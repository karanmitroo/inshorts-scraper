Technology major Google is reportedly planning to add a built-in ad-blocking feature to its Chrome web browser. The blocked ads will include pop-up ads, autoplay videos, and fullscreen ads that show up before users are taken to the homepage or desired website. Interestingly, advertising was Google's greatest source of revenue in 2016 at $79.4 billion.
