Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said India is working on manufacturing next generation routers to secure its telecommunication networks. An agreement with ANURAG (Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group) has been signed for the same, he added. "We cannot have routers...functioning from abroad where there might be bugs to...cause leakage of vital information," he further said.
