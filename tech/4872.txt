Twitter has suspended the accounts of al-Qaeda spiritual leader Abu Qatada and two other al-Qaeda scholars. Their accounts were focussed mostly on the Syrian war and commented on issues like law and religious judgments. Notably, Twitter has deleted over 3.6 lakh accounts since mid-2015 over promotion of terrorism, however, most accounts belong to the Islamic State and not al-Qaeda.
