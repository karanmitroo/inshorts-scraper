French startup Navya Technologies on Tuesday launched its self-driving electric taxi called "Autonom Cab" in Paris. It does not have a cockpit, a steering wheel or pedals and is capable of carrying up to 6 passengers. However, it features sensors, six cameras, and an on-board computer system to control the vehicle without any human intervention.
