Japan, known for being earthquake-prone, on Monday experienced a brief period of panic when earthquake notification app Yurekuru Call sent users a notification of an impending 9.1-magnitude earthquake. This warning sent by the Japan Meteorological Agency was revoked seconds later, when it was found to be an error owing to 'ocean noise'.
