Sports equipment maker Reebok has unveiled its limited edition 'Liquid Speed' shoes which are manufactured by 3D drawing with a liquid to create a better fit. Reebok's Liquid Factory uses a machine to create the frames of the shoes by drawing a synthetic 'high-rebound' liquid on a flat surface. The shoes, priced at $189, have a first-time 'energy return' outsole.
