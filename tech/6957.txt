A 22-year-old student, Jawwad Patel has reportedly developed Asia's first 3D printed water apparatus that produces water from air. Called 'Dewdrop', the portable device uses moisture from the air to produce drinkable water and generates around 1.8 litres of water in an hour.  Patel further claims that the device does not use any toxic gas or chemicals.
