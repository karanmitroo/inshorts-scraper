US-based startup Divergent 3D has unveiled a 3D printed bike at the ongoing Los Angeles Auto Show, which it claims to be 50% lighter than traditional bikes. While the bike's chassis is 3D printed, its motor has been borrowed from a Kawasaki H2 supercharged sportbike. Last year, the startup unveiled a 3D printed supercar called 'Blade'.
