Canadian startup AR Designs has built a wireless charger called 'OvRcharge' that not only charges a smartphone, but also levitates and rotates it mid-air. The charger consists of two parts - a magnetic charging base and a special phone case. It stops charging the phone when the battery is full but keeps levitating it until it is removed.
