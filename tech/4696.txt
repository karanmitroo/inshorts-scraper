The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is planning to launch two mobile apps – 'm-Parivahan' and 'e-challan' – to enhance road safety and facilitate citizen interaction. 'm-Parivahan' is a citizen-centric app that can be used to establish the genuineness of a vehicle and driver. Meanwhile, 'e-challan' is an enforcement app to be used by traffic police and transport authorities.
