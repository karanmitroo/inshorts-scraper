Apple Inc has been ordered to pay $532.9 million after a federal jury in Texas found that its iTunes software infringed three patents owned by Smartflash LLC. Patent licensing firm Smartflash had been asking for $852 million in damages.
The jury determined that Apple had not only used Smartflash's patents without permission, but did so willfully.
