US state Texas Representative Mike Conaway has introduced a bill called Defending US Government Communications Act, aiming to ban government agencies from using Huawei and ZTE phones. According to him, technology coming from Chinese companies poses a threat to national security. Last year, ZTE was fined $1 billion for violating US-Iran sanctions by shipping products to Iran from the US.
