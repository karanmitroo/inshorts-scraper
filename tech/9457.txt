Google Street View on Thursday launched a 360Â° view of Mont Blanc, one of the highest mountain peaks in Europe. Google Street View has collaborated with a team of professional mountaineers to let users experience running up and down the peak, climb ice cliffs and ski.  It also offers panoramic view of the snow-capped surroundings of Mont Blanc.
