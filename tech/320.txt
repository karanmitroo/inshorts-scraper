Apple has said it has seen a "strong demand" for iPhone battery replacements and may offer rebates to users who paid full price for new batteries. The replacement was offered at a discounted price of $29 after Apple admitted to slowing down older iPhones. In a letter to the US lawmakers, Apple added it knew about battery problems since 2016.
