Entertainment firm Walt Disney decided not to pursue a bid for Twitter partly out of concern that bullying and other uncivil forms of communication on the microblogging site might soil the companyâ€™s family image, sources said. Disney reportedly hired investment banks JPMorgan Chase and Guggenheim Partners, to help evaluate the bid. Notably, Salesforce and Google also decided against the bid.
