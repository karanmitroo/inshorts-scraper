The Odisha government on Wednesday decided to spread fibre optics down to the level of gram panchayats. This method of carrying information will connect the “various sectors such as education, agriculture, health” of the state. Further, such IT applications will help improve the service delivery mechanism of Odisha and bring efficiency to poverty alleviation programmes.
