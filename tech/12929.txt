Based on tip-off from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CBI has arrested Amit Tiwari (33), an engineering dropout, for hacking into hundreds of email accounts from across the world. Remarkably, this is the first arrest made by CBI for hacking. Amit ran two websites, hosted in US, that offered hacking email accounts for a fee ranging between $250-$500.
