India’s low-cost Mars Mission satellite, Mangalyaan, will reportedly snap its communication with ISRO in a “blackout” from June 8-22. During this period, the Sun will block Mars from Earth, and Mangalyaan will have to go on an “autonomous mode”. This will be the first time that a break in its communication will last close to 15 days.
