WikiLeaks on Thursday released a new set of data named 'DarkMatter' where it claimed that the US government's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been hacking the iPhone since 2008, a year after it was launched. The CIA created a malware to evade the iPhone's security mechanisms, WikiLeaks said. It further claimed that the CIA has been hacking Macs since 2005.
