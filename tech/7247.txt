Researchers have created a new display technology called 'Cinema 3D' that allows users to view 3D imagery without glasses. The technology uses 50 combinations of lenses and mirrors to deliver a range of 3D angles across the whole theatre, without sacrificing the resolution. The researchers, however, said that the technology isn't quite ready to be applied at local theatres.
