According to company data, the headcount of Samsung Electronics came down in 2016 for the first time in seven years, chiefly due to restructuring in China. A company official attributed the cut partly to the sale of Samsung's printing business to HP. Interestingly, the proportion of female executives rose to 6.3% in 2016 from 4.5% a year ago.
