American startup Fitbit has disputed a woman's claim that her fitness tracker "exploded" on its own while on her wrist. "Testing shows that external forces caused the damage to the device," said Fitbit. The woman claimed she suffered second-degree burns due to the spontaneous combustion and that a doctor had to remove pieces of rubber and plastic from her arm.
