German startup Lofelt has developed a wearable called 'Basslet', which delivers beats and basslines directly to the body by vibrating according to the music the user is hearing. The Basslet works with anything that has sound including a user's smartphone, laptop, gaming console, VR headset and walkman without any app. It lasts up to six hours in a single charge.
