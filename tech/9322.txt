Yahoo has revamped both its website and app to offer users a more personalised experience around finding content like news and videos. Users can now read stories in-line instead of having to open multiple browser tabs and post comments directly below them. Further, Yahoo has replaced the plus sign with the heart icon to find related stories below each article.
