An online petition that has been doing the rounds these days wants Facebook to remove a "feeling fat" status and emoji from status-update options. Endangered Bodies, the group behind the initiative, believe that "feeling fat" option encourages "body-shaming". "When users set their status to 'feeling fat,' they are making fun of people who are overweight," the petition read.
