SoftBank on Thursday said it was partnering with automaker Honda to develop 'talking cars' that can read drivers' emotions with the help of SoftBank's humanoid robotic technology. SoftBank described a future where Honda cars could interact with drivers, helping them park or offering company on long trips. The announcement comes after SoftBank agreed to buy British chip designer ARM Holdings.
