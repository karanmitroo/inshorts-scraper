Google has partnered with Warner Bros ahead of the release of the 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' movie to add Harry Potter-related spells to its voice commands. By activating 'OK Google' on an Android phone, users can say "Lumos" to turn the flashlight on and "Nox" to turn it off. Saying "Silencio" will silence the phone's ringer.
