Vine has rolled out a new feature that allows users to directly integrate music into their videos sans any third-party apps. It has also introduced Snap to Beat, a feature that will let the music loop smoothly and in sync with its video, without sounding abrupt. Vine is a video-sharing service from Twitter where users share six-second-long looping video clips.
