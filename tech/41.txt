Facebook is expanding its Jobs feature to search and apply for jobs directly on its platform to more than 40 countries including India. Job seekers can visit 'www.facebook.jobs' and apply to listed companies, where the application would auto-fill with work history and relevant information from the user's Facebook profile. A messenger window would open to contact the employer after completion.
