Twitter took a significant step Thursday towards broadening its advertising business by offering mobile ads urging people to install apps on its social network as well as through MoPub, the mobile-advertising network it acquired last year. Twitter said it could reach 1 billion unique mobile devices through its MoPub network and 240 million users through its own app and site.
