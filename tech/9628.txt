LG Display has developed a prototype 18-inch foldable OLED display screen that can be rolled up like a newspaper. The company reportedly aims at creating bendable, rollable, and curving displays that can be rolled up into pockets and wrapped around surfaces. LG will unveil the prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show 2016 being held in Las Vegas.
