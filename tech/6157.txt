Germany has banned WhatsApp from sharing data with owner Facebook, while Facebook has been ordered to delete all the data that has already been shared. German watchdog has said that the data-sharing deal wasn't done with the agreement of the users of the companies. WhatsApp started sharing user data with Facebook last month to help it with advertising.
