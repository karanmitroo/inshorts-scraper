After Apple's iPhone 6 reported record sales, Samsung, Wednesday, launched its Galaxy Note-4, earlier than expected. The phone, initially scheduled for launch in October, would hit stores in South Korea and China this week and 140 more nations by the end of this month. The 5.7-inch phone comes with S-pen stylus allowing users to draw and write on the screen.
