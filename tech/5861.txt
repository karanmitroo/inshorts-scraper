Los Angeles-based firm Wavhello, which makes technology products for families, has launched a $60 Bluetooth speaker for babies. Called SoundBub, the toy animal-shaped speaker also includes a white noise maker to lull babies to sleep. It is made of chew-safe material, and comes with preloaded sounds, as well as the option to play recorded music remotely from parents' phones.
