A new font 'LiveScience' has been developed by a German artist which is based upon Albert Einstein's handwriting and will let people write like the famous physicist. This project was a collaboration between Harald Geisler, typography expert and Liz Waterhouse, a former dancer. The project was launched to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Einstein's general theory of relativity this year.
