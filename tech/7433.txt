Popular video game and anime series Pokemon was inspired from creator Satoshi Tajiri’s  boyhood hobby of bug and insect collection. The creator’s fascination for insects led his classmates to call him ‘Mr. Bug’. Notably, Pokemon also involves human trainers catching and training fictional creatures, many of which resemble real life animals.
