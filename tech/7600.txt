Google has bought the entire energy output of two new yet-to-be-built wind farms in Norway and Sweden, which equates to 236 MW of power, to supply its European data centers. The Norwegian 50-turbine farm will be built in 2017, while the 22-turbine farm in Sweden will be completed in 2018. With this, Google has purchased almost 2.5 GW energy worldwide.
