The British parliament today released a briefing saying that banning encryption and online anonymity is neither acceptable nor technically feasible, with a special reference to the Tor anonymity network. British Prime Minister David Cameron had earlier said he wants to ban encryption and online anonymity networks like Tor, which has about 100,000 users at any given moment in the UK.
