In a huge set back to China's ambitious space programme, its lunar rover Yutu or the Jade Rabbit was declared dead after attempts to revive it failed, media reports said on Thursday. Last month Yutu had experienced a mechanical control abnormality due to "complicated lunar surface environment". However, the rover had completed most of its tasks before breaking down.
