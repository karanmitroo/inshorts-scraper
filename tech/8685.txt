Researchers at the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory in US have developed a drone named 'Cracuns', which can launch itself from underwater for aerial missions. The drone, with four rotor blades, can withstand both underwater pressure and corrosive effects of salt water. It can also remain submerged at a depth of several hundred feet of water for at least two months.
