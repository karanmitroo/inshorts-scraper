A street artist in Los Angeles has put up anti-Google posters in the city in response to the technology giant firing an engineer who penned an anti-diversity memo. One ad replaces Google's logo on its homepage with 'Goolag' in reference to forced-labour camps from the Soviet Union. Further, the 'I'm feeling lucky' button has been replaced by 'I'm feeling f*cked'.
