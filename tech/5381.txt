Film company IMAX has announced a partnership with Acer and Creative Artists Agency to fund "at least 25" interactive Virtual Reality (VR) experiences with a $50 million fund. The money will be used for partnerships with video game publishers and 360-degree filmmakers. VR content will eventually come from filmmakers using a camera that IMAX is developing with Google.
