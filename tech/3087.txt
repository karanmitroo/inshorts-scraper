Japanese researchers have made robotic limbs that can be strapped to a user's back for an extra pair of arms. The wrist and elbow joints of the arms called 'MetaLimbs' can be controlled via tracking sensors on the wearer's feet and knees. Researchers said the arms could hold drinks or shake hands when the user's own arms are occupied.
