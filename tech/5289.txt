Technology giant Apple on Thursday acknowledged the touchscreen defect reported on its iPhone 6 Plus smartphones which caused the screens to malfunction and become unresponsive. The cost of repairing the screen has been reduced from $300 (₹20,500) to $149 (₹10,150). However, the company pinned the blame for the defect on the device being "dropped multiple times on a hard surface".
