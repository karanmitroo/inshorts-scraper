After some users refused to return their recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones over battery overheating issues, Samsung has set the device's charging limit to 80%. Samsung had earlier set the charging limit at 60% through an update to avoid potential issues. The update has been rolled out only in Samsung's home market Korea.
