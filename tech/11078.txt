The Android version of Facebook's Messenger app has crossed 1 billion downloads on Google Play Store, the company has announced. The high download count is a result of Facebook's decision to make the Messenger a standalone app, two years ago. Prior to this, only Facebook, WhatsApp and a few Google apps had reached this count.
