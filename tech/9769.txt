Social networking site Twitter on Tuesday reportedly applied for a patent for a special kind of tweet-controlled drone, with an ability to click pictures and record videos, which can be communicated through users' twitter accounts. Capable of telepresence and video conferencing, the unmanned aerial vehicle's actions can be controlled through likes, replies and retweets.
