Search giant Google has called The New York Times (NYT) report which claimed that female employees at Google are paid less than men as 'extremely flawed'. The report was based on a salary spreadsheet started by a former employee to negotiate better salaries. The report features only 1,200 employees, and doesn't include location, role, tenure or performance, Google said.
