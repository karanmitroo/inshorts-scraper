Facebook on Monday added a 'donate' button for making contributions to the earthquake-hit victims in Nepal. Visible right on top of the home page, the donate button lets users choose from options to donate Rs 500, Rs 1000, Rs 2500 and Rs 5000. Facebook said it will match users' donations (upto $2 million) to the Nepal earthquake relief work.
