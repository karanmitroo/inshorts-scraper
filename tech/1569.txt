Siri mistakenly told an Apple user the national anthem of Bulgaria was Despacito, instead of the correct answer Mila Rodino or 'Dear Motherland'. The user said Siri pulled up the Wikipedia page of Despacito, sung by Puerto Rican artists Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Notably, Mila Rodino was adopted as the Bulgarian national anthem in 1964.
