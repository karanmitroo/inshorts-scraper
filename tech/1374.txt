Life insurance provider John Hancock will offer Apple Watch 3 for $25 to customers if they meet "wellness targets", cutting the cost of the smartwatch by nearly $300. Hancock will let users make payments based on the number of workouts completed. If members meet targets regularly for two years, they'll be allowed to keep the device for no additional cost.
