Harvard researchers have developed an artificial eye which combines a metalens with an electronically controlled muscle. Apart from focussing images in real time like the human eye, the metalens can overcome aberrations like astigmatism and image shift, which the human eye cannot naturally do. It could enable embedded optical zoom and autofocus for cell phones and eyeglasses, said researchers.
