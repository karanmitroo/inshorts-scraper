The world’s first webcam, made in 1991, recorded a coffee pot kept in a computer lab in the University of Cambridge. The camera, that grabbed three grayscale images every minute, helped the scientists keep an eye on the coffee levels from their desks. The images were broadcasted live from 1993 to 2001 after which the pot was auctioned for £3,350.
