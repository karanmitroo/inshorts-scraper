Russian graphic designer Misha Petrick has showcased what Instagram would look like on a device running the Windows 95 operating system. In the preview, Instagram was rendered in 8-bit graphics along with pixelated MS Sans Serif font and Microsoft's familiar teal blue background. The preview illustrated three different aspects of Instagram â€“ scrolling, notifications and adding filters to photos.
