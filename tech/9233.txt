Facebook has reportedly blocked pages selling medical marijuana in New Jersey, US, even though medical marijuana is legal in the state. This has been done because the pages do “not follow the Facebook community terms and standards”. Notably, the social networking website's community standard guidelines are against drug sales, but do not mention anything with regard to authorised drug vendors.
