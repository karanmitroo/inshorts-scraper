Technology giant Apple on Thursday launched the new generation of its MacBook Pro laptops with Touch Bar replacing the function keys on keyboard. It allows photo and video editing, suggests text and emojis while typing, and lines up apps selected by the users for quick access. On opening the Safari browser, the Touch Bar shows the users their favourite websites.
