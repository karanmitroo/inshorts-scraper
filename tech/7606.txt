A Russian artist has created a laser-powered drum machine installation called 'Divider' which uses seven lasers to send light through high-speed fans, generating sound. The system, which was inspired from the world's first electronic drum named 'Rhythmicon', works by turning picked-up beams into rhythmic impulses. The fans can each spin at variable speeds to create a range of different sounds.
