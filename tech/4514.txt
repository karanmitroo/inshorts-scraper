Microblogging site Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey on Sunday apologised for a technical glitch that made at least five lakh users automatically follow US President Donald Trump's newly-acquired POTUS handle. The glitch also affected official administration accounts like the US Vice President, The White House and the Press Secretary's account. Dorsey confirmed all affected accounts have been corrected.
