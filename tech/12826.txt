Facebook Thursday announced the acquisition of WhatsApp for $19 billion - $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares and $3 billion in “vesting restricted stock” (which will be given over in next four years). “WhatsApp will remain as an independent brand,” CEO Jan Koum said. Notably, this is Facebook's largest deal and bigger than any that Google, Microsoft or Apple have ever done.
