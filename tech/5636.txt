Delhi Police has informed the Delhi High Court that a 'panic button' will be introduced in every mobile phone starting January 1, to help people in distress. The panic button will be mapped to the emergency number '100'. Further, the authorities are planning to launch a single emergency number '112' to do away with all existing emergency numbers including 100.
