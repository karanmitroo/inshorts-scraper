Researchers from the University of Warwick, UK, have discovered that HD 189733b, an exoplanet about 63 light years away from Earth, has wind speeds of 8,690 kmph. This is 20 times greater than the fastest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. Further, this is the first time the weather of a body outside Earthâ€™s solar system has been definitively mapped.
