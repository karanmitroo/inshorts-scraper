London-based mental health charity Stem4 has developed an app called Calm Harm which helps users resist the urge to harm themselves. It offers solutions in the form of distraction techniques. For instance, the 'Breathe' category instructs users to inhale and exhale for a minute and 'Distract' category offers challenges like counting backwards or thinking up names starting with different alphabets.
