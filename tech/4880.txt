Google avoided $3.6 billion in worldwide taxes in 2015 by moving $15.5 billion to a Bermuda shell company, where no corporate income tax is collected. The total profit that Google sheltered from US taxation, grew to $58.3 billion in 2015. On Tuesday, Indonesia set December 31 deadline for Google to resolve another tax dispute including a possible $223 million fine.
