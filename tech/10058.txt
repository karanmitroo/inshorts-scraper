WhatsApp has updated its app for iOS to incorporate Apple's Peek and Pop 3D Touch feature on iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. While Peek enables users to preview the content of a conversation without having to open it, Pop allows users to quickly navigate to the concerned conversation thread. The updated version also supports rich preview for shared links.
