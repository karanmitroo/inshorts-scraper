Japanese gaming company Nintendo has been ordered to pay $10 million by a US jury over a patent infringement lawsuit. The lawsuit which was filed in 2013, alleged that Nintendo used iLife's motion-sensing technology in creating its Wii Remote. However, Nintendo said it did not infringe on the patent as it was improperly written, making it invalid.
