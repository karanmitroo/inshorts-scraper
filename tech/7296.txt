An online shop listed on e-commerce website Etsy is selling hand-made Pokéball-themed USB power banks for $40. The red and white charger encloses a 5,300 mAh battery and comes with clasps to attach it to belt loops and backpacks. The San Francisco-based shop owner says the idea came to her when her phone's battery kept draining while playing Pokémon Go.
