An investigation conducted by news organisation ProPublica has revealed that Facebook's self-service ad-buying system allowed advertisers to target users interested in the topics "Jew hater" and "How to burn Jews". As part of the investigation, the agency paid $30 to target those groups with three "promoted posts", which the social media platform approved within 15 minutes.
