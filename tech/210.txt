Google has removed the 'View Image' option from image search results which allowed users to open the image without visiting the site that hosts it. The change is part of a deal announced last week to show copyright information and improve attribution of Getty Images. Additionally, Google also removed the 'Search by Image' button that appeared after opening a photo.
