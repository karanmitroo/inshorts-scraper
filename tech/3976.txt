A US court on Wednesday reversed a patent ruling that required technology major Apple to pay $533 million (over â‚¹3,500 crore) in damages to technology developing firm Smartflash. The court overturned a verdict that had adjudged Apple to have violated Smartflash's intellectual property related to payment and storage systems for use in its iTunes software.
