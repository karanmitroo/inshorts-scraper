Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram on Wednesday debuted its new colourful rainbow-themed logos for its main and other in-house apps including Hyperlapse, Boomerang and Layout. The app has also changed its appearance to a white top bar and black icons in place of blue. Notably, this is the first logo redesign since Instagram first emerged five years ago.
