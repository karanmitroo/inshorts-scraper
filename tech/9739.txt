A source-code repository management startup GitLab on Tuesday rolled out an update that includes Auto-merge and GitLab Pages features. The new Auto-merge feature will enable the users to schedule a merge activity upon completion of running builds. While, the GitLab Pages would help in documenting certain processes and improving user experience by hosting a static website on a GitLab instance.
