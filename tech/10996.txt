The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) plans to launch a Saarc satellite from Sriharikota (Andhra Pradesh) next year. The satellite is expected to help in telemedicine, tele-education, village resource centre, crop productivity and disaster management. The idea of the satellite, which would serve the Saarc member nations, was proposed by PM Narendra Modi during his Nepal visit last year.
