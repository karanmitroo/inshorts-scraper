Google has rebranded its casting app 'Google Cast' with a new name, 'Google Home', and a new logo. This is reportedly due to the need for a unified app to manage Google's ecosystem of connected products. The app, first called 'Chromecast', is used to discover content to stream on TVs and speakers connected to its 'Chromecast' media streaming device.
