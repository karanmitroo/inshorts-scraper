Researchers from HSG-IMIT, a research centre in Germany, have developed new 'smart' shoes that harvest power from walking. The shoes have a "shock harvester" that generates power when the heel strikes the ground and a "swing harvester" that produces power when the foot is swinging. The technology could be used to power wearable electronic sensors without the need for batteries.
