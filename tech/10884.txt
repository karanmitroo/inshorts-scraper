The popular instant messaging application WhatsApp may face a ban in the United Kingdom under strict new laws on social media and online messaging services. British PM David Cameron is planning to table a new legislation "Snooperâ€™s Charter" which will restrict people from sending any form of encrypted messages. Notably, WhatsApp, iMessage and Snapchat encrypt the communication between users.
