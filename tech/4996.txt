European technology company +T has created a pair of heated shoe insoles that can be charged wirelessly. The Bluetooth-connected insoles can be paired with an app to set a desired temperature and monitor battery life that lasts for up to five hours. The water-resistant insoles have a built-in accelerometer that automatically turns the insoles on when the user starts walking.
