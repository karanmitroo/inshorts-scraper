Moscow will replace Microsoft software with domestic offerings following President Vladimir Putin's call for Russian authorities to reduce reliance on foreign technology from US and Europe. The city will initially drop MS Outlook on 6,000 computers and instead use an email system by a state-run carrier. Moscow may also consider replacing Windows and Office, said Moscow's Head of IT.
