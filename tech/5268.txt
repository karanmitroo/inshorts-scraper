Google parent Alphabet's smart contact lens, an autofocusing lens addressing to farsightedness, would not be ready for testing in 2016. However, pharma company Novartis, which is partnering with Alphabet for making the lenses, said the product is progressing steadily. Novartis and Alphabet (then Google) started working on the lenses in 2014, expecting to launch it in five years.
