A man has claimed that he received an empty packaging for earbuds inside the Pixel 2 box he purchased. The man also posted a picture which shows a booklet, instructing how users can adjust the earbuds, accompanying the empty packaging. Google doesn't offer earbuds with the phone itself and reportedly planned to offer the Pixel 2 with a headset.
