Apple may stop iPhone X production by mid-2018 due to disappointing sales, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He stated disinterest in China as the main reason for the weaker demand. If Apple stops the phone's production, it would be the first time the firm would cancel an iPhone model after one generation since the iPhone 5C in 2014.
