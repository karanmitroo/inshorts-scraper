Twitter has launched Video App Card globally, a feature that lets app advertisers market their campaigns through videos. These videos will auto-play within a user’s timeline and also provide him with an option to install the respective application. According to Twitter, the platform has “helped some advertisers nearly triple their conversion rate from app click to install.”
