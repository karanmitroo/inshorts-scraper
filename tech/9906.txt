Hacktivist collective Anonymous has declared December 11 as ‘Official ISIS Trolling Day’ and asked everyone to participate by trolling the organization and posting mocking images on the social media with hashtags #Daesh and #Daeshbags. The group said, “Do not think you have to be a part of Anonymous, anyone can do this and does not require any special skills”.
