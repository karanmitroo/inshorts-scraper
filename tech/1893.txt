Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma on Wednesday said, "This is not the regulator versus Apple, but Apple versus its own users." This comes after Apple refused to include TRAI's anti-spam app on its App Store despite repeated requests. According to the tech giant, the app which requires access to user data violates its privacy policy.
