Technology major Apple has filed a patent for a vaporiser-like device that can regulate temperature to release heat from a substance within a canister. The patent focuses on maximising rate of vaporisation so that more of the substance is converted to vapor and less is lost to cooling. Possible applications for the patent include an e-cigarette or a perfume dispenser.
