A Twitter employee on Thursday deactivated US President Donald Trump's personal account, before it was brought back online 11 minutes later, the social media company said. Twitter later clarified in a series of tweets that the account was deactivated by an employee on his last day of job. It added it was taking steps to "prevent this from happening again".
