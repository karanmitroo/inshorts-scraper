Having travelled for more than 10 months and 711 million kilometers, Nasa's Maven spacecraft began orbiting Mars on Sunday. "Based on observed navigation data, congratulations. Maven is now in orbit," said Dave Folta of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center. The data from the unmanned orbiter will help scientists understand what happened to the water on Mars billions of years ago.
