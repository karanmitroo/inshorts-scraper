German advertising company RoadAds and Slovenian startup Visionect have created a 32-inch E-ink display for the trucks to show traffic jams ahead in real-time. The display can also be used to show location-based advertisements and information like the distance to the next gas station. The GPS, 4G and Wi-Fi-enabled display can also be used to track a truck's location.
