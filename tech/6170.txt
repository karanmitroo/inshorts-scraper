News organisations covering the US Presidential Debate on Monday were required to pay $200 for a "secure wireless internet connection" at Hofstra University in New York. The venue also charged journalists $75 for a seat in the media filing room without internet access. Further, technicians at the venue reportedly used an 'Aircheck WiFi Tester' to detect and shut private hotspots.
