The Ministry of Earth Sciences said on Wednesday that 26 countries are working under Indiaâ€™s leadership to develop an early warning system to predict earthquakes before they occur. To gauge this, bore wells filled with sensors will be put in seismically active regions and satellites will be made to send images of surface displacement up to the accuracy of centimetres.
