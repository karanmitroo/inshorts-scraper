Technological product 'Redux' acts as a vacuum chamber to dry and revive the phones which were dropped in water. The device takes about half an hour to vaporise the moisture content in the phone and will revive the gadget from "even the most severe water damage". The machine can also be used for Apple watches, and other electronic wearables.
