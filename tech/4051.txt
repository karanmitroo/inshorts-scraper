The Global Positioning System (GPS)  is a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the Earth, with at least four GPS satellites being 'visible' at all times from all locations. Each satellite transmits information about its position and the current time at regular intervals. These signals are intercepted by GPS receivers, which calculate the exact location, using a process called trilateration.
