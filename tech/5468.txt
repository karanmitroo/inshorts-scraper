Samsung, which killed its latest flagship smartphone Galaxy Note 7 over exploding batteries, will be launching a voice-based assistant with its upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone. While Apple and Microsoft's voice assistants are called Siri and Cortana respectively, Samsung's assistant will reportedly be called 'Bixby'. Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to go on sale early next year.
