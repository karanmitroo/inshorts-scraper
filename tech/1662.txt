Scientists from the University of Luxembourg have developed an artificial intelligence software which claims to detect electricity theft and meter misreadings. They collected the data of energy use of 3.6 million Brazilian households over five years and developed an algorithm to detect faulty metering. According to their inference, the software was able to identify the faults 65% of the time.
