OnePlus will have no new launches under its affordable OnePlus X series, the company's Co-founder and CEO Pete Lau said on Tuesday. Lau added that OnePlus will instead focus on just one true flagship line from now on in order to strengthen its foundation. On opening OnePlus physical stores, Lau said, "This will all make sense in 20 years' time."
