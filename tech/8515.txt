Search giant Google has released a new feature that can teach animal sounds. Users can search for "animal noises" on Google and a field appears which shows illustrations of animals, their names and a sample of their sounds. It has included 19 animal sounds in its list, including ape, cat, lion, owl, pig, cow, horse and tiger among others.
