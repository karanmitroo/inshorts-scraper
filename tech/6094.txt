Facebook on Monday started rolling out a less data consuming Android version of its Messenger app called 'Messenger Lite'. The app allows users to send text messages, photos and links, but doesn't support video or voice calls, or making payments. Currently launched in Kenya, Tunisia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela, it will launch in more countries in the coming months.
