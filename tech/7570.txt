Music streaming service Spotify has complained to Apple after it rejected an update of its app. Spotify General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez said, "It continues a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music". Apple has reportedly turned down the update under "business model rules".
