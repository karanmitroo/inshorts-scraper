Research printed in the journal Nature Cell Biology has claimed that scientists in Florida reversed cancer cells into benign cells. The scientists found that biological microprocessors called microRNAs prevents cells from dividing when they have reproduced adequately. However in cancer, cells don't stop dividing, leading to tumour growth. Restoring microRNAs levels reportedly turns the cells into a benign state.
