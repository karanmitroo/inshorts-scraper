Two US-based researchers have developed 'VibraPhone', a device that can turn the vibration motor in smartphones and fitness trackers into a microphone. The motor has a magnetic surface whose position is controlled by an applied voltage, producing the vibration effect. VibraPhone showed that the magnetic surface's motion can be similarly controlled through the sound wave vibrations in the air.
