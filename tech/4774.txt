Elon Musk-led space exploration startup SpaceX on Monday said that its Falcon 9 rocket exploded during the launch in September 2016 due to a buildup of oxygen in the aluminum liner. The explosion destroyed Facebook's satellite being carried by the rocket. SpaceX said that it will implement design changes to prevent any anomaly in the future.
