Samsung Electronics has announced that it will recover 1.5 lakh kg of rare metal including gold from Galaxy Note 7 smartphones that it recalled last year. The global recall was prompted by a battery defect that caused the phones to explode. Samsung said it will also recycle or repair OLED display modules, memory chips, and camera modules from the smartphones.
