Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology (US) have developed a new security system that continuously monitors how a user taps and swipes a mobile device, providing a personal touch signature for gadget's security. If the movements do not match the owner's tendencies, the system recognises the differences and locks the device. The system was nearly 98% accurate on a smartphone.
