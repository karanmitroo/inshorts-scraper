Softbank's humanoid robot 'Pepper' recently learned to play ball-in-a-cup game using the trial-and-error method, taking 100 attempts. Initially, the robot's arm was manually guided. Each failed attempt enabled it to analyse past performance and slightly alter the next try's movement, to understand optimal trajectory like a human learning. After 100 tries, the robot maintained a 100% success rate.
