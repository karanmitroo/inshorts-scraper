Apple has responded to a report by the Shanghai Consumer Council detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets in China. Apple claimed the explosions were caused by external physical damage to the phones. Previously, Apple blamed an iPhone 6s bug that caused devices to shut down unexpectedly on the battery's prolonged exposure to air prior to assembly.
