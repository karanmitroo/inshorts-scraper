Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company Tesla, which recently acquired solar panel-making company SolarCity, has revealed that it runs the entire island of Ta'u in American Samoa on solar power. The island is equipped with 5,328 solar panels and 60 Tesla Powerpacks that store the solar energy. It took Tesla one year to make the island run entirely on solar energy.
