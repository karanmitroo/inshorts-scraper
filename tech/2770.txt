An outbreak of malicious data-scrambling 'Petya' ransomware, similar to WannaCry, caused mass disruption across Europe on Tuesday, hitting Ukraine especially hard. Ukrainian PM Volodymyr Groysman called the attack "unprecedented" after several companies and the country's main airport were hit by hackers. Many companies in the UK, Germany, and Netherlands reported that they were also targetted.
