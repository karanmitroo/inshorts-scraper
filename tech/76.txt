MIT researchers have developed an AutoSaw system that allows users to craft furniture like chairs, desks, and tables with robotic assistance. Users can customise furniture templates like size and sturdiness in a simple CAD system after which modified robots cut the individual parts. After the cutting, users can assemble the furniture pieces using step-by-step directions from the system.
