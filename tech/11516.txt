E-retail giant Snapdeal announced its acquisition of online recharge service Freecharge on Wednesday for an undisclosed amount, in what could be the biggest acquisition in the Indian startup ecosystem. Sources estimate the deal to be worth $400 million in cash and stocks, eclipsing Flipkart's acquisition of rival Myntra last year for $300 million.
