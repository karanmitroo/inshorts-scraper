The web version of Skype today allowed direct calling to mobile phones and landlines from its platform through subscription or Skype Credits. The Microsoft-owned service has also allowed users to watch YouTube videos within a conversation without opening a new tab. Skype further launched desktop notifications and an option to add non-Skype users to a conversation.
