The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Tuesday ruled that employees must be warned by companies before monitoring their office emails. The judgement was in favour of the Romanian employee Bogdan BÄƒrbulescu who was fired in 2007 for using the company server to send private messages. The Court ruled that his right to privacy had not been "adequately protected".
