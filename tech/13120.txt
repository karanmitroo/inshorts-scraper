In its first ever move, Facebook has decided to change the look of its 'Like' and 'Share' button. The new buttons have a brighter blue shade with white 'Like' and 'Share' texts in a new font and Facebook 'F' logo instead of thumbs-up symbol. They will be automatically rolled out to all the 7.5 million websites in the upcoming weeks.
