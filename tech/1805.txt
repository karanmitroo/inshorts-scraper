US-based online education startup Coursera's Co-founder Andrew Ng has said that artificial intelligence (AI) as a basic technology shouldn't be regulated. Ng said the discussion about AI stems from "irrational fears about... 'evil killer robots,' rather than a deeper understanding of what it can and cannot do." He added that some applications of AI like autonomous driving do need regulation.
