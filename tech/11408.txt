Researchers working for Audi in Germany claim to have extracted diesel using just air and water. Cleantech firm Sunfire masterminded the process by mixing oxygen and pure hydrogen from water molecules and carbon dioxide from biogas under high temperature and pressure. A production plant in Dresden is set to produce 160 litres/day of the fuel over the coming months.
