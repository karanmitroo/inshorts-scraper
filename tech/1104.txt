South Korea's Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favour of a Samsung worker Lee Yoon-Jung who died of a brain tumour caused by alleged exposure to toxic chemicals. The court said that her family should be eligible for state compensation for occupational disease. Earlier, an appeals court had denied Lee's compensation plea citing a government investigation.
