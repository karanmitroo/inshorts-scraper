NASA will send a 3D printer, called Additive Manufacturing Facility, to the International Space Station on March 22. Developed by 3D-printing company ‘Made in Space’, the printer is designed to operate in microgravity and is the first commercial manufacturing device being sent to space. Customers can pay the company to use the printer, which can be remotely controlled from Earth.
