Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Wednesday that all vehicles currently in production by the electric carmaker will have a fully self-driving hardware. The hardware, being installed on Tesla's Model S, X and forthcoming Model 3 sedans, will make the cars "substantially safer than a human driver". The cars will have 8 cameras with 360-degree viewing and 12 ultrasonic sensors.
