According to a new study published in the journal Science Advances, exposure to deep-space radiations could damage the brains of the astronauts. The researchers of the University of California, Irvine and the University of Nevada observed central nervous system damage and cognitive impairments in lab animals that were exposed to highly energetic charged particles, similar to the cosmic rays.
