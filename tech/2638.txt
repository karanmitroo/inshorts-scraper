Billionaire Elon Musk-led Tesla, on Thursday, announced that it is building the worldâ€™s largest lithium-ion battery system to store renewable energy in South Australia. The 129 MWh Powerpack system will provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes upon completion in December 2017. The battery itself will be charged by a wind farm and then deliver electricity during peak hours.
