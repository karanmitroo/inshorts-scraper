Social media giant Facebook has started allowing its users in the US to order food, book appointments and buy movie or event tickets through Facebook Pages. A new 'Recommendations' feature on Facebook will allow friends to suggest places to eat or visit in a city. If the features perform well in the US, Facebook may extend it to other countries.
