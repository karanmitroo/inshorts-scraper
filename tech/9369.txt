The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has blocked blogging platform Medium after the latter refused to remove a post that refers to the alleged corruption involving Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak.  Earlier, he was facing over 30 charges regarding a $681-million transfer into his bank account. Medium said it will “stand by investigative journalists who publish” on the site.
