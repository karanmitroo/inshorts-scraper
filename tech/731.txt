Israeli food-tech startup SuperMeat, which is developing lab-made chicken meat, has raised $3 million in seed funding. The startup is backed by US-based venture capital fund New Crop Capital, and Stray Dog Capital. SuperMeat is working on the meat-making process which involves extracting cells from a chicken and feeding them correct nutrients to produce muscle and fat.
