The Kannada Development Authority (KDA) has written to Apple CEO Tim Cook, asking for a redesign of the Kannada font used in Apple products by employing locally-developed Kannada fonts and keyboards. The authority also asked for Apple's voice assistant Siri to be made available in Kannada. Recently, the KDA directed bank employees to either learn Kannada or quit their jobs.
