California-based sports wearables startup Zepp has announced a sensor that lets footballers track their performance on the pitch. It wirelessly pairs with a smartphone, fits inside a leg sleeve and tracks statistics such as distance covered, number of ball kicks, and running, sprinting or walking time in a game. The sensor and leg sleeve package has been priced at $100.
