Ford Motors on Thursday announced that the company's electric car patents will become open-source to competitors, in an effort to bolster the electric car market. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, made a similar move nearly a year ago. However, Ford is licensing its patents for a fee, whereas Tesla made its patents available to anyone for free.
