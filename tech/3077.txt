Russian internet giant Yandex on Tuesday showed its self-driving car for the first time. The car is a modified Toyota Prius V, which is fitted with multiple sensors, artificial intelligence and computing algorithms that help it navigate itself through traffic and obstacles on the road. Yandex may begin public tests of the car in 2018.
