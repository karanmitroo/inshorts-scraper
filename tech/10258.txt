Facebook’s Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos, has announced that the social network will notify users in case their accounts are “targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working on behalf of a nation-state”. Stamos added that the warning would be issued only if Facebook has strong evidence for its claim.
