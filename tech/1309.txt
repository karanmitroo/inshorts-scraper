Reacting to WhatsApp's message recall feature that allows deleting sent messages, a user tweeted, "We have to improve our Screenshot game". While a different user tweeted, "WhatsApp took "dekh ker delete ker dena" damn serious, so don't update WhatsApp", another tweeted, "Can now delete those messages that were never supposed to be sent in the first place".
