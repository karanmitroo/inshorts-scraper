SpaceX Founder Elon Musk on Tuesday revealed plans to set up a colony on Mars, by sending humans to Mars for $200,000 in 80 days within the next decade. “One path is we stay on Earth forever, and there will be some eventual extinction event... the alternative is to become a space-faring civilization and a multiplanet species,” Musk added.
