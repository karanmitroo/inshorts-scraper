Technology giant Apple's Co-founder Steve Wozniak has said he still earns $100 a week from the company as "token money". He added that it keeps him "loyal" to Apple even though he has played no active role in the company for decades. Notably, Wozniak left Apple on February 6, 1985, selling most of his stock.
