Twitter announced on Friday that over 125,000 accounts were suspended "for threatening or promoting terrorist acts, primarily related to ISIS". However, the number of people linked to these accounts reportedly remains unclear as most Islamic State sympathisers manage multiple accounts. Twitter has also built up a team to review reports of terrorist threats and promotion to block extremist content.
