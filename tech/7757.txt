Researchers at the Kaspersky Lab on Wednesday said that a website named 'xDedic' is selling over 70,000 compromised servers to launch cyberattacks worldwide starting from $6 per server. It offers access to hacked computers owned by governments, companies and universities in 173 countries. Each server allows the owners to launch cyberattacks, spam campaigns and compromise online payment systems.
