A freelance illustrator from London has shared photos of paintings and sculptures from a Dutch museum that he edited using a selfie app called FaceApp to have 'smiling' faces. The app uses artificial intelligence to map facial features and make edits. The Twitter handle of the museum responded to the edits with, "So funny to see our familiar faces smiling!"
