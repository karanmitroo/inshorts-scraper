George Hotz, the hacker known for unlocking the first iPhone, has cancelled the kit developed by his startup Comma.ai, which could be fitted into cars to turn them self-driving. A US regulatory agency had asked Comma.ai for information regarding safety following which Hotz tweeted, "Would much rather spend my life building amazing tech than dealing with regulators...It isn't worth it."
