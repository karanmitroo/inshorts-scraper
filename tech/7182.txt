Microsoft on Wednesday released a new replacement camera application, called Pix, for iPhones and iPads. Upon detecting a face, the app automatically adjusts settings and after-shot enhancements. It also allows comparing the before and after images. The app can sense motions in the shot and automatically create a live Image, and can even help stabilize and time lapse existing videos.
