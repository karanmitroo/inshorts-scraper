Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company's board member Peter Thiel's support of Donald Trump in a message to employees. Thiel recently pledged a donation of $1.25 million to Trump's campaign. "We can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate," Zuckerberg wrote.
