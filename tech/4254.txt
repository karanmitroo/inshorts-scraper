Users of Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have complained that the paint on their phones has started peeling despite using protective cases. The paint is reportedly chipping around the corners, speakers, and physical buttons of the devices. Users say they have resorted to using acrylic paint on their phones as Apple does not offer 'cosmetic damage' warranty.
