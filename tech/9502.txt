Russian search engine Yandex has added the fictional language of Elvish (or Sindarin) in its built-in online translator. The language is spoken by elves in the fantasy novel ‘The Lord of the Rings’, written by author JRR Tolkien. The company said that its team "studied Elvish manuscripts" to enable users to translate to and from Sindarin.
