An ad agency has been booked for allegedly poisoning the roots of 17 trees with acid and cutting 13 others to improve the visibility of an illegal iPhone hoarding in Bengaluru. The agency, Nile Enterprises, reportedly also cut down trees to clear the view of a billboard for a jewellery brand. The illegally erected billboards have now been taken down.
