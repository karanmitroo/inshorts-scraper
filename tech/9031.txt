HTC has launched the Desire 530, 630 and 825 smartphones. All the phones sport Super LCD displays, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, expandable storage and 4G connectivity. Inspired by urban street wear fashion, the design-heavy phones feature over 25,000 themes that change colour schemes and backgrounds based on usersâ€™ favourite photos. These will start selling in key markets in March.
