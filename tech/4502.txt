BBC has blamed a hoax tweet from its Northampton Twitter handle on hackers after the account tweeted, "Breaking News: President Trump is injured in arm by gunfire #Inauguration." After the tweet was deleted, hacker group OurMine accessed BBC's account and tweeted, "Message from OurMine: we detected unusual activity on this account... we are trying to fix the issue now."
