Telecom PSUs, BSNL and MTNL are likely to merge by July next year, as the two companies plan at synergising operations by offering services as single entity. However, the deadline of June-July 2015 has not been officially commissioned. At present, BSNL offers services in the whole country except Delhi and Mumbai, where MTNL provides telecom services.
