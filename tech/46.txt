Billionaire Elon Musk has responded to Harvard Professor Steven Pinker, who said building self-driving Tesla cars was "idiotic" as Musk feared artificial intelligence. The Tesla co-founder said that if Pinker doesn't have a grasp of AI, then "humanity is in deep trouble". Musk argued there was a massive difference between AI used for a car and a more generalised AI.
