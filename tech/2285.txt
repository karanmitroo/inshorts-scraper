England-based researchers are using Google's satellite images to locate potential sites of modern day slavery in India. The project called 'Slavery from Space' locates sites like brick kilns and is focusing on an area of 2,600 square km in the state of Rajasthan. The group reportedly intends to use the data to help on-ground NGOs locate sites of forced labour.
