Facebook-owned VR startup Oculus Co-founder Palmer Luckey has left the company. Last year, Luckey apologised for donating $10,000 to a group spreading anti-Hillary Clinton memes ahead of the US presidential election. Luckey was also involved in a lawsuit against Facebook by Zenimax which accused Oculus of twisting its origin story by giving Luckey complete credit for inventing the technology.
