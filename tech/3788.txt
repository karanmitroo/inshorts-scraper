Pakistan has asked Facebook and Twitter to help identify Pakistanis suspected of blasphemy so it can prosecute them or pursue their extradition. This follows Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's orders to approach international social media platforms to put the blasphemous content off the internet. According to Pakistan's blasphemy laws, anyone found insulting Islam, can be sentenced to death.
