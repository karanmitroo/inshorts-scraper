The Wikimedia Foundation is in the process of implementing HTTPS by default to encrypt all Wikimedia traffic from all its sites, including Wikipedia. It is aiming to protect transmitted data and to make it difficult for governments or third parties to monitor traffic. The project is in final stages of the transition, and will be accomplished in the upcoming weeks.
