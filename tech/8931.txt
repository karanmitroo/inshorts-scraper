The government has revised the 'Indian Customs Declaration Form' to include drones in the list of prohibited and dutiable goods, making it mandatory for the flyers to declare them from April 1. The revision has been made considering drones as a major security risk. Duty-free allowance of foreigners has also been increased to ₹15,000 from the existing limit of ₹8,000.
