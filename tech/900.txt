Russian robot named 'Alantim v2' and its updated version 'Alantim v3' took part in a rap battle at Phystechpark technological facility in Moscow last week. During the battle, the newer robot said, "I am a Ferrari sports car and you are just an old Lada." The robots are named after mathematician Alan Turing and World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee.
