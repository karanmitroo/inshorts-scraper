A Google Chrome extension called 'DropUnited' claims to "drag United Airlines off flight search results" after the airline dragged a man off an overbooked flight. The airline has also received flak after a scorpion allegedly bit a passenger. On searching for a flight through Google Search, Expedia or Kayak, the extension will automatically hide results for United Airlines.
