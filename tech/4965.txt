Paris has dropped its plan to name one of its streets after Apple's late Co-founder Steve Jobs as the city's left front group opposed the decision and called Jobs a tax dodger and a bully. The group said Jobs exploited cheap Chinese labour to rebuild Apple. It added that Apple owes $14.5 billion to Ireland in unpaid taxes.
