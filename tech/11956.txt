The US state of Iowa is planning a smartphone driver's license programme where an app will host the driving license. The app will also send notifications about traffic and license expiry date. To begin with, the smartphone driver's license will be piloted by some state employees. Once successful, the US department of transportation will determine next steps for public use.
