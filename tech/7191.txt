Apple recently patented a stylus concept featuring inertial sensors, which could enable it to act as an air mouse or joystick. In the patent, the company outlined a stylus with pressure sensitivity and inertial sensors. It can be used as a joystick when standing on its tip, or can be used as a rotating controller when rotated left and right.
