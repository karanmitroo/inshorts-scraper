Technology giant Google has reportedly codenamed this year's Android 9.0 update as 'Pistachio Ice Cream' internally, according to reports. The name for 'Android P', which is expected to launch this year, follows Google's tradition of dessert-themed names for its operating systems. Earlier versions of Android were named Oreo, Nougat, Marshmallow, Lollipop, KitKat and so on.
