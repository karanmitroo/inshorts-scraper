Germany's Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics switched on Wendelstein 7-X, the first large fusion reactor. The reactor took 19 years to design and is built at a cost of about $1.3 billion. It currently produces hydrogen plasma and won't generate energy. The inaugural test phase will run through mid-March.
