Twitter has said that only a few users are opting out of its algorithmic timeline, and that the opt-out rate is in “low single digits”. Launched last month, the new timeline shows users customised tweets at the top around the topics they are interested in. Twitter also said that it has seen across-the-board increases in per-user favorites, retweets and replies.
