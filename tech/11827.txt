Google on Tuesday launched its flight search service in India, allowing users to directly search for flights within Google. Users will need to access google(.)co(.)in/flights to quickly find, compare and book flights. Google's new service will redirect the consumers to the concerned airline's booking page, enabling them to avoid the commission paid to the travel agent.
