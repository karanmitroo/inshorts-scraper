Slamming YouTuber Logan Paul's video which showed a suicide victim's body in Japan, YouTube tweeted suicide is "not a joke" and should never be a driving force for views. Adding that Paul's channel violated community guidelines, the video-sharing website said it's looking at "further consequences". Earlier, Paul uploaded the video blurring the victim's face but removed it within 24 hours.
