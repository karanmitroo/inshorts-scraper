Google is building 100 prototype cars that won’t have a steering wheel, but instead it’ll have buttons for go and stop, Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin said Tuesday. It won’t have brake and gas pedals either. A combination of sensors and computing power, takes over. This prototype is the first Google will have built for itself and won't be for sale.
