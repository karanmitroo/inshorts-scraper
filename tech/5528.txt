Israel-based technology startup Glide has created a $249 (approx â‚¹16,600) camera-embedded band for the Apple Watch. The 'CMRA' band incorporates an 8-megapixel primary and 2-megapixel secondary camera. Glide has also developed a stand to charge both the Apple Watch and the CMRA band. Apple recently launched an Apple Watch series 2 variant with a Nike Sport rubber strap.
