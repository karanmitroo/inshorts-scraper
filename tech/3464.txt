Malaysia Airlines will become the world's first airline to track its flights with the help of satellites by 2018. This will enable the airline to track its flights minute-by-minute, anywhere in the world including over the polar regions and the most remote oceans. No new avionics or modifications are needed for aircraft to be tracked by the satellites.
