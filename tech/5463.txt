Indian-origin American scientist Shiva Ayyadurai, who claims to have invented email in 1978 at the age of 14, has won $750,000 (â‚¹5 crore) in a settlement with Gawker Media. Ayyadurai sued the media organisation for defamation and his lawsuit claimed that a series of stories published by Gawker "falsely trace the origin of emails and called Dr Ayyadurai a liar."
