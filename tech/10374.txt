A road safety application called 'Safely Home' was launched in Gurgaon on Sunday. The application, built by an IIT-D student, is reportedly programmed to automatically send an alert message to the police, ambulance and the userâ€™s family if the phone is detected to be damaged. It will be made publically available on Gurgaon's next Car Free Day.
