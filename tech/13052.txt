Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Sunday revealed that the company is experimenting with delivering packages via drones within a mere 30 minutes. The drones, which are expected to be fully autonomous and start operations in the next 4-5 years, can carry items up to 2.3 kilograms, which means it covers up to 86% of the objects that Amazon delivers.
