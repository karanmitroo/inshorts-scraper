US-based startup Out Of Galaxy has developed a $99 (about â‚¹6,400) smart bottle called H2OPal which automatically tracks a user's hydration level via an app. The bottle syncs data with the 'H2OPal' app on a user's smartphone and sends personalised reminders to drink water. It also automatically adjusts users' goals based on their physique and activity.
