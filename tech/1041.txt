PM Narendra Modi on Thursday launched e-governance app UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance), which unifies over 100 central and state government services. The app presently offers services related to payment of bills, filing income tax, Aadhaar-related queries, among other things. UMANG also allows a user to link their Aadhaar number and social media accounts with the app.
