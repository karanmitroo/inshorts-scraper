A UK band called 'Weirds' claims to have gained over 1 lakh new likes on its Facebook page after it got hacked last week. The hackers deleted the band's posts, renamed the page "Top Viral Videos" and posted short videos through it. After regaining control of its page, the band asked its new followers to unfollow the page.
