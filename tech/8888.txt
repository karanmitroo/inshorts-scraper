Palmer Luckey, the Founder of virtual reality company Oculus VR, has said that the company’s VR headset Rift will start supporting MacBooks if Apple “ever releases a good computer”. Luckey explained that Apple computers are not designed to handle the graphical-processing demands of VR software. He added, “It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritize high-end GPUs”.
