Facebook on Thursday launched Audience Optimization, a tool that could help publishers in targeting appropriate audiences and better understand their interests. The tool will sport three features- 'Preferred audience' to add interest tags to the content, 'Audience restrictions' to limit the visibility of certain posts and 'Audience insights' that provides visibility into the content performance.
