US-based firm Snap, maker of photo-sharing app Snapchat, on Sunday said it has removed Al Jazeera from the app's 'Discover' section in Saudi Arabia. Snap said the Saudi authorities asked to remove the Qatar-based news channel as it violated local laws. Notably, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states had cut ties with Qatar this year, accusing it of supporting terrorism.
