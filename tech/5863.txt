US filmmaker Daniel Riley has created what he dubbed "the world's brightest flashlight" by attaching his homemade 1000 Watt LED light panel to the underside of a Freefly Alta 8-rotor drone. He has released a video showcasing his creation, featuring shots of the drone illuminating forests, building tops and a metal bridge.
