Israel-based security researchers have created 'Speake(a)r', a proof-of-concept hack that turns headphones into microphones to secretly record audio. It modifies the integrated audio codec chip output into an input channel, enabling the headphones to pickup audio even when plugged into the output jack. The hack was found to be as good as an unpowered microphone at picking up surrounding audio.
