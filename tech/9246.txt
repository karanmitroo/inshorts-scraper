Amazon on Friday launched a new feature in which users can hail an Uber cab through the former’s digital assistant device ‘Echo’. It will accept various iterations such as "request me a ride," "call me a ride," and "get me an Uber," among others. Echo already offers features in which users can order pizzas and stream music on Spotify.
