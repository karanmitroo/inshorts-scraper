Google has announced it is introducing Firebase Cloud Messaging for web applications, a service that lets developers send push notifications for their apps to end users' devices. Until now, it was only possible to send push notifications via Android and iOS apps with the Firebase service. Google acquired backend database startup Firebase in 2014 to boost public cloud capabilities.
