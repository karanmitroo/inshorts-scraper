Facebook is apologising and paying â‚¹1,030 (around $15) each to the users whose names and photos were used in its advertisements without asking them. The move comes after Facebook lost a 2011 lawsuit where it was ordered to pay $20 million in damages to the affected users. However, only users who claimed damages in 2013 are eligible for the payment.
