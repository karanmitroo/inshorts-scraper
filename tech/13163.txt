The launch of India's Mars Orbiter Mission, slated for October-28, has been delayed by a week with a new date expected to be announced by October-22. Only one of the 2-ships (Yamuna) has reached Fiji, while the other (Nalanda) is expected to reach there around October-21, causing the delay. The launch window for the mission is between October-28 and November-19.
