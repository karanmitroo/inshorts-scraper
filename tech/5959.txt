Apple has removed the application Dash from its App Store, telling the developer that his account was being suspended due to suspicion of review manipulation. The developer claims that he has never engaged in review fraud, giving his own app high ratings and leaving negative ones for competitors. He added that Apple's decision is final and can't be repealed.
