Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced the second major update to News Feed, stating the platform will prioritise 'trustworthy' news. Zuckerberg said Facebook will ask users if they're familiar with a source, as part of its surveys, to identify sources that are trusted by the community. Earlier, Facebook announced it'll prioritise content from users' Friends instead of content from brands.
