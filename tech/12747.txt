Apple has launched the 8GB version of iPhone 5C, the cheaper version of the existing variants of the same phone, in several countries in Europe. The only difference between it and the existing variants of the phone is reduced storage space; other specs of iPhone 5C remain same. iPhone 5C has reportedly not done well when it comes to sales.
