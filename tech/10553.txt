Uber is reportedly planning to unveil its e-commerce delivery service by late September or early October in New York. The company will partner with big retailers and fashion brands and provide an express delivery option to shoppers on websites and applications. In the past, Uber had launched other non-core services like the UberRush messenger and the UberEats meal delivery service.
