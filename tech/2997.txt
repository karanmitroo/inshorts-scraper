Verizon is expected to fire up to 2,100 people from Yahoo and AOL globally once the merger between the two companies is complete. The combined entity 'Oath' will be headed by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Verizon announced its deal to buy Yahoo's core internet business last year, but the original offer was lowered after Yahoo disclosed two massive data breaches.
