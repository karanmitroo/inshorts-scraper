Facebook is reportedly testing an 'in-app search engine' that will let users search for websites and articles within the app and link them to their statuses. Upon putting in any word in the search-engine, Facebook will show a list of matching links which could be shared by the user. With this feature, Facebook is planning to compete with Google search.
