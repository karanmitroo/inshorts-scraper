Facebook on Thursday rebranded its internet.org app as ‘Free Basics’, a mobile app and website that allows users to access certain services free of data charges. The change is intended to better distinguish the app from the larger initiative, internet.org. The company is also experimenting with a program called ‘Express Wi-Fi’ to provide wi-fi in rural areas in India.
