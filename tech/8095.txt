Google on Monday launched Spaces, a group sharing app with inbuilt Google Search, YouTube and Chrome to let users share articles, videos and images without leaving it. Users can create different groups for topics and invite others via messaging, email or a social network. Available on Android and iOS, Spaces will compete with the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
