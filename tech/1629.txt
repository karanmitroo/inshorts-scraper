Twitter on Wednesday announced that it has started testing a bigger 280-character limit for tweets for some users, instead of 140. This is the first time Twitter has changed its character limit since it launched 11 years ago in 2006. "Our research shows the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people Tweeting in English," Twitter said.
