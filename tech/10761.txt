NASA has extended a contract with Russia that will fly its Astronauts to the International Space Station, due to the budget cuts that have delayed commercial US alternatives. The contract has been extended through 2017 and will cost the United States about $490 million, which comes to a cost of $80 million per seat on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
