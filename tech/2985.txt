Researchers have detected a mobile ransomware which appears to be copying the WannaCry malware that had hit 150 countries last month. Unlike WannaCry which affected Microsoft Windows computers, the new ransomware dubbed 'WannaLocker' targets Android smartphones through a Chinese game. WannaLocker can only lock files that are under 10 KB and demands a ransom of â‚¹380 to unlock them.
