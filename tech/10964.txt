Australia-based Fastbrick Robotics has claimed to have developed a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks per hour and build the frame of an average house in under two days. Called Hadrian, the robot is still a prototype. The robot has been named after the ancient Roman emperor Hadrian who "built a lot of walls for the Romans".
