Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday cancelled an internal meeting about firing of engineer James Damore for writing an anti-diversity memo, after employees feared they'd face online harassment. Google employees are "worried they may be 'outed' publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall," Pichai said. He was reportedly set to address 60,000 employees of Google's parent company Alphabet.
