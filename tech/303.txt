US defence research agency DARPA has launched Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors program that will study the viability of using both natural and modified sea organisms to detect underwater vehicles. The system would aim to translate the biological responses of sea life into usable data, to warn ships without needing conspicuous hardware that could alert the enemy of its detection.
