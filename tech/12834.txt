WhatsApp's 450 million worldwide users were unable to access the smartphone free-messaging service on Saturday for almost 3 hours, three days after Facebook acquired it for $19 billion. "Sorry we currently experiencing server issues. We hope to be back up and recovered shortly," WhatsApp said in a message on Twitter that was retweeted more than 25,000 times in just a few hours.
