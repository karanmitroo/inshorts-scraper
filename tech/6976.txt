An American named Adrei Soroker's Twitter handle @abs was on Tuesday mistaken for Australian Bureau of Statistics' Twitter handle. The government body was holding Australia's largest survey online but became inaccessible after a reported cyber attack. Outraged citizens started tweeting their complaints to the @abs handle, making Soroker change his bio to 'Not Australian Bureau of Statistics'.
