A Canadian startup has developed wireless earbuds 'Phazon' for listening to music. Controlled through a dedicated mobile app, the earbuds lets users listen to music and receive calls by tapping on them. The earbuds are also compatible with smartwatches and can be located through the mobile app. The startup also claims that a single size earbud fits all.
