A group of energy tech startups in cooperation with electricity providers in Australia has launched a pilot program of the world's first digital marketplace for rooftop solar energy. The Decentralised Energy Exchange (deX) will let homeowners monetise their solar panels and batteries by "essentially renting them to the grid when they're most needed," said deX partner startup GreenSync's CEO.
