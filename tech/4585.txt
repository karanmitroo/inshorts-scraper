US-based startup Sanho, which has created a hub to give the new MacBook Pro laptops the same ports as previous models, has received over $1.5 million in pre-orders. The HyperDrive hub will add a microSD, USB-C, HDMI and two USB 3.1 ports to the laptops which currently have four USB-C ports. Sanho has received funds from over 18,600 backers.
