American inventor Thomas Alva Edison completed the model of the first phonograph, a device for mechanical recording and reproduction of sound, on August 12, 1877. "I was never so taken aback in my life... I was always afraid of things that worked the first time," Edison had recalled during an event 50 years after the invention.
