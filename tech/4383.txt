Several radio stations across the US were hacked recently to play the protest song 'f**k Donald Trump' against the country's President. Many of the hacked stations were unable to stop the song from playing on a loop until the issue was resolved. The song was written by American rappers YG & Nipsey Hussle during the US presidential election campaign.
