Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio 4G network, which is offering free service until December 31 this year, is also providing additional data through Jio WiFi internet hotspots. The company has launched a 'JioNet' app, which tells users about their nearest Jio Wifi hotspot in case the users run out of data. However, the WiFi usage has limited time and data quota.
