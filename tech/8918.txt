A 13 student-team of IIT Kharagpur has developed i-Bikeâ€“ a disabled friendly bicycle that autonomously rides itself towards any given location. The brainchild of Ayush Pandey and Subhamoy Mahajan, i-Bike has autonomous steering, brake, and driving mechanisms. The bicycle uses GPS and responds to the coordinates of the destination received via SMS, with the help of a dedicated Android app.
