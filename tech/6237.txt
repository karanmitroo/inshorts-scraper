US-based logistics provider United Parcel Service (UPS) is testing delivery of emergency medical supplies by drones. The service is set to begin trials this week in rural parts of the state of Massachusetts. Notably, UPS is a stakeholder in Zipline, a drone startup that has been ferrying blood and vaccines in the African nation of Rwanda since July.
