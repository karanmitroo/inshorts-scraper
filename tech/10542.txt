Scientists from Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona have created the first experimental wormhole that can connect two regions of space magnetically. The tunnel is built such that the magnetic field from a source appears at the other end of the wormhole as an isolated magnetic monopole. The magnetic field appears to travel from one point to another through a fourth dimension.
