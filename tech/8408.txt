A US-based startup has created 'Floatti', a $250 smart suitcase with touch-control and notification-enabled handle that lets users make phone calls. It has detachable mobile and laptop chargers and a strap to place additional baggage. The suitcase also features an in-built weighing scale and comes with anti-theft mechanism and tracking options.
