KFC has created a box for its fried chicken called 'Gamer's Box 2.0' that comes with a built-in Bluetooth controller as well as a mount on the top. The mount turns the chicken box into an adjustable smartphone holder. The boxes are only limited to ten units and are available as prizes for a social media contest.
