US-based researchers are developing electricity conducting coating for fabrics that could power small electronic devices. Researchers used a conducting polymer to make fabrics resistant to wear and tear while remaining stable after washing and ironing. The thickest coating was about 500 nanometres, around one-tenth the width of a human hair, which retained the fabric's breathability and hand feel.
