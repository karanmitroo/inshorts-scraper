Danish researchers have collected data from 70,000 profiles of online dating website OkCupid and released them on the internet. While the data used no real names, it mentioned usernames, locations and answers to personal questions like political leanings. The profiles were technically already public, however according to OkCupid, collecting data without consent violates the website’s legal policy.
