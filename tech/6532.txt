Paris hosted its first drone festival at the Champs-Élysées avenue on Sunday, with citizens participating in a race and guiding their drones through an obstacle course. The postal service also demonstrated its  3.7-kilogram delivery drone during the festival. The City Hall allowed civilians to fly their drones during the event, as they are otherwise forbidden from flying them over Paris.
