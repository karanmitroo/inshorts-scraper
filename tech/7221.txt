US-based startup Alchema has designed a device to home-brew fruit-based alcoholic beverage cider. Users need to select a recipe from a dedicated app and follow the instructions to prepare the drink. The device has an in-built scale to notify users of the quantity of ingredients and also features a UV light system to kill bacteria.
