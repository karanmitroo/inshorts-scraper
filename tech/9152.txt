Eleven fashion designers from North and South America printed their collections using Japanese company Epson's technology for the Epson Digital Couture event, as part of New York Fashion Week (NYFW) 2016. The digital designs were made tangible using Epson printers. Epson believes that their technology "gives designers the ability to design whatever they can possibly imagine".
