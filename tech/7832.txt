Puzant Ozbag, owner of a five day old Tesla Model X has claimed that during parking, the car suddenly accelerated at high speed on its own and crashed into a building. The car's airbags opened and Ozbag's wife suffered burns on her arms. "Tesla should stop deliveries and investigate the cause of this serious accident," Ozbag said.
