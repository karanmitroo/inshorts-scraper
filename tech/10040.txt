A team of cardiologists from Poland have used the eye wearable device Google Glass to successfully open up a chronically blocked coronary artery of a 49-year-old male patient. The doctors were able to clearly visualise the artery with the help of angiography image projections on the device, allowing them to successfully restore blood flow.
