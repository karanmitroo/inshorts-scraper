Gaming equipment maker Razer has unveiled a prototype of Project Valerie, the world's first laptop to incorporate three built-in foldable monitors. Each 4K screen on the 1.5-inch thick and 5.44kg heavy gaming laptop measures 17.3 inches. The screens slide out from the central lid chassis to create a full 180-degree viewing area or can be used to run different applications.
