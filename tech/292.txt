Technology giant Apple's smart speaker HomePod, which is priced at $349, will cost $279 to repair its out-of-warranty defects. The company offers a warranty against manufacturing defects for one year but does not cover damage caused by accidents. The Siri-enabled HomePod can send messages, set a timer, play a podcast, check the news, sports, traffic, and weather.
