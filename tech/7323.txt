Saudi Arabia's highest religious body has reportedly renewed a 15-year-old fatwa against the Pokémon game franchise calling it 'un-Islamic' and said it promotes Zionism and gambling. Saudi's Mufti asked children not to play Pokémon games in order to "protect their religion." The renewed fatwa, originally issued in 2001 against Pokémon card games, does not mention the new Pokémon Go game.
