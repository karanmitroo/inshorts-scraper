Energy bar Snickers has developed an algorithm 'Hungerithm', which the company claims can ascertain the mood of the internet. The algorithm, enabled to identify slangs and sarcasm, analyses around 14,000 social posts a day. Based on the analysis, Snickers decides the price of its bar at 7-Eleven convenient stores in Australia. The angrier the internet, the cheaper becomes the bar.
