Leading printer-manufacturer, HP, will reportedly enter the 3D-printing market by the end of next year. Company officials said their version will be high-end, that will work much faster and not be meant for DIY enthusiasts or homes. The version will not be limited to plastic, but work on metal and other mediums too, in an effort to “revolutionise the market”.
