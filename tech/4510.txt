A Canadian man remotely accessed his stolen laptop and shared photos and contact number of the thief by hacking into her Facebook account. The man initially used the information on the thief's profile to send her a message asking her to return the laptop or he would "make (her) famous." On not receiving a reply, he posted her details online.
