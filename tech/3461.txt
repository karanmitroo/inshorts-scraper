Apple has reportedly hired Steven Keating, a doctoral student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who made a 3D printout of his own brain after he was diagnosed with a tumour. In 2015, Keating said he had collected 75 GB of his health information to understand the tumour. He is reportedly working on one of Apple's healthcare teams.
