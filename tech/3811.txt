Snapchat Product VP Tom Conrad on Thursday took a jibe at Instagram Head of Product Kevin Weil for copying the former's 'Stories' feature. Conrad had responded to Weil's post asking Twitter users to caption a photo of two children looking shocked. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has been facing flak for introducing Snapchat-like features across its platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger.
