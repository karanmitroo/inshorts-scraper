Microsoft on Wednesday addressed its interns with "Hey Bae Intern!" in an email inviting them to a company party. The email further said, "There will be hella noms, lots of dranks...Hell yes to getting lit on a Monday night." Microsoft later apologised saying the email was "poorly worded and not in keeping with (Microsoft's) values as a company."
