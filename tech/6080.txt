China recently completed a test run of its first suspended electric monorail network in the Chengdu city, over a 300-meter line. The project's chief designer said the lithium battery-powered train has a top speed of 60 kmph and load capacity of 120 passengers per coach. He estimated the project's cost to be one-fifth to one-eighth of that of underground rail.
