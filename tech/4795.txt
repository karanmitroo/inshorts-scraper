PM Narendra Modi on Friday launched a BHIM mobile payments application that supports over 30 banks and is compatible with all Android phones. Users can link their Unified Payments Account with a bank account or create a new UPI account with their phone number as username. It provides options to send and request money or scan a receiver's QR code.
