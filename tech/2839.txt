Apple's new store in Chicago, US, will feature a giant rectangular roof with a logo on its middle, meant to replicate a MacBook Air laptop. The 20,000 sq ft store will have all-glass walls and a thin, carbon fiber roof to give the look of a MacBook Air. Apple has not indicated when the new Chicago store will open.
