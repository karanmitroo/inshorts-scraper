Scientists at the Public University of Navarre in Spain have created a tractor beam using sound that can grab tiny objects and move them around in air. The tractor beam is a concept of science fiction in which a hypothetical beam of energy is used to move objects, generally spaceships as shown in the movies Star Wars and Star Trek.
