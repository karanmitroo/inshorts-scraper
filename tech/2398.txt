Apple has paid Nokia $2 billion in cash as part of a deal to settle the patent dispute between the companies. This comes after Nokia sued Apple for violating 32 of its patents in December 2016. Although the companies settled their patent dispute earlier this May, the financial amount paid by Apple was disclosed in Nokia's Q2 2017 earning reports.
