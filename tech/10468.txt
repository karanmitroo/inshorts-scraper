Russia's anti-monopoly agency has held Google guilty of abusing its dominant market position in the country. In a case filed by local competitor Yandex, Google was found to have pre-installed its search engine and given its application icons preferential placements on mobile devices. The company could face penalties up to 15% of its revenue generated in 2014 in that region.
