Hacktivist collective Anonymous has declared #OpTrump against US presidential candidate Donald Trump after the latter called for a ban on Muslim entry in the US. In a video message, the group said, “The more Muslims feel sad, the more ISIS feels they can recruit them...Donald Trump, think twice before you speak anything.” Anonymous has already waged a cyberwar against ISIS.
