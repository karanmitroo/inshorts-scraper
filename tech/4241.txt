A teardown of Nike's limited-edition HyperAdapt self-lacing shoes, which are priced at $720 (over â‚¹48,000), reveals that the laces are made out of a high-strength liquid crystal polymer called Vectran. The shoes also have a metal gearbox, capable of lifting up to 13 kg, a pressure sensor, and several magnets. Other components include circuit boards, connectors, and a battery.
