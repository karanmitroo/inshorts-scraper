Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post on Thursday said, "I'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite." The satellite, which cost around $95 million, was Facebook's first satellite aimed at providing spot-beam broadband for the company's Internet.org initiative. However, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carrying the satellite exploded during a test launch in US.
