In order to benefit guests reserving seats on its mobile app, Jet Airways has integrated Google Now for flight bookings, a feature that delivers updates without having to search for them, into its booking system. This feature is available via the Google Search app for iOS devices on Appleâ€™s App Store, and is built into Android 4.1+ devices.
