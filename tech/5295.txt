Twitter accounts of media firms like The Economist, The New Yorker and Viacom were compromised on Saturday morning and started posting ads leading to a spam website that claimed to help increase followers. All of the spam tweets were posted through a Twitter statistics analysis tool called 'Twitter Counter'. Accounts of gaming companies PlayStation and Xbox were also hacked.
