YouTube has announced a $5 million investment in its 'Creators for Change' program, to promote videos which "counter hate and promote tolerance." The program includes videos focussing on racism, the plight of refugees, and breaking stereotypes surrounding Muslim women. The move comes after the video sharing platform faced criticism for hosting videos including hate speech and terrorist propaganda.
