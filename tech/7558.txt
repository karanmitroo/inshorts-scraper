US-based audio devices maker Turtle Beach has developed 'HyperSound Glass', which the company claims, is the world's first transparent directional speaker. Comprised of multiple layers of transparent materials and film which allows it to generate a beam of ultrasound, the speaker is only audible to the targeted listeners. The speaker is currently in the early prototype phase.
