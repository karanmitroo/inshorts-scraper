A New York-based startup has unveiled 'Kobi', a $4,000 fully self-driving robot that can cut grass, collect leaves, and clear snow from the garden. The robot can also be controlled by the owner through a dedicated smartphone app. The robot, which travels at a speed of 3 kmph, automatically docks itself to the charging station when its battery gets drained.
