The International Telecommunication Union, a UN body, predicts that 3.2 billion of 7.2 billion global population will be using Internet by the end of 2015. By the year end, 80% of households in developed countries and 34% in developing countries will have internet access in some form, a report said. In 2000, there were just 400 million internet users worldwide.
