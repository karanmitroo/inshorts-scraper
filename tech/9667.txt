Drone manufacturer DJI on Thursday launched a beta version of the new geofencing technology, called Geospatial Environment Online (GEO), that helps the drone to avoid restricted airspaces. GEO will also allow the users with verified DJI accounts to briefly unlock some restrictions. A mobile application, available on android and iOS platforms, would be required to use the new technology.
