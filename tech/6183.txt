Microsoft on Monday introduced the 'Windows Defender Application Guard' for its Edge browser, an application that isolates the browser like a "virtual PC", to make it harder to hack. It uses the recently introduced Virtualization Based Security and keeps Edge separate from processes including storage, apps and Windows 10 kernel. The system is currently available for Windows 10 Enterprise.
