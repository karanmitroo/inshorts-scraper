A three-minute-long YouTube video shows the process behind the heating of food in a microwave oven. The kitchen appliance was invented by accident after Dr Percy Spencer, while testing a magnetron in 1946, observed that the candy bar in his pocket melted. Spencer, who created the first microwave oven in 1947, passed away 47 years ago on September 8, 1969.
