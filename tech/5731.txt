Some Facebook employees had threatened to quit after CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to not delete Donald Trump's post calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US, according to Wall Street Journal. Zuckerberg had argued that it would be inappropriate to censor a presidential candidate. However, some employees believed that Trump's comments violated the platform's rules on hate speech.
