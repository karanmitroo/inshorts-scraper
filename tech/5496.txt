US security service FBI has reportedly launched an internal investigation into one of its own Twitter accounts. FBI's Twitter account 'FBIRecordsVault' shared documents related to the US presidential candidates including information on Donald Trump's father and files from an investigation on Bill Clinton. It is illegal for FBI employees to use the department's resources to influence an election.
