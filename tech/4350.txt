A Belgian hacker recently hijacked old tweets on US President Donald Trump's personal Twitter handle and changed the expired links to parody videos. The hacker, 'Inti De Ceukelaire', purchased the expired URLs used in at least four of Trump's tweets and switched them for YouTube videos like a My Little Pony convention and a video mocking Trump's alleged Russian ties.
