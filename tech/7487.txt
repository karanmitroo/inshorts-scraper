Facebook-owned Instagram has introduced a new 'Comment Moderation' option, that will help business users cut down on the amount of spam and abuse in comments. It essentially blocks comments with words or phrases often reported as offensive. The new feature, which can be turned on from the account settings, was rolled out only for business pages for now.
