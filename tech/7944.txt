Singapore-based engineers have developed a multi-field invisibility technique that can make electronic and thermal sensors 'invisible' without compromising their performance. The existing such technologies that can make sensors 'invisible' usually decrease the sensors' performance or make them ineffective. The team created the ideal invisible sensor by covering it with a thin pure copper shell.
