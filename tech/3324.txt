Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to hire 3,000 more reviewers to remove objectionable content faster following an increase in number of violent videos uploaded on the platform. Facebook has been criticised for taking too long to remove such content. Last month, the video of a Thai man killing his 11-month-old daughter was available for 24 hours before being removed.
