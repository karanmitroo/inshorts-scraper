Mapping data provider 'Here', co-owned by Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, has developed a platform through which cars will be able to exchange information in real-time. Vehicles will use their sensors and cameras to offer details on free parking spaces, traffic conditions and road hazards. The platform, scheduled to roll-out in 2017, will start by sourcing data from its parent automakers.
