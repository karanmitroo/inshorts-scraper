The US House of Representatives has passed a bill to scrap a Barack Obama-era rule that required internet providers to get customers' permission before sharing their browsing history with other companies. The rule also required internet providers to protect that data from hackers and inform customers of breaches. The bill will become law once US President Donald Trump signs it.
