Social media giant Facebook is testing a resume feature that lets users list their contact details along with professional experience and education on their Facebook accounts. The feature, which allows users to add their image and other qualifications, combines the information under a single tab. The feature is reportedly an expansion of Facebook's 'Work and Education' section.
