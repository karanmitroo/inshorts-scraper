US electronics firm Griffin has made a magnetic cable that can charge the new MacBook Pro laptops announced by Apple using the 'MagSafe' technology. The $40 (approx â‚¹2,600) cable can be used with any device that has a USB-C port including the Google Pixel lineup. Apple used the magnetic charging technology for a decade before announcing its discontinuation this week.
