Nobel Prize-winning economist Sir Christopher Pissarides has been slammed online after he said he preferred the voice on Apple's digital assistant Siri to be male because that made it more trustworthy. Apologising for his comments, Pissarides said, "But the audience was laughing." The comments were made at the Starmus Festival, whose spokesperson accepted that Pissarides' comments were sexist.
