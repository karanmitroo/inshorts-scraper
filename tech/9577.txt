US-based Sandia National Labs are working on a new accelerator named 'Thor', which will be 40 times more efficient than the World's most powerful pulsed-power accelerator 'Z Machine'. The machine's 'magnetic field' would be able to reach one million atmospheres, the pressure experienced at Earth's core. Such setups are used to test and study how materials behave at extreme pressures.
