A clinical trial for a breast cancer vaccine, conducted by Washington University's School of Medicine, was proved successful in the preliminary phase. The side effects were mild, like treatable rashes and tenderness at the vaccination-site. The vaccine strengthens the patients' immune system, by homing in on a protein called mammaglobin-A, thereby weakening the progression of cancer.
