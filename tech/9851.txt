According to Microsoft chief evangelist Steve Guggenheimer, low-cost Windows 10 smartphones will not come to India anytime soon. He said, “We are sort of re-building so we will start high. New generation smartphones first”. Guggenheimer added that high-end phones are being rolled out to compete with Apple. Microsoft recently launched two Lumia phones in India for ₹43,699 and ₹49,399 respectively.
