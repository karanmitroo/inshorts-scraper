A US-based man has claimed his e-cigarette exploded in his face while he was using it, knocking out seven of his teeth and causing second-degree burns to his cheek. The man shared images of himself after the explosion along with the burnt vapouriser pen and the damage done to his house. The e-cigarette was using a 3,000 mAh LG battery.
