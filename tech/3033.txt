Lawyers representing two Twitter users on Tuesday sent the White House a letter demanding they be unblocked from US President Donald Trump's account. The lawyers argued blocking users suppresses speech as they can't interact with Trump anymore. His account creates a "public forum from which it may not constitutionally exclude individuals on the basis of viewpoint," the letter said.
