Nilay Mehta, a 17-year-old Indian-origin boy in the US, has developed a 3D-printed robotic arm worth $260, that is programmed to replicate movements of a human hand. A user can make the hand perform specific movements by speaking into a small microphone attached to it. Mehta has won six science fair awards so far for his creation.
