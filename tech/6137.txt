British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN. The web was originally developed to meet the demand for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. CERN, which was founded on September 29, 1954, probes the fundamental structure of the universe.
