Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, that aims at loading web pages on mobiles at a faster speed, will reportedly go live in February 2016. The company said the AMP pages, tested on Pinterest, load “four times faster and use eight times less data than traditional mobile-optimized pages.” Further, platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn and Viber are considering linking to AMP content.
