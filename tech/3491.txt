China-based Internet firm Tencent, which owns messenger app WeChat, has paid an undisclosed employee $40 million (₹258 crore) in salary and bonus in 2016. This is nearly double that of Apple's highest paid executive, Senior Vice President of Retail Angela Ahrendts, who made $22.9 million (₹147 crore). Reports speculate that this compensation could be for Tencent's COO Mark Ren Yuxin.
