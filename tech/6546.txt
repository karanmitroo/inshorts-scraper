American corporation Xerox has developed an inkjet printer which is claimed to print photos, images and text directly on almost all 3D objects. The 'Direct to Object Inkjet Printer' uses algorithms to control microscopic-nozzles to print on smooth, rough and curved surfaces made from plastic, metal and glass. The printer costs $145,000 and prints with resolution up to 1,200 DPI.
