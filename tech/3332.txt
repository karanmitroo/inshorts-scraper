To prevent any leak of the upcoming iPhone, Apple doesn't allow any factory worker to carry their phones inside, according to NYU student Dejian Zeng, who spent six weeks working undercover at Apple factory. All Apple factories have facial recognition and highly-active metal detectors. Furthermore, big curtains separate workers assembling new iPhones from the ones working on the old iPhones.
