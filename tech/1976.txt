Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this week recalled around 465,000 pacemakers which help control heart beat due to risk of being hacked. According to FDA, the medical devices' cybersecurity could be hacked to run the batteries down or even alter the patient's heartbeat. However, the pacemaker manufacturing company Abbott has issued an update to cover the vulnerabilities.
