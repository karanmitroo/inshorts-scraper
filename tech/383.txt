A Live video on Facebook, claiming to show the 'Super Blue Blood Moon' in Greece, used a nine-year-old still image of the moon, according to reports. The image was overlaid with a current timestamp and the sound of wind was added in the video, which garnered over 16 million views. Facebook said the video was removed for violating its policies.
