NASA on Friday reported that its Swift spacecraft has identified its 1,000th gamma-ray burst (GRB). Swift specialises in detecting GRBs, which are explosions emitting high-energy light, associated with the collapse of a large star. Swift’s principal investigator said, “The spacecraft remains in great shape after nearly 11 years in space, and we expect to see many more GRBs to come.”
