A group of Evangelical Christians in Brazil have launched a "sin-free" variant of Facebook, "Facegloria", a social networking site where any kind of swearing, irreligious or erotic content is completely banned. The site which has already attracted over 100,000 users, has been launched to morally and spiritually clean up social media. It has an “Amen” button, analogous to Facebook's 'Like'.
