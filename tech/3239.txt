A YouTuber has shared a video of him drilling a hole through an iPhone 7, which is priced at â‚¹60,000 in India, and iPhone 5s to turn them into 'fidget spinner' toys. He inserted a ball bearing into the hole, which was 7/8th of an inch wide, to make the phones spin. Fidget spinners are meant to be stress-relieving toys.
