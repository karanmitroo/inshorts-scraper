Tech giant, Google, Tuesday announced a $500 million acquisition of satellite maker, Skybox. The deal could serve as a launching pad for the Internet company to send its own fleet of satellites to take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world. The expansion into satellites comes two months after Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace.
