Google is reportedly building a new live-streaming app called YouTube Connect. The standalone app lets users stream videos right from their phones and also store previous broadcasts for later playback. In direct competition with Twitter’s Periscope and Facebook Live, it features built-in news feed, chat and tagging. However, it does not feature support for sharing live-streams on social networks.
