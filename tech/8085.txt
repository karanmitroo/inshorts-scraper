Delhi-based NGO Wildlife SOS, along with Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, has urged online retailer Amazon to take down protected wild and aquatic animal specimens and hunting equipment from its ‘sale' list. The NGO alleges that Amazon features snares, traps and specimens like alligators, snakes, bats, spiders, ladybugs, scorpions, frogs, octopus, and shark teeth under its ‘Toys and Games’ section.
