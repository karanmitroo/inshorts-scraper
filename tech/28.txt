Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, in a series of tweets, announced the micro-blogging site would be measuring the "health" of public conversations. Dorsey acknowledged Twitter has been misused for abuse, misinformation, trolls while being accused of censorship, political bias, and focussing on business rather than society. "This is not who we are, or who we ever want to be" Dorsey added.
