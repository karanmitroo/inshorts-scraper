The US Justice Department has dropped its lawsuit against Apple as the FBI has successfully unlocked the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone via an unknown alternative method. Earlier, Apple was ordered to unlock the iPhone, but it refused to do so citing privacy concerns. Apple said, “People…deserve data protection, security and privacy. Sacrificing one for the other puts…countries at greater risk.”
