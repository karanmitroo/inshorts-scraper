Technology giant Google has partnered with the US government to help in developing artificial intelligence (AI) for analysing drone footage. A Google spokesperson also confirmed that the company was providing the US access to its software to help build object recognition algorithms. The partnership is reportedly part of a programme called Project Maven launched by the US government last year.
