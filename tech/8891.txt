LinkedIn on Thursday open-sourced its metadata management tool called WhereHows. The software allows users to track specific types of data available under LinkedIn’s management, serving up information on more than 25,000 publicly shared data sets. It also lets users run wide-ranging searches and share subsequent information. The software is now available on GitHub under an open-source license.
