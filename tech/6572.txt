Luxury automaker Mercedes and technology major Microsoft are currently working on an 'In Car Office' project that will let owners complete work-related tasks while driving. The technology will sync a user's smartphone to integrate calendar, to-do list and contacts with carâ€™s navigation. This will allow the car to access meetings' addresses and make work-related calls through in-car voice system.
