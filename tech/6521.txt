A new report claims that over 1.6 million units of Samsung's latest Galaxy Note 7 smartphone are prone to the explosion of the battery. This comes shortly after Samsung announced a worldwide recall of the smartphone after confirming 35 cases of battery explosions. Analysts have estimated that the recall would cost the South Korean electronics major around $1 billion.
