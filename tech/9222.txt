Reliance Jio on Monday launched its Jionet free WiFi service at the recently opened Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport in Durgapur, West Bengal. The "high-speed" service will be accessible through a log-in process verified via SMS, after which travellers will be able to surf the internet for 24 hours. However, the service will automatically disconnect after 30 minutes of inactivity.
