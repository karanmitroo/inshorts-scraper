Fired Google employee James Damore who wrote the anti-diversity memo, in an interview earlier this week, said he wouldn't have used the term 'neuroticism' to describe female engineers "just because that has a very negative connotation." He also said it was "hard to regret" sending the memo as he had noticed problems in Google and "wanted to fix them."
