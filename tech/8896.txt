Bradley Hayes, a student at MIT's Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Lab, has developed an AI-powered Twitterbot named @DeepDrumpf. The bot learns Trump's underlying language structure through his speeches and debate transcripts, and uses deep learning techniques to recreate his language. The bot’s name comes after comedian John Oliver recently revealed Trump's ancestral name 'Drumpf'.
