As per reports, AT&T stores are being told to send back the Nexus 6 handsets they've received so far, as the devices are suffering from a crippling bug. The bug apparently causes the Google flagship's display to go black and prevents it from connecting to AT&T's service, "essentially leaving the device useless," a report says.
