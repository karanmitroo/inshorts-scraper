Numerous users of Samsung's latest flagship phone, Galaxy S8, have taken to social media to complain about an unusual 'red tint' on the phone's screen. While Samsung will launch the device worldwide later this month, it has begun shipping it to South Korean consumers who pre-ordered the phone. Samsung says the red tint can be fixed through phone's screen settings.
