Computer company Dell admitted on Monday to a security flaw that could let hackers access private user data on its new laptops. A pre-installed program intended to improve customer experience caused the security vulnerability, the company said, while declining to say which laptops were affected. Users will be given instructions by email to permanently remove the program, the company added.
