Google has announced an initiative on YouTube called 'Redirect Method' that will take users searching for terrorism-related keywords to playlists that will debunk violent extremist ideologies instead. To measure the success of the Redirect Method, Google will analyse the amount of engagement the counter terrorism content gets from the people being redirected to it.
