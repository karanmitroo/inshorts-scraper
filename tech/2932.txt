Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein on Monday got tricked by an anonymous email prankster who masqueraded as a top bank executive. The prankster congratulated Blankfein for a tweet he posted taking a jibe at Donald Trump's 'Infrastructure Week', which was overshadowed by fired FBI Director James Comey's testimony. Blankfein failed to discover it was a prank and reverted to email.
