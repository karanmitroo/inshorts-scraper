The Twitter account of Martin Shkreli, the controversial ex-CEO of America-based Turing Pharmaceuticals, was hacked on Sunday. The hackers changed his account name to 'Martin The God' and posted a series of tweets including â€œI am now a god". Earlier, Shkreli was condemned for increasing the price of Daraprim, a drug taken by AIDS patients, from $13.50 to $750 overnight.
