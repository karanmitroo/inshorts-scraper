NASA on Monday shared on Facebook a picture of the India-Pakistan border at night as seen from space. The picture, taken on September 23 by an astronaut from the International Space Station, shows the border lit-up by orange security lights. The Indo-Pak border is one of the few international borders to be seen from space, NASA wrote in the post.
