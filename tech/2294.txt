An American woman on Thursday filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company, alleging that her child was illegally tracked while using its mobile games. The ad-tracking software embedded within Disney's mobile games makes personal information of kids available to third-parties, the lawsuit further claims. In 2011, Disney subsidiary Playdom paid a penalty of $3 million over similar claims.
