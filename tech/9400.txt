Canada-based technology firm Pishon Lab has unveiled a new fingerprint-secured padlock called TappLock, and has launched a crowdfunding campaign for the product. It will come in two variants, one with a six-month battery life and another with three-year battery life that would also be able to charge phones. The company claimed that TappLock can be unlocked in just 0.8 seconds.
