Google is set to dispatch a custom-built research van, designed as a mini-version of its laboratories, to find out how people use its online services and react to new features. Starting Monday, the vehicle will take a six-week trip across seven US states, where about 500 walk-up volunteers will be invited for question-answer sessions of up to 90 minutes.
