A US-based startup has developed a $249 pocket-sized power bank named 'Omnicharge Pro', that can charge a laptop and a smartphone at the same time. The 20,400 mAh power bank comes with three outlets including two USB ports and a three-pronged AC/DC outlet. It also has a LED panel that displays the battery's temperature and remaining charging time.
