A Hungary-based startup has created a bicycle bell called 'Shoka Bell' which claims to turn any bicycle into a smart bike. The bell, which also acts as a front light, comes with a theft alert alarm, a 200-hour battery life per charge and an LED display for navigation. It is also capable of adjusting its volume according to the environment.
