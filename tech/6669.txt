US-based startup Petcube has developed a platform that lets pet owners interact with their pets remotely. While 'Petcube Bites' allows users to throw treats at their pets at home via a smartphone app, 'Petcube Play' allows users to exercise their pets using a laser toy that can also be controlled via the app. The products have been launched on Kickstarter.
