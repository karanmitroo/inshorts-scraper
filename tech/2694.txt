Microsoft researchers have installed computer vision system on a â‚¹2,200 Raspberry Pi 3 microcomputer, which can trigger sprinklers on spotting squirrels in a garden. They are now developing ways to add artificial intelligence to pepper-flake-sized Cortex M0 chip. The smallest device that the group will focus on is the Arduino Uno, a single-board computer with only 2 kilobytes of RAM.
