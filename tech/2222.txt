Former Google software engineer James Damore, who was fired this week for writing an anti-diversity memo, has posed for photographs outside the technology giant's headquarters in California. Damore held up a sign that said, "Fired for truth" and wore a t-shirt with an altered logo of Google that read "Goolag" in reference to forced-labour camps in the Soviet Union.
