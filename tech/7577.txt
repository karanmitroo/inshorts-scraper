Neighbours of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are upset over a newly built six-foot wall around his $100 million resort at the Hawaiian island of Kauai. The wall has reportedly blocked the neighbours' view of the ocean. "When we drove along the road we could see the ocean and see through the property, it's closing off that view," said a neighbour.
