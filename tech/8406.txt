UNICEF has created 'Sofia', a 3D animated child using 500 photos of real children from emergency-hit areas to raise awareness about children affected by conflicts across the world. The virtual child was named 'Sofia' as it was reported the world's most popular name last year. The campaign aims to inspire people to become donors to UNICEF as "world parents."
