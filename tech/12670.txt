Google on Monday announced that it had purchased Titan Aerospace, the maker of high-altitude drone satellites, which will be used to take photos of the Earth and to connect people to the Internet. Google's move follows that of Facebook, which recently acquired Ascenta, that makes a similar type of drone. Reportedly, Facebook was earlier in talks to buy Titan Aerospace.
