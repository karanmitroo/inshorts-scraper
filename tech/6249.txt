Delhi High Court on Friday allowed messaging app Whatsapp to enforce its new privacy policy in India but directed it to permanently remove the data of users who delete their WhatsApp account before September 25. Last month, WhatsApp had asked users to accept changes in its terms that would allow it to share user data with Facebook.
