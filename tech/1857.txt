The Virginia State Board of Elections has directed counties to discontinue the use of direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines over the concerns of them being hacked. The touchscreen machines will be replaced with devices that produce a paper trail to audit results. The decision came after the Department of Elections recommended that DRE voting machines be decertified.
