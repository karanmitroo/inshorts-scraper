Google on Wednesday announced the acquisition of Jibe Mobile which will help deploy RCS (Rich Communication Services) for Android. RCS is a new standard for carrier messaging and brings many of the features which users expect from messaging such as group chats, high resolution photos and more. It has also joined hands with operators and device makers for the service.
