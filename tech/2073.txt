Facebook on Monday announced it is adding a dedicated Safety Check feature on its app and website. Safety Check will have its own dedicated button on Facebook's navigation menu. The feature is a disaster response system that lets users inform friends and family of their safety during a crisis and allows them to find help in such situations.
