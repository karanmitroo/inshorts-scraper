US-based company eXclaim has developed thermal sleeves called 'Phoozy' priced at about â‚¹2,000 to protect phones from heating up in the sun. The impact-resistant sleeves, made using a spacesuit-inspired material, reflect 90% of the sun's energy and float on water. The thermal proofing also claims to preserve a phone's battery life in extreme cold or hot conditions.
