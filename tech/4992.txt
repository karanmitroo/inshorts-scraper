Google on Wednesday announced to set up a separate company focused on its self-driving car push called 'Waymo', which derives its name from Google's mission of finding new way forward in mobility. The independent company will work within the Alphabet umbrella, where Google was also moved last year. Google's self-driving car project was started in 2009.
