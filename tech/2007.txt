A California judge dismissed a lawsuit against Apple earlier this week for not having a system on iPhone to block out distracted drivers. The case was filed by Craig Riggs, whose son died in 2013 after being hit by a driver who was texting. A similar lawsuit was filed in 2016 against the technology giant which was also dismissed.
