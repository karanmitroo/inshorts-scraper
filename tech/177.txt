US-based startup PowerUp Toys has launched a $50 updated version of its paper airplane which features a device controlled by a smartphone. The startup also offers folding papers which can be made into different airplanes. Users can connect the device through Bluetooth and control it via app to take flight and tilt the wrist for turns, tilts, or speed boosts.
