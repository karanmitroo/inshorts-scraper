Switzerland-based 22-year-old Jann Horn, who found the Spectre and Meltdown flaws that hit PCs globally, is a security researcher associated with Google's Project Zero team. Horn read Intel manuals and investigated how processors handle speculative execution. Horn realised that the code pattern on which the chips were working might potentially leak secret data, discovering the bugs in the process.
