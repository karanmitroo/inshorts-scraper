South Korean prosecutors have sought a second warrant to arrest Samsung heir Jae-Yong Lee, after questioning him for 15 hours on Monday. Lee has been accused of paying $36.42 million to a friend of impeached President Park Geun-hye for political favours. The first arrest warrant against Lee was rejected by a court due to lack of evidence.
