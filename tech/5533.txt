Business networking service LinkedIn on Wednesday launched 'Salary', a tool that allows users to check the salaries generally being paid in their field of work. For a given job title, the tool details base salary with annual bonus, top-paying companies, and required educational qualifications. The tool also lets users calculate the expected salary based on future work experience.
