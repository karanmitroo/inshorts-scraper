After the interesting '.sexy' and '.events' domains, people will soon be able to buy a '.sucks' domain to criticise a person or brand on the web. After winning the rights from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Momentus has fixed its price at $2,499 per year. The registrations for the domain will start on March-30.
