A biodegradable bottle which disappears as soon as the user finishes its content has been developed by Ari Jónsson, a product design student at the Iceland Academy of the Arts. Jónsson made the biodegradable water bottle out of algae, which shrinks and decomposes once it is emptied. He said that he created the product to replace plastic products.
