A lawsuit has claimed American audio equipment company Bose of spying on the users of its wireless headphones through an app that tracks the music they listen to. Bose violates users' privacy rights by selling their audio information without permission, it added. Audio choices offer "an incredible amount of insight" into a customer's personality, behaviour and religion, the lawsuit said.
