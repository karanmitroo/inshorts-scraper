Microsoft and Facebook have announced the completion of their 6,600 km-undersea internet cable 'Marea' across the Atlantic Ocean earlier this week. It runs from the US state of Virginia to Spain's Bilbao, and can transmit up to 160 terabits of data per second. The cable system will be managed and operated by telecommunications infrastructure company Telxius.
