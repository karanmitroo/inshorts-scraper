Scientists in Ethiopia have discovered jaw and teeth fossils of a previously unknown member of the human family tree dating back to 3.3-3.5 million years. The fossils were found 50 km away from the remains of the famous human ancestor 'Lucy.' The newly-discovered specimen combines ape-like and human-like traits, but is different enough to warrant a separate species name.
