China and US-based researchers have developed an electronic skin, which when cut into two can heal itself by recreating chemical bonds between the two sides. If broken beyond repair, it can be soaked in a solution that "liquefies" it for recycling the materials to make new e-skin. The film, equipped with sensors, can measure pressure, temperature, humidity, and air flow.
