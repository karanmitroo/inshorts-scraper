Russia recently announced that in 2018 it will test a nuclear engine that could help cosmonauts reach Mars in six weeks, as compared to the 18 months a spacecraft currently needs to travel to Mars. The $274 million project uses nuclear propulsion rockets that weighs around half as much as a chemical rocket without reducing the thrust.
