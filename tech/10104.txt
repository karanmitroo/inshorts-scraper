Less than six months after the launch of Apple Music, the company has announced to shut down Beats Music, a live-streaming music service that was acquired in 2015 for $3 billion. All Beats Music subscriptions will be cancelled on November 30. Notably, Apple Music, that charges $10 per month, incorporates many of Beatsâ€™ features.
