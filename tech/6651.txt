British luxury car manufacturer Aston Martin's CEO Andy Palmer in an interview said, "We will not lead in self-driving technology. Astons are to be driven." He added, "We concentrate on only technology we think that is useful to drivers such as automatic parking and around-view monitors." Palmer added that he is excited about self-driving technology's potential to enhance driving experience.
