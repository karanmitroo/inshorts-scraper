Google-owned video hub YouTube has rolled out a new feature that lets smartphone users double-tap on the left or right side of the screen to fast forward or rewind any video by 10 seconds. The functionality works only in full-screen mode and is available in the latest version of the YouTube app for both iOS and Android.
