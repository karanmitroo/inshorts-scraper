Four engineers from Bengaluru have built 'Sparsh', a device for the blind and visually impaired for easy access to the internet. The device converts online texts into Braille in real time and reads them out to the user. A unique feature of the device is that it allows users to scroll through text at their own speed, the engineers said.
