Jani, a 10-year old boy from Helsinki, has received $10,000 from Facebook for identifying a security bug in Facebook-owned Instagram. Jani discovered a flaw that allowed him to delete any written content on the social media platform by altering the code. This makes him the youngest person to be paid through Facebookâ€™s bug bounty program, till date.
