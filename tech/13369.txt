Google with $241-billion 'enterprise value', surpassed Apple at $233-billion (on deducting Apple's $145-billion and Google's $45-billion in cash) last week to become the world's most valuable technology company, The Wall Street Journal reported.  However, in terms of the more commonly used "market capitalization", Apple($378.5-billion) is still worth $100-billion more than Google($278.4-billion), and is only behind the oil major ExxonMobil($396.2-billion).
