Hyperloop Transportation Technologies on Tuesday announced that it will use a new sensor-embedded carbon fiber for its capsules, which are capable of achieving speeds up to 1,223 kmph. The company is calling the material "Vibranium" and claimed that it's "eight times stronger and weighs about five times less than aluminum". Notably, Marvel character Captain America's shield was made of Vibranium.
