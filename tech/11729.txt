Physicists in the University of Lethbridge in Canada have explained in their paper (published in Physics Letters B) that the Big Bang never happened and that there was no formal start to the universe. The team of physicists, including one Indian, applied quantum correction terms to Einstein's theory of general relativity to explain that the universe never expanded or shrunk.
