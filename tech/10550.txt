Google has launched its Street View application—that enables users to get a 360-degree, street-level view of roads—as a standalone platform in both Android and iOS. Users will now be able to upload their photo spheres (360-degree panoramas) to the app, while separately exploring Google Maps’ standard content. Notably, Street View is replacing iPhone’s Photo Sphere Camera application.
