A British man has created a messaging app called 'ReplyASAP' that forces kids to respond to their parents' calls and texts. The app takes over the recipient's phone screen and keeps ringing an alarm until it is answered. The kids can either snooze the alarm or cancel it, and the parents will be sent a notification in either case.
