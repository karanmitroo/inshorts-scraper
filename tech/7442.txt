Researchers at the New York University, in collaboration with the MIT and Northeastern University, have developed a new technique called LAVA that could help in testing and improving the quality of existing source code bug-finders. In this technique, the team would add known quantities of controlled vulnerabilities in a source code to test the limits of the existing bug-finding tools.
