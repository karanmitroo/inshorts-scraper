British airline carrier Virgin Atlantic is testing Google Glass at London's Heathrow airport to deliver a high-tech and personalised customer service (like faster check-in) to its upper class passengers. The innovative pilot scheme was launched 2 months ago. Google Glass, a wearable computer, displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format, with the wearers communicating with Internet via voice commands.
