A US-based startup has created a wearable fitness tracker 'AniFit' for dogs, that tracks the calories, weight and diet. Controlled through a dedicated Android or iOS app, the tracker is tied to the dog's collar. It lets owners set calories loss and weight goals for their dogs. The app also lets the owner maintain a photo-record of the dog's progress.
