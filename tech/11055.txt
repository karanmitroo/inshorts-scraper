Adding fun and innovation to the banking services, a British technology firm has launched the worldâ€™s first emoji passcode. It will allow people to log into their banks using four emoji characters, instead of traditional PINs. The company claimed that its Emoji Passcode is more secure because there are more potential combinations of the 44 emojis than the numbers 0-9.
