Singapore-based researchers are testing self-driving scooters to curb accidents involving pedestrians who are on their phones. The one-seater weighs 50 kg and travels at a top speed of 6 kmph. The scooters move along a predefined route on footpaths and make use of laser sensors to navigate around obstacles and avoid collisions.
