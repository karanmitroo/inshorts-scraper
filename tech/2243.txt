Former Google engineer James Damore, who was fired for writing an anti-diversity memo, has said that he feels Google "betrayed" him. Damore claims he shared the 10-page memo a month ago, but it was "only after it got viral that upper management started shaming" him. "It would be career suicide for any executives or directors to support me," he added.
