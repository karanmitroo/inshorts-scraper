Japanese electronics maker Panasonic has created a smart shopping system that automatically tallies and puts the items in a bag while the customer pays the bill. The system  includes special baskets with slidable bottoms that allow picked items to fall into a bag placed underneath. The setup is already in use at a convenience store near Panasonic's Japan headquarters.
