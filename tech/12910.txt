Japanese lingerie brand Ravijour's has launched 'true love bra', a bra that unhooks itself but only when the wearer is experiencing ‘true love’. The innerwear is equipped with a heart-rate monitor that is synced with a smartphone app, which reads the wearer's pulse, and then automatically unclasps itself when the wearer's heartbeat reaches what is called the 'True Love Rate'.
