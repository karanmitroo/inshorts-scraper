Researchers in Brazil have developed a technology that can read mind to identify the song a person is listening to. It uses a magnetic resonance imaging machine to find out from the brain activity of research volunteers what music was in their minds. The experiment was conducted on six participants who listened to excerpts from 40 songs of various styles.
