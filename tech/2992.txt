Android Co-founder Andy Rubin's startup Essential has reportedly raised $300 million (nearly â‚¹2,000 crore) at a $1 billion valuation, according to private share trading firm Equidate. The investment paperwork was filed few days before Essential unveiled its first smartphone. Equidate's analysis also shows that Rubin's tech incubator Playground Global has considerable voting rights in Essential.
