Saudi Arabia has blocked Facebook’s Messenger service in the country to reportedly protect the revenues of traditional telecom companies. However, an official said, “The service had been banned because it failed to comply with regulations”. Internet calling over WhatsApp and Viber were already blocked in Saudi Arabia but similar apps including Tango and Line are still available in the country.
