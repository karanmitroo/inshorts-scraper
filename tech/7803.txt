Apple on Wednesday announced a new revenue sharing model for app developers wherein the developers will get 85% of the revenue, up from 70%. However, the increase will come in place once a subscriber completes the first year. Google is also reportedly working on a similar model, where developers will get 85% of the revenue right from the first year.
