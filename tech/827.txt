The European Union's highest court has ruled that ride-hailing app Uber is a taxi company and should be regulated as such when drivers arenâ€™t professionals and they're using their own vehicles. Uber argued it was a technology platform helping people make contact with each other. After the ruling, Uber claimed most of its products are already covered by such regulations.
