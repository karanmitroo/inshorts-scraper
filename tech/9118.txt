On the occasion of Valentineâ€™s Day, Facebook Messenger has rolled out a new feature through which users can send gift-wrapped messages. Users have to click on a little heart icon on the app which gift-wraps a message once it is sent. The receiver has to tap on the message to unwrap it. Users can similarly gift-wrap other elements like GIFs.
