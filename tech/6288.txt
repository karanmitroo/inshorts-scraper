Electric car manufacturer Tesla has revealed that the company faces four lawsuits filed by its  shareholders opposing Tesla's $2.6 billion acquisition of solar energy company SolarCity. The lawsuits allege that Tesla and SolarCity board members, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, breached their legal duties as they own shares in both the companies. Tesla said that the actions are "without merit".
