Japan-based startup Borderless has created a  ₹1,15,000 smart helmet with an inbuilt rearview camera to give users a 360° visibility while riding a motorbike. The helmet which connects to an app also allows users to send information like navigation, time, and distance to the destination, from their smartphone. The information is then displayed on a head-up screen of the helmet.
