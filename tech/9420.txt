According to a report by online magazine Motherboard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) last year hacked into a child pornography site on the Dark Web to identify paedophiles around the World. For 13 days the site's content was available for distribution, which was later used to track IP addresses of more than 1,300 people who logged into that site.
