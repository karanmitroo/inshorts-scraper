Video game company Nintendo on Thursday launched its first smartphone game, Miitomo, in Japan. The social mobile game lets players build their own cartoon avatars, called Mii, that develop personalities by asking users several questions and then go on to independently interact with their friends' Miis. Miitomo is first ofÂ the five mobile apps Nintendo hopes to release by 2017.
