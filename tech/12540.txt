Just after two months of its launch in India, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has fallen by 30%; the phone which was priced at Rs 51,500 at launch is now available for Rs 36,125 at Flipkart. The possible reason for this could be that many people donâ€™t see the S5 to have anything significantly better than the S4, available at 29,500.
