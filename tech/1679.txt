Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram used a photo that read, "I Will Rape You" to advertise itself on Facebook. Reporter Olivia Solon discovered that a photo she had posted of a rape threat email was turned into an advertisement using Instagram's social media algorithms. Instagram later apologised and claimed that the image was not used in a "paid promotion".
