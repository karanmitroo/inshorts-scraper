Nokia has sued rival Apple alleging that the latter's products have infringed 32 of its phone patents covering technologies like display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets and video coding. Apple declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license its patented inventions in its products, Nokia said. Notably, Nokia earlier announced it will come back in the smartphone market in 2017.
