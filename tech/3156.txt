Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp has launched a feature to let Android users pin three chats at the top of their conversation list. The feature is intended to make it easier for users to access their preferred chats without having to scroll and look for them. Users can pin chats by long pressing on them and then tapping the pin icon.
