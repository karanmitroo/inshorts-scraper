A man's LG smartphone reportedly caught fire in his trousers while he was shopping in Seattle, US. The store manager said that the fire was put out using a fire extinguisher, but the phone was reduced to ashes and left a burn mark on the floor. The man was also provided with a new pair of pants, added the manager.
