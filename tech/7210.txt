Moscow authorities have said they are updating an existing app to work like Pokémon Go, so that users can hunt for historic figures and "catch" them by taking selfies with their 3-D representations. Called 'Discover Moscow Photo', the full app will be available by the end of August. Notably, Pokémon Go is not available in Russia at the moment.
