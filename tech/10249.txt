NASA on Monday launched a new website where it will post a minimum of 12 images every day of the Earth as it rotates, thus showing the entire globe in the span of a single day. The colour images, which will be of the sunlit side of the Earth, will be taken by NASAâ€™s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC).
