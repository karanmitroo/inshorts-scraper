The Delhi High Court has allowed the use of the social media platform WhatsApp and email in judicial proceedings to issue summons. Recently, the Bombay High Court had served summons through WhatsApp. The court ruled this while hearing a case filed by Tata Sons alleging that unidentified email IDs were used to circulate 'defamatory allegations' against one of its officials.
