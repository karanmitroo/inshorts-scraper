Alphabet CEO Larry Page used a hidden link to Hooli.xyz, a Google-like company from HBO TV series ‘Silicon valley,’ in his letter announcing the reorganisation of Google. Hooli XYZ is a moonshot division in the series and the link was buried under text relating to Alphabet's moonshot division, X Lab. Ironically, using hidden links is against Google's Terms of Service.
