Apple has increased the prices of iPhone models in India due to an increase in custom duty on mobile phones in the Union Budget. The iPhone X 64 GB model is now priced at ₹95,390, while iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will cost ₹67,940 and ₹77,560 respectively. However, the price of iPhone SE, which is manufactured locally, will remain unchanged.
