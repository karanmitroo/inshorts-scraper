US-based startup REM-Fit has created a smart pillow named 'Zeeq' that comes with in-built speakers to let users stream music through their smartphones. While the users are asleep, the pillow tracks their motion and the volume of snoring to indicate the overall quality of their sleep. Further, a motor fitted inside the pillow vibrates to stop the users from snoring.
