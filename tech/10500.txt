The fourth generation Apple TV, integrated with App Store and voice-controlled remote control, was unveiled on Wednesday by Apple CEO Tim Cook at the 'Hey Siri' event. The remote has a touchpad and motion control backed by an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The TV runs on App Store and will allow developers create new software for it, including video games.
