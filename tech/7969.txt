Chinese electronics manufacturer and iPhone maker Foxconn has reportedly replaced 60,000 staff at its Kunshan factory in China with robots. The company said that it is applying robotics engineering and other manufacturing technologies to replace the repetitive tasks previously done by employees. Since September 2014, around 505 factories across China have invested over $640 million in robots.
