Google's instant messaging app and WhatsApp rival, Allo has started supporting Hindi language on both the Android and iOS devices. To start talking one-on-one with Google's voice assistant in Hindi, a user can say 'Talk to me in Hindi' or change language preference settings. The app's 'Smart Reply' feature that suggests answers between a chat, is also available in Hindi.
