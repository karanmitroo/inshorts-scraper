BlackBerry has launched a BBM update allowing unlimited access to Retract and Timer, formerly a part of BBM subscription. With Retract, users can retract messages and pictures from recipients in case they were mistakenly sent, or were to be made inaccessible. Also, users can set a timer to control how long contacts can view messages and pictures.
