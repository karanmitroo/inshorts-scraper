According to the Association of American Publishers, sales of e-books went about 10% down in the first five months of 2015. This is reportedly owed to the fact that most people are “hybrid readers,” utilizing both print and electronic mediums. Also, research firm Forrester says that 20 million less e-reading devices were sold last year as compared to 2011.
