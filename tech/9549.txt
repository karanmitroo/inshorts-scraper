Indian tablet and mobile maker Lava on Wednesday partnered with ShopInSync, an Android app that lets users compare deals on online shopping websites. Under the partnership, Lavaâ€™s all 10 upcoming 4G smartphones will be preloaded with the ShopInSync app. Launched last November, ShopInSync sends users price comparisons and allows them to share products through an integrated messaging service.
