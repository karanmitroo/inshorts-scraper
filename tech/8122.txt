Responding to claims that trending topics on Facebook suppress stories with conservative viewpoints, CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said that the company is “conducting a full investigation” of the matter. He said, “We…do not permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or...suppression of political perspectives.” He added that no evidence of the reports being true has been found yet.
