University of Michigan Children's Hospital doctors have successfully used a 3D printer to make a complex medical decision regarding a baby's delivery. The baby's walnut sized lump on the face which could block his breathing, was mapped using a 3D printer. The information gained helped the doctors in deciding if the baby required a complex procedure or a caesarian section.
