YouTube will remain blocked in Pakistan 'indefinitely', as experts have failed to come up with a solution for filtering objectionable or 'blasphemous' material in the country, said an official. The video-sharing website was blocked in Pakistan in Sept 2012 after its hosting of the controversial film "Innocence of Muslims" sparked furious protests in the Islamic nation.
