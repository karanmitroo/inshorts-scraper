To commemorate the company's 40th anniversary, Apple hoisted a special pirate flag outside of its campus in Cupertino, California, on April 1. The flag, which was originally hoisted by the first-generation Mac team in 1983, was a reference to a quote by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, "It's better to be a pirate than join the navy".
