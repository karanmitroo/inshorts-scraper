Following a limited period (one day) launch on Apr-15, Google has now made the ‘Glass’ available for purchase to everyone. For interested buyers, an Explorer Version of Glass will still cost $1,500. It should be noted that the Explorer Version still hints at a beta-esque quality, meaning the product is still very much in development.
