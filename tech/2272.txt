Sixteen-year-old Indian-origin student Kavya Kopparapu with her team has developed an AI system to recognise signs of a diabetic complication that damages blood vessels in the eye. The AI, trained with 34,000 retinal scans, can identify diabetic retinopathy and offers preliminary diagnosis. Kavya developed the system as her India-based grandfather's vision deteriorated due to delay in diagnosis.
