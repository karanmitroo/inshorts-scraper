Microsoft on Thursday said that the company is laying off 2,850 of its employees worldwide in the fiscal year 2017. The lay-offs are an addition to the 1,850 job cuts in the smartphone hardware business and sales announced earlier in May this year. Microsoft has written off most of the value of its Nokia's handset business purchased in 2014.
