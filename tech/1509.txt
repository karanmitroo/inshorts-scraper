Dubai International Airport has introduced virtual aquariums lined with facial recognition cameras at the security checkpoints. The virtual aquarium is reportedly tunnel-shaped and contains 80 cameras to scan faces and irises as passengers walk through. Once passengers reach the end, they'll either be cleared with "have a nice trip" message or a red sign will be displayed to alert security.
