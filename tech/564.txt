Using crawling robots, a Purdue University study has found that babies inhale dust and airborne impurities four times (per kilogram of body mass) what an adult would breathe walking across the same floor. The crawling motion kicks up high levels of dirt, skin cells, bacteria, pollen, and fungal spores, which act to stimulate and challenge their immune system, said researchers.
