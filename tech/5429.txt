A recently-filed patent by Samsung shows illustrations for a device with a bendable screen, a week after Apple was granted a patent for foldable iPhones. The patent states that the device will have a secondary display that will activate when the device is folded, like in flip phones. Samsung is rumoured to release two smartphones with bendable screens in 2017.
