Amsterdam will test self-driving boats in the city's canals in a five-year pilot program starting next year. Besides carrying people and goods, the self-driving boat fleet will also track environmental conditions and comb the canals for waste. Floating stages or bridges that can be assembled and disassembled in hours, will also be introduced in the city.
