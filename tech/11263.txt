Amazon India and Snapdeal declared that they wouldn't be following Flipkart into an app-only format. "We do not want to force our customers to use one specific medium to shop on Snapdeal," a Snapdeal spokesperson said. Myntra had closed down its website on Friday to move to a mobile-only platform, while Flipkart aims to do the same within a year.
