An Allahabad court on Tuesday reportedly served a notice to Google for listing, in a search result, Prime Minister Narendra Modi among the top 10 criminals in the world. According to Times of India, the court also ordered registration of a criminal complaint against Google and its top officials. However, Google had apologised for the search result in June 2015.
