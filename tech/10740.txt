NASA engineers are reportedly developing drones that can fly to Mars, asteroids and the Moon to access areas that rovers cannot. Designed for the thin atmosphere of outer space, they would use a lander as base to replenish batteries and propellants. “Some crater walls are angled 30 degrees, and that’s too steep for a rover to navigate,” a technologist said.
