In its first-ever historic inter-planetary travel, India on Tuesday successfully launched its mission to Mars from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. The PSLV launch vehicle carrying a 1,350-kg unmanned probe --the 'Mangalyaan' Orbiter-- built at a cost of Rs.450 crore, is a bid to reach the Red Planet in Sept-2014 and study its atmosphere.
