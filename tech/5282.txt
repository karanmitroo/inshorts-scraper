An Italian startup has created a â‚¹20,000 drone called 'AirSelfie' which fits inside the mobile cover that comes along with it. Integrated with a camera, the drone allows taking aerial photos and selfies directly from the phone using a dedicated app. On putting the drone back into the cover, it gets charged again within 30 minutes.
