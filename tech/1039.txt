US-based software developer Shantini Vyas has developed an app called Pawsy which lets users find and connect their pet dogs with nearby dogs. The app connects pets based on a number of questions related to their personality, size, and style. Pawsy allows users to view other dog profiles on the platform and includes 'add friends' feature.
