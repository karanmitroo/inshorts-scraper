Two Paris-based youth Sarah Marga and Yoann Lopez have made an online platform 'Happenstance', that lets users meet random new people around the world through exchange of e-mails. Happenstance users need to fill a 10-question form about their likes and interests. Based on this information, the platform every month connects users to a person from anywhere in the world.
