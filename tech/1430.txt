Technology giant Apple has been ordered by a US court to pay $440 million to the patent-holding firm VirnetX for four patented technologies allegedly used in FaceTime and other iOS apps. However, the iPhone maker plans to appeal this judgement, according to an Apple spokesperson. VirnetX first filed suit against Apple in 2010, winning $368 million two years later.
