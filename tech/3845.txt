Israel-based startup ESTI has created 'Eye', a smartphone case which adds a 5-inch screen to the back of iPhones. The case, which runs Android Nougat, also has 2,800 mAh battery, 16 GB storage, dual SIM slots, and a headphone jack. 'Eye' will use the iPhone's mic, camera and ear speaker, but can otherwise function as a separate device.
