Users of Google's voicemail service 'Voice' that allows to send free text messages on Friday complained of trouble in receiving text messages. The users claimed that while SMSes could be sent from their accounts, their responses were not being received. Although Google's community manager said the issue "should now be resolved for all users," people are still reporting the same.
