Japan-based scientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system which they claim can detect colorectal cancer in less than a second. The diagnostic uses a 500-fold magnified view to detect abnormal tissue growth in the area. Trained using over 30,000 images, the AI assessed 306 cases in real-time, providing a 94% sensitivity, 79% specificity, and 86% accuracy, said researchers.
