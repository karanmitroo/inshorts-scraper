Twitter's Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey in a recent interview said it is important that leaders like US President Donald Trump continue to tweet. "I believe it's really important to hear directly from our leadership," said Dorsey. "And I believe it's really important to have these conversations out in the open, rather than have them behind closed doors," he added.
