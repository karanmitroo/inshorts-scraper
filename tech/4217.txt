Technology major Google has been ordered to pay $20 million (â‚¹133.6 crore) in damages for infringing three anti-malware patents in Chrome. The lawsuit, which had originally been filed in 2013, was initially dismissed by a district court. The case was reportedly centred around the phrase "web browser process", which Google claimed wasn't a good enough description of Chrome's anti-malware features.
