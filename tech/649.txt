Cybersecurity expert John McAfee on Monday revealed that he met his wife as a prostitute five years back. In a tweet, he said it "always seemed fair" to him to pay for prostitutes and that he would not have met his wife otherwise. He had earlier tweeted that he paid for prostitutes, drugs, and pornography using cryptocurrencies whenever possible.
