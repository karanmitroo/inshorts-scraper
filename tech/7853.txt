According to reports, interrogations of captured Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives have revealed that terrorists have been communicating with their handlers in Pakistan using a modified 'Calculator' app to avoid the Army's surveillance. The app reportedly used 'cognitive digital radio' networks to exchange messages and GPS locations on offline maps without access to mobile phone signals or WiFi.
