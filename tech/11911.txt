A group of International researchers has designed the world's smallest hearing aid, Nanoplug,  with a size of just 7.1mm x 5.7mm x 4.17mm - almost half the size of any other hearing aid. The device can be programmed using software running on a computer, the results of which can be downloaded directly to the device via a cable.
