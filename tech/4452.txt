After Elon Musk supported US President Donald Trump's State Secretary pick Rex Tillerson, a Twitter user asked Musk, "Can you please send him on a one-way trip to Mars?" Another said, "We're kind of depending on you to save the world." "Please hurry with Space X. I gotta get off this planet before Trump kills it," tweeted another.
