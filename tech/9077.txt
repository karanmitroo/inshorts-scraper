Twitter has introduced two business-centric tools to help companies better interact with customers. Businesses can now add a deep link to their tweets through which customers can send them a direct message. Also, the customer feedbackÂ feature lets people privately share opinions with businesses. Kotak Mahindra Bank and Reliance Communications are the first Indian companies to use this feature.
