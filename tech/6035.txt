Hacker group OurMine on Wednesday hacked American media website BuzzFeed after it published a story claiming to have identified one of the members of the group. "Hacked by OurMine team, don’t share fake news about us again, we have your database. Next time it will be public. Don’t f*** with OurMine again," the group posted on BuzzFeed.
