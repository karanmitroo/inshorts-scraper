The codename for the original iPhone development project was 'Purple', according to technology giant Apple's former executive Scott Forstall. The team booked an entire floor at Apple's Cupertino office which was named the 'Purple Dorm' to work on the iPhone. The first iPhone was unveiled by late Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007.
