Arizona-based innovator Spencer Trotter has developed 'Anywhere Fridge', a solar-powered fridge and freezer with a cooling range from minus 15°C to 10°C. The fridge has an integrated battery which powers it even on cloudy days and allows phone charging. Besides outdoor hangouts, it can be used for grocery shopping of cold items and to keep vaccines cool during natural disasters.
