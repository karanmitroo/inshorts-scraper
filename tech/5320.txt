Elon Musk-led aerospace startup SpaceX has filed an application with the US Federal Communications Commission, seeking permission to launch 4,425 satellites to provide high-speed, global internet coverage. There are less than 1,500 active satellites in orbit around the Earth presently. The project, which Musk previously said would cost at least $10 billion, was first announced in January 2015.
