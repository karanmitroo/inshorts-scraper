Open-source software community Mozilla, on Wednesday released a new update to its desktop browser Firefox. The update enables websites to send push notifications, without keeping tabs of the websites open. Initially, each website will have to ask for permissions to show push notifications. The feature aims to ease speed-related issues that arise when multiple tabs are opened in the browser.
