Amazon has unveiled a technology to run a grocery store where customers can enter by scanning their phones and leave without paying for the items. Called 'Amazon Go', the store will be able to detect the items picked and charge the customers accordingly through a dedicated app. The first such store will be launched in Washington in early 2017.
