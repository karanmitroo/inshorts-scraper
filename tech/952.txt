Russia's Finance Ministry has proposed to criminalise cryptocurrency mining in the country's attempt to regulate the virtual currencies. "If someone created the cryptocurrency for the purpose of settlements, then there will be a criminal punishment," the Finance Ministry said in a statement. However, buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would be legal, officials added.
