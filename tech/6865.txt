Wikiverse is an interactive website that casts 250,000 Wikipedia pages as floating points of light in a 3D universe, clustering 'stars' on the same topic together. Users can trace millions of links and paths between art, science, history, and other major topics. Wikiverse Creator Owen Cornec said, "In this universe, articles are threaded together...where proximity equates to related-ness."
