Authorities have revealed that two Ohio prisoners built computers from PCs that were supposed to be dismantled for recycling and then hid them in the ceiling. The inmates used a prison employee's credentials to access the internet and were caught after they exceeded the daily network usage limit. The incident, which occurred in 2015, has been made public recently.
