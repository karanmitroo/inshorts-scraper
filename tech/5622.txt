South Korean electronics major Samsung posted a 96% plunge in third-quarter mobile earnings to $88 million compared to the year-ago period. This marks the lowest quarterly earnings of the company's mobile division in nearly 8 years. The smartphone maker attributed the dip in earnings to its discontinued flagship Galaxy Note 7 which was recalled globally over battery explosions.
