A worker sued Google claiming that the company did not pay him overtime, improperly classified him as an independent contractor then terminated him after he asked for more hours to be covered under his contract. The case, filed in a New York federal court on Wednesday, seeks to proceed as a collective action on behalf of other Google Inc workers.
