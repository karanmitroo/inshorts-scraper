Google on Wednesday rolled out the pilot program of its 'Hands Free' application in the US, that features hands-free mobile payment. It uses location-based services to check whether a customer is in a store equipped for hands-free payments, and passes the information to the point-of-sale system. The customer then needs to provide the initials for cross-checking against the Google profile.
