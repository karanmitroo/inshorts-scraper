Swedish contraception app Natural Cycles, which calculates fertility during a month, has been reported to the country's medical regulator after many of its users became pregnant. The complaint was lodged by a Stockholm hospital after performing abortions on 37 users in four months last year. The app claimed to track users' menstrual cycles to predict 'safe' days for unprotected sex.
