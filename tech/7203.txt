Technology firm Qualcomm on Tuesday agreed to pay $19.5 million to settle a gender discrimination suit filed on behalf of nearly 3,300 women. According to the lawsuit, women working in research and engineering are paid less than their male counterparts, and are promoted less often. Qualcomm will hire consultants to set diversity policies and ensure their enforcement through compliance officers.
