Facebook has started testing 'Express Wi-Fi', a new model for public Wi-Fi to provide the internet access in rural areas. Facebook is working with carriers, internet service providers and local entrepreneurs to expand the connectivity. The service empowers local entrepreneurs to make a steady income by providing internet access to their neighbours.
