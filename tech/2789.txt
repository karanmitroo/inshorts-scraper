An Italian company named BlueSpin has created a â‚¹3,150 Bluetooth-enabled fidget spinner toy that records a user's spinning skills with touch sensitive buttons on each side, and an accelerometer that tracks motion. The data collected is available on a dedicated app. Users can also compete in spinning tricks and skills with people who own the same fidget spinner.
