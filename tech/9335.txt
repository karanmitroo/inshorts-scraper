A US startup has developed a fruit-flavoured cup 'The Right Cup' that tricks the user's brain to think that the plain water is flavoured. The Right Cupâ€™s natural fruit aroma combined with a patented sweet taste technology, gives the brain a perception that the user is drinking fruit-flavoured water. It is available in five flavours including orange, apple and peach.
