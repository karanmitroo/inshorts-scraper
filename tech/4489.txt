China's ZTE has admitted it made a mistake by using mid-range specifications on the 'Hawkeye' smartphone concept that won its crowdsourced design contest. The phone, which has a self-adhesive back and eye-tracking technology, uses an old Snapdragon processor and offers only 3 GB RAM. ZTE's concept failed to raise even 10% of its goal of about â‚¹3.4 crore on Kickstarter.
