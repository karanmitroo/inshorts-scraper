Adult website Pornhub on April 1 pranked users with a video sharing feature that led people to believe their activity has been shared on Facebook and Twitter automatically. The pop-up appeared when users clicked on a video, thanking them for sharing their videos on their social media accounts. However, Pornhub then informed users of the website's encrypted HTTPS protocol.
