French spyware firm Fireworld has been slammed for claiming that its software could help parents determine whether their children are gay. By installing the software, parents could take screenshots, control their child's PC remotely, view real-time activity and even log keystrokes. Fireworld also claimed that a boy might be gay if he was more interested in theatre than football.
