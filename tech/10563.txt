Peter Chou, co-founder of Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC, has taken up another job in a Hong Kong-based visual effects company Digital Domain Holdings as executive director and member of the executive committee. He has reportedly done this to reassert HTCâ€™s focus on the virtual reality market, what with its recent push in the industry with VR headset Vive.
