Berlin-based Israeli graffiti artist Shahak Shapira sprayed the pavement in front of Twitter's office in Hamburg, Germany with 30 racist tweets he encountered on the website. According to the artist, he received only nine responses to 300 hate tweets he reported to the company. However, he said Facebook deleted 80% of the hate comments reported by him.
