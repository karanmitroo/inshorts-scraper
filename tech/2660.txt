Australia-based researchers have discovered the three extra eyes on bees' heads contain receptors perfectly tuned for sensing ambient light's colours. These eyes provide true colour perception as the two compound eyes infer colours based on surroundings, like cameras. This colour constancy could help improve camera technology, as commercial cameras process colours with respect to a greyscale.
