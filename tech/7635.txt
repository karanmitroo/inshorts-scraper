New York-based startup Uncharted Play has developed 'Soccket', a soccer ball that can charge devices. The ball's mechanism captures human movement and transforms it into electrical charge. Once the ball is charged, users can plug their devices into the ball through a USB adapter. A 30-minute play with the ball can power an LED lamp for three hours.
