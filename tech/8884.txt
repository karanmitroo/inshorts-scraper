French startup Rhythm on Thursday launched a smart $350 headband 'Dreem', which enhances the sleep quality of the user. It recognises the user's sleep pattern by measuring brain waves and stimulates 'ocean-like' sound to keep the user in deep sleep for an extended period. The device also records and analyses user's sleep patterns on a dedicated Android or iOS app.
