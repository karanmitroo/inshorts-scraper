Japanese startup AgIC has developed a pen called 'Circuit Marker' which uses a silver quick drying ink that conducts electricity. The pen allows users to draw electric circuits that can withstand up to 100 volts and power LEDs and motors. Priced at $14.99, the Circuit Marker is to be used on a special electronics-embedded paper which costs $37.49.
