German carmaker BMW has revealed an elevated road concept called Vision E3 Way for electrically powered two-wheel vehicles. The elevated roads will be constructed  above existing roads and will have an elaborate system to separate flowing and filtering traffic, as per the concept. An automatic speed limit of 25 kmph will reduce the risk of accidents, BMW said.
