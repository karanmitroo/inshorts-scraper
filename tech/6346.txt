A California-based startup, Pulpstream aims to get rid of paper-based forms at businesses, replacing them with mobile-based digital processes. The forms can be customised to a variety of businesses, and can be created by employees themselves , requiring no programming expertise to build. According to CEO Pankaj Malviya, this will enable professionals in the field to efficiently collect data.
