Facebook has launched Messenger Codes, a series of dots and dashes circling a profile picture that can be scanned to directly start chatting with someone on Messenger. The feature is similar to Snapchatâ€™s Snapcodes. Facebook has also launched Messenger Links, short profile URLs located at m.me/[username]. Typing in a friend's Facebook username after m.me/ will lead to his Messenger profile.
