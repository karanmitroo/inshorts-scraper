Facebook has showcased laser-based wireless communication system that can deliver speeds up to 2 Gbps. It uses fluorescent materials instead of traditional optics to collect light and concentrate it onto small photodetectors. Since the fibers don't emit the same color they're absorbing, brighter light can be aimed at the detectors. This can help in providing wireless connectivity to remote areas.
