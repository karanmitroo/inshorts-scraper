Finnish video game developer Rovio Wednesday confirmed that hackers had defaced its Angry Birds site with an image that read "Spying Birds" and which sported an NSA logo. However, the company said that the defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately. The hacking occurred after revelations that America's NSA has been targeting the site's "leaky" user data.
