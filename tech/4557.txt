Hacker group Anonymous has reportedly threatened to expose US President-elect Donald Trump's ties to Russian mobsters and warned that he will "regret the next four years." The group tweeted, "You have financial and personal ties with Russian mobsters, child traffickers, and money launderers... This isn't the 80's any longer, information doesn't vanish, it is all out there."
