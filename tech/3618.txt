Russian lawmakers have drafted a bill to bar children under 14 from using social media networks, according to reports. As per the draft, social network platforms will have to register new users only after they provide their passport data. Platforms violating this rule could be fined between 100,000 to 300,000 rubles (around â‚¹1.15-3.45 lakh).
