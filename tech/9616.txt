Former computer programmer Wes Cherry said that he made Microsoft's Solitaire game when he was working as an intern in 1988 and was never paid for it. Microsoft only gave him an 'IBM XT' computer to fix bugs during the school year, he said. He claimed he made the game for Windows after playing a similar game on a Mac.
