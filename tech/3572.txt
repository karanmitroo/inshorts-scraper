Social media platform Twitter on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the US government to block an order that required it to reveal who is running an account opposed to US President Donald Trump's immigration policies. The account, @ALT_uscis is claimed to be the work of a government employee. Twitter cited freedom of speech for not turning over the account's records.
