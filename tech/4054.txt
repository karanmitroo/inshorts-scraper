Former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski has been accused in Google parent Alphabet's lawsuit against Uber for theft of technology. Alphabet's self-driving car firm Waymo has claimed Levandowski took incredibly valuable intellectual property from Alphabet before he quit the firm. Levandowski quit in 2016 to start a new self-driving startup called Otto Trucking, which was bought by Uber.
