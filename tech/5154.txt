Some new Adidas stores will offer 'Run Genie' technology to help analyse runners' walks using wearable sensors that clip onto the shoelaces. The system takes about 40 steps per foot to collect information and determines whether a runner puts more weight on the inside of the feet or outside. It then recommends appropriate footwear to help correct those issues.
