The Felt app is holding a vote to send lumps of coal to the 'naughtiest person of 2017'. Users can add anyone, from public figures to acquaintances, to the Felt naughty list and the person with the most votes will receive a lump of coal for each vote cast. US President Donald Trump is currently leading the list.
