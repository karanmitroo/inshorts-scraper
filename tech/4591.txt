Hackers have stolen 900 GB data from mobile hacking agency Cellebrite, which reportedly helped the FBI hack an iPhone involved in the San Bernardino attack after Apple refused. Cellebrite's device can be plugged into smartphones to steal data like text messages and call logs. The Israeli firm is also reportedly supplying technology to governments in Russia, UAE and Turkey.
