Electronics giant Panasonic's President Kazuhiro Tsuga has sent an email to the company's 1 lakh employees in Japan, asking them to leave office by 8 pm. The regulation also applies to Panasonic's executive posts, but does not affect the Board of Directors. Panasonic was one of the first companies to prohibit the 6-day working week amidst the Japanese economic boom.
