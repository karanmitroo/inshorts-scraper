Chinese smartphone maker Huawei made users write fake reviews for its Mate 10 Pro smartphone, which is yet to go on sale. Through a Facebook group, the company reportedly offered people to "beta test" the phone in exchange for five-star ratings. Some of the reviews included "unbeatable smart phone of the year", and a device that "puts Samsung to shame."
