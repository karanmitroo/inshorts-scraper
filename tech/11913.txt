A research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has created a 4D printing technique, that makes 3D objects that can change shape. The technique involves using 2 materials with different properties; one stays rigid and the other is water-absorbent. The applications can include cardiac stents, childcare products, clothing and footwear, and improving functionality of products.
