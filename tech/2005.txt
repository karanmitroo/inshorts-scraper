New York Police Department (NYPD) has decided to replace its 36,000 Windows phones for officials with iPhones by the end of this year. The department bought Microsoft-based Nokia smartphones as part of a $160 million NYPD Mobility Initiative in 2014. The move follows Microsoft's recent decision to end support for Windows 8.1 operating system.
