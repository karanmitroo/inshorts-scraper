A hacker group called "Official Cyber Caliphate" claimed that it had hacked into the Malaysian Airlines website on Monday. The Airlines, however, said that passenger bookings and data servers remained unaffected. The website showed a photograph of a lizard in a top hat, monocle and tuxedo, surrounded by the messages "404 - Plane Not Found".
