Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, IBMâ€™s largest shareholder, has dumped a third of its stake, worth $4 billion at current share price, in the technology company. "I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying," Buffett stated. "IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors, too," he added.
