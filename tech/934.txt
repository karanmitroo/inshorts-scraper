Technology giant Apple has agreed to pay Ireland $15.4 billion in back taxes, Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe confirmed on Monday. The European Commission had ordered Apple to pay the sum last year, citing that the company received illegal tax benefits from the Irish government. Apple is expected to begin making the payments from the first quarter of next year.
