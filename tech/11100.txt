Angry Birds maker, Rovio has reportedly signed a deal with toymaker Lego to launch a line of Angry Birds building blocks. Rovio's business has been struggling as earnings fell 73% in 2014 because of a drop in licensing Angry Birds toys, clothing and merchandise. The release of the toy-line will reportedly coincide with the Angry Birds movie premier in 2016.
