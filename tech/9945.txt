As record rains paralysed Tamil Nadu capital Chennai, Facebook activated the 'Safety Check' tool to keep friends and family posted about users' safety. Users outside the affected area can check for friends who have been marked safe and who are yet to check in. Facebook had recently announced that this tool will be activated for both human and natural tragedies.
