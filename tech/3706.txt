Uber on Saturday suspended all of its self-driving car tests on public streets after one of its self-driving cars crashed in Arizona. No serious injuries were caused in the accident where another car failed to give way to Uber's car, making it flip on its side. The tests will remain suspended until the investigation into the crash is completed.
