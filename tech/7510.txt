Security giant Avast Antivirus on Thursday announced having acquired Czech-based antivirus software maker AVG in an all-cash deal worth around $1.3 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Avast's Management and Supervisory Board. Reports suggest that it isn’t yet clear if Avast will fold AVG’s services into its own brand or continue to sell them under the existing banner.
