Blackberry has decided to take a move back, and work on expanding its QWERTY range of smartphones. "QWERTY has been one of our strong suits...There remains a large portion of the user base that are loyal to the QWERTY experience," said Sameer Bhatia, Director, Distribution at BlackBerry India. The company will launch the Passport and Classic in the coming months.
