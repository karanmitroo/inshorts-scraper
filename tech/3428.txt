A 41-year-old man in California was recently arrested for "prowling and public intoxication" after he knocked over a security robot while he was drunk. The 5-foot-tall, 136 kg robot can stream 360-degree video and read 300 license plates per minute. Last year, the robot faced flak after it ran over a toddler's foot.
