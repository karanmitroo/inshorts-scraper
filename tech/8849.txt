Truecaller has announced plans to phase out its standalone Truedialer app that helps users better manage their contacts. The key features of the app, launched in 2014, will be merged into the main Truecaller app. In addition to helping users identify unknown telephone numbers, Truecaller will now sport a built-in dialer, a ‘smart call history’ feature and an ‘availability’ feature.
