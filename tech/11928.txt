NASA's High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) mission will aim at exploring the atmosphere of Venus, rather than just the surface. To this end, the manned mission seeks to establish a permanent human settlement in a floating cloud city above Venus. The researchers believe the upper atmosphere of Venus is "probably the most Earth-like environment that's out there."
