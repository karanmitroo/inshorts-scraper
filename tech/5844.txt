Samsung, which discontinued its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone over exploding batteries, had its batteries tested at a company-owned lab. Samsung's lab is housed inside its own testing facilities unlike its rivals Apple, Lenovo and LG, which conduct their battery tests at third-party sites. Samsung is still investigating the reason behind the overheating of Note 7's battery.
