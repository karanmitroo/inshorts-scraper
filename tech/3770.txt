Technology major Apple CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday visited billion-dollar Chinese startup Ofo which provides bicycles for rent. Ofo is backed by China's top taxi-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which in turn, received a $1 billion funding from Apple in 2016. Cook had said that the investment in Didi Chuxing will help Apple to better understand the Chinese market.
