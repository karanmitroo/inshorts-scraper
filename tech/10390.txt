Hong Kong-based Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour has accused Lens technology, one of Apple’s Chinese suppliers, of worker exploitation, claiming it forced overtime, withheld wages and risked workers’ safety. The accusation came on Friday as the new iPhones were launched. Around 10 protesters held signs of “Throw Away The Bad Apple” outside Apple’s largest store in Hong Kong.
