Google's parent company Alphabet is reportedly in talks with Uber rival Lyft to invest about $1 billion in the cab-hailing startup. The investment may come from Google or CapitalG, Alphabet's private-equity arm, reports added. In April, the US-based ride-hailing startup Lyft raised $600 million from investors including Baillie Gifford and AllianceBernstein, valuing it at $7.5 billion.
