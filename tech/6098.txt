Mumbai-based software developer Sudhanshu Mishra has created 'GitHub Audio', a website that tracks events across code-sharing platform GitHub and plays different sounds for every such event. The site plays music each time someone commits new code to any repository, or opens or closes an issue. It presents a visualisation of the events in real-time, allowing users to explore current projects.
