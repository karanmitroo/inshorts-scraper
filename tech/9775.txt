NASA has cancelled its next flight to Mars after the protective pouch of its spacecraft lander's seismometer developed a leak. The InSight spacecraft was to launch in March 2016 to study the planetâ€™s crust, mantle and inner core and there is reportedly not enough time to repair the leak. The next opportunity for the launch will be in May 2018.
