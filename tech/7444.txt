After hacking Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's Vine account, the hacker group named 'OurMine' had claimed that Twitter can see users' Vine passwords, which was later denied by the micro-blogging website. OurMine mentioned that it hacked Dorsey's dropbox and found a picture of Vine's control panel, showing users' private information and passwords. However, Twitter insisted that the picture is inaccurate.
