IBM has opened up access to a five-qubit quantum computing processor located in New York through a new free cloud service. Qubits are the fundamental unit of quantum computing which, unlike bits in classical computing, can be zero or one or both. The system would let users run algorithms, experiments and simulations, and even work with individual qubits.
