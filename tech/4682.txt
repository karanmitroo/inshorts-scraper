Hong Kong-based tech company Tappy has unveiled 'smart ring' at CES 2017 which can double up as a payment method. The users will be able to make payments by placing their ring close to a payment machine, using the contactless payment terminals. The rings are ceramic, as metals, including gold and silver, would interfere with wireless payment technologies.
