US President Donald Trump's administration has ordered Facebook to disclose information about "anti-government activists". The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has demanded access to all the information from the profiles of three activists who led anti-Trump protests on the Inauguration Day. The DOJ has also sought information about users who interacted with a page used to plan the protests.
