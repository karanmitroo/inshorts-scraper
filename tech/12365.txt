Google announced on Monday that YouTube will be available in offline mode in India, in the coming weeks. This will be made possible through the option of downloading videos when connected to the internet, and watching them later on the YouTube application. It wasn't made clear, though, if it'll be available throughout YouTube India or was valid for Android only.
