Hactivist collective Anonymous has declared a cyber war against the ISIS, who has claimed responsibility for the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. In a video message, Anonymous threatened to hunt the ISIS down and launch the biggest operation so far against it. The group also claims to have taken down 2,000 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts under #OpParis.
