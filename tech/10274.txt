Tesla Motors on Thursday launched autopilot feature in the US, for all Model S sedans built after September 2014. Provided through an upgrade, autopilot would enable cars to change lanes, steer and park themselves. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk cautioned that drivers should keep holding the steering wheel and that drivers, not Tesla, would be held liable in a crash.
