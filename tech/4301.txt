Japanese company Koei Tecmo has developed a cabinet called 'VR Sense' that engages with a user's nose and skin to let them smell and touch the different environments in virtual reality. It comes with functions for wind, mist, temperature and scent. The cabinet's chair can move in all directions and users can also feel bugs and rats crawling on them.
