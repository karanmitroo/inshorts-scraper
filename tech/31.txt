Arne Wilberg, who worked for nine years at Google as contractor has sued the tech giant for allegedly terminating him for complaining about their hiring practices. Wilberg alleged he was instructed to select job applicants based solely on whether they were women, black or Latino. Google, however, said the hiring was based "on merit", maintaining "diversity" at the same time.
