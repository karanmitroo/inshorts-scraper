Photo-sharing platform Instagram has rolled out a 'Superzoom' feature which automatically zooms into user's photo with 'dramatic' sound effects. Users can make a Superzoom of their selfies, friends' photos or even a half-eaten sandwich, Instagram wrote in a blog post. The feature is located in between the 'Boomerang' and 'Rewind' options underneath the screen's record button.
