The French government is facing criticism for its terror alert app 'SAIP' which sent out the first alert nearly three hours after the Nice truck attack began. Launched in June this year, the app was meant to provide an alert within 15 minutes after confirmation of a terror attack. The truck attack in France claimed over 80 lives on Thursday.
