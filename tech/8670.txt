Pune-based startup Smartbro Optinno has developed an Android app named 'Smartbro', which tracks and logs every single deduction of balance from a user's prepaid mobile SIM. It tracks both the main and data balance, shows current available balance on the phone's dialler and reminds about the expiry of the balance. The app does not require a data connection to work.
