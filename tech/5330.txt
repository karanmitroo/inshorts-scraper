A Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone exploded in a Canadian man's hand causing second-degree burns on his hands and third-degree burns on wrists. The man was driving his car when he felt the device heating up in his pocket, which exploded when he took it out. "I could've lost my eyes, my cheeks or anything could have happened," the man said.
