An Android-based application, The Bird Tap, has been launched by Surat-based animal welfare organisation, Prayas Team Environment Charitable Trust, to provide relief to thirsty birds and street animals from the summer heat. The app will help Prayas distribute earthen-pots, enable Surat netizens to locate water bowls distributed in different parts of the city and refill them regularly.
