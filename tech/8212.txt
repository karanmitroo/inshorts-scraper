Xiaomi has launched a smartwatch for kids, called Mi Bunny, for ₹3,067 (299 yuan). The watch has the ability to make and receive calls and can alert parents when their kids step out of the virtual fence they have set up. It also features an SOS button that reportedly sends a child’s current location data to their parents' phones in seconds.
