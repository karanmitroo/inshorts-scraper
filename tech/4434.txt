Biomedical solutions company Draper is developing a technology to turn dragonflies into 'living drones'. The main component of the DragonflEye project is a solar panel-equipped backpack to harvest energy. It also has a navigation system to send commands to neurons that control the insect's flight. The dragonflies could potentially act as surveillance systems or pollination machines.
