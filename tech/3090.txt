Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday revealed that he met his wife Priscilla outside a washroom during Zuckerberg's farewell party at Harvard. The party was arranged by his friends who thought he'd get expelled for launching a prank website. "I'm getting kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly," Zuckerberg had said to Priscilla.
