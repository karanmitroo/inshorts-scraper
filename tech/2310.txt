UK-based retail company The Co-operative group and forensic technology firm SmartWater have created a gel that can stick on clothing and human skin for five years. The invisible water-based gel technology, which glows under UV light, will be sprayed on anyone who tries to break into ATM machines. The branded thieves can then be traced back to their criminal acts.
