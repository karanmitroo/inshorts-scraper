Microsoft on Tuesday announced that its Cortana personal voice-assistant will be available for iPhone and Android smartphones later this year. It also launched 'Phone Companion', a Windows 10 app with which user can sync their Android, iOS or Windows handset using PC. The company launched Cortana on Windows Phone 8.1 last April as an answer to Siri and Google Now.
