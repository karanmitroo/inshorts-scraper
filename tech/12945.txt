French watchdog CNIL is fining Google 150,000 euros ($204,000) for breaking rules on ensuring data privacy. CNIL said Google's new privacy policy, which applies to all of its services, isn't specific enough about how and why it collects user data and doesn't define how long it keeps such data. EU authorities also have said Google's policy doesn't follow their rules.
