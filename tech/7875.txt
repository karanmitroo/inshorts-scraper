A French startup has created 'Energysquare', a $65 mousepad-sized rechargeable pad that allows users to charge multiple devices wirelessly at one time by attaching a small sticker to their devices. Energysquare is compatible with smartphones and tablets powered by Android, Windows and iOS. It also features a smart sleep mode to prevent any power wastage when no devices are connected.
