IBM's music-composing AI 'Watson Beat' has helped Grammy-winning producer Alex da Kid create his first solo extended-play of four songs, first of which was recently released. While IBM's bot did not write the actual songs, it analysed musical culture trends of the past five years to generate "completely new musical scores," which Alex reportedly used as inspiration for the tunes.
