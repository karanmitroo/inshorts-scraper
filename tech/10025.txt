According to a report on Friday, a successful kidney surgery was performed by a surgical robot on a six-year-old boy in Chinaâ€™s Guangdong province. A surgeon operated the arms of the robot by looking into a magnified view of the surgical area. One hour less than the usual laparoscopic surgeries, the surgery lasted for two hours and 20 minutes.
