Hewlett Packard has collaborated with designer Michael Bastian to launch a smartwatch called MB Chronowing. The smartwatch, which supports both the iPhone and Android devices for wireless pairing, will be available exclusively via Gilt from November 7, at $349 (for a silver-plated model). Unlike other smartwatches, this one does not feature a touch screen.
