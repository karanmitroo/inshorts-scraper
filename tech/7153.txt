According to several reports, a glitch in the Microsoft-owned SwiftKey app caused it to reveal other users' email addresses and phone numbers as predicted text. Reportedly, the issue was with its cloud sync service which was providing its users with predictions intended for someone else. SwiftKey said it has temporarily disabled its cloud sync service and removed email address predictions.
