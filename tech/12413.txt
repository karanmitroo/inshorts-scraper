Sony on Friday launched a perfume bottle-shaped selfie camera, Cyber-shot DSC-KW11. The "cap" of the bottle is a wide-angle 21-mm lens that can swivel 180 degrees for easy selfie. The 19.2 megapixels camera has several other features like, "beauty effect", "eye widening" and "face slimming" options to tweak the appearance, reports said.
