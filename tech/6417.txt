Google has patented a new technology for its self-driving car which will let the car detect flashing lights of the emergency vehicles and respond accordingly. The technology would allow a car to see and interpret flashing lights and their colors, specifically red, blue, and a potential third color, which is a common scheme of emergency lights.
