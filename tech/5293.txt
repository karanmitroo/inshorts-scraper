A YouTube video by McDonald's explores the fast-food chain's new 'Just For You' model in a virtual reality and 360° format. The video shows the touchscreen booths introduced by McDonald's in some US states that allow customised ordering. Users can watch the video using Google's VR headsets or by scrolling within the video to view the restaurant in 360°.
