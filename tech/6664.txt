Poland has started an investigation after five court offices downloaded personal data of over 1.4 million citizens from the country's national identification number database. The database reportedly contains over 20 types of sensitive information, including banking-related details. Notably, Polish court officials are authorised to access a portion of the sensitive data for debt collection cases.
