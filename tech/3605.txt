An 11-year-old from the UK unintentionally made online game purchases worth about ₹4.8 lakh after accessing his parents' iTunes account on his iPad. The boy's mother said that he generally asks before making small purchases but on seeing an available ₹8,000 purchase, he grew curious and pressed multiple times. However, Apple has agreed to refund the amount to the family.
