Tatarenko Vladimir Nikolaevich, a Ukranian engineer, has developed an aircraft design with a detachable passenger cabin that can be ejected from the airplane in case of in-flight emergencies. Further, automatic parachutes can help the ejected cabin to land safely on ground or water. The design also includes storage space underneath the cabin to avoid loss of luggage.
