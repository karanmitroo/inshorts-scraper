Following the success of its first Mars mission, ISRO is planning to revisit the planet in 2018, possibly with a lander and rover to conduct more experiments. The Mars 1 mission was launched on Nov 5, 2013 from its spaceport in Andhra Pradesh; and on Sept 24, the state-run space agency successfully inserted its spacecraft (MOM) in the Martian orbit.
