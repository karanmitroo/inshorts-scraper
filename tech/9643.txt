A US Judge on Monday ordered Yahoo Inc to face a class-action lawsuit for sending text messages in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Over 500,000 users of Sprint Corp reportedly received "Welcome" messages when other users sent messages on Yahoo's Messenger Service. Yahoo faces a penalty of $1,500 per text message if the violations are found 'wilful'.
