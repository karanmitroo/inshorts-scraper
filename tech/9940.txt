Google has rolled out an entertainment-focussed update to its search engine on Android and tablets. Search results now feature added layers of information on music, TV and movies, including recommendations. If one looks up a singer, Google provides a skeletal bio, links to all his official profiles, list of his songs and also asks for feedback in case of misinformation.
