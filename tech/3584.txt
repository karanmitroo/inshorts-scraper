An American woman's Fitbit fitness tracker recently helped save her life after she noticed it was registering an abnormal resting heart rate. The tracker displayed a resting heart rate of over 140 beats per minute, higher than her usual 60-70. This prompted the woman to dial for an ambulance, after which doctors found potentially fatal blood clots in her lungs.
