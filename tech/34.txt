Russia-based security firm Dr.Web has discovered a malware called Triada that is infecting low-cost Android phones even before they are turned on for the first time. Triada downloads components to perform actions including data theft, spying on messages or hijacking web browsing. Researchers have detected the malware in over 40 Android device models so far including China's Leagoo and Doogee.
