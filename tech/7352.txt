Andy Rubin, one of the Co-founders of Android, was given the nickname 'Android' by his co-workers because of his love for robots while he was working at Apple back in 1989. Rubin co-founded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, which on Tuesday released the final developer preview of the upcoming Android version â€“ 'Android Nougat'.
