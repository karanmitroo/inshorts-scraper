Google has filed a patent for see-through air conditioner units that permit an "unobstructed view" through windows. The patent describes variants of AC units with bladeless fans or thermoelectric coolers to reduce size, weight, and noise compared to existing units. A transparent window may also be present in the centre of the unit for a direct view of the outdoors.
