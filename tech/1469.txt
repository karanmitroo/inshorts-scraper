A video shows a Dubai police officer hovering on a flying motorbike called 'Hoverbike', which has rotors instead of wheels. In the video, the officer is seen manoeuvring the bike in the air, with Dubai police vehicles in the background. Designed by Russian company Hoversurf, it can fly 16-feet above ground and stay airborne for around 25 minutes.
