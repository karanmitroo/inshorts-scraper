University of Canterbury's researchers Jack Copeland and Jason Long have successfully restored the first ever music recording done by a computer. Originally recorded in 1951, the music clip includes three melodies played by a gigantic primeval computer made by British scientist Alan Turing. The recording is now available in a two-minute audio clip with extraneous noise filtered out for clarity.
