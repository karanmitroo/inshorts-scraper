US-based biotech startup Sandstone Diagnostics has got FDA clearance for its male fertility testing device called ‘Trak’. While the device enables users to measure semen quality at home, a dedicated app provides feedback and wellness advice on ways to improve and track sperm count. The startup will start shipping its product by the end of summer this year.
