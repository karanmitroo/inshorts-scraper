NASA refuted the claims of Russian scientists, on Wednesday, that the newly-discovered 1312 foot asteroid, 2014 UR116, could threaten the Earth in the near future. NASA's calculations were supported by Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which revealed that the Earth was safe for the next 150 years. NASA's project, "asteroid redirect mission", will also help avert potential threat.
