A new health-check wearable device, called 'CH4', analyses people's farts to advice dietary changes. The device is worn just above a person's posterior, in the back pocket, and monitors food habits using an accompanying app. The device can be of great importance to people with severe digestion problems. It costs about $120, and will be available in March next year.
