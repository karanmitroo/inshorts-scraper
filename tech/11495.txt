Fashion e-tailer Myntra has decided to take down its website from May-1, and sell its products only through its mobile application. Reportedly, around 80% of traffic and 70% of total sales for the company are achieved through the app. Myntra's parent company Flipkart will monitor the results of the move, and it might also follow suit.
