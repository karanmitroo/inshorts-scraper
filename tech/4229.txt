Google India has used the 'Spoke to my ex after 10 years' meme to promote its video calling app Duo on Twitter. The tweet highlights Duo's Knock Knock feature which lets users see a live video of the caller while the phone rings, if they have the contact saved. However, the caller cannot see the receiver till call is picked.
