An Israeli startup has built a $40 smartphone case called 'StickBox' that comes with a full-length in-built selfie stick. It slides out from the rear of the case and extends to a 28-inch long aluminium selfie stick with a button that snaps photos on pressing. The company is planning to launch another cover with light-weight carbon fiber selfie stick.
