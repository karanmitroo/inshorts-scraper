Google Search for the query “How many genders are there?” gives "There are only 2 genders. Male and Female" as the top result. This outcome is reportedly due to a Google Search feature called 'Featured Snippets' which aggregates information from high-ranking sources and summarises it. Notably, Facebook offers its users 53 gender choices and allows them to add custom genders.
