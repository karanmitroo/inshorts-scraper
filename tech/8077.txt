Mahmoud Jabari, creator of the online soccer game 'Breakaway', recently delivered a TED Talk on how his game teaches boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 15 to fight gender-based violence. The game asks players to make positive or negative choices around sexist behaviours via a series of soccer and cultural challenges. Their choices decide their game score.
