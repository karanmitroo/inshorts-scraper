A US-based startup has developed machine-washable smart clothing 'Enflux' which tracks the user's workout in real-time using 10 embedded motion sensors. Connected through an app, the clothing tracks the user's workout in 3D including heart rate, efficiency and intensity. The clothing claims to be anti-odour and comes with a battery life of two weeks in a single charge.
