Thailand police have reportedly busted a 'Clickfarm' at a rented house run by three Chinese men who were in possession of over 3 lakh unused SIM cards, 474 iPhones and 10 computers. The suspects said they were being paid to artificially boost engagement on WeChat. It was being run in Thailand due to the country's relatively cheap smartphone usage fees.
