Facebook mistakenly blocked the profile of a user by the name of Isis Anchalee for about a day, allegedly confusing her first name with the acronym used by the extremist Islamic State group. Anchalee tweeted, “Facebook thinks I’m a terrorist. Apparently sending them a screenshot of my passport is not good enough for them to reopen my account”.
