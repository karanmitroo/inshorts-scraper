China launched its 2nd second high-definition satellite, the Gaofen-2, from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, on Tuesday morning. The satellite is China's most advanced earth observation satellite, and can see a one-metre-long object from space in full colour. It will be used for geographic and resources surveillance, environment and climate-change monitoring, agriculture, disaster relief and city planning.
