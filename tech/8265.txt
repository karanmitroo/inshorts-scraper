Twitter on Tuesday reported a 36% rise in revenue for the quarter-ended March to $594.5 million. Losses narrowed to $79.7 million from $162.4 million a year ago. Further, the microblogging service's monthly active user base grew to 310 million from 305 million in the preceding quarter. Post the announcement, however, Twitter's shares fell 13.6%, reportedly owing to lower-than-expected revenue.
