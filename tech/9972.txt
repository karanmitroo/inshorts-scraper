A study by services firm KPMG revealed that 72% Indian companies were victims of cyber attacks in 2015. The survey that included over 250 firms observed that while 91% firms considered cyber crime as a major threat, only 41% listed the issue as a board agenda. Furthermore, 54% firms spend less than 5% of total technology expenditure on cyber defence.
