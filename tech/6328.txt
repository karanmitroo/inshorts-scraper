Electric car company Tesla is developing the world's largest lithium-ion battery storage system to help power Southern California. The 'Powerpack' system will be able to power more than 2,500 households for a day or charge 1,000 Tesla vehicles. It will charge using electricity from the grid during off-peak hours and deliver electricity during peak hours, taking strain off the generators.
