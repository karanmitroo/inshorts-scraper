Bharti Airtel has launched 4G internet services for mobile phones in Chandigarh and neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula. However, 4G services were introduced in the region last year through dongles. Chandigarh is the second city, after Bangalore, to get Airtel's 4G services on mobiles. The company will provide 4G services starting at Rs 250 for 1 GB, equivalent to 3G rates.
