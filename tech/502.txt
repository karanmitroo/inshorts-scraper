Selfie app Snow, developed by South Korean firm Naver, has raised $50 million from Japan's SoftBank and Sequoia Capital China. Snow plans to use the investment to develop its augmented reality (AR) and facial recognition technologies. The app offers filters, stickers, augmented reality (AR), and other features for selfies that can be exported to social networks or chat groups.
