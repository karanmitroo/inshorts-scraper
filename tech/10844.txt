Italy sports car giant Ferrari has recalled 2,600 cars globally on account of faulty airbags supplied by Japanese company Takata. The vehicles may be equipped with a driver-side airbag "that was improperly assembled", the company said. "This issue is not related to the other recall made by other manufacturers for Takata airbags," a company spokesperson said.
