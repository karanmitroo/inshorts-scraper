Apple on Wednesday pulled its mobile payment and digital wallet service Apple Pay from websites selling white-supremacy clothing and accessories in light of Virginia riots. The websites were violating Apple's guidelines which prohibits use of Apple Pay to promote "hate, violence, or intolerance." Earlier this week, both GoDaddy and Google refused service to white supremacist blog, Daily Stormer.
