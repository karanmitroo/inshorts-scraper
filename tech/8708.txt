According to Bloomberg reports, Google is looking to sell robotics firm Boston Dynamics, which it acquired in 2013, after concluding that it's unlikely to produce any marketable robot in coming years. The firm became famous by publishing videos showing its machines' versatility and reliability. Its robots, created for military purposes, were rejected because of being too noisy for practical use.
