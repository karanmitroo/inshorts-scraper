US-based startup Robomart has developed an on-demand self-driving grocery store, which it claims is the world's first. It has built a prototype of the store which can be equipped with either a refrigeration or heating system and also features a wireless charging technology. Robomart will track what customers take using a 'checkout free technology' and will send a receipt accordingly.
