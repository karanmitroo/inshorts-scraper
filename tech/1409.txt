A video which surfaced last week, showing fight between robots piloted by US-based robotics company MegaBots and Japan-based Suidobashi Heavy Industry, wasn't shot live. MegaBots' Co-founder said it was filmed over a number of days and repairs of the robots were removed from the footage. In the initial bout, Japanese robot knocked down its American counterpart with a single punch.
