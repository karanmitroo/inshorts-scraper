Billionaire Richard Branson-founded Virgin Galactic has completed a 'dry run' for its SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity plane which will be used to carry passengers to suborbital space. The reusable spaceplane flew with the configuration of a rocket-powered flight despite having no rocket. Unity is the company's second SpaceShipTwo spacecraft after the original vehicle crashed in 2014, killing a co-pilot.
