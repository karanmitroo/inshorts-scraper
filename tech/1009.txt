Technology giant Apple has removed games glorifying Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. This comes after more than 130 organisations, including human rights groups and drug rehabilitation centres wrote a letter urging Apple's CEO Tim Cook to remove the games. Nearly 4,000 people have been killed in Duterte's war on drugs.
