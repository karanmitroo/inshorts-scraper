Twitter on Wednesday released a feature titled Highlights, which summarises the interesting, relevant stories on a users' feed. Highlights presents a personalised summary based on discussions and profiles most popular among the accounts followed by the user. Currently on Android platforms, the feature is supposedly available in at least 35 languages and is presented via ‘rich notifications’.
