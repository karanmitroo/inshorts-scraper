England-based researchers have created a levitating display of 'floating pixels', called JOLED, that can be controlled and manipulated using sound waves and electric force fields. In the display, each pixel can be rotated on the spot to show different colours and images. The technology may help create floating displays or bring computer game characters to life as physical objects.
