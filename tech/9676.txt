Facebook on Monday activated its Safety Check feature for Manipur after an earthquake measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale hit the North-Eastern states of India, killing at least six people. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “Tremors were also felt in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal…we'll send you a notification to access Safety Check so you can share that you're safe.”
