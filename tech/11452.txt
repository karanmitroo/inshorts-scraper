London-based company Moley Robots has developed a prototype robo-chef for home that will do all the cooking for its users. The robot, that will take a few years to be launched in the market, would do everything from assembling the ingredients to chopping, stirring, pouring, adding ingredients, and also cleaning after the cooking is done.
