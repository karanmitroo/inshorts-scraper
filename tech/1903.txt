YouTube to MP3 conversion site YouTube-mp3.org has agreed to shut down and transfer the site domain name to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Last year, record labels like Sony Music, and UMG under RIAA sued the site for illegal downloads of YouTube videos. The lawsuit claimed the site was responsible for "upwards of 40 percent" of all illegal audio-ripping.
