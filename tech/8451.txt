According to media reports, social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram are being used for trading illegal weapons in Libya. Sellers register under fake names to sell arms including AK-47s, truck-mounted machine guns and shoulder-launched rocket systems. Notably, Facebook banned private sales of weapons inÂ January this year, and also made it easy for users to report violations.
