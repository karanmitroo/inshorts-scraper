Sandip Gund, primary school teacher from Pashtepada, Maharashtra has converted a zilla parishad school into a ‘smart school,’ where children are taught using tablets and computers instead of schoolbooks. The majority of the students are children of farmers and labourers. He has inspired over 40 schools in Thane district to replicate his ‘Gund’ model of teaching this year.
