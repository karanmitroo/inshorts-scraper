UK-based scientists are developing a camera that can track medical tools inserted into a patient. It can detect light sources from inside the body, such as the illuminated tip of an endoscope, which is generally tracked using X-rays or other expensive methods. The prototype demonstrated locating a point source of light through an approximately 20-cm-thick tissue under normal lighting conditions.
