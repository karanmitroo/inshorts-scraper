'Mirror, Mirror' fame Lily Colins is the riskiest celebrity to be searched for online, says the recent list released by computer security company McAfee. The title was previously held by 'Harry Potter' actress Emma Watson. Avril Lavigne, Sandra Bullock, Kathy Griffin and Zoe Saldana follow Colins in the list. 'Mad Men' star Jon Hamm is the only man in top-10.
