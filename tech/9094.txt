Scientists in the UK have created five-dimensional glass discs that can store 360 TB of data for up to 13.8 billion years. The glass used to make the disc will be safe to use for up to 1,000Â°C. Unlike CDs, which reflects light encoded in two dimensions, the glass disc encodes five dimensions, making it feasible to store large data.
