In a first, US and UK-based researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that successfully predicted laboratory simulated earthquakes. The AI employs machine learning for finding patterns in the acoustic signal from the fault to determine future earthquakes. Researchers are aiming to scale up the AI for real earthquake detection and, possibly, avalanches and landslides.
