Apple is launching a 'Spoken Edition' service on its iTunes music service, that will feature short-form programs focussed on turning media publishers' articles and news into audio content. Some of the publishers supported by the new system include TechCrunch, Wired, Time, Forbes and Playboy. The service will be rolled out in October, according to a report.
