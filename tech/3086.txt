German artist Jip de Beer has created gold-plated structures of websites like Facebook and Google. He made the three-dimensional models of the domains by mapping the depth of different elements on the page according to their hierarchical structure. The structure looks like a building from the side, but looking at it from the top reveals which website it is.
