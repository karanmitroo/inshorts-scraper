Apple Maps has unveiled indoor layouts of over 30 airports across the globe to let users "look inside" for check-in desks, airport lounges, bathrooms and other locations. While the company has primarily covered American airports, airports in Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Geneva and London have also been included. Users will also be able to use virtual assistant Siri with the service.
