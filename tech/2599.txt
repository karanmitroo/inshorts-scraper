US government's defence agency DARPA has announced a â‚¹116 crore investment in Paradromics, a startup building implants which will act as a "modem for the brain". The startup's implant will record and stimulate neurons that will eventually help stroke victims relearn to speak. The investment is part of DARPA's grant to six teams working on similar brain implant projects.
