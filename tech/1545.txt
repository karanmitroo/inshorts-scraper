A four-wheeled robot in German town Bad Hersfeld is helping postal workers carry mail by using sensors to follow them as they do their rounds. Deutsche Post DHL said "PostBOT" can carry up to 150 kilograms. It added, "We're constantly working on new solutions to allow our employees to handle this physically challenging work even as they continue to age."
