Pakistan's Punjab province has launched a smartphone application for women to report harassment to police in an effort to promote women's safety. The app lets women call an emergency response police team to their location by clicking a button, and also lets them report domestic violence. Reportedly, Punjab accounted for 74% of crimes against women in Pakistan in 2013.
