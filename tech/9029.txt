At this year's Mobile World Congress, MediaTek announced the MT2511 chip, which is its first bio-sensing, analog front end chip, catering specifically to health and fitness devices. The chip is capable of measuring bio-parameters such as electrocardiography and photoplethysmography, besides measuring the heart rate. The MediaTek MT2511 is likely to be mass manufactured by the first half of 2016.
