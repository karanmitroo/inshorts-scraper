Scientists at NASA have captured a zoomed-in picture of the faintest galaxy detected so far through its Hubble Space Telescope. Nick-named Tayna, the ancient galaxy is four billion light years away and came in view through a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Under this, the galaxy cluster's gravity acts as a magnifying glass and makes it appear about 20 times brighter.
