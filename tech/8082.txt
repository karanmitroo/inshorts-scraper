Researchers at the Stanford University have developed a device that uses a black box and a smartphone camera to test urine at home. The one-time assembling black box integrates a standard medical paper dipstick that collects urine and changes colour to detect a medical condition. The dipstick can help find evidences of kidney disease, diabetes, urinary infections and bladder cancer.
