Brazil, which organised the just-concluded 2014 FIFA World Cup, will now host a soccer tournament for robots, which will be held from July 19-25 in the north-eastern city of Joao Pessoa. RoboCup's organisers say around 3,000 university students from 45 countries and 400 teams will participate in this year's competition, which will attract approximately 60k spectators.
