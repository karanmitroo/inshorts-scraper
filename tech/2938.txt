Chinese company Huawei has been ordered by a British court to pay licence fees to a US firm to avoid smartphone sales ban in the UK. Huawei has been told to pay royalties on millions of smartphones to Unwired Planet for allegedly infringing on its patents. The ruling has been put on hold as Huawei prepares to appeal against it.
