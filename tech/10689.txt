According to Apple's diversity report released on Thursday, the company hired 65% more women, 50% more African-Americans, and 66% more Latinos last year than it did the year before that. Although CEO Tim Cook said, “This represents the largest group of employees we've hired from underrepresented groups in one year,” overall the company has reported having made little progress.
