Cybercrime in India rose by 350% from 2011 to 2014, an Assocham-PwC joint study claimed on Thursday. The cybercriminals can gain control of vital systems such as nuclear plants, railways, transportation or hospitals, said the study. In the past, attacks have mostly been initiated from the US, Turkey, China, Brazil, Pakistan, and Europe among others, it added.
