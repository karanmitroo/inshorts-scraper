American package delivery company UPS, which unveiled its drone-launching delivery vans this week, failed its second delivery attempt during a demo after its 'HorseFly' drone's compass experienced issues. The drone aborted its launch and tried to return to the top of the van. However, it fell to the side and was nearly crushed by the closing lid of the vehicle.
