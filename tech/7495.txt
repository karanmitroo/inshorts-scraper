A US Navy department has provided a three-year $750,000 grant to a project aimed at developing bomb-sniffing locusts. The researchers will use locusts' ability to identify particular scents, by implanting an electrode into its brains and reading the electrical activity. A backpack would also be attached on the insect's back to transmit data about the absence or presence of explosives.
