A UK-based startup has developed 'Little Rooster S', a vibrator which is to be worn inside underwear at night and starts vibrating at a specified time, acting like an alarm clock. The device begins vibrating on a low setting and gradually increases to the wearer's selected level of intensity from the 30 levels offered. Currently sold-out, the device costs $77.
