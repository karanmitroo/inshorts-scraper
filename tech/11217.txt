A Singapore-based mobile application company has entered into a partnership with Indian smartphone maker Intex Technologies to launch a free-calling app 'Nanu', designed to work in 2G network. The move is set to open a big market for rural India. Unlike conventional voice calling apps, Nanu lets you call non-Nanu users on landline and mobiles all around the world.
