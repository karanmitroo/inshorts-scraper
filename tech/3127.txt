Payments service PayPal has sued music streaming service Pandora over the similarities in its new logo introduced last October. "Pandora has no path to profitability and it deserted its longstanding logo and latched itself on to the increasingly popular PayPal Logo," said PayPal in its lawsuit. PayPal is demanding an injunction against Pandora to stop it from using the logo.
