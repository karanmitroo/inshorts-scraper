SodaStream, an Israel-based manufacturer of sparkling water making devices, has launched 'Beer Bar', a counter-top device that claims to brew three litres of beer at $3.34 in seconds. It comes with a one-litre bottle of concentrate for a light beer called Blondie, which contains 4.5% alcohol by volume. It brews beer by mixing the concentrate with sparkling water.
