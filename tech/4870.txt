Iran has banned mobile game 'Clash of Clans' to protect the country's youth from its influence, which the government claims promotes tribal warfare. The ban was urged after a report from psychologists claimed the game encourages violence, tribal war and is extensively addictive. Released in 2012, the game allows players to build town using resources gained from attacking other players.
