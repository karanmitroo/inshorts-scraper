A drone named 'DRL Racer X' on Friday set Guinness World Record for the fastest drone by hitting a top speed of 263 kmph. This speed is more than the top speed of the fastest Tesla car, Model S in Ludicrous Mode. The earlier prototypes of the drone had burst into flames when hitting their highest speed.
