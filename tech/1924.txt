A US judge has ruled that Yahoo must face the lawsuit brought on behalf of over one billion customers who claimed their personal information was compromised in Yahoo's data breaches. Yahoo sought to dismiss the lawsuit, saying the victims didn't have legal standing. The breaches occurred between 2013-2016 compromising user details like email addresses, and telephone numbers, among others.
