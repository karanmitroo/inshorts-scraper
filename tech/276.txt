The Competition Commission of India has found Google guilty of 'search bias' after complaints by Martrimony.com and Consumer Unity and Trust Society in 2012. Google was accused of manipulating the search algorithm to promote its own services. While the complaint was being probed, Facebook, Flipkart, and MakeMyTrip had also filed complaints about Google abusing its dominance in India.
