Japan's Henn-na Hotel (meaning Strange Hotel), world's first hotel run entirely by robots, was opened on Friday. The hotel replaces people with lifelike lady humanoid receptionists and a bow tie-wearing dinosaur concierge. It has keyless rooms and guests enter their rooms via facial recognition technology. It also features a self-serve cafe which serves snacks and drinks from a vending machine.
