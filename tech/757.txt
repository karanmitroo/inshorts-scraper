Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel spent $4 million on New Year's Eve party for his employees in Los Angeles, US. The company secured proper permits to host around 5,000 guests who were treated to a 105-foot DJ tower and pyrotechnics. Spiegel reportedly flew employees in from "around the world" for the party where rapper Drake gave a surprise performance.
