The Apple Park, which hosted the iPhone X launch event on Tuesday, is widely regarded as the 'final product' designed by Steve Jobs due to his heavy involvement in designing. The event was organised in the main building, commonly known as the 'Spaceship' because of its appearance. Further, the theatre where the launch took place is named after Jobs himself.
