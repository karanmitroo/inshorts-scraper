A team of Stanford University researchers has made six bug-sized micro-robots which can pull a Sports Utility Vehicle weighing over 1,700 kilograms. The six robots jointly weighed around 100 grams. One of the researchers said that the demonstration is the functional equivalent of six humans pulling a weight equal to that of the Eiffel Tower.
