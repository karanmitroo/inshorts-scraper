Technology giants Microsoft and Facebook on Thursday announced plans to build "MAREA", a 6,600 km subsea cable system across the Atlantic Ocean. It's designed to have a maximum bandwidth of 160 Tbps, the highest capacity under the Atlantic, the companies said. The two parties claimed that this cable system will be the first to connect the US to southern Europe.
