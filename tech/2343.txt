A nine-year-old boy in the US has been charged with breaking and entering into his neighbour's home to steal several items. The boy was identified because the neighbour had a feature on her phone that allowed her to receive audio recordings from Amazon's smart speaker Echo. According to reports, the child will face charges in juvenile court.
