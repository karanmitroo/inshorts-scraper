Google Thursday announced a partnership with Oxford University's artificial intelligence teams to teach machines to think like people. Oxford professors and DeepMind, a London-based startup that Google bought early this year, will work together to get machines to better understand what they hear and see, potentially powering services such as intuitive virtual assistants and online search tools.
