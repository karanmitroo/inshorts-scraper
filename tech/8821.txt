A Chicago-based startup has developed 'Tovala', a smart oven that cooks ready-made meals provided by the startup in 10 to 30 minutes. Priced at $349, it is designed to read the barcode provided on the meals and cook them accordingly. Tovala uses an exact combination of cooking methods, timing and temperatures chosen by the chefs for each dish.
