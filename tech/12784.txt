A security breach, which involved computers belonging to DRDO and armed forces being hacked, was detected by Intelligence agencies in December. Up to thirty classified files could have been compromised; a security advisory has been issued mentioning the detection of spyware, government sources said. National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon downplayed the incident, insisting that "things are not in bad shape".
