Scientists at Sony have claimed that they have created "first-ever entire songs composed by Artificial Intelligence". The two songs 'Daddy's Car' and 'Mister Shadow' have been developed using 'FlowMachines', an AI system that learns music styles from a vast database of songs to compose new songs. 'Daddy's Car' has been composed in the style of the English band 'The Beatles'.
