Facebook has agreed to pay $35 million to settle claims that its officers and directors misled investors prior to the company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2012. However, the social media giant didn't admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. "Resolving this case is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders," Facebook said in a statement.
