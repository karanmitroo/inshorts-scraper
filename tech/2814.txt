Digital currency exchange GDAX has announced it will reimburse customers who suffered losses after Ethereum plummeted from around $320 (₹20,600) to 10 cents (₹6.45) in a few seconds on Wednesday. The "flash-crash" was triggered by one investor placing a multi-million-dollar "sell" order. However, if investors bought Ethereum at low prices during the crash, the trade will still be honoured.
