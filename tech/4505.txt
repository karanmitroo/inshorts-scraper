Google has reportedly added a feature to the beta version of its Maps app for Android devices that shows users the availability of parking at their destination. The parking availability indicator appears next to the estimated driving time with the label "easy," "medium," or "limited." According to the report, the indicator will be available for public places like shopping malls.
