A fully operational Ricketts Apple-1 Personal Computer, that Steve Jobs sold out of his parents' garage in 1976 for $600, is ready to be auctioned on December 11. It is expected to fetch more than half a million dollar. It is the only surviving Apple-1 which was sold directly by a 21-yr-old Steve Jobs.
