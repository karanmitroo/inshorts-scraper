Researchers at Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs have uncovered bugs in dating apps like Tinder and OkCupid that make users' data accessible to hackers. The bugs could expose user names, login information, location, message and history, researchers claimed. Dating sites including Badoo, Zoosk, Happn, WeChat, and Paktor also made it to the researchers' list of being vulnerable.
