Former Google engineer James Damore, who was fired for his 10-page anti-diversity document, on Friday said in an article titled, 'Why I was fired by Google' that the technology giant is like a cult. Damore argued that Google created an environment where only certain opinions could be voiced. He further wrote that his firing "neatly confirms that point."
