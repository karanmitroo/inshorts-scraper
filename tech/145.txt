Snapchat has responded with "We hear you" in a blog post to users complaining about the app's redesign. The company had announced an update for sorting Stories, group chats, and subscriptions, to enable "customisation of the app." The response comes after 1.2 million users signed a petition asking the update's removal, which they said makes the app difficult to use.
