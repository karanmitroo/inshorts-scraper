The world's first Short Message Service or SMS was sent by software programmer Neil Papworth from a computer 25 years ago today. The text, which was sent to a colleague on December 3, 1992, read "Merry Christmas". It was only in 1993 that Nokia introduced an SMS feature with a distinctive 'beep' to signal an incoming message.
