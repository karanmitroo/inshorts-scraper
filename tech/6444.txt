A New York-based designer has created what he claims to be the first camera made entirely from 3D-printed parts. To make his 'Single Lens Objective' camera, Amos Dudley used a 3D printer which can print using several resin types, like opaque for the body and transparent for the lens. The camera has two shutters with the option to vary exposure.
