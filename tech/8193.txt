American camera manufacturer GoPro has released the footage of a suborbital rocket launch that saw a 20-foot tall SpaceLoft-10 rocket carry two cameras to 396,405 feet. The launch was carried out in November last year from Spaceport America in New Mexico. With the launch, an 11-pound capsule was launched into space to test its stability upon re-entry into earth's atmosphere.
