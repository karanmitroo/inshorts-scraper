Microsoft Saturday briefly faced its second social media-based attack from the Syrian Electronic Army in a month. The @XboxSupport account posted a link to the SEA website, along with other messages, tagging the groupâ€™s own Twitter account. However, the tweets were deleted within 45 minutes of being posted, indicating that Microsoft has regained control of the account.
