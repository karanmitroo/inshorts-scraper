Apple's next smartwatch scheduled to release this year, will reportedly not have cellular connectivity. As the currently available cellular chip would have drained the Watch's battery, the feature has been pushed to a later generation. A cellular network in the Watch in the future would allow download of sports score alerts, e-mail and Maps information without connecting with an iPhone.
