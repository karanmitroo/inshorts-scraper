A US-based startup has developed 'AiraWear', a $199 app-connected massaging hoodie which relaxes body through acupressure technology and claims to improve the body posture. It includes a six-modular detachable massage unit and an inflatable posture correction vest. Users can customise their massage type and intensity through the app. It claims to deliver three hours of massage in single charge.
