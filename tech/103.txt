US-based IT firm Unisys Corporation has launched a device called Digi-Pet which allows users to monitor their pets in aircraft cargo holds. It uses Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology through smart sensors attached to the pet's carry case, to monitor and transmit information such as temperature, oxygen levels, and light. It also alerts the owner and airline staff if something goes wrong.
