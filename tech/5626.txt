CEO of Silicon Valley technology firm Palantir, Alex Karp on Wednesday admitted that he had "f*cked up so many things" at the company but being biased wasn't one of them. He said this with reference to the lawsuit Palantir is facing for discriminating against Asian job applicants. He added that about one-quarter of Palantir's employees are Asian.
