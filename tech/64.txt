Chinese electronics company Haier has developed a smartwatch called Asu featuring a built-in projector which enables users to display images onto their hands. The watch features a 1.5-inch screen, 1 GB of memory, a heart-rate sensor, GPS, and 4G LTE support. Users can also double tap on the projection on their hand to change what's on the screen.
