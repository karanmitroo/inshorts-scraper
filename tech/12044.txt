Twitter Wednesday said it's now tracking what other apps its users have installed on their mobiles so it can target content and ads to them better. Users will receive a notification when the setting is turned-on and can opt-out using their phone settings. On iPhones, this setting is called "limit ad tracking" while on Android, it's "opt-out of interest-based ads."
