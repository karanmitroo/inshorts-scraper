E-marketplace Snapdeal is reportedly looking to establish a base in the US, with the intention of finding specialist talent and strengthening its technology. Snapdeal has been bringing in top talent from Silicon Valley companies like Google and Yahoo for its leadership positions. If the decision gets executed, Snapdeal will become the first Indian e-commerce to have an international office.
