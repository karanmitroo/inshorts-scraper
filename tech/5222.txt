UK is planning to open a 'College of National Security' to teach cybersecurity to teenagers. The college will offer a three-year curriculum with related subjects including maths, physics, and computer science to students on the basis of merit. It will open in 2018 in Bletchley Park, an area where British agents decoded encrypted Nazi messages during World War II.
