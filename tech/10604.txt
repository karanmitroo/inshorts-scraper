NASA will begin flying its Global Hawk aircraft over the Atlantic ocean basin to collect data for a mission to improve hurricane tracking and intensity forecasts. Scientists at the space agency have partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the same. The real-time data collected from the mission will be sent to the National Hurricane Centre.
