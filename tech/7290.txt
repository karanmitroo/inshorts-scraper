News Corp Australia has launched a chatbot on Facebook Messenger that allows users to interact with Tasmanian soldier Archie Barwick, who fought in World War I. The bot is designed to relate Barwick's experiences from his diary entries and follows his actual movements and locations throughout the battle. The bot's answers are programmed to improve the more people ask questions.
