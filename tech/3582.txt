South Korean prosecutors have outlined how a presidential aide documented instances of alleged bribery by Samsung Chief Jay Y Lee in 39 handwritten notebooks. However, Lee's lawyers maintained that the prosecution couldn't prove that Lee had asked for specific favours when he met with South Korea's ousted President Park Geun-Hye. Lee faces five years to life in prison if convicted.
