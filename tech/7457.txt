Iranian startup IKAP-Robotics has developed 'Olive', a smart interactive suitcase that can be transformed into a vehicle to carry its user. Connected through an app, the suitcase allows users to set reminders, charge devices through in-built USB port and get information about its weight. The suitcase can also be locked or unlocked remotely and tracked in real-time through the app.
