Japanese electronics maker Panasonic has invested â‚¹408 crore in a startup that makes a laundry folding robot called 'Laundroid'. The robot uses artificial intelligence and image recognition to detect what kind of clothes are put into it, folds them, and stacks the folded clothes on the inbuilt shelves. The robot is set to launch in Japan next year.
