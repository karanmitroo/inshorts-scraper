Twitter Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey on Friday apologised for allowing an advertisement promoting a white supremacist group on its platform. "We made a mistake here and we apologise. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed," Dorsey tweeted. Twitter recently suspended a number of accounts over hate speech.
