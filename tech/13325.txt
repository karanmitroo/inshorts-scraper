Japan launched world's first humanoid robot astronaut, Kirobo on Sunday from the International Space Station, Tanegashima. The 34-cm long robot will serve as a companion for astronaut Koichi Wakata and will communicate with its ground-based counterpart robot Mirata on the Earth. The robots have been designed to give emotional support to the astronauts who feel lonely in the space.
