Facebook on Monday mistakenly started asking its users in the US to support India’s Save Free Basics campaign. The company said, “We accidentally turned on this notification for some people outside India this evening for a short period of time”. The notification urges users to send a pre-filled message to TRAI in support of Free Basics, formerly known as internet.org.
