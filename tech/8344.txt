Microsoft and Austrian researchers have developed 'FlexCase', a prototype of a smart flip cover for smartphones with touch-sensitive flexible display. Users can flip pages, zoom in and out, navigate pages and rotate maps by bending the cover forward or backward. The cover can also be used as an extended visual display screen for searching and typing.
