A reporter for The New York Times took to Twitter this week to share a letter that the newspaper's editor Michiko Kakutani received from a Xerox employee in 1979. The employee objected to the use of the word "xeroxed" in an article by Kakutani. "There is no adjective 'xeroxed'. Rather, one should use copied, photocopied or duplicated," it read.
