A $300 million undersea internet cable called 'Faster' funded by Google and five other companies to connect US and Japan went live on Thursday. The 9,000-kilometre cable lands in Oregon in the US and two landing points in Japan namely Chiba and Mie prefectures. The cable's capacity of 60 Tbps is reportedly 10 million times faster than a cable modem.
