Geo-textile technology is being used for the first time to repair damages in the National Highway 08 in Assam's Karimganj district. Made from polyester or polypropylene, geo-textile fabrics have the ability to separate, filter, reinforce, protect and drain. The technology initially increases construction cost by 10-15% but repair and maintenance are not required for seven to eight years.
