A former woman engineer at Google, Kelly Ellis, lashed out at the company's human resource practices after Uber fired its SVP of engineering Amit Singhal for hiding sexual harassment allegations against him when he worked for Google. "Google invests in and partners with Uber. These guys just get shuffled around, with zero regard for women in our industry," tweeted Kelly.
