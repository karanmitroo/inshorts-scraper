US startup Rocket Innovations has developed a smart cloud-ready notebook 'Rocketbook Wave', that digitises all the notes penned by the user. A dedicated app for the notebook sends all the notes written by the user on the cloud. Interestingly, the 80-page notebook gets ready for reuse on microwaving it for three-five minutes.
