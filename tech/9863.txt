Google announced on Saturday that it will discontinue YouTube's Webcam Capture feature from 16th January next year. The feature, which was introduced in 2006, enabled the users to record videos directly on their YouTube channel without the need of any upload activity. After this announcement, the webcam capture window started displaying a warning message of the feature's termination.
