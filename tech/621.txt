Technology company Philips has unveiled the 'SmartSleep' headband that plays white noise to help sleep. The $400 headband, which was unveiled at CES 2018, attaches built-in sensors to users' forehead to detect brain activity and shares the data with a connected mobile app. When deep sleep is detected, its speakers will start playing white noise in a slow, repeating pattern.
