Microsoft Co-founder billionaire Bill Gates was asked to guess the price of everyday grocery items on a TV show. Gates guessed that a box of Rice-A-Roni (a food mix box) costed $5 and was shocked to find that the actual price was $1. He admitted that the last time he went to a supermarket was a "long time ago".
