A World War II-era machine used to exchange messages between Adolf Hitler and his generals has been found for sale on eBay for about $13.87, according to reports. The Lorenz teleprinter is stamped with an official German wartime number, the Swastika and Waffen-SS insignia. UK's National Museum of Computing, which bought the machine, is now looking for its missing components.
