US-based online camera store LensRentals earlier this week shared photos of camera gear on its blog which melted during the recent solar eclipse in the US. The post showed cameras with damaged sensors and shutters, mirrors, lenses, and even some built-in filter systems. According to the post, they had warned users to buy solar filters before renting out the lenses.
