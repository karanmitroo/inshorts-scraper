Twitter on Monday bought London-based AI startup Magic Pony Technology for a reported $150 million. Founded in 2014, Magic Pony uses machine learning to create high-quality pictures and videos from grainy footage. The services will likely be integrated into Twitter's live and video services such as Periscope and Vine. Twitter had previously acquired machine learning startups Madbits and Whetlab.
