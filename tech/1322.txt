Technology giant Google has announced that the choice of country service will no longer be indicated by domain names. Earlier users could get localised search results by visiting Google at different domains, for example, 'google.com' for the US and 'google.co.uk' for England. Google said that its users, by default, will be served the country service that corresponds to their location.
