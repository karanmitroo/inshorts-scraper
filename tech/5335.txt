The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed companies that operate search engines like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to block pre-natal sex determination advertisements within 36 hours. The court also directed the government to constitute a nodal agency to monitor such advertisements. The order came in response to a PIL seeking court's intervention over the declining sex ratio in the country.
