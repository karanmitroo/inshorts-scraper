Nintendo's shares on Monday dropped by 17% (about $6.4 billion) following the company's revelation that Pokémon Go's impact on its results will be limited as it only owns 32% of The Pokémon Company. The game, which earlier helped Nintendo double its market value in two weeks, is a collaboration between The Pokémon Company and the American game company Niantic Labs.
