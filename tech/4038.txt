In an internal memo to employees, Chinese electronics maker Huawei's Founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said the company will "fall apart" if all employees do not work hard. "Thirty-something strong men, don't work hard, just want to count money in bed, is that possible?... Huawei will not pay for those that don't work hard," the memo said.
