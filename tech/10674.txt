Taxi aggregator Uber Technologies on Thursday won the dismissal of a racketeering lawsuit by 15 Connecticut (New England) taxi and limousine companies seeking to stop Uber from doing business in the state. The plaintiffs failed to show that Uber competed unfairly, tried to lure away their drivers, or misrepresented its services, fares, and drivers' insurance coverage to passengers.
