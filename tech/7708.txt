The Twitter account of Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, was reportedly hacked on Sunday by a group called OurMine. While the tweets posted by the group have been deleted, the Twitter account of OurMine has been suspended. Costolo, however, tweeted, "looks like an old account from another service that cross posted to Twitter was compromised, not my Twitter account."
