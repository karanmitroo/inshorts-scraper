With 2,618 unfilled faculty positions (40% of total seats), the IITs will take nearly a decade to reach the ideal teacher-student ratio of 1:10 (presently around 1:15). It is worst at IIT-Roorkee(1:20) and best at the newer institutes, IIT-Ropar and IIT-Mandi(1:2). The student's intake has risen by 54% since 2006 due to 27% OBC quota, leading to the shortage.
