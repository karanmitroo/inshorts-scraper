Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and NeXT software engineer Randy Adams hid their Porsche 911 cars when businessman and potential investor Ross Perot visited them. "We have to hide the Porsches...We donâ€™t want him to think we have a lot of money," Jobs had told Adams. Perot invested $20 million in NeXT in 1987.
