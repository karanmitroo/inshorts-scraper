Commercial spaceship startup founded by billionaire Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic will resume test flights of its new spaceship 'Unity' from August this year, while attached to an aircraft. It is scheduled to begin independent, fully powered flights next year. The company's flights have been grounded since October 2014, after its 'SpaceShipTwo' broke up in mid-air, resulting in a fatal crash.
