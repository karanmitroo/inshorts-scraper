Apple has announced a voluntary recall of its AC wall plug adapters because of a “very rare” risk of them breaking and giving an electric shock. The two-prong adapters, shipped between 2003 and 2015, were designed for Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Continental Europe, New Zealand and South Korea. Currently, Apple is aware of 12 incidents of adapter malfunction worldwide.
