The world’s first digital camera, created in 1975, took photographs with a resolution of 0.01 megapixels. It took 23 seconds to capture one black-and-white image and store it on a magnetic tape cassette. Weighing about 4 kilograms, the camera was made by Kodak engineer Steven Sasson using parts discarded by the company’s manufacturing line.
