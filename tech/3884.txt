WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has offered to provide technology companies with exclusive access to CIA hacking tools that WikiLeaks possesses so they can patch software flaws. Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc replied that they welcomed submissions of flaws through normal reporting channels. CIA responded to Assange's offer saying, "Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity."
