In what is being considered a jibe at Snapchat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday said, "We do innovation to serve everyone in the community, not just the high end". He added, "I worry more and think more about what our community actually wants". Zuckerberg's statement comes amid Snapchat CEO facing backlash for allegedly calling India a "poor" country.
