Google X engineer Max Braun has created an automated bot that buys stock based on US President Donald Trump's tweets about different companies and donates the earnings. "I have a very particular set of skills that allow me to have some fun with Mr. Trump's emotional incontinence and maybe effect positive change along the way," Braun wrote in his blog.
