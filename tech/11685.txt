Scientists from the Scripps Research Institute and other institutions said they have engineered a molecule that can block infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. This discovery might lead to a new therapy for patients or an alternative to a vaccine. The scientists reportedly used an approach resembling gene therapy or transfer rather than eliciting an immune response.
