Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has criticised US President Trump's order banning US-funded groups from providing abortions globally by sharing her experience working with World Bank in India. "I saw firsthand how clinics funded by foreign aid are often the only source of health care for women. The last time the global gag rule was in effect...abortion rates doubled," she said.
