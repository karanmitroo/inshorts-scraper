Boeing has built prototype of a self-cleaning lavatory which uses ultraviolet (UV) light to sanitise the lavatory surfaces and remove bacterial odour in three seconds. The lavatory, combined with touch-less faucets and soap dispensers, claims that the UV light is not harmful to human skin. The cleaning system is also capable of lifting and closing the toilet seat by itself.
