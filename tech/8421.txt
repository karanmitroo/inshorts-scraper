Google has launched a new service called ‘My Live Case’ that lets users create custom cases for their Nexus 5X, 6 and 6P phones. Users can upload any image or map they want to be printed on their phones, and further personalize them with design, filter and styling options. The end product will be delivered to the user for $35.
