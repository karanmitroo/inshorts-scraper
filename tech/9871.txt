Microsoft on Wednesday rolled out its digital voice assistant Cortana on both Android and iOS in the US and China markets. However, Cortana in the said operating systems does not support changing settings and opening apps. Further, the ‘Hey Cortana’ voice activation feature works only on Android, and not on iOS. Initially, Microsoft had launched Cortana exclusively for Windows phones.
