Nike is set to open a five-storey store in New York, which will have a hi-technology basketball court with sensors to capture body movements and display those on a big screen. The store's escalators will have LED panels to display information and special messages. It will also have 3D-printed decorations, personalisation studio for on-demand orders, and self-lacing shoes.
