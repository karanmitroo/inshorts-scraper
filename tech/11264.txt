The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) will test its first indigenously-built, multi-object tracking radar (MOTR) during a PSLV rocket flight next month. MOTR can track 10 different objects simultaneously with a range of nearly 1,000 km, while existing radars have a range of 400 km. The 'Rs 245 crore MOTR' is a classic example of 'Make in India' project.
