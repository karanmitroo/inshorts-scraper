Users of Apple's MacBook Pro have complained about a 'popping' sound coming from the laptops. One user compared the sound to the “clicking” or “creaking” noise made on “slowly squeez[ing] a plastic bottle.” Apple has reportedly identified the cause to be a small dent on the bottom casing hitting the cooling fan which isn't covered under warranty.
