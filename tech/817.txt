Apple is reportedly planning to combine iOS and macOS apps by next year. Developers will be able to design apps that can adjust to both the platformsâ€“ touch input for iPhone or iPad, and mouse and trackpad input for Mac, reports added. Notably, iOS App Store was redesigned this year, while Mac App Store has seen no change since 2014.
