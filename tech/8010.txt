Google on Friday demonstrated the developer unit of 'Ara', a modular Android smartphone with six interchangeable modules that allows users to add a high-resolution camera, a louder speaker and swap a better battery. The modules can be ejected electronically with a voice command like, â€œokay Google, eject the camera". Google is planning the commercial release of the smartphone in 2017.
