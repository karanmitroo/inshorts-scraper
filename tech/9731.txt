YouTube has accused network provider T-Mobile of degrading its video resolutions to 480p under the latter’s ‘Binge On’ scheme. ‘Binge On’ lets users stream videos for free on services like Netflix, but in 480p resolutions. Notably, YouTube is not a part of the scheme and is alleging that its videos, which can't be streamed for free, are automatically being downgraded.
