Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at an event on Wednesday revealed he chose computer science in school instead of political science and gave up on the dream of becoming a Mayor. "I was a little bit more selfish. I wanted to see things more immediate," he added. Dorsey said he felt building software could enact change faster than public policies.
