Thermal cameras will be used to detect hidden motors in bicycles in the upcoming Tour de France, the French Sports Secretary of State announced on Monday. The technology will be used besides magnetic resonance, used by the International Cycling Union, which detected a motor earlier this year in the bike of a Belgian cyclist at the Under-23 Cyclocross World Championships.
