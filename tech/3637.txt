A fake startup by students of Yale University reportedly received applications from other interested students after it sent list of job openings to the university's Computer Science department as a joke. The startup also made a video and started a crowdfunding campaign for its fake product 'Hub'. The product, which doesn't do anything, was built to mock smart home devices.
