Google on Wednesday introduced several new features that include enabling iOS users to locate their lost or misplaced phones by googling 'I lost my phone', a feature which was launched on Android last year. Another feature would let its users directly go to their account by saying "Ok Google, show me my Google account" or by googling the account name.
