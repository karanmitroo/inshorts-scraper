Technology giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook explained why he met US President-elect Donald Trump last week by saying, "It’s very important. Governments can affect our ability to do what we do." Cook added, "We engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling."
