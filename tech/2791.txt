Several Ukrainian banks, companies, including the state power distributor, as well as the country's main airport were hit by a cyber attack on Tuesday. A blackmail virus was allegedly used in the attack which demanded $300 in Bitcoin to be sent to a certain address. Notably, Ukraine had blamed previous cyber attacks on Russia.
