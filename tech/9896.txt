In an official blogpost on Monday, micro-blogging site Twitter announced that it will no longer crop the images on users' timeline. "We are introducing this feature so that you can experience and present them as they were meant to be viewed," Twitter said. Images will not be cropped in both single and multi-photo tweets.
