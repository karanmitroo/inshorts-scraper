Russia's Sberbank in July started offering free insurance coverage for Pokémon Go mobile game players in Moscow. The insurance is valid for Pokéstops near the bank's branches across the city. “Considering the number of news from around the world about players being injured while catching Pokémon, we created a product that'll be free for the players," said the company.
