US military’s technology arm DARPA has developed a self-driving cardboard drone to transport vaccines and other medical supplies to remote areas. The drone can fly twice the distance of any fixed-range aircraft because it’s disposable. While it has no motor on board, it has a small computer and sensors to adjust the aircraft’s control and determine where it will land.
