Video sharing company YouTube has confirmed that it will stop supporting 30-second unskippable ads from next year. However, unskippable advertisement formats with 15-and 20-second-long videos will still be supported. According to a report, YouTube will also show more of six-second "bumper ads" that cannot be skipped. YouTube was acquired by Google in 2006 for about $1.65 billion.
