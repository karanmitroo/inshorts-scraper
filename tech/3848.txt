Financial services company Visa on Tuesday announced a pilot program for sunglasses that can be used to make payments by tapping the glasses against a payments machine. The sunglasses will have an NFC chip embedded on one side to enable payments. The glasses can be used in scenarios where users aren't carrying their phones or wallets, like on a beach.
