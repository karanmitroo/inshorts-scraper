Billionaire Elon Musk's tunnel making startup The Boring Company has said it will build a Hyperloop system to transport people at 965 kmph in vacuum tubes between cities. Last month Musk claimed he had "verbal government approval" to dig a Hyperloop tunnel between New York and Washington, DC. Musk had introduced the idea behind Hyperloop in 2013.
