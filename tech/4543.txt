Margarita Simonyan, Editor-in-Chief of Russian news agency RT responded to it being blocked from posting on Facebook by saying, "I'm not surprised. If the (US) Department of State could block oxygen to us, they would do it." The ban will prevent the agency from posting about Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of United States on January 20.
