Facebook is shutting down its text-based assistant 'M', which was launched in 2015. Facebook said the assistant will stop operating on January 19 and added it is taking "useful insights" from the platform to power its other artificial intelligence projects. M could solve several queries on Facebook's Messenger app such as gift recommendations and table reservations at restaurants, among others.
