US researchers have developed Ellie, a virtual psychologist, that claims to be capable of diagnosing depression. The software observes 66 points on the patientâ€™s face to read variations in facial expression, taking note of a 'flat' expression that is symptomatic of depression. Notably, surveys indicate that patients prefer to reveal personal information to Ellie over a human therapist.
