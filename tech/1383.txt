A couple in United States' Florida, who had placed an order for four plastic storage bins from Amazon, received 29 kilograms of marijuana inside the bins. The couple informed the police of the delivery, and the authorities are investigating how the drugs were shipped through the US Postal Service. The e-commerce giant later sent the couple a $150 gift card.
