Reacting to the announcement of scientists working to launch 4G on the Moon by 2019, several Twitter users complained about bad network coverage in their localities. Some other tweets read "It's a bit early for April fools isn't it!" and "Will the roaming charges be astronomical?", while one read, "I'd rather see a remote village in Africa gets 4G instead."
