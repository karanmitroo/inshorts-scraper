A shareholder has sued Twitter over claims of misleading the investors regarding growth prospects including user count and engagement, in November 2014. Twitter had promised an increase in the monthly active users to 550 million in the “intermediate” term and over a billion in the “longer term.” However, Twitter had 313 million monthly active users as of June 30, 2016.
