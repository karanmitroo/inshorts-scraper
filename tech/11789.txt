Scientists may soon be able to make invisibility cloaks and shields concealing planes using metamaterials. Hao Xin, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Arizona discovered that metamaterials can bend electromagnetic, acoustic and other types of waves backwards (negative refraction), being able to hide things depending upon the refractive index distribution.
