Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 users will no longer be able to use its digital assistant Cortana to perform a Google search. Cortana will now only be allowed to launch the Edge browser and the Bing search engine, both Microsoft-owned services. Microsoft said using a third-party search engine on Windows 10 results in a “compromised experience that is less reliable and predictable."
