A Russian research centre has unveiled a high-tech combat suit at the National University of Science and Technology which has an exoskeleton to increase performance and stamina while fighting. The helmet has a pop-up display that can be used for tasks like examining a plan of the battlefield. The gear has been likened to that of stormtroopers in Star Wars.
