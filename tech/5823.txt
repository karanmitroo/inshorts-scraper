Ride-hailing startup Uber has been using drones to advertise its carpooling service 'UberPool' to drivers stuck in traffic in Mexico City. One of the Spanish signs said, "Driving by yourself? This is why you can never see the volcanoes", referring to smog in the city. However, the company has said it will not replicate the strategy in other markets.
