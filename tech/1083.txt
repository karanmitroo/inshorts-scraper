Uber has patented a sensor system to prevent motion sickness which takes place when passengers read in the car. The patent filed focuses on self-driving cars and introduces a "sensory stimulation system". The system syncs a rider's eyes and ears by 'vibrating seats' or 'bursts of air' to create an environment which allows them to work in a moving car.
