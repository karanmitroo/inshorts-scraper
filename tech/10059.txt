To show solidarity with Paris post the terrorist attack, Facebook has enabled users to apply a photo filter in the colours of Franceâ€™s flag to their display pictures. Earlier, it had switched on its Safety Check feature for survivors to mark their safety. Facebook, in the past, used the photo filter feature for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India initiative.
