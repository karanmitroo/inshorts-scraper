Amazon is working on a free platform for schools and other educators to upload, manage and share educational materials. The company has opened an ‘Amazon Education Wait List’ where educators can sign up to receive more information on the said platform. The landing page of the waitlist reads, “[S]oon, educators... will have free and unlimited access to first-class course materials".
