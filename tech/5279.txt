Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, recently admitted that initially he "didn't think Google would be that successful". Schmidt recalled that he had said, "Who cares about a search engine? Who uses search engines", when initially asked to interview for the company. Google is presently the second most valuable brand in the world.
