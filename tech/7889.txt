Alibaba has launched an Android app called 'Privacy Knight', which lets users lock the apps in their smartphones through a selfie of themselves. The selfie can unlock the protected apps within one second. It also captures selfies of intruders who try to unlock the protected apps and comes with a privacy vault to hide private photos and videos.
