Australia-based researchers have invented a 'flip-flop' technology that allows quantum bits, basic units of information in quantum computers, to be placed several nanometres apart and still remain coupled. The qubit can be controlled using electric signals, instead of magnetic ones. The flip-flop design promises to make large-scale manufacture of quantum chips cheaper and easier, said researchers.
