US' Federal Trade Commission has obtained a court order forbidding a Florida-based man from falsely claiming he was hired by government to fix people's computers. The man allegedly sent fake press releases and spam messages to consumers, saying it was his job to remove tracking software from their computers. He has been asked to shut his websites and phone numbers.
