Facebook is seeking to emulate Twitter's popular trending topics feature with its own version that will show its users a "personalised" list of topics being talked about on the social media. Facebook on Thursday rolled out the feature in the US, UK, Canada, India and Australia on only desktop version for now and it is being tested on mobile devices.
