Instagram on Tuesday announced 'Instagram Stories' that lets users share videos and photos which will only be visible for 24 hours from the time of posting. Instagram Co-founder Kevin Systrom credited Snapchat for developing the stories format, adding that it's about putting "your own spin on it". The feature will launch on iOS and Android over the next few weeks.
