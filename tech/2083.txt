A security researcher on Tuesday claimed that weather forecasting service AccuWeather's iOS app tracks users' location without permission. According to the researcher, the app requests location from users for providing weather data and sends it to a third-party, even if the device's location sharing setting is off. It reportedly also shares name of Wi-Fi router the user is connected to.
