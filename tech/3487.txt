Chennai went missing from Google Maps for a while on Tuesday, according to The New Indian Express. Google Maps appeared to have marked Chennai as Kovur, which is a town located to the west of Chennai, even as other districts around Chennai were marked correctly. Meanwhile, a town in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh is also known as Kovur.
