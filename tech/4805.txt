Several Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge users have claimed the lens of their handset's camera shattered without any impact. "The camera glass shattered like a miniature bullet hole," claimed one of the users. While Samsung is yet to acknowledge the issue, Galaxy S7 range has been named as the most difficult to repair by popular gadget repair company iFixit.
