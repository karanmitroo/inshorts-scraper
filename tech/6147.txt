Dating app Tinder is testing a new feature in Australia called 'Boost' that will put a user's profile on the top of nearby profiles for 30 minutes. Tinder claims that the Boost feature could increase a user's profile views by up to 10 times. Once launched, the feature can be purchased by the users any time they want.
