Google-funded $30 million-Lunar XPrize race to the Moon, which began 10 years ago, is set to end as no team will be able to make a launch attempt by the March 31 deadline. The competition was for privately-funded teams to be the first to land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit data back to Earth.
