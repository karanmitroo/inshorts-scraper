In view of the odd-even vehicle rule applicable from January 1, AAP-led Delhi government on Friday re-launched the PoochhO app to enable ease of availing taxis and auto-rickshaws in the national capital. Delhi's Transport Minister Gopal Rai said that the app allows commuters to book rides of nearby autos and taxis belonging to drivers who have registered on the app.
