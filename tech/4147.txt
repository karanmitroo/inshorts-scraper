American aerospace manufacturer SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has revealed that its robotic Martian lander Red Dragon won't be ready in 2018 as the company had planned. Shotwell added that they're now "looking more in the 2020 timeframe" for the mission to the Red Planet. The company's original plan was to send a mission to Mars by 2022.
