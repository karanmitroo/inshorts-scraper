Elon Musk-led SpaceX will launch Hewlett Packard Enterprise's 'Spaceborne Computer' to the International Space Station on August 14. The launch is part of HPE's joint experiment with NASA to test if high performance computing hardware can survive in outer space conditions. Although the supercomputer's hardware hasn't been modified, the team has built an enclosure to withstand conditions in space.
