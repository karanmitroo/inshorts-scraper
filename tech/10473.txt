Laurene Powell Jobs, late Apple founder Steve Jobs’ wife, has reportedly started a $50-million initiative called ‘XQ: The Super School Project’ that aims at creating high schools with a different approach to education. The campaign, that will mainly concentrate on school schedules, curriculums, and technologies, seeks to crowdsource new ideas that will then be judged for implementation in 2016.
