The world's first search engine Archie, that was launched 26 years ago on September 10, 1990, could locate a file on the internet only upon searching the name of the file, as it did not index the files' content. It helped users get "descriptive information about freely available...documents, images, sounds and services on the network...worldwide", explained Archie creator Alan Emtage.
