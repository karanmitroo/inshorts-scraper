Photo-sharing app Instagram is fixing a bug that has caused some users’ follower counts to increase, the company said. The increase in people’s follower counts will reportedly disappear once the bug is completely fixed. "We’re fixing the bug and counts will be made accurate once we’ve got it fixed,” a company spokesperson said.
