Possibility Pictures, producer of American movie "To Write Love On Her Arms", has sued Sony Pictures for failing to safeguard the movie from piracy following the 2014 "Sony Hack". In the hack, Sony's confidential data including copies of then-unreleased films were leaked online. The plaintiffs claimed the movie was downloaded 20,000 times and asked for around $8.7 million in compensation.
