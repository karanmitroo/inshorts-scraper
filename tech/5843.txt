Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba recently demonstrated its app 'VR Pay', that will let customers shopping in virtual reality to make payments by nodding their heads. People using virtual reality goggles to browse Alibaba's virtual reality shopping malls will be able to pay for their purchases without taking off the goggles. The users, however, would still need to enter their password.
