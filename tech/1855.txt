US and China-based researchers are developing electronic devices that can be triggered to dissolve through exposure to water molecules. In a prototype, electronics built on a film remained stable until surrounding moisture triggered a chemical breakdown to digest the inorganic material. The work holds promise for eco-friendly disposable electronics that dissolve within the body, said researchers.
