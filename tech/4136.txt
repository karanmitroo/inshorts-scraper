In a recent interview, Bill Gates said that he believes there should be a tax on robots who replace human jobs. Gates said the freed-up labour can help the elderly or children with special needs, but "you can't just give up that income tax". He added that he doesn't think "robot companies are going to be outraged" over the tax.
