Apple has created a short film starring a non-verbal and autistic teen named Dillan Barmache to celebrate Autism Acceptance Month. The film called 'Dillanâ€™s Voice' shows how the teen is able to communicate with the help of an iPad and an augmented and alternative communication app. Notably, Dillan also delivered his school's graduation speech with the help of these tools.
