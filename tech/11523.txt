In a move to solve various environmental problems like smog, greenhouse gases and energy crisis, China is planning to build a space solar power station, 36,000 kilometres above the ground. The energy generated through the solar panels would be converted to microwaves or lasers and transmitted to a collector on Earth. It will become the largest-ever space project, if realised.
