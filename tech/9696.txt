A group of American researchers have found a possible gene-editing technique to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare form of muscular dystrophy that results in muscle degeneration and premature death. Researchers reported the study in the journal Science, mentioning a successful initial test done on a mouse with a defective dystrophin gene that improved the overall muscle strength.
