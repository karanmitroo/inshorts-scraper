An Israeli company claims to have developed a technology that can charge a smartphone in just 30 seconds and an electric-car in few minutes. The battery uses nano-technology to synthesize artificial molecules & can store a much higher charge more quickly. The battery is currently too bulky and the company believes that a slimmer battery will be ready by 2016.
