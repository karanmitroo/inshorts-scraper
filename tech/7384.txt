Art collective teamLab on Saturday opened a digital art exhibition in Tokyo, Japan, which allows visitors to engage with interactive artworks. The 3,000-square-metre exhibition features a kaleidoscopic digital maze where visitors can control the intensity and hue of the lights. It also features a 'flower universe' installation into which visitors can release butterflies using their smartphones.
