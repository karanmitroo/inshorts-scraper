Celebrating the 'Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan' week, the Ministry of Agriculture has launched two mobile apps, Crop Insurance and AgriMarket, for farmers. Crop Insurance allows farmers to get complete details related to the insurance cover available in their area and to calculate insurance premium for notified crops. AgriMarket enables farmers to get prices of crops available in markets.
