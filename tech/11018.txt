The Ginger emoji was Friday unveiled on Google Play Store for Android, giving redheads their own set of emojis. Tech firm Swyft Media has also released its own "emoji keyboard" to help ginger people communicate more effectively. The move follows an international outcry about the lack of such emoji, with an online petition for its introduction reaching over 15,000 signatures.
