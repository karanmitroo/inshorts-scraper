Google on Monday launched a pilot program for a new commuter carpooling service in Israel. The service will be offered through an app RideWith which will use Waze, a Google-owned navigation app to learn the most frequent routes which drivers take for work. The app will match these drivers with the people looking for a ride in the same direction.
