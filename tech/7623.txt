Twitter on Monday announced a new image-editing feature called '#Stickers' to let users add emojis, props and accessories to make their photos searchable. Tapping on a sticker in a tweeted photo will take users to a new timeline, where they can see how others are using that sticker. The feature will launch across all platforms in the next few weeks.
