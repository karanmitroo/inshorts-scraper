Richard Branson-owned commercial spaceflight company Virgin Galactic on Friday unveiled its new spaceship 'VSS Unity'. The two-pilot, winged spaceship with a capacity of six passengers will take its passengers on five-minute voyages into the suborbital space at $250,000 a ticket. VSS Unity is a new version of the company's SpaceShipTwo, which crashed during a test flight in 2014.
