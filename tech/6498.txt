Samsung on Thursday announced that it would give a free Gear VR headset to its Indian customers who pre-booked the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, which is being recalled over fire-prone battery concerns. The company will also give an Oculus content voucher worth â‚¹3,300 bundled with the free headsets. The device is yet to be officially available for buying in India.
