Social networking platform Snapchat has started notifying users when 'Snaps' are being recorded using the screen recording feature on iOS 11. The update will work on all iPhone models including recently launched iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Earlier, the company allowed iOS 11 users to record other users' 'Snaps', without them being aware of it.
