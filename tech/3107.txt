A couple in Israel has been fined $2,200 (â‚¹1.4 lakh) for sending "misleading" emojis, including dancing and champagne emojis, to a prospective landlord. The landlord had removed his property listing, believing they wanted to rent the property. He moved the court when the couple stopped talking to him, and the court ruled in his favour saying their emojis conveyed "optimism."
