Sphero on Monday launched its new robot 'SPARK+', priced at $130, that teaches basic principles of coding to the kids. The fully programmable waterproof rolling robot lets kids customise the speed, angle and colour of the robot through a dedicated app. Creations made with the robot can also be shared with a community through the app.
