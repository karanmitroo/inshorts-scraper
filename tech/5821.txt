MIT engineers and a designer have created a $1,500 smart crib called 'Snoo', which mimics the sound of a mother's womb to put a baby to sleep. With three built-in microphones, the crib detects when a baby is crying, and starts playing the sound. The crib also starts shaking slowly to help a child go to sleep.
