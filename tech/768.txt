US-based developer Pheramor has developed a dating app which matches its users based on DNA obtained from the swab taken from their cheek. The app then combines the information about the users' genes with their social media posts to find a match. The 'Pheramor' app, which focusses on 18-44 age group, is expected to launch on February 10, 2018.
