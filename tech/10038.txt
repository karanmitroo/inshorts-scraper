The process of planetary formation from cosmic dust has been observed for the first time by astronomers from the University of Arizona. Using two telescopes, the astronomers picked up signature emissions characteristic of very hot material falling on  a growing planet near a star. The planetary system and the star were observed near Taurus, 450 light years from Earth.
