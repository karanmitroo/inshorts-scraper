A Cambridge University-led research has successfully incorporated washable, stretchable and breathable electronic circuits into fabric. The textile electronic devices are based on low-cost, sustainable printing of inks based on graphene, a 2D form of carbon. The fabrics developed are comfortable to wear and can survive up to 20 cycles in a typical washing machine, said researchers.
