Uber Co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick has revealed that users in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will be able to hail self-driving cabs starting later this month. The self-driving cars will be supervised by humans in the driver's seat for now. The fleet consists of modified Volvo XC90 SUVs with sensors that use cameras, lasers, radars, and GPS receivers.
