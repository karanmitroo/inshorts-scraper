Polaroid has launched its new 'Pop' digital camera that features 20-megapixel CMOS sensor and prints 3x4-inch coloured photos in under a minute. The camera's integrated printer uses zero ink technology that heats and colourises cyan, yellow and magenta dye crystals embedded in the paper. The camera includes a 3.97-inch touchscreen for framing shots and navigating the camera's menu.
