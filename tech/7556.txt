Unlike Googleâ€™s tradition of naming Android versions after desserts in an alphabetic order, the first two versions were called Android 1.0 and 1.1. The first version to be named after a dessert was Android 1.5, named Cupcake. The subsequent versions were called Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, Kitkat, Lollipop, Marshmallow, and the latest one, Nougat.
