Coinciding with Halloween, Asteroid 2015 TB145, also being called the 'Great Pumpkin,' will fly past the earth on October 31, NASA said. Appearing at a safe distance, the asteroid can be viewed using small telescopes at 3.35 am IST when it comes closest to the earth at roughly 490,000 km. It will not affect anything on the moon or earth.
