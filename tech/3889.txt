Elon Musk-led Tesla has set up a solar farm of 54,978 solar panels on Hawaii's Kauai island to power it entirely on solar energy at night. The farm includes 272 Tesla Powerpack batteries that store solar power throughout the day and power the island at night. Tesla claims to save 60.5 lakh litres of fossil fuels annually with the farm.
