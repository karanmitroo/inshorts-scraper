San Francisco-based startup Molekule has developed a molecular air purifier that uses a new technology, called Photo Electrochemical Oxidation, to remove contaminants like bacteria, allergens, mold and chemicals from air. The $799 cylindrical device treatsâ€‹ air using UV-A light, which breaks down contaminant compounds into non-harmful elements such as water, carbon dioxide and elemental nitrogen.
