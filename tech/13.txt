Indonesia has blocked microblogging and social networking website Tumblr over pornographic content. The government said it blocked Tumblr after the company failed to reply to its February letter demanding the removal of pornographic content from the platform within 48 hours. Earlier, Google removed its gay dating app Blued from the Indonesian version of its online store over government demands.
