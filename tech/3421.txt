Microblogging platform Twitter has posted its first revenue decline to $548 million in the first quarter of 2017. However, the company's shares rose by more than 10% in pre-market trading as analysts had expected the revenue decline to be much steeper. The 11-year-old company, which went public in 2013, has never posted a profit so far.
