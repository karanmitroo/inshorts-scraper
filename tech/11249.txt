Apple Inc. has acquired Coherent Navigation, a global positioning company founded in 2008, for an undisclosed amount. Many of Coherentâ€™s employees including the former CEO Paul Lego have reportedly already started working at Apple. Coherent's system is believed to be much more precise than the "consumer grade" GPS systems and this acquisition will reportedly better the much criticised Apple Maps.
