Facebook on Wednesday awarded a $50k 'Internet Defense Prize' to the German researchers - Johannes Dahse and Thorsten Holz - for a paper outlining how to find flaws hackers could exploit. "We decided to focus on creating greater opportunities and incentives for researchers to produce work that actually protects people," Facebook security engineering manager John Flynn said.
