Scientists have discovered Weyl fermion, a massless particle that if applied to next-generation electronics, could allow for free and efficient flow of electricity and pave way for new types of quantum computing. Theorised 85 years ago by Hermann Weyl, it has been long sought by scientists because of it being a possible building block of other subatomic particles.
