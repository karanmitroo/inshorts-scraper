British startup Riversimple has unveiled a zero-emission car that runs on hydrogen. Named Rasa, the car functions by passing hydrogen through a small fuel cell, which then forms water and electricity driving four motors inside the vehicle. Rasa has only 18 moving parts and can run for 300 miles on 85 ounces of hydrogen. It is expected to launch in 2018.
