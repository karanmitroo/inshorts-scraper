Messaging app Line is shutting down its music streaming service MixRadio in the coming weeks. Stating that the business isn’t financially viable, Line said that MixRadio’s “future growth would be difficult to ensure”. The company had acquired MixRadio from Microsoft in December 2014, and made it available on Android and iOS in May 2015.
