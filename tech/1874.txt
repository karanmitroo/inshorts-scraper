Social media giant Facebook is reportedly planning to spend $1 billion on original shows in 2018 for its recently launched video tab Watch. Facebook hosts the original shows with its partners, including content from Freethink Media, MLB, and Discovery Channel. It allows users to subscribe to their favourite shows on Watch and offers sections like "Today's Spotlight" and "Popular Now."
