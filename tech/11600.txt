On its Independence Day on March 26, the Bangladesh government will add 400,000 new Bengali words to Google Translate. The initiative is being organised by Bangladesh's Information and Communication Technology division, Bangladesh Computer Council and Google Developer Group Bangla. The inclusion of so many words on the Internet in a single day would be a new record, an official said.
