Researchers at the University of Exeter have developed a new Terahertz camera that can observe at a microscopic level and can be used to find defects in microchips. The camera can scan through solid objects at resolutions almost double than usual terahertz imaging technologies. Scientists claim that the discovery will help scan optically opaque objects and help detect skin cancer.
