DRDO Armament Research Board chairman SK Salwan Saturday said that India is efficient enough to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), which can hit targets beyond the range of 10,000 kms. He added that India has become self sufficient in laser technology after a ban on import of components for laser technology, imposed by the USA, UK and other countries.
