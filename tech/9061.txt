 The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has declared all the hoverboards including self-balancing scooters and single-wheel devices currently available in the market as unsafe. "Consumers risk serious injury or death if their self-balancing scooters ignite and burn," CPSC said. It has also asked all hoverboard makers and sellers to voluntarily take the devices off the market.
