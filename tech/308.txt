Ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has said the cab-hailing startup's relationship with Google was "like a little brother to a big brother." Kalanick's statement came as part of his testimony during the trade secrets trial between Uber and Google spinoff Waymo, which began on Monday. Earlier, the documents in the trial had revealed that Kalanick encouraged his staff to cheat.
