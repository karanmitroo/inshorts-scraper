SpaceX Founder Elon Musk on Friday took to Twitter to ask for help in understanding the launchpad explosion of the aerospace manufacturer's Falcon 9 rocket earlier this month. "Support & advice from NASA, AFPAA (US Air Force) & others much appreciated", Musk tweeted. He also asked witnesses to share any footage they had of SpaceX's "most difficult and complex failure...ever".
