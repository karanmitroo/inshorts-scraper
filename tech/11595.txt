A Hainan Airlines flight in China Saturday completed the country's first commercial flight using biofuel, made from waste cooking oil collected from restaurants. The move is seen as a scientific advancement to promote green and low-emission fuel in the country. In 2012, Canada had witnessed the world's first flight entirely powered by biofuel.
