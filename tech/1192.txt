US-based smartphone app maker Cromulent Labs has developed an app called 'Notcho' which lets users hide the 'notch' in Apple's iPhone X. Users can choose from some pre-loaded backgrounds within Notcho to conceal the notch or import photos and images for a notch-free wallpaper for the iPhone X. However, Notcho doesn't hide the notch while the apps are running.
