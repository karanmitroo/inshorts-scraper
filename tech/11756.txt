Scientists from the Universities of Leeds and York used a computer-based model to identify a code in the viral genome and find a way to “jam” the genetic code to stop the virus from replicating. Professor Peter Stockley, who was in-charge of the study said that the breakthrough could save future generations from the common cold and other serious illnesses.
