Snapchat's Co-founder Evan Spiegel's fiance and former Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr has said that she can't stand Facebook copying the features of Snapchat. "Can they not be innovative? Do they have to steal all of my partner’s ideas? I’m so appalled by that," said Kerr. "It’s a disgrace. How do they sleep at night?” she added.
