Dating app Tinder has collaborated with Giphy to allow users to send GIFs to potential matches. In other updates, users can now ‘like’ messages on the app by hitting a little green heart icon and also upload their Tinder profile photos directly from their camera rolls. Further, emojis will now be displayed in a larger format on the app.
