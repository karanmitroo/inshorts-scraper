Facebook has announced that it is working on a small unmanned helicopter called "Tether-tenna" to wirelessly provide the internet to disaster-struck areas. The helicopter, tethered to a fibre line and a power source on the ground, can remain airborne for at least 24 hours. Facebook is currently figuring out how the helicopter can survive high winds and lightning.
