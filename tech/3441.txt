Days after a Jharkhand government website made Aadhaar details of more than 10 lakh people public, the Union Ministry of Water and Sanitation's website has now made Aadhaar numbers public. The Aadhaar numbers that went public belonged to the beneficiaries of the Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin. The details were removed from the website after the news of the breach emerged.
