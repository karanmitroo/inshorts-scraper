Google has started testing the personalised version of its virtual assistant Google Now, integrated with Android devices and Search. A new feature called 'Explore Interests' will let users train Google Now to deliver precise information according to users' interests, like sports, movies, people, stocks and more. It will use search history, location and other details to make exact recommendations.
