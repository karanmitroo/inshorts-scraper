A Silicon Valley-based startup named 'Eyefluence' is working on a technology that would allow users to control their computer screens with their eyes. The technology includes a pair of eye-tracking augmented reality glasses equipped with cameras that preview the computer's screen. It allows users to click on icons with a glance and send messages by dictating.
