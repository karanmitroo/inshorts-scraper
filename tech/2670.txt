Korean startup TEGway has created a device to let users feel heat, cold or even pain in virtual reality. The flexible device, which can be added to joysticks, gloves, and chairs, can rapidly change its temperature between 4 to 40 degrees Celsius. By simultaneously producing both heat and cold, it also simulates a pinch on users' skin to produce pain.
