A Russian web studio has posted a job offer for a fake programmer who wears glasses and 'worn-out' sweaters. The job entails saying, "What kind of fool wrote this code?" when clients enter the studio. The company said it wanted to add workforce as clients view it as a short-lived enterprise when they see only three people at the office.
