WikiLeaks on Friday put online a searchable database of 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments sent to and from top figures in the US Democratic National Committee (DNC). Many of these emails contain personal and financial information of citizens. WikiLeaks hasnâ€™t identified the source of the leak but it says the leak is "part one of our new Hillary Leaks series."
