A 136-kilogramâ€‹ autonomous mall security robot at the Stanford Shopping Center in Silicon Valley ran over a one-year-old boy last week and left him with a swollen foot. The five-feet robot kept moving after knocking down the boy. The robot, a Knightscope K5, is used to recognise known shoplifters and report unusual noises to the mall's security team.
