Twitter on Monday announced that it is rolling out changes to its 140-character limit, which were first announced in May this year. @Usernames in replies and media attachments like photos, GIFs, videos and polls will no longer count as characters. The micro-blogging platform will also let users Quote Tweet tweets without counting them as characters.
