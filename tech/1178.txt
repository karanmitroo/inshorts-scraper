Intel CEO Brian Krzanich left Trump's Manufacturing Council in August in light of violence in Virginia. Krzanich said, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier's decision to quit from the council triggered him to leave as things became politicised after Trump criticised Frazier's decision. Frazier's decision came after Trump said that both the alt-right and left-wing supporters were responsible for the violence.
