France-based startup C-Way developed a new GPS-enabled smartwatch for kids that can be synced using a mobile application. The app will also allow parents to set a schedule for their kids, who will receive alerts on the watches accordingly. The smart wearable would require a data connection to operate and would last around 48 hours on a single charge.
