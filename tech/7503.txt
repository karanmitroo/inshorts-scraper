Snapchat on Wednesday introduced a new feature called 'Memories' that will allow its users to save snaps and stories indefinitely. The service, which initially enabled its users to communicate using images that were explicitly short-lived, will backup all the 'Memories' to its servers instead of users' camera roll. The new feature will start rolling out selectively over the next month.
