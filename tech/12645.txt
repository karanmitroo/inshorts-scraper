Following the “Heartbleed” case, technology companies, including Google and Facebook, have reportedly pledged to donate at least $100K a year for three years to OpenSSL Foundation so that the group could hire more full-time developers. Surprisingly, OpenSSL, which powers almost 75% of the internet, has just one full-time developer as the foundation was receiving only $2K in donations every year.
