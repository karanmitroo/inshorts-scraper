Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that he doesn't regret firing James Damore, the company's ex-engineer who wrote a memo questioning Google's diversity efforts. Pichai added he regrets that people misunderstand that Google fired him because of a political belief. He emphasised that in context of a workplace, where Google wants an inclusive environment, firing him was the right decision.
