US-based startup Zero Mass Water has developed solar panels that pull out drinking water from sunlight and air. The panels, called Source, draw air through a fan from where nano-materials absorb the water and  help separate the water from the material. After condensation, the water flows into a reservoir and a mineral block adds magnesium and calcium in it.
