Microsoft has developed an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot called Tay to conduct real-world research on the conversational language of millennials. Aimed at indulging in conversation like teenagers, Tay is available on Twitter, GroupMe, Kik, Snapchat and Facebook. Besides straightforward chatting, the robot can also tell jokes and stories, make memes out of photos, and deliver a horoscope.
