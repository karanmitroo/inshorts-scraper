American company Verizon, which is buying Yahoo, had sought a $925 million discount on the all-cash deal which was originally priced $4.83 billion, according to regulatory filing. The discount was sought by Verizon after Yahoo revealed massive online security breaches last year. Verizon even considered killing off the deal before the price was reduced by $350 million to $4.48 billion.
