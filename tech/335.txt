World's first robot citizen Sophia is expected to make a public appearance at a global technology event this month in Hyderabad. The humanoid, designed in British actress Audrey Hepburn's image by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics, was given citizenship by Saudi Arabia last year. Sophia made her first appearance in India draped in a sari at IIT Bombay last December.
