Chinese startup Moikit has developed a smart bottle 'Seed' priced between $130-$150, that tracks the user's water consumption, compiles health data and gives water intake reminders. Seed comes with an LED touchscreen cap that displays reminders, temperature and stale water warnings. Compatible with other health apps and devices, the bottle can be controlled through a dedicated Android and iOS app.
