A Delhi court on Thursday directed Google India to remove content allegedly containing hate speeches against the Sikh religion and its gurus within a week. This comes after a woman, Sakshi Bhardwaj, allegedly uploaded derogatory content against Sikh gurus. Sikhs are likely to feel grave insult to their religious sentiments if the videos continued to circulate, the court said.
