A Californian woman has sued Apple for intentionally 'breaking' FaceTime on iOS 6, forcing users to download iOS 7 and save money. Old iPhones like 4 and 4S were allegedly rendered unusable as they "buckled under the weight" of iOS 7. The complaint refers to Apple's internal emails indicating it changed how FaceTime works to cut spending on third-party servers.
