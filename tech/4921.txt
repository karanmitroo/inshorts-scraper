Facebook Messenger has launched Group Video Chat on desktops and both the Android and iOS platforms, allowing up to 50 people to join a video chat at one time. A video icon in the upper right corner of the screen activates the feature. While up to six people can be seen at once, other friends can join chat via voice.
