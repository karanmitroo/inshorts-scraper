The Beijing Intellectual Property Office has ordered Apple to halt sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, after ruling that it violated the design patents of the Shenzhen-based firm Baili. The Chinese company sued Apple for copying the external design of its 100C smartphone. Apple has appealed at the Beijing Intellectual Property Court asking to revoke the office's ruling.
