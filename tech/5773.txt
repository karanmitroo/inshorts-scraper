US President Obama on Thursday mocked the discontinued Samsung Galaxy Note 7 while describing issues in deploying the 'ObamaCare' Act. "When one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone, and it has a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it, they upgrade. Unless it catches fire...then they just pull it off the market," he said.
