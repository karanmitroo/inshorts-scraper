Dutch-Brazilian visual artist RafaÃ«l Rozendaal has created a website called 'BlankWindows.com' that contains only blank windows. Users can drag and rearrange the windows and resize them by clicking on one of the window's corners. Rozendaal, who says that he "uses the internet as his canvas", has made 106 other websites with different patterns and effects.
