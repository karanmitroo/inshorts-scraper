Snapchat has denied a former employee's claim alleging that CEO Evan Spiegel in 2015 had said, "This app is only for rich people...I don't want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain". Responding to the claim, Snapchat said, "This is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It's available worldwide to download for free."
