US-based high-speed transport technology startup Virgin Hyperloop One has unveiled a navigation app to offer a digital demonstration of the passenger experience. The app, revealed at CES 2018, will let users book a ride in real-time and have access to other modes of transportation including public, private, and ride-sharing services. It will further let users virtually pay for their ride.
