Talking about technology's impact on people's privacy, Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak said, "Technology is taking away our privacy. Everything I do is accumulated by Google, Amazon etc and that's bothersome". "But Apple doesn't do that", he added. Wozniak, who is currently visiting India, also said technology won't take away jobs, but "the next generation will have different kinds of jobs."
