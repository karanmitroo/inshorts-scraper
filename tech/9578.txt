US-based aerospace manufacturer SpaceX will attempt to land an older version of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating landing pad in the Pacific Ocean after its launch on January 17, according to reports. After two failed attempts of the same mission last year, the third attempt will see SpaceXâ€™s vehicle carry a NASA ocean monitoring satellite.
