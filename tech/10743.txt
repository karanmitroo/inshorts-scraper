In the honour of its 20th anniversary, Yahoo is set to bring back the company’s iconic billboard on Interstate 80 in Silicon Valley. It had gone up in 1999 and after surviving four different CEOs, was taken down in 2011. With an inaugural message that reads, "It's good to be back,” the construction of the new billboard is near completion.
