Japan's Fair Trade Commission has raided Amazon's office in Japan on suspicion of antitrust practices, Nikkei reported on Monday. Amazon Japan allegedly imposed several conditions on retailers including forcing them to sell products at a lower price. A Fair Trade Commission spokesman said he could not confirm the report but added, "I won't say the contents are incorrect."
