Following a nearly 30% collapse of business-oriented social network LinkedIn’s share value on Thursday, Facebook is now worth ten times more than LinkedIn and Twitter combined. While LinkedIn’s market capitalisation (m-cap) got eroded by around $7 billion to fall to $18.35 billion, Twitter’s m-cap stands at $11.55 billion. In comparison, Facebook has an m-cap of $311.38 billion.
