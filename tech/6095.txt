Facebook on Monday rolled out a new 'Marketplace' feature that lets users buy and sell items, including electronics and apparel, with the nearby users. Product's name, description, price and seller's location is required before it's listed for sale. Available under a 'shop' icon on the bottom of the app, it has currently launched in US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
