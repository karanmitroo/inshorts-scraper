Social networking giant Facebook Monday clarified the types of posts it blocks from its site. Besides banning terrorist organisations like the IS, FB also bans supporting groups involved in "criminal or hateful behaviour". Further, it removes "photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing on fully exposed buttocks". Threatening people with physical or financial harm is also prohibited.
