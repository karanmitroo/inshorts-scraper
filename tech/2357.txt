Google parent company Alphabet's X research lab is developing a system for storing renewable energy using cold antifreeze and hot salt. Alphabet claims the storage system codenamed 'Malta' can be located anywhere with the potential to last longer than lithium-ion batteries. The system takes in energy in the form of electricity during peak hours and stores it for later use.
