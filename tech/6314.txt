Nintendo has launched a $35 wearable called 'Pokémon Go Plus' which pairs with the user's smartphone and allows playing mobile game Pokémon Go without the phone. The wearable vibrates and lights up in different colours if a player is near a PokéStop or a Pokémon. The wearable also supports additional features like tracking steps for hatching eggs.
