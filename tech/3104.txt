French officials have opened an investigation into the possibility that an iPhone 6s and iPad Mini 4 could have caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 804 in 2016 which killed 66 people. The theory suggests that the Apple products, belonging to the plane's first officer, might have overheated and started a fire after being plugged into an incorrect socket.
