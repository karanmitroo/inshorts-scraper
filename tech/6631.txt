Five Don Bosco students from Goa have designed a robot that can clean the windows of high-rise buildings from outside. “[C]urrently used machines run on electricity whereas we have employed pneumatic cylinders, which use compressed air to work,” a student said. The wireless, remote-controlled prototype runs on message commands and Bluetooth, and can clean 1 square metre in two minutes.
