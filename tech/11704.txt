French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve met with representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter in San Francisco to work directly with French officials during a live investigation and to immediately remove terrorist propaganda when authorities alert them to it. The one-day visit comes weeks after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris left 20 people dead, including three terrorists.
