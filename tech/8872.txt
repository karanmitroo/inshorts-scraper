NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who tested Microsoft’s HoloLens aboard the International Space Station, has said that “virtual reality has a lot of potential”. He added that the headset can enable scientists on the ground to directly write things in an astronaut's field of view. Kelly also said that the device didn't make anyone feel disoriented in the weightlessness of space.
