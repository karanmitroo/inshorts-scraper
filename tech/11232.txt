The ISRO announced on Tuesday that the fully assembled Astrostat, India's first space observatory, was ready for intensive tests before its launch in October. The 1,650kg satellite will orbit the Earth equatorially at 650km to study distant stars, black holes and other cosmic objects. This launch will put India in an elite league with the US, Europe, Russia and Japan.
