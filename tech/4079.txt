When Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was 12 years old, he called up Hewlett-Packard (HP) Co-founder Bill Hewlett and asked for some spare parts to build a frequency counter. After a 20-minute telephone call, Hewlett agreed to give Jobs the spare parts and also offered him an internship. During his internship, Jobs used to assemble frequency counters at HP.
