Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday took to Twitter to tweet that he is "disappointed" with US President Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of Paris climate agreement. The US would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the 195-nation accord. Paris climate agreement is the first legally binding global deal to fight climate change.
