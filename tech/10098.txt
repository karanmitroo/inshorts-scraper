A policeman in California pulled over one of Google's self-driving cars on Thursday for riding along at a "cautious pace". The car, moving at 24 miles per hour (mph), was holding up traffic on a road with a 35 mph speed limit, police said. Laws in California allow driverless cars on roads but impose a 35 mph maximum speed limit.
