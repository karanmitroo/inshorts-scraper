The US government on Wednesday banned Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab's software over fear of Russian influence on the firm. The US Department of Homeland Security said the department "is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies." It further directed the agency to develop plans to discontinue the software.
