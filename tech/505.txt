WhatsApp Co-founder Jan Koum has revealed that he conceived the idea of creating the messaging app after being annoyed about missing calls at the gym. He wanted to create an app that could communicate to people whether he was free or not. Koum added that he was "so happy" when WhatsApp was launched and "so disappointed when nobody used it."
