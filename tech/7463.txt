A New York-based entrepreneur has developed a smart LED bag called 'LiLu Smart Bag', which responds to music beats though various light formations. A dedicated app for the bag allows users to take control of the bag's LED panel, sensitivity towards music and check the bag's battery. LiLu is waterproof and claims to last for 10 hours on single charge.
