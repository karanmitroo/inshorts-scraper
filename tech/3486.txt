The Ministry of Electronics and IT has directed internet service providers (ISPs) to block the distribution and transmission of child sexual abuse content by July 31. The directive was issued after the recommendation of an inter-ministerial committee that was constituted to recommend solutions to address the issue of child sexual abuse material following a Supreme Court order.
