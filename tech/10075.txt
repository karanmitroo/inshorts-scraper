Researchers from the University of Washington have for the first time used a laser beam to refrigerate water and other liquids in real life conditions. The team used an infrared laser to cool water by 2.2Â°C, considered a major breakthrough in the field. The potential applications include cooling of microprocessors and studying biological processes by slowing them.
