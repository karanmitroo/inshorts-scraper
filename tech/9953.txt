Digits, Twitter’s password-free login service, has introduced itself on Apple's tvOS operating system. This will let developers integrate Digits’ login interface in their apps, consequently enabling users to directly login into Apple TV via a unique code. Currently, users manually type their passwords with an on-screen keyboard. Recently, Facebook executed the same idea with its own SDK for tvOS.
