An Australian mine surveying company has lost around â‚¹70 lakh after eagles knocked down nine of its drones used for the aerial survey of mines. The company painted the drones to look like baby eagles and carried out nearly 50 successful drone flights. However, the eagles soon figured out the truth and started attacking the drones again.
