A new emoji-based coding language, Emojicode, enables programmers to build fast, cross-platform applications using emojis. Open-source and multi-paradigm, Emojicode aims to become the first high-level programming language that uses emojis to structure a program and its flow.Â It can be executed by the Emojicode Real-Time Engine, which is claimed to be faster than the average virtual machine.
