Following complaints about microphone failure on Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, Google has recommended users to get the faulty devices replaced. Some users reported a total audio input block and others claimed the microphone works only when recording video. Google Product Management VP Brian Rakowski said that applying heat with a hairdryer might fix the issue, but suggested against it.
