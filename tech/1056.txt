US-based retail giant Walmart is testing a self-driving robot that scrubs the floor, the company's spokesperson confirmed. The autonomous robot features cameras, sensors, and LiDAR that help it manoeuvre down the aisles and dodge obstacles. In October, Walmart announced it is deploying shelf-scanning robots across 50 locations in the United States.
