Question-and-answer platform Quora has raised $85 million in Series D round co-led by Collaborative Fund and Y Combinator's Continuity Fund at a $1.8 billion valuation. This round roughly doubled Quora's valuation since last fundraise of $80 million in 2014. Quora CEO Adam Dâ€™Angelo said the startup took eight years to reach unicorn status as it didn't focus on ads before.
