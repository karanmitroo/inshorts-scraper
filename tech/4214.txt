Twitter's two-day plunge after disappointing fourth-quarter earnings has dipped its market value below China's microblogging site Weibo, widely known as Twitter's Chinese clone. Weibo is now worth $11.3 billion, about $200 million more than Twitter. While Twitter was launched in 2006, Weibo made its debut seven years ago in 2009.
