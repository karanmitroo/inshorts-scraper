Amazon has asked people owning pre-2013 Kindle e-readers to compulsorily update their devices to the latest software by march 22. If not, users can lose access to the Kindle Store, any book saved in the cloud and all other Kindle services. Notably, users who miss the deadline can manually update their devices through a USB cable.
