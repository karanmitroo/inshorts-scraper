Canadian technology company BlackBerry has filed a lawsuit against Nokia for infringing on as many as 11 patents. The patents pertain to a mobile telecommunications standard called 3GPP which Nokia uses for its radio network controllers. BlackBerry was part of a group called Rockstar Consortium that bought the patents from a company headed towards bankruptcy for $4.5 billion in 2011.
