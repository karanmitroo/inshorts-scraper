Twitter users on Friday joined a 24-hour boycott of the platform, organised around the hashtag '#WomenBoycottTwitter', to protest against online harassment. It follows the suspension of actress Rose McGowan's account earlier this week for tweeting about sexual violence against women. However, Twitter claimed the suspension of the account was a result of her disclosing a phone number in her tweets.
