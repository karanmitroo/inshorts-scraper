According to filings from a case against Facebook by shareholders, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposed that he be allowed to take a two-year leave to serve "in a government position or office" without losing control of Facebook. The lawsuit accuses Zuckerberg and Facebook board member Marc Andreessen of prioritising Zuckerberg's control over the company at the expense of ordinary investors.
