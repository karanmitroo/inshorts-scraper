Google-owned video-sharing website YouTube has announced that people across the world are watching 1 billion hours of video every day on its platform. If a person sits and watches a billion hours of YouTube videos, it would take that person over 1 lakh years. YouTube reportedly surpassed 500 million hours per day in 2015, and 300 million in late 2014.
