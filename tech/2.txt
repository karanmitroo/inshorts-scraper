Android Co-founder Andy Rubin's startup Essential has been granted a patent for a 'pop-up' selfie camera for its smartphones. The patent reveals a phone with a small panel on the top of the frame that pops up to reveal a front-facing camera. However, the startup has made no confirmation whether it will implement the technology explained in the patent.
