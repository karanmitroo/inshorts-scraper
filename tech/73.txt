US-based startup AliveCor has developed a band for the Apple Watch that monitors a user's heart rhythm to check if its normal. Called 'KardiaBand', it features a sensor over which a user is required to keep the thumb for 30 seconds to record the heart's rhythm. The results can then be accessed by the user on their watch.
