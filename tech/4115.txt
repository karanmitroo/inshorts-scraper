Japanese company Final Audio has created a pair of gold-plated, chrome copper earphones called Piano Forte X for nearly â‚¹1.5 lakh. Unlike typical in-ear headphones, Final Audio's earphones do not have a silicone covering at the end. The company claims that the chrome copper allows users to experience the "sensation of sound notes lingering naturally."
