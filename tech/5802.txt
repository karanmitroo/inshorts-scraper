Speaking at a summit on Tuesday, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said there's no timetable for profitability and the video platform is still in investment mode. YouTube does not disclose its earnings separately from parent company Alphabet, but its revenue is pegged to be in billions. The company claims a billion monthly users, a third of all people on the internet.
