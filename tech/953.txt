Volocopter's Co-founder Alex Zosel has said that in two or three years the German aviation startup will have its first commercial applications "somewhere in the world." Zosel added that the first commercial application will be a 'point to point' solution over bottlenecks such as traffic congestions. The startup's aircrafts will fly at an airspeed of 100 kmph.
