US chipmaker, Intel, Thursday lost its challenge against a record $1.44 billion fine handed down by European Union antitrust regulators five years ago for blocking rival Advanced Micro Devices. The European Commission in its 2009 decision said Intel tried to thwart AMD by giving rebates to some PC makers for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.
