University of Tokyo researchers have created tiny LED lights which levitate in the presence of ultrasound. Named Luciola for its resemblance to the firefly, each hemispherical particle weighs 16.2mg, has a diameter of 3.5mm, and emits a red light that can illuminate text. The developers hope Luciola will be commercially viable in 5-10 years for use in moving displays.
