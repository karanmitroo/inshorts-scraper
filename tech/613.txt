American technology company Dell has unveiled jewellery made of gold which was recovered from computer motherboards collected through its recycling programs. The collection, which was unveiled at CES 2018, has been designed in collaboration with American actress Nikki Reed. Dell's gold reclamation process is 99% less harmful to the environment than mining gold from the Earth, Reed claimed.
