Amazon-owned audiobook subscription service Audible has introduced a feature that uses machine learning technology to allow users to jump to sex scenes in an audiobook. Called "Take Me To The Good Part," it can also identify other categories such as "First Meeting", and "First Kiss". The feature is part of a new package of books under the Audible Romance brand.
