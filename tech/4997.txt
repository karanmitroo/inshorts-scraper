Google has reportedly cancelled plans to develop its own self-driving vehicles and will instead pursue partnerships with existing car makers to possibly launch an autonomous ride-sharing service. Google's existing autonomous car fleet consists of Lexus SUVs and two-person pod cars. The company also partnered with Fiat Chrysler earlier this year to produce self-driving minivans.
