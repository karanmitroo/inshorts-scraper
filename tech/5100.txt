Google has launched a new personal safety app called 'Trusted Contacts' that lets users share their location with trusted people in everyday situations and emergencies. The app works even without the internet or when a user is unable to reach the phone. The app can also automatically share the user's location when they do not respond within a reasonable timeframe.
