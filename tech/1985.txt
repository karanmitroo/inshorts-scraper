A 17-year-old girl, the alleged administrator of the deadly Blue Whale Challenge that encouraged players to commit suicide, has been arrested in Russia. She allegedly threatened her victims that she would murder them or their families if they didn't complete the set tasks. She initially played the game but didn't take her own life, and became the game's administrator instead.
