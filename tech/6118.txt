Donald Trump on Thursday claimed that a "Google poll" showed he won the first US Presidential debate over Hillary Clinton despite Google's search engine "suppressing the bad news about" the Democratic nominee. Google had issued a clarification stating that it "does not favour any candidate or cause", after similar claims had been made in June this year.
