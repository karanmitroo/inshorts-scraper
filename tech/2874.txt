Twitter user 'ThreesPorn' has reportedly completed the mobile puzzle game 'Threes' exactly three and one-third years after it was released on the app store. The game, previously considered unbeatable, involves sliding tiles with similar numbers to form the biggest number. However, ThreesPorn found that on reaching 12,288, the screen shows a starburst of light and plays a game-ending animation.
