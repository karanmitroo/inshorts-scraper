A website called the 'Celebrity Perv Apology Generator' creates public apologies for men who have been accused of sexual abuse or harassment. The apologies contain all the elements of several key words that have come up in recent events of sexual harassment. The apology generating website is made by writers Dana Schwartz, Rob Sheridan and designer Scott McCaughey.
