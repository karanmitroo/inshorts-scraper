Apple on Monday introduced a bright green and orange water gun to replace the black and silver revolver emoji as part of the company's iOS 10 emoji update. The update will also have a new rainbow flag and more gender diversity. In June, Apple had reportedly got the rifle emoji removed from Unicode's list of new emoji candidates for 2016.
