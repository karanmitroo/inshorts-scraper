Google is reportedly planning to update its Android Messages app which would allow users to send texts from their computer. The feature will allow users to pair their smartphones with their computer by scanning a QR code. The codename for the feature is 'Ditto' but may reportedly be labelled as 'Messages for web' when it is officially rolled out.
