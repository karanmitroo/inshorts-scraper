Social networking giant Facebook on Monday launched its 2G-friendly Facebook Lite app in India. It is currently available only on Android devices and there is no immediate plan to develop its iOS or Windows version, said officials. Facebook Lite, primarily aimed at low-end phone users, will also come handy for high-end phone users, especially when they are on poor connections.
