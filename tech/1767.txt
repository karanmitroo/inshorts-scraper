Google's parent company Alphabet has asked a federal judge in the US to delay the trial in its lawsuit against cab-hailing startup Uber. Google spinoff Waymo cited it needs time to accommodate "unexamined devices" and documents that have now been provided to the company. Waymo sued Uber in February, accusing the ride-hailing startup of stealing its self-driving car technology secrets.
