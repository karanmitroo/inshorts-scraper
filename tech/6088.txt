Facebook recently disabled the account of an Indian blogger after he shared a funny photo of a cat wearing suit, with a friend on Messenger. After sending the photo, the Messenger app asked the blogger to re-enter his credentials and logged him out of all the devices. Facebook later reinstated the blogger's account and apologised for the incident.
