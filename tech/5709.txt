American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) was incorporated by inventor Alexander Graham Bell in 1885, making it the world's oldest telephone company in operation. The company was initially set up as a subsidiary of Bell Telephone Company, but bought Bell's assets in 1899 to become the parent company of the entire Bell system.
