Google has apologised after its new Photos app auto-tagged images of two black people as "gorillas". Jacky Alcine, a New York-based programmer, on Monday tweeted that the app had automatically placed his images in an album titled "Gorillas". "Weâ€™re appalled and sorry that this happened. We are taking immediate action to prevent this type of result from appearing," Google said.
