Scentee, a new smartphone accessory developed by a Japanese company, releases a chosen scent when the phone receives a text or notification. The round, white gadget that costs about $35 can be plugged into the headphone-socket to release different smells like mint, coffee or rose. It can also function as a fragrant wakeup alarm clock by scheduling the scent emission.
