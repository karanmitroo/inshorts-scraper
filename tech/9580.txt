Lenovo, which bought Motorola from Google in 2014, has indicated at the CES 2016 that it would phase out Motorola and rebrand it to "Moto by Lenovo". Lenovo added that phones like Moto X will henceforth be sold with a Lenovo logo. Motorola was the first company to produce a cellphone with the launch of the DynaTAC 8000X in 1983.
