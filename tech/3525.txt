CIA Director Mike Pompeo on Thursday called whistleblower agency WikiLeaks' Founder Julian Assange "darling of terrorists" after WikiLeaks published over 9,000 documents pertaining to CIA's hacking tools. "Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value. He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous. He is a fraud...a coward hiding behind a screen," Pompeo added.
