The US military has successfully tested self-steering "smart" bullets that have a real-time guidance system to track targets and can change their course if needed. These bullets of .50-caliber are equipped with optical sensors. The smart bullets would help the military personnel or shooters to hit the moving target or a static target in high winds.
