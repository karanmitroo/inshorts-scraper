Scientists from Imperial College London have found the remnants of red blood cells and proteins in 75 million-year-old dinosaur fossils. The discovery, published in the journal Nature Communications, indicates that blood and other cells might be preserved much longer in fossils than previously believed. Those soft tissues can provide valuable information that bones alone can't, a researcher said.
