A mobile application 'Mumbai Toilet Locator' has been launched by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to help people find public toilets. Currently available for Android users, the application will provide the location of 800 toilets across the city. "The application will help commuters, especially those on highways, where the only option is to go to nearby restaurants," said an official.
