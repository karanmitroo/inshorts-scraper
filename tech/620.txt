The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged Ohio resident Philip Durachinsky for allegedly using a malware, nicknamed 'Fruitfly', to spy on users between 2003 and 2017. He reportedly stole data including logins, chats and medical records, and spied on users through webcams. The DOJ also alleged the malware detected when users typed words associated with pornography on their devices.
