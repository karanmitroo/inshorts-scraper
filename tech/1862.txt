Over two-thirds (67%) of American adults get "at least some of their news on social media", up from 62% of American adults in 2016, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Adding that the growth is driven by more substantial increases among Americans who are older, less educated, and non-white, the research found Facebook as a dominant platform for news.
