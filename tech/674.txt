French airbag manufacturer Helite has unveiled a belt called Hip'Air at CES 2018 which contains airbags to protect a user's hips in case of a fall. Hip'Air, which is reportedly priced at $800, also contains a battery and sensors which detect the fall within 0.2 seconds. The airbags inflate right above the hips to allegedly absorb 90% of the impact.
