Facebook is ending its photo-sync feature on mobiles and moving usersâ€™ synced images to its private photo-sharing app Moments on January 10. It has started alerting users to download Moments, the standalone app that was launched in India in August. Earlier, Facebook took out the Messenger service from its app, forcing users to download a separate app for the same.
