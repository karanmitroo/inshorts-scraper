Researchers at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology have developed a system that detects sarcasm in social media posts. The 'Sarcasm SIGN' system is meant to interpret sarcasm for people with autism and Asperger syndrome who have difficulty understanding such statements. Based on a database of 3,000 sarcastic tweets, the system uses machine learning to turn sarcastic sentences into honest ones.
