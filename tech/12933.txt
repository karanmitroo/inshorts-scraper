Facebook has been sued for falsifying member endorsements through their "likes" for advertising purposes. Colorado (US) resident Anthony Ditirro has alleged that he was misrepresented in a sponsored advertisement for USA Today, despite he never visited USA Today's website or clicked the like button on its website. Earlier also, Facebook was sued for allegedly intercepting private messages of the users.
