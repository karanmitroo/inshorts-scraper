A US-based startup has created 'PlayDate', a $149 smart interactive ball that lets owners play with their pets remotely. Controlled through an app, the ball has an in-built camera and microphone to let owners watch their pets, click photos, record videos and talk to their pets from anywhere. The app also allows users to control the movement of the ball.
