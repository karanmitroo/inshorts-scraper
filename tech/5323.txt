The Ministry of Urban Development has reportedly partnered with Google to launch a 'Toilet Locator' feature for Delhi-NCR. Users will be able to search for toilets near them on Google Maps in the same way that theatres and petrol pumps can be searched for. Keywords like 'lavatory', 'swach' and 'shauchalay' will be incorporated, said a ministry official.
