YouTube is all set to launch 'YouTube Music Key'- the long-awaited paid monthly subscription service. The subscription to the service will start at $7.99 per month. The ad-free service will allow users to watch videos offline and listen to music while other apps are working. It will be first available through an invite to its "biggest music fans", YouTube said.
