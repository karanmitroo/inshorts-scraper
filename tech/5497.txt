US-based researchers have developed a conductive ink that can repair itself when broken or cut. Sensors printed with this ink would magnetically re-attach to each other in as little as 50 milliseconds when a rip or tear occurs in a wearable gadget. The ink is said to be long-lasting, fast, and immune to humid or hot conditions.
