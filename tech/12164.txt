An unmanned NASA-contracted rocket exploded about six seconds after its launch from a commercial launch pad in Virginia on Tuesday evening. The explosion produced huge flames and loud booms along the eastern Virginia coast but caused no injuries or deaths. This is the first accident since NASA turned to private operators to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.
