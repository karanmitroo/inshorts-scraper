Purdue University researchers have developed a new tool to help law enforcement officials recover information stored in smartphones while investigating crimes. The technique, called 'RetroScope', directs the phone's graphical rendering code towards its RAM to recover screens previously shown by any app. Once recovered, the screens are then displayed in the order they were originally viewed.
