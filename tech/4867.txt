Japanese scientists have developed a urine-powered sensor that can alert caregivers when a diaper is wet. It took the scientists five years to develop a flexible embeddable battery and urine sensor for diaper. The setup contains a battery attached to capacitor that stores generated electricity and a transmitter which can beam signal to a receiver up to 16 feet away.
