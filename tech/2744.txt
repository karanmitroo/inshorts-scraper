Non-profit publication ProPublica has published documents reportedly used by Facebook to train moderators on hate speech. One slide shows that Facebook 'protects' white men over subsets like black children and female drivers from attacks on the social media platform. Similarly, a post saying "all white people are racist" was reportedly banned, while one about killing "radicalized" Muslims was not.
