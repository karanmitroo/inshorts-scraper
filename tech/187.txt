WhatsApp's Vice President Neeraj Arora has resigned from Paytm's Board of Directors days after WhatsApp launched its payments feature in India. Arora, an alumnus of Indian School of Business, was among the first WhatsApp employees when he joined in 2011. Meanwhile, Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma called WhatsApp's payment feature rollout unfair and said it's killing "beautiful open UPI system".
