A lawsuit filed against digital payments company PayPal in the US alleged that donations made through the platform are misdirected to other charities without the donor's consent. The suit stems from a woman's complaint who used PayPal to donate over â‚¹2 lakh to 13 charities, but later learned that 10 out of the 13 charities didn't receive the funds.
