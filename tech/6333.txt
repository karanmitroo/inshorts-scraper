San Francisco-based entrepreneurs Kayla Matheus and Laura Day have developed a smart device called 'Moti', which helps users to build good habits like exercise and drinking more water. The device keeps reminding the user to continue the good habit and gets angry or sad when the user breaks the routine. On completing the task, the device celebrates by emitting light.
