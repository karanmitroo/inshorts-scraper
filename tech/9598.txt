US-based chip manufacturer Intel on Wednesday unveiled a helmet fitted with X-ray vision like glasses developed using their RealSense 3D camera technology. The development was mainly focussed on the industrial use of the device. Intel also paired up with an augmented reality (AR) company Daqri for the setup, which it claims as the "most powerful AR wearable device" available.
