Technology giant Facebook has removed the 'Ticker' feature that helped track friends' activity. Launched in 2011, it used to appear to the right of the desktop News Feed showing likes, comments and other activity by friends. A verified Facebook Help Team member confirmed this saying, "This feature is no longer available," but didn't give a reason for the same.
