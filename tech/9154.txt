San Francisco-based startup Slughaus has developed a bullet-sized 30 mm long LED flashlight 'Bullet', which is claimed to be the world's smallest LED light ever. Inspired by the 9 mm round, the flashlight is weatherproof and weighs 6 grams. It comes attached with a loop that makes it fit to be carried along with a bunch of keys.
