Facebook Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday shared a video taken by his father in 2002 when Zuckerberg received an email from the Harvard University confirming his selection. "Yay I got accepted," Zuckerberg says in the video. Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard 13 years ago to dedicate himself to Facebook, will be receiving an honorary degree next week.
