Researchers at The University of Manchester have claimed their world-first handheld device can detect alcohol counterfeits without opening the bottle. The device employs Raman spectroscopy, where lasers are directed through the glass, enabling the detection of chemicals. The prototype was able to detect methanol impurities through various colours (clear/brown/green) of glass, said researchers.
