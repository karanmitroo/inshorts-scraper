A journalist was found playing mobile game Pokémon Go during a US government briefing on the Islamic State on Thursday. The state department spokesman John Kirby in the middle of his briefing asked the journalist, "You’re playing the Pokémon thing right there, aren’t you?" to which the journalist responded, “I’m just keeping an eye on it.”
