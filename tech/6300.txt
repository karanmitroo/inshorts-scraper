US ride-hailing giant Lyft's Co-founder and President John Zimmer in a blog post on Sunday said, "Within five years a fully autonomous fleet of cars will provide majority of Lyft rides across the country". Zimmer added, "By 2025, private car ownership will all-but end in major US cities". Notably, Lyft rival Uber recently launched the first fleet of self-driving cars.
