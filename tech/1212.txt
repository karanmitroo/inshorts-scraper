The US Supreme Court has rejected a request by Samsung to re-evaluate a $120 million award granted to Apple in a patent infringement lawsuit. The case which dates back to 2014, found the South Korean technology giant guilty of infringing Apple's slide-to-unlock patent, among others. Samsung said that the court's decision allows Apple to "unjustly profit" from the patent.
