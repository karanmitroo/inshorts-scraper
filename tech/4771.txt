A video that emerged last week shows Amazon's voice-controlled assistant Alexa returning pornographic results when a child tried to search for a nursery rhyme. The issue reportedly arose because of a spoof song with a title similar to what the child searched for. Amazon said it was "working to build additional restrictions to prevent this from happening in the future."
