A US-based startup has developed 'Knocki', a $129 smart device that can turn any surface into a remote control to operate various devices. The device turns any surface into a touch interface. Connected through an app, it can let users control lights, find phone, adjust room temperature, access television, and brew coffee from bed by knocking on the Knocki-attached surfaces.
