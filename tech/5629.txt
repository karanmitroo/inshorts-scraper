American airline Delta has updated its smartphone app to let passengers track their luggage in real-time. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags will be added to checked-in bags that will be tracked by scanners along the way to indicate when a bag is on its way to the plane or when it has reached the terminal on a map interface.
