Apple introduced its first ever Mac computer, known as Macintosh, through a television commercial in 1984. The commercial showcased Apple as a young female rebel who frees individuals from the overbearing control of 'Big Brother', which is believed to be IBM. Apple launched its first iMac computer 18 years ago on August 15, 1998.
