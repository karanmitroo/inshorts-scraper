PixelSynth, a new Chrome Experiment written in Javascript, allows users to turn images into music. Users can choose from a library of pre-selected images or upload their own to start the experiment. They can also adjust the brightness, contrast, scale, key and speed to modify the music. Launched in 2009, Chrome Experiment is an online repository of several browser-based experiments.
