Facebook's VP of Global Operations has said, "We know we need to do better" after it emerged that the platform took two hours to take down a shooting video uploaded by the alleged murderer. Facebook said three videos were uploaded, first about intent to murder, second of the fatal shooting, and third was a live video of the man's confession.
