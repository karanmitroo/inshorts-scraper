Social media giant Facebook has acquired anonymous compliment app 'tbh' (to be honest) for a reported price of less than $100 million, the app announced on Monday. The app's Founders will also become formal employees of Facebook, as part of the deal. The app allows users to exchange compliments via in-app quizzes and only generates positive polls.
