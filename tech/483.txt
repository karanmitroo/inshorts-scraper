Google has revealed that less than 10% of active Gmail users have enabled two-factor authentication making the remaining users vulnerable to cyber attacks. The 2-step verification feature requires using a second step, like a single-use key or password, along with the account password to verify a user's identity. Google first rolled out the feature in 2011 to protect online accounts.
