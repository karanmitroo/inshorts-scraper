In a video posted on Thursday, American automaker Ford showcases its new collaborative robots, known as co-bots, working together with humans in its assembly plant in Germany. "The co-bots are an 'and' proposition and not an 'or' proposition. It's not 'can this robot do what a worker cannot do?' They're complementary, working together as a team", a company representative said.
