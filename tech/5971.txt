Navya, a startup out of France that makes driverless shuttles, has raised $34 million in funding to build self-driving shuttle busses. The funding is coming from two strategic backers, public transportation provider Keolis and automotive parts group Valeo, along with Qatari investors Group8. Navya is not disclosing its valuation but one report from Funderbeam estimates it at $222 million.
