Australia-based researchers have developed a swallowable electronic capsule that can detect different gases in the human gut. Trials on seven individuals showed the human stomach uses an oxidiser to fight foreign bodies in the gut, a finding "never reported before". The team is aiming to commercialise the technology for diagnosing food malabsorption and colon cancer.
