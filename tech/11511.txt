Photo sharing app Instagram has added new editing tools, fade and color, to its new update that allows the adjustment of the color tones of a picture. While 'fade' softens the existing colors of the image, 'color' helps add tint. Instagram has also added a post notification button to get notifications when the users you follow share a new post.
