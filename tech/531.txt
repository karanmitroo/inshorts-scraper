Megaupload Founder Kim Dotcom has sued the New Zealand government, demanding several billion dollars in damages, on the day of his marriage to Elizabeth Donnelly. Dotcom had reportedly generated over $175 million by encouraging paying users to share copyrighted material. "Today, 6 years ago... I was arrested for the alleged online piracy of my users," Dotcom tweeted on Saturday.
