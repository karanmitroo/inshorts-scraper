Employment-oriented social networking platform LinkedIn on Sunday announced the launch of its existing program called 'Welcome Talent' in the US, where it will help refugees find internships in the country. "While we canâ€™t control policies around entry of refugees into countries, we can lead with opportunity and help newly settled refugees find economic livelihood," said LinkedIn in a blog post.
