The US Consumer Product Safety Commission in a public statement has asked users of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 to "power them down and stop charging or using the device". Although Samsung has issued a recall following reports of the phone's battery exploding, the Note 7 will become illegal to sell in the US if officially recalled by the Safety Commission.
