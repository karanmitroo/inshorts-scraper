Chinese technology major Baidu made some of its engineers jump in front of an autonomous car in motion, as revealed by Baidu CEO Robin Li in a speech. The company undertook the stunt to demonstrate the ability of its driverless cars to prevent collisions. Although the car stopped in time, Li said he "felt it was a little risky."
