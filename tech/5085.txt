Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube on Monday announced a collaboration to help limit the spread of "terrorist content" online. The companies said they will create a shared database that will be used to identify this content, including the "most extreme terrorist images and videos" that have been removed from their platforms. Content related to terrorist recruitment will also be removed.
