Cosmic rays originating from outer space produce energetic particles on entering Earth's atmosphere. These 'alien' particles interfere with circuits in electronic devices by changing the stored data. Citing an event when a plane dove 690 feet in 23 seconds due to system failure, Professor Bharat Bhuva said that multiple circuits could be used in the same device to avoid failure.
