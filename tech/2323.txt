Hyperloop One achieved a record speed of 309 kmph on its Nevada track while testing its full-scale pod earlier this week. The pod used was 8.7 metres long and 2.4 metres wide, while the test track measures 500 metres. Hyperloop One's pods use electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation to travel in near-vacuum tubes.
