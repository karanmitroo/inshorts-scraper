A US-based startup has created 'PawsCam', a smart wearable camera for dogs to let owners keep track of their pets. The bite-proof and water resistant camera detects interesting movements such as standing up, rolling, chasing, jumping, licking, or barking and shoots 6-second shareable videos. The camera's battery lasts for up to 10 days on a single charge.
