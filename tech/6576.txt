Apple on Thursday announced that it will start deleting 'problematic and abandoned' apps from the App Store. The company will review those apps which no longer function as intended, donâ€™t follow review guidelines, or are outdated. Apple also said that it will limit names of new apps to 50 characters as long names are not fully displayed on the store.
