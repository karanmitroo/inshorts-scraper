Pokémon Go-creator Niantic announced it will reverse the lifetime bans it had earlier issued to some users' accounts. Players who used third-party add-on maps to locate Pokémon will be unbanned on a benefit-of-doubt basis. Users who used apps to scrape game data, or remotely capture Pokémon, will still be banned, as their actions place excessive load on the game servers.
