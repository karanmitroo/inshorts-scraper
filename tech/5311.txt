Designer Rafael Dymek has made a smart fully touchscreen mirror based on iOS 10, that is able to text, play songs, movies, browse the internet and even order an Uber ride. Called the 'Apple Mirror', the mirror shuts itself off after 45 seconds of inactivity and shows reflections like a regular mirror.
