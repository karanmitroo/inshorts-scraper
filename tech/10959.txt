NASA on Sunday sent Microsoft's HoloLens with astronauts to the Space Station as part of SpaceX resupply mission. HoloLens is a headset that maps the virtual world with reality. As a part of the project "Sidekick", the headgear will help astronauts identify or fix items that they may not be familiar with, like custom modules or instructions in another language.
