The government's 'Project Insight', which was built over seven years at a cost of $156 million, will enable catching tax evaders by keeping a tab on their social media posts. The government will collect information not just from bank accounts, but also from Instagram and Facebook, from August. This will help ensure that individuals' tax declarations match their spending patterns.
