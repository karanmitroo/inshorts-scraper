A US-Russia research collaboration at Harvard has created the world's most advanced quantum computer with 51 quantum bits, or qubitsâ€“ the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer. A classical bit can store data in 0 or 1 state whereas a qubit can store both simultaneously. Scientists believe a 50-qubit quantum machine can outperform the world's most powerful computer.
