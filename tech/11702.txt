NASA's Curiosity rover has clicked and sent a selfie from the “Mojave” site of Mars. The picture shows a sweeping view of the “Pahrump Hills” of Mars where NASA's Curiosity rover has been working for five months. The selfie scene is assembled from dozens of images taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager camera on the rover's robotic arm.
