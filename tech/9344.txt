Chinese electronics firm LeEco will use Facebook's Immersive Canvas Mobile ads technology for advertising. The technology allows advertisers to use a mix of videos, photos and other elements to display their products. The company said, “It's like an alternate version of a brand's website.” LeEco is one of the first few companies to be selected to use the new feature.
