Scientists are using photographs clicked by astronauts from the ISS to map light pollution around the world. The project, called ‘Cities at Night,’ is cataloguing over 1,30,000 high-resolution images and relying on crowdsourcing for their classification. One inference from the project is that LED street lights, known for their energy-saving capabilities, are causing the maximum light pollution.
