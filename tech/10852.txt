A NASA-funded study has revealed that it is possible for humans to land on the moon by 2021. If NASA adopts the plan right away, rovers could scout lunar poles for hydrogen by 2018 and prospecting could begin by 2019. Robotic Construction of a permanent base could then begin in 2021, enabling humans to land there later that year.
