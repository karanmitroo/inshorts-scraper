German automaker Daimler has begun testing its new 'smart ready to drop' logistics service to enable parcels to be delivered to the trunk of customers' cars. For this, Daimler has collaborated with DHL Paket and online retailers such as Amazon, among others. The service will comprise the “biggest in-car delivery test ever performed in Germany” according to Daimler.
