American amateur chemist Robert Cornelius took the first known photographic self-portrait in 1839, which is considered as the world's first selfie. To capture the photo, he set up the camera behind his family's silver-plating shop, removed the lens cap, ran into the frame and sat still, before covering the lens again. He titled it 'The first light Picture ever taken'.
