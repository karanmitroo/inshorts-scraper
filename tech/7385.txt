A 3D printing artisan named Matthew Davis has built a fully 3D printed arm-mountable gun called 'The Arcus', that can fire 48 rubber bands in seconds. All of the gun's parts are designed to snap together without any screws or glue. The Arcus uses the energy from the rubber bands that it is shooting to spin the gun's barrels.
