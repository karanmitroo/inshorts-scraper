Facebook has set up a formal 'Social VR' team to “explore how people can connect and share using today’s VR technology”. The new team will build on the achievements of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. It will also collaborate with the Facebook-owned Oculus group, the company behind the first consumer-targeted virtual reality headset Oculus Rift.
