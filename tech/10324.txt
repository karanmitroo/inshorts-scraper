Amidst a slew of launches today, Microsoft unveiled a mixed reality game called 'Project X-Ray' for its wearable headset Hololens. With the game, users can convert any room into a gaming canvas. In the Project X-Ray experience, the user wears a holographic weapon and defends oneself from an attack of flying robots and other objects by shooting lasers at them.
