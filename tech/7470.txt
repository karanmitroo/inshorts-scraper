Hacker Jonathan James from Florida hacked NASA computers in 1999 when he was 15 years old, resulting in a three week system shutdown and an estimated recovery cost of $41,000. He also invaded computers of a Defense Department agency and intercepted 3,300 emails with 19 employee passwords. He was later traced and sentenced to six months in jail.
