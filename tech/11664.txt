US based Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the world's first all-electric communications satellites into orbit. The satellites will rely entirely on energy-efficient electric ion engines to maintain their orbit for up to two decades. SpaceX is scheduled to launch at least two more Falcon 9 rockets this year.
