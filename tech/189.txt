University of Washington engineers have turned toilet tissue-like paper into a wearable sensor that can detect heartbeat and a blink of an eye. Researchers showed that on tearing tissue paper loaded with electricity-conducting carbon nanotubes, the paper acts as a sensor. The flexible and inexpensive sensor has potential applications in healthcare, entertainment and robotics, said researchers.
