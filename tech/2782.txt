Panasonic is launching a â‚¹11,500 clothes hanger in Japan that deodorises the clothes hung on it and annihilates the scent from them. The hanger relies on a  technology called 'nanoe', which involves releasing nano-sized particles that gather moisture from the air to get rid of smells from the clothes. The hanger requires a power supply and special cable to work.
