After years of ignoring apps that promise users "sexy" pictures or "desi stories", Google has revised its guidelines for app developers and has added "erotic content" to the type of material that it will ban in the Play store. Earlier, only the "sexually explicit" content was banned. Moreover, Google has also updated its policy regarding advertisements within the apps.
