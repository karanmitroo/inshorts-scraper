Japanese electronics maker Veldt has introduced 'Tottori West Family Time Watch' that lets users monitor how much time they spend with their family. The smartwatch pairs with the user's smartphone to track when an accompanying beacon, worn by children, is within a 30-metre range. It also lets users set targets and rings an alarm if they are not met.
