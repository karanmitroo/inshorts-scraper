Chinese technology company LeEco accidentally leaked its upcoming product lineup in the US on its website, about ten days before its official release. The products include LeEco's mid-range Android smartphones, Le Max 2 and the Le S3, and four TVs. Interestingly, two TVs were shown with $14.99 (almost â‚¹1000) price tags, but that is expected to change.
