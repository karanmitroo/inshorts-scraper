In a first, doctors in China have successfully reconstructed the entire skull of a 3-yr-old using 3D printers. The girl was suffering from a medical condition called hydrocephalus which made her head grow to four times the normal size. During the 17-hour-long surgery, her scalp and skull were removed. Doctors then implanted artificial skull and covered it with her scalp.
