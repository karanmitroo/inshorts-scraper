Google has suspended its fact-check feature in search and news results after its algorithm reportedly linked a Washington Post fact check to another article. A Google spokesperson confirmed that the company was ending the 'Reviewed Claims' section of its Knowledge Panel feature. Google launched the feature last year to highlight articles in its search results that have been fact-checked.
