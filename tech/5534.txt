A team of Harvard scientists has built a chain-smoking robot to study lung diseases in humans. The robot can be fitted with 12 cigarettes at once and can be programmed to 'inhale' at different intensities and frequencies. The smoke is passed through a channel of living lung cells from patients with lung diseases to observe how they react to smoke.
