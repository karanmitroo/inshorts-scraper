French startup Wired Beauty has developed a smart skin-moisturising beauty mask 'MAPO'. Controlled through a dedicated app, the mask measures and manages the moisture of the skin within a minute through sensors placed at key face positions. The app also lets users connect to a community where people can share and discuss beauty solutions.
