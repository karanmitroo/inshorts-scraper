The Indian Army on Monday launched ‘Army Cloud’, an internal encrypted cloud computing system and ‘Digi-Locker’, a digital locker similar to the e-locker offered under the ‘Digital India’ initiative. The 'Army Cloud' includes data centres in Delhi and a disaster recovery location for duplication of critical data, in addition to virtual servers and storage at an environmentally controlled site.
