Technology major Apple has filed a legal challenge in Switzerland against watchmaker Swatch's "Tick Different" trademark, arguing that it's too similar to Apple's now-retired "Think Different" slogan. Notably, Apple's own slogan is believed to be a reference to IBM's "THINK" slogan. The court has reportedly asked Apple to prove that over 50% local consumers associate "Think Different" with Apple.
