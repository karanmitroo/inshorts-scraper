Scientists at Disney Research Zurich (DRZ) have developed a technique to produce more realistic faces. Noting the significant variation in eyes between individuals, the team devised the technique using multiple cameras and varied lighting to capture those features. "...little attention to date has been given to the eye, particularly its shape," explained Pascal Berard, a PhD student at DRZ said.
