A team of researchers, from the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology in Singapore, has developed a paper-based disposable device that will allow dengue-specific antibodies to be easily detected from saliva within 20 minutes. This device kit is expected to save valuable time in testing, which has been conducted on blood samples until now.
