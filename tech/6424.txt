Google has partnered with more than 50 global natural history institutions to feature interactive stories and virtual reality tours in its new Art and Culture app. The tours explain the history of evolution, from solar system's origins to the "rise and the fall of prehistoric worlds". Users can also explore creatures like predatory dinosaurs and prehistoric giraffes in 360 degrees.
