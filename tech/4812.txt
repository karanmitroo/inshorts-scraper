Startup Aura Health has launched 'Aura', an iOS app that creates up to 200 short three-to-seven-minute meditation sessions based on the user's current mood â€” be that stressed, anxious, happy or sad. The app collects data on demographics and age to better understand what type of meditation suits the user. It also provides users with a graph of their mood.
