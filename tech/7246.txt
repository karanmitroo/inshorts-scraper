Microsoft had offered to buy Yahoo in 2008 for $44.6 billion, at a price of $31 per share. Yahoo rejected the offer stating that it “massively undervalued” the company. The stock was priced with a 62% premium over Yahoo’s last closing price, when the deal was offered. Verizon bought Yahoo for $4.83 billion in an all-cash deal on Monday.
