American engineer Scotty Allen has shared a video that shows him modifying an iPhone 7 to add a headphone jack. Allen built Apple's 'Lightning' to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter into the smartphone and also designed a circuit board for the same purpose. While Allen was able to listen to music using headphones, he couldn't charge the iPhone 7 simultaneously.
