Google on Monday launched its video calling app Duo, that will rival Microsoft's Skype. It allows making end-to-end encrypted video calls to a user's entire contact list on a single tap. To make a call, Duo only requires a user's phone number. Available for both Android and iOS users, the app will be live worldwide in the next few days.
