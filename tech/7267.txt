Several pictures of children in war-torn Syria holding placards with Pokémon and Arabic text asking to be saved have surfaced online. "I'm in Kafr Nabl on the outskirts of Idlib, come and save me," read one such placard. This campaign reportedly asks that gamers take a break from hunting Pokémon and turn their attention to children trapped in war zones.
