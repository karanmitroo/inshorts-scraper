After the $4.83 billion acquisition of Yahoo's core business by Verizon on Monday, CEO Marissa Mayer wrote, "I'm planning to stay." In an email to employees, she added, "I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you. It's important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter." Mayer will reportedly assist with the transition and then depart the company.
