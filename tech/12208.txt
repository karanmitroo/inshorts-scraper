Google on Wednesday introduced a new email app called ‘Inbox’, for iOS, web and Android. What Inbox does differently than Gmail is present you with your information in a way that’s aimed at making content contextually relevant, instead of just presenting it as it comes in. The app is currently available to a limited user group only.
