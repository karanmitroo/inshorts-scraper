Converse has developed a sneaker that features a built-in wah pedal â€“ a pedal that alters the signals of electric guitars to create a distinctive effect. The idea, which was prototyped in 2013 by London-based fashion label Cute Circuit, uses a micro-sensor embedded in the sole of the shoe that registers foot movements to mimic an actual wah pedal.
