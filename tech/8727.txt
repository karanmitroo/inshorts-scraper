Google is asking users their opinion on possible names for the latest Android N OS via its survey app Google Opinion Rewards. Users are first asked to name a “tasty food” that begins with N, and then asked to choose between various “tasty treats”, all starting with N. The options include Nut Brittle, Nachos, Noodles, Neapolitan Ice Cream and Nougat.
