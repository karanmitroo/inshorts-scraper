Non-profit organization Equal Justice Initiative, funded by Google.org, has launched an online platform to explore the history of lynching in the US. 'Lynching in America' will involve research, data and the stories of those affected by lynching in the country. The site states that over 4,000 black people were lynched across twenty states between 1877 and 1950.
