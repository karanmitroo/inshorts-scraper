Facebook was slammed by users for removing US-based photographer Monet Nicole Moutrie's video depicting people of all backgrounds giving birth. Moutrie claimed the video, which has 100 million views, was removed for violating Facebook's community guidelines but didn't contain explicit nudity. Addressing Facebook, Moutrie said there's nothing more antithetical to the community than censoring birth.
