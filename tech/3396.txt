Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently surprised a US family by visiting their house for dinner just 20 minutes after they were informed of arrival of a 'mystery guest'. "We got to know a very cool guy...Just down-to-earth and real easy to talk to," said the family's head. Earlier, Zuckerberg had challenged himself to visit all 50 US states this year.
