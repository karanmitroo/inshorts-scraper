Physicists based in the UK, Germany, New Zealand, and Canada have said that 'twisted' light can be used for wireless data transmission. Photons can be 'twisted' by passing them through a type of hologram giving them a twist known as optical angular momentum. Researchers claimed that the number of intertwined twists in the photons allows them to carry additional data.
