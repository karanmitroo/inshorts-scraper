A UK-based startup has developed 'The Barisieur', an electric alarm clock that can also brew a cup of coffee or tea. While users need to fill the clock's compartments with water, coffee and milk before sleeping, the clock automatically brews the beverage at the set time and wakes up the users. It also has a USB port for charging phone.
