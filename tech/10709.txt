Scientists at the University of Montreal have developed a technique that enables computer cursors to interact in 3Dâ€”in single or multiuser, local or remote collaboration scenarios. According to them, the system is not so much about turning the world into an IMAX as offering designers an opportunity to navigate through their creations and manipulate 3D objects with 3D interactions.
