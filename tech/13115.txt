In an early move, Aircel has started conducting trials of 4G services in Andhra Pradesh. But the commercial launch will take time as Andhra circle doesn't have the required ecosystem, including 4G-enabled handsets, said a top Aircel official on Thursday. Aircel is only the second cellular service provider after Reliance to bag 4G-licence for AP circle.
