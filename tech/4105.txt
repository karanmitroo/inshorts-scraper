Japanese town Oji has appointed a flying drone puppy named 'Yukimaru' as official mascot. The mascot is named after the pet of Prince Shotoku, who was a 7th century politician and is believed to have encountered the first Chinese patriarch of Chan Buddhism. In a video, the drone visits tourist attractions like the Daruma Temple, Yamato River and Mount Myojin.
