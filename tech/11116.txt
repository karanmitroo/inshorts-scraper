Facebook on Friday released a 'Lite' version of Facebook for Android smartphones tailored to be used where wireless data bandwidth is scarce. Facebook Lite is less than 1MB in size and includes Facebookâ€™s core experiences like News Feed, status updates, photos and notifications. The company began rolling out Facebook Lite in Asia this week.
