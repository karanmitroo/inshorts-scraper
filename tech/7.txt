Google has unveiled a quantum processor with 72 qubits, surpassing IBM's 50-qubit computer unveiled last year. A classical bit stores data as either 0s or 1s, whereas a quantum bit, basic unit of information in quantum computers, can store both simultaneously. Scientists believe, with 49 qubits, a quantum computer with low-enough error can outperform any classical supercomputer in the world.
