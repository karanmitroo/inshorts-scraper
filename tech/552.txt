Facebook-owned photo sharing platform Instagram has added a feature that lets users check when other users were 'last active' on the platform. The status is visible in the Direct Messaging tab and has been rolled out for both Android and iOS operating systems. The feature only allows the accounts a user follows or anyone they message to see the status.
