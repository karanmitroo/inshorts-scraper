Researchers at the University of Washington have used Wi-Fi signals to power a battery-free camera kept 5m away. Researchers reportedly programmed 3 Atheros AR9580 chipsets to broadcast power to an energy-harvesting sensor on the camera. This is reportedly progress in the Internet of Things conception, which believes objects can be fitted with unique identifiers that can transfer data over a network.
