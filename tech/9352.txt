Australian startup UsBidi has developed a charger that auto-shuts charging when a phone's battery gets fully charged. Compatible with both Android and iOS phones, the charger comes with colourful LED charging indicator and magnetic ends. Further, the company claims that it charges two times faster when connected to a USB port.
