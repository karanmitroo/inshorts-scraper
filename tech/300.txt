Apple has filed for a patent which shows a stylus that can write on any flat surface and even in the air. For instance, users could draw a 3D cylinder in mid-air and have the drawing appear on a computer screen. The device's movement can be tracked using a force sensor in the tip and onboard motion sensors or camera.
