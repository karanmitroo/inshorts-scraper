Japan-based mold factory Nitto has developed a wearable chair called Archelis (Japanese for walkable chair) for surgeons. The product aims at allowing surgeons to sit during surgery, thus reducing fatigue while performing long and physically demanding operations. However, the chair can help people from any industry who must stand for long periods. Archelis is expected to start selling this summer.
