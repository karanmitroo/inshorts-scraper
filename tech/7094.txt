A US-based man has sued Pokémon Go mobile game makers for placing Pokémon on his property without permission. The man claims that strangers started gathering outside his home with at least five people knocking on his door. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of "showing a flagrant disregard for the foreseeable consequences of populating the real world with virtual Pokémon."
