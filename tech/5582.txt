A US-based family has sued Amazon after a hoverboard purchased through the platform caught fire and burned their $1 million home down in January. The family, which is seeking $30 million in damages, alleges that Amazon knowingly sold the product despite knowing of its potential danger. Following a spate of explosions, hoverboards were banned and deemed unsafe earlier this year.
