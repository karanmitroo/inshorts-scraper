Former Google employee Tim Chevalier has filed a lawsuit against the company for wrongfully firing him because of his statements against "discrimination, harassment, and white supremacy." Chevalier, who identifies as transgender and queer, alleged that Google's internal social networking platforms were used to harass the minorities. Chevalier had joined Google in 2015 as Site Reliability Engineer.
