In a move to connect the entire population across the world to the web, Facebook is planning to test Internet beaming drones in 2015. Besides the flying Wi-Fi drones, there will be satellites and infrared lasers too which will be built to provide Internet to all. Google also has the Project, Loon-y Internet beaming balloons, with similar motive.
