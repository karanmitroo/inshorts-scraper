Facebook on Monday won a trademark case against a local beverage maker in China which registered "face book" as a separate trademark to sell foods and beverages in 2011. A Beijing court ruled that the trademark was company's obvious act of copying and harms fair market competition. Notably, Facebook is currently barred from operating in China.
