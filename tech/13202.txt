A durability test conducted by SquareTrade rated Google's Moto-X as the most robust smartphone while Samsung's Galaxy-S4 was the biggest loser. The test, conducted on five smartphones, including Apple's new iPhones, Galaxy-S4 and Moto-X, was based on eight factors including their risk of breaking/failure and water resistibility. The iPhone-5, iPhone-5S and iPhone-5C were rated at 2nd, 3rd and 4th.
