Google today launched the latest version of its Android operating system called 'Oreo'. Its key features include 'Notification Dots' that lets users long press on an app's icon to view the latest notification and 'Picture-in-picture' mode allows them to minimise videos while performing another task. Google has also redesigned its emoji, adding 60 new in the process.
