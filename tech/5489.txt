After the worldwide recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones over exploding batteries, Samsung has recalled 28 lakh top-load washing machines in the US that pose a risk of injury. This comes after consumers reported excessive vibration in the washing machines and that the top detached from the chassis. Nine injuries, including a broken jaw and an injured shoulder, were reported.
