A Switzerland court has fined a man over â‚¹2.5 lakh for clicking the "Like" button on what a judge said were defamatory Facebook comments. The comments liked by the man, who runs an animal-rights group, suggested that he holds racist and anti-Semitic views. By hitting the "Like" button, the defendant "clearly endorsed the unseemly content," the court said.
