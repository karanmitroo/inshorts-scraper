Google has introduced an interactive 'Santa Tracker' which will go live on December 24, allowing people worldwide to follow Santa's progress. The experience includes 'Santa's Village' featuring games that allow visitors to learn about geography and languages. The tracker, which has marked the Christmas countdown for 12 years, has also launched an 'educator resource page' this year.
