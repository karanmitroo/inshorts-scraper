Apple will invest $390 million in US-based chipmaker Finisar to increase the production of chips that power features including Face ID, the technology giant said. The investment is a part of $1 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund that seeks to support innovation and create jobs. Finisar will use the funds to reopen a 700,000-square-foot plant in Texas to produce chips.
