Google Maps was erroneously directing tourists looking for the Blue Mountains in Australia to a dead-end street about 30 minutes away. Nearby residents were forced to put up a sign saying, "Blue Mountains is not here." Meanwhile, Google recently corrected the error, adding, "data found in Google Maps come from a wide range of sources, including third-party providers, public sources."
