Formula E, the all-electric racing series, announced plans to start a driverless electric car race called 'Roborace' in 2016. Ten teams with the same cars will compete in an hour-long race on the same track as the "regular" electric car race. Reportedly, the focus will be on improving artificial intelligence in cars that will reach top speeds of 300 kmph.
