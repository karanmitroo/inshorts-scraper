Computer scientists at the University College London have developed an artificial intelligence platform that can weigh the legal evidence available and predict the outcome of trials. Analysing datasets for 584 real cases, the AI 'judge' reportedly reached the same verdicts as human judges at the European court of human rights, in around 79% cases involving torture, degrading treatment and privacy.
