Australian scientists in collaboration with Microsoft have developed a technique that could enable computer's operating system to share its processing power, thereby boosting its energy efficiency by 25%. "Computer servers spend a lot of time waiting around for search requests... By sneaking in other processes while they are waiting, we can use the computers more efficiently", a researcher said.
