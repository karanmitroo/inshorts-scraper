OurMine, the group which claimed responsibility for hacking Sundar Pichai's Quora and Mark Zuckerberg's Twitter and Pinterest accounts, said that it's going after high-profile accounts to promote better security practices. The three-member team of teenagers scans the security of social media accounts and websites in exchange for a fee. The group currently has  34 customers, said an OurMine member.
