Technology major Oracle has cut pay of its top executives in 2016, including a 35% pay cut for Co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison, who received $41.5 million this year. Oracle's Co-chief executive officers Safra Catz and Mark Hurd each received $41 million, a 23% decline from last year. The move comes after Oracle faced shareholder opposition for its compensation practices.
