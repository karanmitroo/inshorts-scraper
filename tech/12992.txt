India on Monday successfully test-fired its nuclear-capable Agni-III ballistic missile ( having a strike range of more than 3,000 km), as part of a user trial from Odisha coast. "It was the second user trial in the Agni-III series carried out to establish the 'repeatability' of the missile's performance," DRDO said. The first user trial was performed on Sep-21, 2012.
