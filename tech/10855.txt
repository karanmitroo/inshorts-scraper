An international team of scientists, including one of Indian origin, have found a drug that may treat malaria in a single dose and prevent infections by mosquito bites. The drug cripples a critical protein that the malaria parasite needs to survive. If the undergoing human trials are successful, this could prevent a disease that kills more than 500,000 people annually.
