US-based startup Brooklyness has developed a $299 smart helmet for cyclists called 'Classon', which navigates riders to their selected location. It has indicator lights, which light up by sensing hand gestures. Further, cameras installed within the helmet record every ride, footage of which can serve as evidence during an accident.
