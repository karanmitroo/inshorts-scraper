An Indian-origin scientist, Manu Prakash, and his team have developed a computer that operates on water droplets to process information and manipulate physical matter. Prakash, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, was working on the technology for over a decade. Reportedly, the droplet computer can perform any operation of a conventional computer, but at slower rates.
