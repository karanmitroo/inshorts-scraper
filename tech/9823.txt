American hacker George Hotz has reportedly built a self-driving car in his garage in a month. Hotz said that his vehicle, a 2016 AcuraÂ ILX, is meant for highways like Tesla's autonomous cars. The 26-year-old is also known as the first person to jailbreak an iPhone. Notably, Tesla said it is unlikely for a single person to develop such a car.
