Japan's Toshiba, in partnership with SanDisk, is set to introduce its 256GB flash chips. Toshiba stacks in 48 layers flash cells, the smallest in the world at 15 nanometers, to maximize density. The result will be faster, more reliable memory and also cheaper and faster memory chips for smartphones and other mobile devices.
