US Senator John Thune, in a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, asked if the company considered making battery replacements available for free. Thune also asked if Apple was planning to offer rebates for those who replaced batteries prior to cost reduction. This comes after Apple admitted to slowing down older iPhones and offered battery replacements at discount rates.
