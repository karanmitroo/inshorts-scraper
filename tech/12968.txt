At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toshiba has unveiled a new 5-in-1 PC that can physically change into five different modes. The 'shape-shifting concept PC' has a laptop mode that includes the traditional clamshell design, and a convertible tablet mode. There's also a presentation mode where you can detach the keyboard to create a screen for viewing.
