Technology giant Apple is reportedly working on self-driving shuttles called 'PAIL', short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, to ferry employees between Apple's current and its new campus. The shuttles will be built on to another car manufacturer's van rather than being built by Apple. In April, Apple received a permit to start testing self-driving car technology in California.
