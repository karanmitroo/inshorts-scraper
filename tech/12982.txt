Samsung has launched Galaxy Camera 2, an upgraded version of Android-powered Galaxy Camera, with a faster processor, better battery life and more storage and memory, even though the key camera specs remain the same. It has the same 16.3MP BSI CMOS sensor with 21x optical zoom, besides a 4.8-inch HD LCD screen, Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) and 1.6GHz quad-core processor.
