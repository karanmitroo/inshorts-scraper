Facebook has unveiled a new standalone app, Moments which allows users to create groups that sync photos to friends. Moments uses facial recognition technology, alike "tagging" used by Facebook, to group photos and share them with friends who are in them. The app will be rolled out to other countries over time after its June 15 launch in the US.
