China's WeChat has launched 'Mini Programs', which are apps built into the messaging service and do not need to be downloaded to use. Users can directly search and use an app on WeChat instead of downloading it from App Store or Google Play. The mini apps include a photo editing app, productivity app, flight search engine, and recipe search engine.
