After failing to acquire Whatsapp, Google is planning to launch its own mobile messaging app next year, sources said. The tech giant is likely to test the app, which is currently in early stages of development, in India and other emerging markets. Google had reportedly offered over $10 billion for Whatsapp, which was finally bought by Facebook for $19 billion.
