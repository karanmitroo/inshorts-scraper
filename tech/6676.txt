According to a report, Apple's iPhone 7 may face a supply shortage at the time of its launch, slated for next month. The shortage will primarily be due to 'faulty components' which could impact the phone's availability. At the time of launch, 10 million fewer iPhone 7 builds will be available compared to last year's iPhone 6S, the report added.
