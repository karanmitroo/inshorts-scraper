US Senator Brian Schatz on Tuesday took to Twitter to slam the credit reporting firm Equifax for charging its customers for a credit freeze. "If half of those hit by breach buy "credit freeze" then Equifax makes $700 million off their own mistake. That's a ripoff," he tweeted. Equifax was recently hacked, compromising personal information of about 143 million Americans.
