The Pakistan government is planning to shut down BlackBerry services by Dec 1 this year over security reasons. As per UK-based watchdog Privacy International, Pakistani intelligence agency ISI carries out surveillance on public. Notably, BlackBerry encrypts users' data and ensures greater privacy, making it difficult to carry out surveillance. Earlier, BlackBerry had faced similar issues in India.
