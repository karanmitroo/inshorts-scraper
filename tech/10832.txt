John Polimeno, with a team at the University of Utah, has developed an app to reunite lost dogs with their owners. Called 'Finding Rover', the app uses facial recognition technology used in prisons and casinos. Pet owners upload a picture of their dog while shelters and other app users upload pictures of found dogs, thus, helping to find lost dogs.
