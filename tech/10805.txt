Scientists have efficiently transformed the neural networks of laboratory mice with a wi-fi controller, permitting them to consider the results of neural activation free of examination topics tethered by wiring. The research, published recently in the scientific journal Cell, could lead to the development of probes to treat neurological disorders like stress, depression, addiction and pain.
