Google has stopped serving advertisements to satirical news website Fark over a comment posted by one of its readers six years ago, causing it a huge financial hit. The comment included picture of a young woman in a low-cut shirt, which was used as evidence for a man arrested on pedophile charges. Google accused the site of hosting pedophile content.
