Ride-sharing service app BlaBlaCar, which is available across Europe, Russia and Turkey, has now arrived in India. The app service lets drivers offer rides from one city to another, and share the cost with co-travelers who sign up for the journey, making the trip more affordable. The France-based company will start its operations in Delhi first.
