Snapchat is strategically rolling out a feature called 'Limitless Snaps', that lets users send photos and videos that exist longer than the previously set 10-second maximum duration on the app. The photos will remain on the recipients' screens until they choose to dismiss it. Users can also send video messages that loop until friends manually dismiss them.
