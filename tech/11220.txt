Google on Tuesday celebrated the 64th birth anniversary of American physicist and astronaut Sally Ride by dedicating a doodle on the search engine's homepage. Sally, who joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1978, became the first US woman to travel to space when she was 32 years old. She died in 2012 at the age of 61.
