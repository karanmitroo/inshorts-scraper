Microsoft's former CEO Steve Ballmer in an interview on Tuesday revealed the company never tried to buy Twitter while he was at Microsoft. Interestingly, Ballmer is a well-known Twitter investor holding about 4% of the microblogging site. However, he added, "There's a real opportunity to make that a valuable economic asset," referring to reports that Twitter is up for sale.
