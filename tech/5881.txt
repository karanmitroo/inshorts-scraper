Swedish researchers have created a flexible, full colour e-paper material that is less than a micrometre thick. The material was created by placing conductive polymers on nanostructures. It works well in bright light conditions as it reflects light instead of emitting, researchers said and added that the display can have a resolution of 10,000 dots-per-inch, much greater than existing e-paper.
