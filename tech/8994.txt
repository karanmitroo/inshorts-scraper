Facebook has launched a Telecom Infra Project as part of its Internet.org initiative that aims to increase internet connectivity across the world. Under this, Facebook will partner over 30 telecom companies like Intel and Nokia to develop new technologies that will reduce the cost of building mobile networks globally.
