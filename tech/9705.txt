A group of scientists from the University of Bordeaux and French National Centre for Scientific Research have developed an imaging technique that uses lasers and titanium to view the internal workings of a human cell. Different parts of a cell absorb heat at different rates and generate energy at different rates, a fact which was used in the developed process.
