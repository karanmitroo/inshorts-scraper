Elon Musk-led SpaceX has confirmed it could not recover the central core booster of the Falcon Heavy rocket, which was supposed to land on a drone ship after the launch on Tuesday. Musk said the core ran out of propellant, which kept it from being able to slow down for landing. However, the two side boosters were recovered as planned.
