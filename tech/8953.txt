Australia is testing $250,000 shark-spotting drones named 'Little Ripper' for monitoring beaches to support search and rescue operations. To be tested for the next six months, the remote-controlled drones will aerially detect sharks through real-time sensors and pattern recognition algorithms. This data will be shared by the drones with the police, ambulance and emergency services through radio.
