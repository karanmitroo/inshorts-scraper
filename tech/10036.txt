NASA on Friday signed its first mission order for manned commercial space flights with SpaceX, Elon Musk's commercial space program. NASA plans to launch its maiden private manned mission to the International Space Station towards the end of 2017. While this will be Space X's first such mission, the space agency had earlier signed a contract with Boeing in May.
