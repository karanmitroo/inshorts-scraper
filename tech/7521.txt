Security researchers at Arbor Networks have discovered that several thousand closed-circuit cameras and webcams were hacked by a group called 'Lizard Squad' to attack bank, gaming, government and internet provider websites. Some attacks flooded the websites with as much as 400 Gbps of data. The group had earlier claimed responsibility for entirely shutting down North Korea's internet for a day.
