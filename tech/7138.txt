Washington-based startup Sioeye has launched the Iris4G, a compact action camera that includes built-in LTE cell service enabling users to live stream directly from the device. The GoPro-like camera simultaneously records HD video on its memory card while streaming at 480p. Users have the option to stream live to either YouTube or Sioeye's custom cloud platform.
