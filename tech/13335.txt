Jelly Bean has now become the most-widely used version of Android (OS of nearly 75% smartphones) with its use in 34% Android devices surpassing Gingerbread(33%). ICS(22.5%) stood 3rd in the league. Still, more than 50% users of Android are using its older versions, because of the fragmentation in updating and delay in enrolment of newer versions by original equipment manufacturers.
