Electronics engineer Steve Wozniak, one of the Co-founders of technology giant Apple, sold his HP scientific calculator to raise money for starting the company in 1976. Steve Jobs, the other Co-founder, sold his Volkswagen van, "so they had a few hundred bucks each" to assemble the first Apple computer in Jobs' garage. Wozniak celebrates his 66th birthday on Thursday.
