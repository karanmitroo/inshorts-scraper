A California court has ruled that Facebook must provide refunds for purchases made by children in apps and games like Farmville. The lawsuit was filed in 2012 by two families on behalf of all Facebook users under the age of 18 who made such purchases. The company has introduced a 'Facebook Payments Support' feature that allows users to request refunds.
