Facebook has launched a tool for iOS that can help visually-impaired English-speaking users understand whatâ€™s featured in the photos posted on the platform. People using screen readers on iOS will hear a basic description of items in a photo. In the past, users could only hear the name of the person who shared the photo, followed by the term photo.
