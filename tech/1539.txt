Technology giant Apple's Chief Design Officer Jonathan Ive at a recent event said, Apple had been working on iPhone X's technology for five years. Ive added that for the vast majority of the development cycle, all Apple had "were things that failed". Apple launched the iPhone X last month, which features an edge-to-edge display, face recognition, and wireless charging technology.
