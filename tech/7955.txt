PayPal Co-founder and billionaire Peter Thiel reportedly funded wrestler Hulk Hogan defamation lawsuit against New York-based Gawker media for publishing his sex tape. Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million jury verdict against Gawker in March this year. Notably, the media platform had outed Thiel as gay in 2007.
