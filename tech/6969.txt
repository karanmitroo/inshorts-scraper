The Prime Minister's Office app, which was recently launched by PM Narendra Modi, has been developed by 'Team Sanskriti', a team of six students led by 19-year-old Raghav Sarin. It was a joint initiative of the government and Google to crowdsource the app's design and technology. It allows making appointments with PMO officials and informs citizens about the government schemes.
