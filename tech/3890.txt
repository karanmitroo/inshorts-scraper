The CEOs of two of the world's largest technology companies, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook, were recently spotted having dinner together at a US restaurant. Their pictures were shared by Amit Pradhan, the Co-founder of US-based artificial intelligence startup Zero Labs. Earlier in 2010, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was spotted having a coffee with Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt.
