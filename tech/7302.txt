A day after popular torrent site 'KickassTorrents' was taken offline by US authorities, two clone sites have been spotted. One of the clones has been created by a member of torrent site 'IsoHunt' and the other is located at KAT.am. Both websites encourage visitors to sign a petition to help free Artem Vaulin, the alleged KickassTorrents creator who was arrested.
