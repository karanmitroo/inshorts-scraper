Google will reportedly unveil a new standalone online photo-sharing service during I/O developers’ conference in San Francisco later this month. The new tool will allow users to post images to Facebook and Twitter. With this new service, Google is planning to compete with Facebook, Instagram and Flickr. This falls in line with Google's plan to separate Google+’s photos and Hangout.
