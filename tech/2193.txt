Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba-owned website Taobao has been slammed for selling customised photos and videos featuring African children. The pictures show young children holding a chalkboard with a purchased message for birthdays and other occasions for as little as $1 (â‚¹64). The children reportedly often only receive snacks or a few dollars for completing a batch of photos and videos.
