The US Marines are reportedly testing Googleâ€™s military robot dog, Spot, to check the extent of its usefulness during combat. Built by Boston Dynamics, the robotics company owned by Google X, the dog weighs 160 pounds and is hydraulically actuated with sensors aiding in navigation. The robot, unveiled in February, can be controlled from up to 1,600 feet away.
