Amazon has filed a patent application for a technology to let users make payments by taking a photo or a video of themselves instead of their account's password. The process involves facial recognition of the users and asking the user to perform a certain action, like blinking. It will be used on various devices including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
