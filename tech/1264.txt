US-based startup Beheld allows users to scan, send, and 3D-print their action-figure-like representations using a booth-sized scanner. The scanner takes multiple pictures of a user's body in 360 degrees, creating a 3D model which costs $40 (â‚¹2,600) to print. Beheld was launched in January this year by industrial designer Kat Kinkead and former CEO of Shapeways, Peter Weijmarshausen.
