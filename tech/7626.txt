According to The Verge, a YouTube user who goes by the name 'ajw61185' has posted a video showcasing his remote-controlled model of Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9 rocket. In the video, the model tries a landing on a barge in a pool. The model can deploy its legs mid-flight and features an attachable 'flame' that mimics the propulsive landing.
