American technology firm Garmin on Thursday launched its 'Vivofit jr' fitness tracker for children aged four to nine, priced at $80. A connected smartphone app allows parents to track and monitor their children's activity and set rewards for every task they complete. The tracker also shows a fun fact on the completion of the daily 60-minute play goals.
