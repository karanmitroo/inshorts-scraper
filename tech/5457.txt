US military scientists have developed and successfully tested electrical brain stimulators for enhancing multitasking skills of servicemen like drone operators. The brain stimulation kits use electrodes to send weak electrical currents through the skull and into specific parts of the cortex, to help neurons fire, and ultimately improve effectiveness in high-pressure situations.
