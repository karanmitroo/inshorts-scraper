In a first, Japanese researchers have used drones to pollinate flowers. To make their pollinator, the team stuck patches of horsehair under drones and also applied moist and sticky liquid ion gels on it to capture pollen grains. The drone was able to grab and release pollen from the male and female parts of pink and white Japanese lilies.
