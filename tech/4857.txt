New York-based entrepreneur Natalie Rebot has created a â‚¹2,400 device called 'Moonlite' that can be added to a smartphone's camera to act as a bedtime story projector. The device comes with story reels and a dedicated app that includes sound effects and high-definition images. The images can be projected on the ceiling, walls or a projection screen.
