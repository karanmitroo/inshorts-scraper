According to Apple's website, a record number of orders for the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus may cause a month's wait in its delivery. The 4.7-inch iPhone 6, however, would be available for delivery on time. The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on September 19 in the US but the company began taking online orders on Thursday.
