Adobe on Monday made its Photoshop Lightroom photography app free on all Android devices. So far, users needed a monthly paid Creative Cloud subscription to use the app. However, to sync images between Photoshop Lightroom's Android and web versions, users still require a subscription. Earlier in October, Adobe made the app free on iOS.
