Photo-sharing app Snapchat is planning to add college newspapers to its Discover section called 'Campus Publisher Stories.' The student papers will create magazine-style stories per week which will be visible to Snapchat users located near each respective campus. The Stories will also include ads to derive revenue which will be shared by Snapchat with the student papers.
