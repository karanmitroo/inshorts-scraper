Researchers at Swansea University in UK have announced plans to try 'smart' bandages that will use 5G data and nano-sized sensors to let doctors monitor wounds. The 3D printed bandages would allow doctors to customise patients' treatments and also keep track of their activity levels. The bandage is part of a $1.6 billion deal to create a 5G test hub.
