According to a study that appeared in the Science Translational Medicine, a new lens-free microscope has been created, making cancer detection much easier, faster and less expensive. It works through laser or light-emitting-diode to illuminate the biomedical specimen, after which the patterns of shadows are recorded by a sensor array on a microchip for further analysis and detection of cancer.
