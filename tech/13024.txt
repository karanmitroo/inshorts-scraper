Apple said Wednesday that its new high-end desktop, the Mac Pro, priced at $3000 and $4000, will go on sale Thursday. The Mac Pro is designed as a cylindrical tower that gives it a radically different look than previous Apple desktops. The $3000 model has a 3.7 Ghz quad-core processor, 12 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of flash storage.
