Snapchat has partnered with US television network NBC to stream highlights from the 2016Â Olympic Games to take place in August in Rio De Janeiro. This is the first time NBC has agreed to share content of the Olympics anywhere outside its own platforms. Snapchat will also show off-the-field interactions and behind-the-scenes content on its platform curated by media company BuzzFeed.
