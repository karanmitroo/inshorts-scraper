A US-based startup has made 'Ziro', a $149 hand gesture-controlled robotics kit which includes a smart glove, a smartphone app and motorized modules. The kit lets users build their robots and control them with hand gestures including lifting a finger or flicking the wrist. The modules last for seven hours on a single charge.
