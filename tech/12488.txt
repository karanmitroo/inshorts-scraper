Facebook has launched a new app - ‘Mentions’ - which will help Facebook-recognised or verified celebrities to manage their public figure pages. The app could make it simpler for celebrities to manage their Facebook account by viewing posts that mention them. Verified users can create new posts and also host live Q&A sessions within the app.
