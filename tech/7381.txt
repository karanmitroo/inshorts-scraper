Apple's online and retail stores in some countries have started selling a smart skipping rope called 'Tangram Smart Rope' at a price of $90. Embedded with 23 LEDs, the rope displays the user's fitness data mid-air. Further, a dedicated Smart Gym Pro app shows the user's jump count, calories burned and other fitness data on the iPhone or Apple Watch.
