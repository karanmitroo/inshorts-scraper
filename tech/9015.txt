Samsung has debuted in the Connected Car business with the launch of its Connect Auto dongle. The Tizen OS-powered dongle monitors the vehicle’s performance, offers a 4G hotspot connection and is capable of notifying the driver’s listed contacts in case of emergencies. It can also act as a “virtual mechanic” by checking the car’s status and providing recommendations on maintenance.
