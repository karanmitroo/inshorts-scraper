US-based startup Wer-tek has created 'Hiody', a bluetooth-enabled hoodie with in-built speakers and microphone, priced at $69. A button on the hoodie's pocket lets users control music, receive or ignore calls. It also has an integrated universal MiniJack compatible with all kinds of music devices. The hoodie becomes completely machine washable after removing the integrated technology.
