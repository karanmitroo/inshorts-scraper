Taxi aggregator Ola has reportedly leaked names, numbers, and addresses of about 400 Bangalore users over the last three weeks. Chennai-based Swapnil M, who had been getting the said information through messages, said, “My mobile number had been linked to the driver database instead of the customer database.” Ola has said that the issue has been resolved.
