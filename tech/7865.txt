A UK-based startup has created an eco-friendly and flame-free electric lighter called 'Volt'. Priced at $32, the lighter claims to be windproof, waterproof and built by recycled products. It can light paper, cardboard, sparkles, candles and other items. Rechargeable through a USB cable, it claims to last for a month in a full charge, which takes five minutes.
