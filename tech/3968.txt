Three Australian teens were nabbed and charged with more than 40 offences by the police after they live-streamed themselves riding an alleged stolen car. The live stream was made using one of the teen's personal Facebook account, which was tracked by the police. The car was linked to a number of offences including fuel drive-offs and evading police.
