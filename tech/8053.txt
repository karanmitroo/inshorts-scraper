US-based scientists have developed a new method to generate 'truly' random numbers, a breakthrough that could be used to improve cybersecurity. The method merges two weakly random sequences of numbers, data sampled over time that can exhibit predictable patterns, into one sequence of truly random numbers. An important application for truly random numbers is in generating keys for data encryption.
