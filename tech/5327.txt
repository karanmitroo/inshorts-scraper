Scientists have created a small stick-on wearable sensor that can monitor a user's heartbeat. The miniature stethoscope can pick up the motion of sound waves as they travel through the flesh and fluids of the body. The wearable can also measure throat vibrations when a person is talking and can be used as a possible tool for speech therapy.
