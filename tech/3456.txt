Uber has rubbished The New York Times report that claimed Uber kept tracking individual iPhones even after the app was deleted from the devices. "This is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone," said Uber. The report had claimed Uber stopped the practice after Apple CEO threatened to remove Uber's app from App Store.
