Video game character Mario was named after the landlord of Nintendo's US warehouse, Mario Segale. The character was initially called Jumpman in Japan, but the developers renamed it 'Mario' after the landlord reportedly demanded rent while they were thinking of a new name. The first game in the Super Mario series, 'Super Mario Bros', was released on September 13, 1985.
