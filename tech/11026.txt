Nest, Google's connected home products maker, on Wednesday unveiled a range of smart home products including a surveillance camera and a talking smoke detector. It is Nest's biggest product update since Google bought the Palo Alto, California, company last year for about $2.75 billion. Google is also working on Brillo OS to communicate all the internet-connected home devices with each other.
