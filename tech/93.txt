Chinese smartphone maker Huawei claimed that its Mate 10 Pro phone has become the first artificial intelligence (AI) enabled phone to drive a car. It first allowed a Porsche car to be robotically controlled and then mounted a camera atop the car, which was tethered to the smartphone. The smartphone then recognised objects to instruct the car what to do.
