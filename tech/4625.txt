Swedish pharmacy Apotek has installed an anti-smoking billboard in Stockholm that is equipped with smoke detectors and coughs whenever a smoker passes by. The billboard includes a digital screen that features a picture of a man who coughs when sensors detect smoke. The coughing is followed by advertisements of various nicotine gum products.
