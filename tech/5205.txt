The Aviation Ministry on Friday launched the AirSewa website and mobile app, allowing passengers to check the live status of flights and flight schedules. AirSewa also includes a mechanism for grievance redressal, wherein passengers can upload videos and describe their grievances. They will be given reference numbers allowing them to track the response to their grievances, an official has said.
