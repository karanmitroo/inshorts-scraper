Netgear has launched a new $400 Wi-Fi system called Orbi, which the company claims can cover up to 4,000 square-feet of living space. The kit comes with a router and satellite, both of which have four Gigabit ethernet ports. Unlike other systems, Orbi has two separate channels for devices, and one dedicated channel for the satellite.
