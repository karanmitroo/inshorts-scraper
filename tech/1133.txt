US chipmaker Qualcomm is reportedly planning to reject rival Broadcom's $103 billion takeover bid as early as this week. Reports suggested that Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf feels the offer undervalues the company and doesn't account for the potential regulatory hurdles. The deal, if goes through, would be the biggest technology acquisition ever and will make Broadcom the third-largest chipmaker.
