Facebook on Thursday launched 'Signal', a free discovery and curation tool for journalists to source and gather content from Facebook and Instagram, across different categories. Journalists can also access the lists of public figures mentioned the most on Facebook. 
They can select and copy the embed code of any Facebook and Instagram post and use it in their coverage.
