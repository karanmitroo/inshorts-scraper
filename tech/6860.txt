Singapore's national bank POSB on Tuesday launched the country's first 'Video Teller Machine' (VTM) to let ATM users talk to a bank teller live via video chat. Users can perform regular ATM transactions along with branch banking services like requesting for statements directly from the VTM. The machines will also be able to scan fingerprints for authentication.
