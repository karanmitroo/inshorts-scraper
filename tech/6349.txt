Steve Jobs had once revealed in an interview that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to him. The Board decided to fire Jobs after a rift between him and the then CEO John Sculley. Interestingly, he was fired on September 16, 1985, and was hired back the same day, 12 years later.
