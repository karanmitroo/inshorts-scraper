Google on Wednesday announced the launch of its pilot programme ‘Accelerated Mobile Pages’ that would enable users to search for news content and download articles instantly. "Today, roughly 40% of users abandon an article if it doesn't load after six seconds," said a Google product director. The move comes after Facebook and Apple started similar initiatives earlier this year.
