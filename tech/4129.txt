The German government has ordered parents to destroy or disable a "smart doll" it has classified as "illegal espionage apparatus" because it can be used to spy on children illegally. 'My Friend Cayla' lets children access the internet using speech recognition software. Nearby hackers can allegedly access it via bluetooth, listen to conversations and speak directly to the child playing.
