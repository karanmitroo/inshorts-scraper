A Twitter account called Burned Your Tweet replies to tweets by US President Donald Trump with a video of a robot that automatically prints out Trump's tweets. The robot then grabs the printed tweets, sets them on fire and puts them in an ashtray. The account, which has posted four videos in a day, has garnered over 9,000 followers.
