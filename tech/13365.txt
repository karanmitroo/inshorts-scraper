Anshika Agarwal, a research scholar in the department of biotechnology at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, has developed a colour-based sensor (membrane), which changes colour when the milk gets spoilt. "Milk often gets spoilt before the expiry date printed on the sachet... My sensor is cost-effective and easy to incorporate in packaging system", says Anshika.
