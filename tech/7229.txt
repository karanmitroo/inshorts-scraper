Beijing-based AI startup Mobvoi, whose last funding round was led by Google, is set to sell its $200 smartwatch Ticwatch 2 in US in September. The watch's new version has a voice-activated search which responds to questions in English and users can order pizzas, book cabs and browse restaurants. Notably, this investment was Google's first direct investment in China.
