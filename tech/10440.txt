Twitter’s Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto has reportedly claimed the microblogging website to be bigger than Facebook, “depending on how you measure it.” He said that besides the number of members, the company also has logged-out users and the ones who view syndicated or embedded tweets. While Facebook’s user-base is touching 1.49 billion, Twitter currently has 316 million recorded users.
