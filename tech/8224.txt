Japan-based company MicroAd has produced a choreographed drone performance, titled Sky Magic, set against the backdrop of Mount Fuji. The audio-visual performance used a fleet of 20 remote-controlled drones, equipped with 16,500 LED lights, to create several aerial formations including lanterns and fireflies. The performance was accompanied by traditional Japanese Shamisen music.
