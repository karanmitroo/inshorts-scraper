A team of researchers from University of Virginia’s School of Medicine has discovered the “missing” link between the brain and the immune system which may explain current medical mysteries. Brain is connected to the peripheral immune system through meningeal lymphatic vessels which may help treat neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis in the near future, researchers said.
