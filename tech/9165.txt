Illuminated clothing line was showcased at the New York Fashion Week by the American label 'Chromat' using the technology 'Curie Module', from Intel. Stretchable sensors were attached to the hands of the models allowing them to light up their garments by squeezing their hands. However, these technology backed garments are currently only runway pieces and not available for mass consumption.
