Apple CEO Tim Cook, while speaking at a recent event said, if a venture capitalist (VC) asks for an exit strategy, entrepreneurs should "get up and walk out of the room". He added, such people are there not to grow the company but for a "quick buck". He further said that entrepreneurs shouldn't be attracted to that kind of money.
