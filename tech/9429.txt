US-based startup Shalgi Design Studio has developed a smart luggage 'G-RO', that features all-terrain wheels, inbuilt tablet stand and a charging station with two USB ports. G-RO comes with 360Â° revolvable wheels and a luggage location tracker. The 23,000 mAh battery in the luggage capable of charging tablets, laptops and smartphones lasts long enough to charge a smartphone 10 times.
