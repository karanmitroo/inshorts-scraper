The Gujarat High Court has issued notices to the Centre, state and the US-based​ Niantic Inc over a PIL filed against the location-based augmented reality game ‘Pokemon Go’ for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The petitioner has argued that in the game, images of eggs appear in the places of worship of Hindus and Jains which is considered “blasphemous”.
