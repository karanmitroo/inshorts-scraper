UK startup Kurv Music has created a pocket-sized stringless digital guitar 'Kurv Guitar' that can be played using touch, motion and gestures. It consists of an eight-key touchpad that produces and manipulates sounds of three guitars namely acoustic, electric and bass, depending on the pressure applied by the fingers. The output can be heard on a dedicated iOS app.
