China's top microblogging site Weibo will block unapproved video content and promote "meanstream" ideas on its platform, the firm said. This comes after the country's media watchdog threatened to shut Weibo's video service in a crackdown on political opinion. China has banned several social networking sites including Twitter and does not allow questions over the legitimacy of the Communist Party.
