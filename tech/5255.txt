Apple has acknowledged some iPhone 6s handsets are shutting down unexpectedly and said the batteries of the affected devices will be replaced for free. Apple believes that only some devices manufactured between September and October 2015, have been affected. Notably, some iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are facing 'touch disease' that causes a flickering grey bar and reduces touchscreen responsiveness.
