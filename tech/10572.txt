A 2013 judgement asking Americaâ€™s National Security Agency to stop its bulk metadata collection program was reversed by a federal appeals court on Friday. The three-judge panel argued that privacy activist Larry Klayman was not able to prove that his data was breached through NSA's phone surveillances. The agency's mass phone spying was disclosed by Edward Snowden two years ago.
