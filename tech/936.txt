UK's Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has asked Facebook to stay away from his kids and act responsibly after the company launched 'Messenger Kids' in the US. Hunt said, Facebook promised to come up with ideas to prevent underage use of its product but instead, is "actively targeting younger children." "Not sure this is the right direction at all," Hunt added.
