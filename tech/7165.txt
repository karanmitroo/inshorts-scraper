Japan's National Science Museum is exhibiting a new robot, named "Alter", which runs on an embedded neural network, powered by 42 pneumatic actuators and a "central pattern generator". The network replicates neurons, allowing the robot to create movement patterns of its own, influenced by sensors that detect proximity, temperature, noise and humidity, similar to that of human skin.
