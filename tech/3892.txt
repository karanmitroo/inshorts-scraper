Dating app Tinder reportedly operates a secret version of the platform called Tinder Select, which is meant to serve "CEOs, supermodels, and other hyper-attractive/upwardly affluent types." According to the report, Tinder invited a select group of people to the platform, some of whom can 'nominate' others. Tinder Select members can switch between regular Tinder and the exclusive platform.
