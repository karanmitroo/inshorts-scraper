Twitter on Friday announced that it will stop counting @usernames in replies to tweets towards its 140-character limit, which it had started testing last year. In September 2016, Twitter started rolling out changes to stop counting media attachments like photos, GIFs, videos and polls in tweets. The micro-blogging platform also lets users quote tweets without counting them as characters.
