MIT researchers have developed an app that lets users track calorie counts by verbally describing the contents of a meal. The speech-controlled nutrition-logging system automatically retrieves nutritional data of meal descriptions from an online database of the US Department of Agriculture. Users can also refine their descriptions, either verbally or by selecting precise information on the app.
