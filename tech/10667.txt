Space agency NASA tested what it calls the "Ferrari of Rocket Engines," on Thursday designed for the Space Launch System rocket. The RS-25 rocket "is one of the most complex and efficient rocket engines in the world." Space Launch System will reportedly be NASAâ€™s most powerful rocket ever built and will enable astronauts to travel deeper into the solar system.
