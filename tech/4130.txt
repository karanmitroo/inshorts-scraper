UK-based company Angie Scott Cakes digitally decorates wedding cakes with video projection. The six-tier cakes feature two plain white sides on which a 10-minute specialised video is projected. The video can be made up of photo collages, moving animations, video messages and handwritten messages. Other options for the projections include fireworks and computer games like Pac-Man.
