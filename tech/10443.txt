Microsoft’s virtual assistant Cortana failed to understand CEO Satya Nadella’s voice commands thrice at Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference on Wednesday. While delivering his keynote address, Nadella asked Cortana, "Show me my most at-risk opportunities.” In its first attempt Cortana displayed search results for "Show me to buy milk at this opportunity” and opened up reminders in the second.
