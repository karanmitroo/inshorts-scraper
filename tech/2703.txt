Two 26-year-old Indo-Canadian engineers Manmeet Maggu and Rahul Udasi have developed the first commercial exoskeleton for children with disabilities. Maggu was motivated to develop an "Iron Man-like" suit after his Delhi-based nephew was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a disease that impairs motor function. Maggu and Udasi have set up a start-up, Trexo Robotics, to roll out the exoskeleton.
