Instant messaging app Telegram has increased the upper limit for its supergroup feature to 5,000 from 1,000 participants. Different from standard group chats, supergroups are optimized for larger number of people. It allows new members to see the entire message history and by default keeps notifications on mute. Further, when a user deletes a message, it is deleted for everyone.
