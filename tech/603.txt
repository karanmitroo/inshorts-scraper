Google has removed 60 gaming applications from Play Store after they were found to be infected with a malware that displayed pornographic advertisements. The apps, several of which were children-focussed, were attempting to trick users into installing fake security apps, according to security firm Check Point. The malware hid inside games that were downloaded 3 to 7 million times.
