The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on Saturday launched their new solid-fuel rocket- Epsilon carrying "SPRINT-A" telescope built for remote observation of planets, in a launch coordinated by just two laptops and eight persons. The 79-feet long and 91-tonnes heavy Epsilon is the first rocket in the world to be equipped with artificial intelligence for autonomous launch checks by itself.
