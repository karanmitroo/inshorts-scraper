Bajaj Auto is set to launch its quadricycle 'Qute' by September end in 16 countries. Priced at $2000, the vehicle is backed by a 217 cc engine, which gives an efficiency of 36 kilometres per litre and can reach a top speed of 70 km per hour. The company still awaits Supreme Court verdict to launch the vehicle in India.
