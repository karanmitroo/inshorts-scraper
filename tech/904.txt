Facebook is testing a feature to let users' comments on posts be visible to only a particular section of its audience. It can be enabled by clicking on the 'padlock' icon showing privacy options like friends only, post owner and commenter only, and everyone else. Facebook is also testing a 'Greetings' feature for users to send a wink, or high-five.
