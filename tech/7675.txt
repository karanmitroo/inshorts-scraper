The public websites of the central banks of Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyberattacks on Monday, claimed officials. No money was lost in the attacks following the regional cooperation between the central banks. While there is no word on who the hackers were, activist hacking group Anonymous last month had pledged to target banks across the world.
