As an April Fools' Day prank in 2013, Twitter announced it would let users buy a single additional character, expanding their tweet to 141 characters. Twitter said that users would have to bid for the additional character which meant the more popular a character, the higher its price. The company on Monday relaxed its 140-character limit.
