Thomas Edison, who invented the phonograph on August 12, 1877, recorded the nursery rhyme 'Mary had a little lamb' as the first words on the device. Phonograph was the first device capable of recording and reproducing sound. “It’s my baby. It’s gonna take care of me in my old days,” said Edison about his invention.
