Suntory, Japanâ€™s oldest distillery, has announced that it will send six whisky samples to the International Space Station next month, to observe the effects of zero-gravity on their ageing process. This includes the Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013, which was named the best whisky in the world last year. The first sample will return to Earth after a year.
