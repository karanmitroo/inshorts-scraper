Facebook once hired a man to know why people like the company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The employee, Tavis McGinn, has revealed that his job was to do surveys and focus groups globally to understand why people like him. McGinn, who had originally applied for a job in market research, left the company after working for six months last year.
