The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai has backed SpaceX's plan to provide broadband services using satellites. If adopted, it'll be the first approval given to an American company to provide broadband services using such technology, Pai said. SpaceX filed an application seeking permission to launch 4,425 satellites to provide high-speed internet coverage in 2016.
