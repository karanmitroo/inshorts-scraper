Canadian technology company BlackBerry has partnered with American automaker Ford to make 'cars of the future' by providing software to help develop self-driving cars. BlackBerry has previously worked with startups to develop technology that brakes a car automatically when it spots something in its path. Ford has announced plans of selling 1,00,000 self-driven taxis by 2021.
