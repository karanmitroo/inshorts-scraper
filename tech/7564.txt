Drexel University researchers have created a computer game called 'DietDash' which they claim, can help the people lose weight. It asks players to respond to images of sugary as well as healthy foods to improve their inhibitory control. An app called 'DietAlert' has also been created that learns the users' eating patterns to help them stick to their diet plans.
