Ransomware is a malicious program that locks files on a user's computer or smartphone till they meet attackers' ransom demands. Researchers encourage users hit by ransomware to call law enforcement and not pay the money demanded, as it doesn't guarantee the computers will be unlocked. Preventive measures include using anti-virus, backing up files, and updating the device's software regularly.
