Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US have developed flexible solar panels, which they claim to be the thinnest and the lightest. These solar panels can be placed on any surface including soap bubbles, smartphones or clothes. The scientists said that these solar cells could help to power the next generation of portable electronic devices.
