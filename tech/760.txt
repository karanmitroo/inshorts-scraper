Japanese automaker Honda's subsidiary Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI) has said it doesn't have the technology for electric two-wheelers. The company does not have plans to bring electric vehicles to India as it is difficult to meet customer expectations, HMSI CEO Minoru Kato said. "In Japan, we launched electric in the past but they donâ€™t exist anymore," he added.
