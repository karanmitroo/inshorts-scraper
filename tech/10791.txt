The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which has so far launched 45 satellites for 19 nations, will now help the US to launch one of its satellites. This is the first time that the US would use an Indian vehicle, the PSLV, for satellite launch. In the next two years, 28 foreign satellites are expected to be launched.
