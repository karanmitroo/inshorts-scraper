Google on Wednesday launched the third developer preview of its upcoming Android operating system called 'Android N'. It features a VR mode that will allow VR apps to use its smooth head-tracking, stereo notifications and low latency graphics. It also introduced a feature for seamless updates, meaning devices running Android N or greater can install system updates in the background.
