Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry on Tuesday announced it will no longer manufacture its Classic model, one of the company’s last smartphone models with a physical keyboard to input text. "The Classic has long surpassed the average lifespan for a smartphone in today’s market," said BlackBerry. The company is reportedly launching three new Android-based smartphones in the next three quarters.
