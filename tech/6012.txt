Dating app Bumble has updated its rules on photo moderation to prohibit the users from posting a mirror selfie on their profile. Pictures in underwear, bikini or swimwear photos not taken at the beach and photos of children without adults are also banned. The online platform said that the new rules bring real-life etiquette to online dating.
