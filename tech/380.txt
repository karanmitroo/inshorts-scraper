A US appeals court has ruled that dating app Tinder is discriminating against users above 30 by charging them $19.99 per month for its premium service, Tinder Plus. In comparison, users below 30 years of age are being charged $9.99 per month. This came after Allan Candelore sued Tinder over the pricing on behalf of himself and other California consumers.
