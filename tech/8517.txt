According to reports by Samsung-focused blog SamMobile, Samsung was granted a patent in South Korea for smart contact lenses embedded with a built-in camera, a display, antennas and sensors to detect eye movement. The antennas then beam the acquired data to external smartphone-like devices for processing. The company reportedly developed the lenses to offer improved augmented reality experience.
