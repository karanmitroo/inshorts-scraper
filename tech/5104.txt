The Co-founder of software company Autonomy which was sold to HP for $11 billion, Michael Lynch has called HP's $5 billion lawsuit alleging him of fraud "bullsh*t and spin". HP alleged that two Autonomy executives including Lynch overstated their company's financial status, making HP pay more during the buyout. Lynch has countersued HP for $160 million for ruining his reputation.
