Instagram is rolling out video channels in its Explore section on Android and iOS. This will enable users to view a personalized channel called ‘Videos You Might Like’ and other ‘Featured’ video channels under the section. Explore connects users to posts they might be interested in from people they don’t yet follow. The feature is currently available in the US.
