A Seoul court on Thursday denied Samsung's claim that Apple violated three of its patent related to SMS. The court said, Samsung patents lacked 'progressiveness' and can be easily developed by others. Samsung had sued Apple in March 2012. The ruling is the latest blow to Samsung, which owes Apple $930 million from two jury verdicts in Silicon Valley.
