Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, which has been selling its handsets only through online mode, will soon foray into offline space. Its phones will be available at 300 outlets of 'The Mobile Store' across the country. However, Xiaomi will continue its exclusive online partnership with Flipkart and its phones will cost the same both online and offline.
