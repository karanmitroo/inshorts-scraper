The power button resembles a small circle with a vertical line. The universal symbol is believed to have originated when the term 'On and Off' was replaced by numbers 1 and 0. The numbers were derived from the binary system, in which 1 stands for power and 0 indicates power off. The numbers were later merged to form the symbol.
