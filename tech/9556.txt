US-based technology firm Intel set a new Guinness World Record for 'Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously' with 100 drones. The drones, controlled by Intel PCs, showcased a live light show on Beethovenâ€™s Fifth Symphony. The event happened in November last year but the footage was first shown during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).
