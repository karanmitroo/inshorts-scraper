Apple has said that the music streaming app Spotify is asking for "preferential treatment" in the App Store's approval process. This comes after Spotify accused Apple of blocking the app's update to prevent it from competing with Apple Music. "We find it troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules we apply to all developers," said Apple.
