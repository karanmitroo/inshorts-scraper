The trial in the lawsuit between Google-spinoff Waymo and cab-hailing startup Uber began on Monday. Google had sued Uber in February 2017 for stealing its 'LiDAR' technology used by self-driving cars. In the lawsuit, Google accused its former engineer Anthony Levandowski, who later founded a startup which was taken over by Uber, of stealing 14,000 files before quitting the company.
