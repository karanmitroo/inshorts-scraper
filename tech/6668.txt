A team at Canada-based Memorial University of Newfoundland has developed 'Mune', a new kind of electronic musical instrument. The digital instrument, which has been launched for crowdfunding on Kickstarter, is accompanied with an app and can be used for drum beat sequencing, DJ-ing, playing piano and synthesizer. It can also be used as a controller to modify several instruments' sounds.
