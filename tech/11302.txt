Few technical glitches surfaced during the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) which was held online for the first time on Sunday. Some students reportedly complained of losing about 15 minutes as advertisements popped up on screen during the examination. CLAT is the gateway to admissions in undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes (LLB and LLM) in 16 National Law Universities.
