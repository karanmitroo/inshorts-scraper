The world's first internet domain 'Symbolics.com' was registered 32 years ago, on March 15, 1985, and still exists today. It was created by the now obsolete Massachusetts-based computer manufacturer Symbolics. Symbolics.com remained under the same ownership for nearly 25 years, after which it was purchased by XF.com Investments for an undisclosed sum in 2009.
