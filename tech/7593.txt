Expressing disappointment at the announcement of 'Nougat' as the name of Android N, a user tweeted, "Android N is Nougat. I was ready with a bottle of Nutella Google.Thanks for ruining it". While some other tweets read "Android N is now Nougat. I like the letter 'N' better" and "Wait, they didn't name Android N 'Android Null-Pointer Exception'? Missed opportunity".
