Wisconsin-based Three Square Market has given its employees the option of receiving a rice-sized implant in their hands for free. The microchip will enable employees to open the front door without a key or buy snacks without using a credit card, cash, or smartphone. The company says 50 employees have signed up for the implant so far.
