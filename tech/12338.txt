India has created history in space, as its first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), entered the Martian orbit at around 8 am (IST) on Wednesday morning. Remarkably, India has become the first Asian country to reach Mars and the first nation to enter the Red Planet in the first attempt. PM Narendra Modi congratulated ISRO scientists for their hard work.
