Android Co-founder Andy Rubin on Wednesday tweeted a picture of one of his co-workers working on a new product and asked people to guess what the product could be. Last month, Rubin teased his startup Essential's first smartphone, which appeared to have an edge-to-edge display. Rubin's startup is reportedly made up of former employees of Apple and Google.
