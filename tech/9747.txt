Computer hardware company Asus reportedly partnered with AdBlock Plus on Friday to embed the ad-blocking services in its smartphone's browser and turning it on by default starting from 2016. With this move, Asus became the first hardware producer to integrate ad-blocking service into its mobile devices. By blocking ads, AdBlock helps the users to avoid potential malware threat.
