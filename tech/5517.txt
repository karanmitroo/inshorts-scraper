Budget carrier SpiceJet on Thursday said that passengers are prohibited from carrying Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in hand, check-in baggages, and cargo. Aviation regulator DGCA had issued a fresh advisory on Galaxy Note 7 last month, asking passengers not to carry them onboard. The ban comes after several reports of device catching fire and its subsequent withdrawal by Samsung.
