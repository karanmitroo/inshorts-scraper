Uber has started delivering goods using its fleet of self-driving trucks on its shipping-on-demand app 'Uber Freight', the ride-hailing startup said on Tuesday. The shipments are taking place in the US state of Arizona where the company is also testing its robot taxis. Uber said the trucks drive autonomously on the highway while drivers take over for the last miles.
