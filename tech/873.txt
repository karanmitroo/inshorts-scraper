American electric carmaker Tesla has restricted the use of its Superchargers for vehicles used for commercial purposes, according to an updated policy. It also applies to vehicles being deployed as taxis by ride-hailing businesses like Uber and Lyft. The move is intended to keep the high-speed battery chargers available for customers without immediate access to home or workplace charging.
