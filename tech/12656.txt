In an interesting discovery, a US astronomer named Ethan Kruse has discovered an 'upside-down planet', that reveals new method for studying binary star systems (a system of two stars very close to each other). Kruse's discovery confirms an astronomer's prediction in 1973 - based on stellar evolution models of the time - that such a system should be possible.
