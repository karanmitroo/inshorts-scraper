After 5 years of work, Netherlands has become the world's first country to open a solar road for public use. Named "Solaroad", it was made with cheap mass-produced solar panels, sandwiched between layers of glass, near the Dutch town of Krommenie near Amsterdam. The solar panels are connected to smart meters, which can optimize their output and feed electricity.
