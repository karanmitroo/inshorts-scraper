A team of MIT researchers have developed a way to 3D-print programmable hair called Cilllia. Cilllia can be programmed by specifying certain parameters to provide warmth, adhesion, locomotion and act as a sensor, a researcher said. The team created several toys including finger swipe sensors and a furry bunny fitted with an LED that changed colors when petted.
