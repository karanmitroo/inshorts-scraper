In order to support the ongoing anti-government protests, a group of Pakistani hackers brought down several government portals, including that of the Army, and leaked 23,000 bank records overnight. "...And we will initiate the process of removing every vestige of the Pakistan government from the Internet and shutting down their communications network," said the group calling itself ASOR Hack Team.
