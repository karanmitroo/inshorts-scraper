Starting November 30, Facebook is launching an 'Instant Games' initiative where users will be able to play 17 different games including Pac-Man and Galaga, in both the Messenger and News Feed. The Messenger will feature a controller icon that will show the games a user can play. The feature is currently available as a beta version to select users.
