A Brazilian judge on Monday ordered network operators in the country to block Whatsapp messaging service for 72 hours. However, the Sergipe state court did not reveal the reason for the order. This reportedly affects around 100 million users across the country. This is the second time in five months that a Brazilian court order blocked Whatsapp in the country.
