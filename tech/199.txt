Billionaire investor George Soros has said Facebook and Google have left the US government impotent with their monopoly while only the EU has the power to stop them. Soros also compared the internet giants to casinos, luring people to gamble their money. He further attacked the companies for considering themselves "masters of the universe" and called them "obstacles to innovation".
