Tech giant Apple, which has been keen to enter India since 2006, has asked Indian government to relax sourcing norms in FDI policy, as it plans to set up wholly-owned retail outlets in India. Apple currently runs stores modelled on its global retail outlets through franchisees in India. Globally, Apple Inc operates more than 360 wholly-owned stores in 12 countries.
