Bloomberg created an interactive website tracking each of billionaire Elon Musk's startups to mark his 46th birthday on Wednesday. It also shows whether targets set by Musk for Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, and Neuralink are on schedule or not. For example, Musk had set 37 goals for electric carmaker Tesla, of which 11 have been completed and two are delayed.
