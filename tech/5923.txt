Playboy has launched digital versions of its nudity-free magazines on Apple and Google app stores in an effort to reach a broader audience. The in-app subscription of the monthly magazine costs $17.99 (₹1,200) a year, or $5.99 (₹400) per issue. The magazine was previously available on some digital newsstands but was restricted on the app stores due to nude content.
