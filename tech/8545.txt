Hong Kong-based product and graphic designer Ricky Ma has unveiled a female robot prototype called Mark I, resembling Hollywood celebrity Scarlett Johansson. Built with 3D-printed parts and silicone skin, it responds to a set of programmed verbal commands. It can also make facial expressions such as a smile or a wink and make statements like “Hehe” and “Thank you.”
