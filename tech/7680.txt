South Korea-based researchers have developed flexible photovoltaic cells with a thickness of about 1 micrometre â€“ 100 times thinner than an average human hair. The team claimed that these cells, built using the semiconductor gallium arsenide, worked properly even when wrapped around a 1.4 mm wide object. The advancement can be used in portable power sources for wearable flexible electronics.
