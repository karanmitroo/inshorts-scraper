ISRO on Thursday successfully performed the first orbit-raising manoeuvre of the Mars Orbiter, which is currently orbiting Earth after its launch on Tuesday. ISRO has scheduled a series of five orbit-raising operations starting today and last one on Nov-16 that would raise the apogee (farthest point from Earth) to 1,92,000 km, followed by the trans-Mars injection on Dec-1.
