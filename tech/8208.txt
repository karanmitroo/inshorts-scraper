Microsoft, in partnership with Swedish image bank Pickit, has revamped its Clip Art service to provide Windows 10 and Office users with legally-cleared, high-quality images. The crowd-sourced images will be uploaded by individual photographers and stock image banks, who will receive 60% of the revenues made. The service was earlier killed off in 2014.
