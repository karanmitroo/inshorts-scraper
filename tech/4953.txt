Tokyo-based Internet of Things company Vinclu Inc has created Gatebox AI, a virtual personal assistant featuring a female anime-like character projected inside a glass tube. The device can be connected to the user's home network to automate household appliances. Further, voice controls let the user talk to it, with the option of engaging in text messaging when not at home.
