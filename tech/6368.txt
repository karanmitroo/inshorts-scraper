Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras have developed an exhaust emission prediction model that can reportedly measure pollution from vehicles in real-time. Through this, the software-based model can assist policy makers in managing grid-wise traffic flow, indicate roads that register the highest pollution levels, and help manage urban air quality, developer Rohit Jaykumar said.
