Researchers in the US have developed a ‘smart’ insulin patch from nontoxic, biocompatible materials that detects blood-sugar levels and secretes Insulin doses into the bloodstream. The thin square patch is smaller than a penny and has more than a hundred needles the size of an eyelash. Scientists have emulated vesicles, the body’s natural Insulin generators to create the painless system.
