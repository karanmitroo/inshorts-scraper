Multinational technology company IBM had released a video in 2006 of a concept similar to the hi-tech 'Go' stores unveiled by Amazon on Monday. The video shows a man walking around a supermarket, putting items in his jacket, and walking out without paying the bill. Amazon Go stores will detect the items picked and charge the customers through an app.
