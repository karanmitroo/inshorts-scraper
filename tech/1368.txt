Technology giant Google has said that it has launched an investigation on reports of Pixel 2 XL OLED screens burn-in. Users on Sunday reported Pixel screens turning grey within a week of the device's usage which suggests burn-in. Google did not offer a verdict on the issue, but stressed that it puts products through "extensive quality testing".
