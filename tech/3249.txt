May 11 is marked as the National Technology Day to commemorate India's technological achievements, including the initiation of 'Operation Shakti' (Pokhran-II) at the Indian Army's Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan in 1998. Following Operation Shakti, erstwhile Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee then declared India a full-fledged nuclear state, making it the sixth country to join the "nuclear club".
