Two US lawyers have been charged with extorting about $6 million out of porn pirates over three years. The lawyers allegedly uploaded pornographic videos to torrent websites and targeted users who downloaded the content. The men then threatened to sue the users for piracy under copyright violation unless they agreed to pay them a settlement.
