Facebook-owned instant messaging platform WhatsApp is reportedly testing a new feature that will let users pin three chats at the top of their conversation list. The feature will remove the effort needed to scroll down to a person's chat to get back to a conversation. A long press on a chat in the conversation list will show the pinning option.
