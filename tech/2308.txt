A privacy advocacy group has accused Google of invading users' privacy by tracking in-store purchases made by them. Google gathers data on the products bought by users by tracking their financial transactions and lets businesses see how online searches translate to sales. The group claimed that it is hard for users to avoid Google's purchase tracking.
