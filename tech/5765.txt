Following the announcement of fitting all its new cars with fully self-driving hardware, electric carmaker Tesla has asked customers not to use the cars to earn money. "Using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride-hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network," the company said.
