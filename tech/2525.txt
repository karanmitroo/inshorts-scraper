Taiwanese electronics company HTC has admitted that it has accidentally been showing ads within the default keyboard app 'TouchPal' on some of its smartphones. HTC has asked users to uninstall TouchPal's updates, and the keyboard's developer has claimed that a server issue led to the unwanted advertisements. "This is absolutely not the experience we intended," said HTC in a statement.
