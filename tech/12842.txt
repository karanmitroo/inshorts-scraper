Apologizing for the Saturday’s outage, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum Sunday said - “We are sorry about the downtime. It has been our longest and biggest outage in years. It was caused by a network router fault which cascaded into our servers.” WhatsApp was down for more than three hours on Saturday just days after Facebook bought it for $19 billion.
