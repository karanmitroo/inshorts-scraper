Engineers at the Harvard University in collaboration with ReWalk Robotics have developed a lightweight, wearable soft robot to assist people with lower limb disabilities in regaining mobility. The robot uses compact, powerful actuators packaged in a belt to provide physiological assistance to the wearerâ€™s legs. It can be used by stroke, multiple sclerosis and elderly patients to improve mobility.
