Researchers at the Wyss Institute of Harvard University have developed a laser-assisted technology that allows metal to be 3D printed in midair. Silver nanoparticle ink is deposited through a nozzle which is instantly heated and solidified by a laser into wires thinner than a human hair. These wires can be used in flexible electronics, sensors and biomedical devices.
