Researchers from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology have developed an ultra-compact nanomechanical sensor that can detect cancerous tumors as well as viral disease markers for HIV, hepatitis and herpes. The highly sensitive sensor will allow diagnosis of diseases long before they can be detected by any other method. It will pave a way for a new generation of diagnostics.
