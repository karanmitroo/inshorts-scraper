LinkedIn's Co-founder Reid Hoffman and his wife have donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organisation. The donations will fund the 'Biohub' laboratory where researchers will work together to cure diseases. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg and his wife pledged to spend $3 billion over the next 10 years to fight diseases.
