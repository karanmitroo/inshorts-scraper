The @Sweden account on micro-blogging site Twitter has been handled by private citizens, who take turns to manage the account on a weekly basis, since 2011. The citizens tweet about life in Sweden and share different ideas. Inspired by the @Sweden project, Ireland has also allowed a similar weekly 'rotational curation' of the @Ireland Twitter handle from 2013.
