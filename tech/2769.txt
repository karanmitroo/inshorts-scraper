Google on Tuesday was hit with a record $2.7 billion fine by European Union regulators for illegally favouring its shopping service in search results. This is the biggest fine for a company in an EU antitrust case. Google will face 5% penalty of its parent company Alphabet's average daily worldwide turnover if the practice is not stopped in 90 days.
