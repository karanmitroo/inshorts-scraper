Kolkata Police are all set to launch a mobile application that will make it easy for investigating officers to immediately get hold of past records of criminals. The Deputy Commissioner (south suburban division) Santosh Pandey is leading a team of policemen with dedicated IT and forensic experts to develop the app. The app will likely be called M-Watch.
