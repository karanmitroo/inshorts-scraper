Music streaming service SoundCloud has partnered with Sony Music Entertainment (SME), thus increasing the number of songs on its platform. Further, artists affiliated with SME will now be able to generate revenue off of their tracks hosted on SoundCloud, and have access to SoundCloudâ€™s promotional tools and analytics data. SoundCloud already has similar deals with three other music publishers.
