American startup Faraday Future, which unveiled world's fastest production electric car FF 91, failed to get the car park itself with a button press following a technical glitch during launch. The car failed to move when company's investor and LeEco Founder Jia Yueting pressed the self-parking button. "It's a little bit crazy," said an executive after the failed attempt.
