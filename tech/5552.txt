The China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) has announced plans to build the world's fastest commercial train with a top speed of 600 kmph using magnetic levitation technology. Shanghai Maglev, the fastest train currently operational, can travel at 430 kmph. Japan recently tested a train faster than 600 kmph but it will not be ready for commercial use until 2027.
