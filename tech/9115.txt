A team of scientists in the US has developed a new 3D bioprinter called the Integrated Tissue and Organ Printing System that can print human tissues made of living cells. The team has so far printed an ear, part of a jawbone, muscle, and cartilage structures. The 3D printed tissues are strong enough to replace human tissues, the researchers reported.
