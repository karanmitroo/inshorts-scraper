Pornhub has reportedly sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey offering to buy the video-sharing platform Vine. Twitter on Thursday announced that it will be shutting down the app that lets users share six-second-long looping videos. "Porn in six seconds is more than enough time for most people to enjoy themselves," wrote Pornhub's Vice President in the letter.
