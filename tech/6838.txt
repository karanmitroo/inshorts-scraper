In his first interview after being named the CEO of Microsoft in 2014, Satya Nadella said he was "honored, humbled, excited" to be offered the position. Nadella said his first priority as CEO would be to "ruthlessly remove any obstacles" keeping Microsoft from innovating. Nadella, who turned 49Â on Friday, is the first non-American CEO of Microsoft.
