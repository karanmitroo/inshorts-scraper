Researchers at the University of East Anglia, UK, have developed a lip-reading speech recognition technology that can be applied at places where the audio is not good enough to determine the speech. It could be used in several situations like helping people with hearing or speech impairments or enhancing audio-less video footage with additional speech data during criminal investigations.
