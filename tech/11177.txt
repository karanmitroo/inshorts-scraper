Lenovo on Thursday unveiled Magic View, a dual-screen Android smartwatch at an event in Beijing. The smartwatch sports two screens - main display and virtual interactive display. The second-screen removes physical limitations of the main screen by using optical reflections to produce a virtual image 20 times larger than the watch face. It resembles Moto 360 with a round display.
