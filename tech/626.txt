Singapore-founded gaming company Razer has unveiled the 'Project Linda' concept at CES 2018 which extends the smartphone into a full laptop. It features a 13.3-inch display shell with a dock for the recently launched Razer Phone which functions as a touchpad for the laptop. Further, the hardware runs the laptop-sized version of Android which is the same as the smartphone.
