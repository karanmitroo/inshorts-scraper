Technology giant Microsoft has launched a new Windows Bounty Program to pay up to ₹1.6 crore for finding severe vulnerabilities and security bugs in Microsoft Edge or Windows 10 preview builds. It extends to "design flaws that compromise a customer’s privacy and security". Facebook and Google also offer bug programs for researchers to find vulnerabilities to prevent widespread cyber attacks.
