According to NASA scientists, the giant black hole in the Milky Way may be producing neutrinos, the origin of which is one of the biggest problems in astrophysics today. Neutrinos are tiny particles that carry no charge and interact very weakly with electrons and protons. The discovery may also contribute to the understanding of the source of high-energy cosmic rays.
