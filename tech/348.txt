Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has claimed to set a new spaceflight record for launching the smallest rocket ever to carry a satellite into orbit. The SS-520 sounding rocket carried a three-unit micro-satellite measuring 13.6 inches in length and weighing 3 kgs. The launch came after the agency's tiny, experimental rocket failed to reach the orbit last year.
