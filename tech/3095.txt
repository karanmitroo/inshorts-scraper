Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard commencement speech was streamed live on the social media platform with wrong and misspelled captions like, "Everyone has a sense of purposos..." The errors were initially thought to be a result of Facebook's closed-captioning system, but the company later clarified that Harvard was responsible for the captions.
