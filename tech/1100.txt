US-based high-speed transport technology startup Virgin Hyperloop One has signed MoUs with governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka to conduct feasibility study of routes in the states. Hyperloop said it could reduce commute time between Pune and Mumbai to about 14 minutes. Citizens could commute 10 times farther in the same amount of time by connecting regions in Karnataka, Hyperloop added.
