US-based automaker Ford has filed a patent for a head-rest with a built-in secret compartment that can hide a wrap-around neck pillow. The design of the headrest features a hidden door that allows it to split in two, revealing the concealed pillow. Ford has noted that this feature will facilitate 'napping' and represent 'a significant advance in passenger comfort'.
