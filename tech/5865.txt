The Indian arm of electronics major Samsung has issued a formal apology to customers who had pre-booked the now-discontinued Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Samsung is offering a free Samsung Gear VR to customers who purchase its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones instead. The company has also promised a one-time screen replacement within a year of purchase.
