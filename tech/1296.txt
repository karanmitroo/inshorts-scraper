Ten VIP ticket holders volunteered to have microchips implanted into their hands which were preloaded with a three-day pass to Pause Fest, a technology fest which will be held in Australia in February. The microchips were implanted between the volunteers' thumbs and forefingers. The chips will also be programmed to unlock the door to the volunteer's home, gym, or workplace.
