Mojio, a Canada-based connected car platform, is launching an app and services store called Mojio Drive. It will feature 20 services that range from apps that can connect cars to local garages to apps that measure driving habits and share that information with insurance agencies. Mojio is based around a built-in wireless device that can work even without a phone.
