French investigators raided Google's Paris headquarters on Tuesday as part of an investigation into tax evasion and money laundering that started in June last year, the financial prosecutor's office said. The internet giant has been accused of owing $1.8 billion in unpaid taxes to the French state. However, Google has not made any comment on the case so far.
