According to reports by online magazine Motherboard, Starcon, a Facebook-like social networking service that was recently launched in North Korea, was hacked by an 18-year-old college student from Scotland named Andrew McKean. McKean said that he guessed "admin" and "password" as the website's login credentials, which gave him admin privileges, allowing him to make several changes to the website.
