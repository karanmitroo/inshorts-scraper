A research report by Ajay Sharma, assistant director for education with the Himachal Pradesh government, says that the second law of motion has been unscientifically credited to Newton. "In Newton's time, acceleration and second derivatives were not given. So it was impossible for Newton to write F=ma," Sharma said. According to him, the law was given by Leonhard Euler.
