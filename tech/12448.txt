After a limited release last month, Blackberry has finally launched BBM for Windows, making it available to all users. Though the app isn't as functional as the ones for iOS and Android, Blackberry has promised to introduce new features like BBM Voice and Channels, soon. It is compatible with Windows phone 8 and 8.1, currently.
