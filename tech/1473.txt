Technology giant Apple has been granted a patent for self-adjusting Apple Watch bands, which automatically tighten or loosen to fit the user's wrist. The patent describes bands which users could electronically adjust either manually or in automatic response to biometric data from the Watch. However, there is no proof whether Apple will build the self-adjusting bands into an actual product.
