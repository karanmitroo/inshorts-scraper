French startup Novitact has developed 'Unitact', a smart bracelet that helps the hearing impaired people communicate easily through touch and vibrations. The app-connected device vibrates on the set alarm timings and lights up on receiving texts, calls or notifications. Users can also communicate important messages by assigning different vibrations to each message through the app.
