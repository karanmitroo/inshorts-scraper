Huawei Business Group CEO Richard Yu has admitted that some units of its P10 smartphone are slower than others as there's a "serious shortage" of flash memory in the supply chain. Yu noted that different P10 units shipped with different memory chips. This comes after users complained of data reading speeds as low as 250MB/s while other devices had 750MB/s.
