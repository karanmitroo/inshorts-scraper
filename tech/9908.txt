The Indian Space Research Organisation is reportedly developing a new navigation system called the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) to replace the existing GPS and improve the positioning system service at remote places. An agency official said that the new system could also be used to track and monitor a fleet of ships and trucks with more accuracy.
