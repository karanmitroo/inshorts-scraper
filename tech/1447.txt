Android Co-founder Andy Rubin's phone-making startup Essential has been sued by Nest Co-founder Tony Fadell-backed startup Keyssa for allegedly stealing its wireless connector technology. Keyssa claims Essential held technology talks with it for 10 months, before breaking the deal in favour of its rival. Keyssa provides technology which allows wireless data transmission without WiFi or Bluetooth.
