US President Donald Trump is using a new iPhone, the White House's Director of Social Media Dan Scavino Jr revealed on Wednesday. This comes after several Twitter users noticed that some of Trump's tweets appeared to be sent from an iPhone over the last few weeks. Earlier, Trump had faced criticism from Democratic senators for using an 'unsecured' Android phone.
