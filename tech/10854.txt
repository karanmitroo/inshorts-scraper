Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy on Wednesday said that India has failed to generate even a single "earth-shaking" invention in the past 60 years that could become a household name globally. “Our youngsters have not done impactful research work despite being equal to their counterparts in intellect and energy in Western universities,” Murthy said in an address in Bangalore.
