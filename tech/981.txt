Samsung has filed for a patent for a smartphone with fully curved display that bends 180 degrees to the back of the device. The new Samsung phone will reportedly replace the physical power and volume buttons with virtual ones. Last year, Samsung filed a patent for a 'foldable' smartphone and is reportedly expected to launch in 2018.
