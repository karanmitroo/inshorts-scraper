Ajit Pai, the recently-appointed Chairman of Federal Communications Commission, which regulates broadband in the US, has called net neutrality rules "a mistake". Pai added, "Rules developed to tame 1930s monopoly were imported into 21st century to regulate the internet." Net neutrality is the principle that data on the internet should not be priced differentially based on users or content.
