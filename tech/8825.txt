Former CIA employee Edward Snowden and Russian feminist protest group Pussy Riot, along with ad-blocking browser extension AdBlock, have launched an online campaign to protest against cyber censorship. The campaign, displaying messages from activists, would only be visible to AdBlock users. Notably, the campaign marks the 'World Day against Cyber Censorship', which is held on March 12 every year.
