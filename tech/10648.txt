The leading manufacturer of wireless activity tracking devices Fitbit recently launched its Universal App for the Windows 10 Store. However, the Windows 10 Mobile and XBox One apps will be made available later this year. The Fitbit App logs steps, food intake, weight, height, sleep and excercise using Fitbit products and supports the latest Windows 10 features Cortana and Continuum.
