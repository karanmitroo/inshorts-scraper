US-based researchers have developed a flexible wearable monitoring system that can scan the biochemical reactions and electrical signals running inside one's body. It records heart signals and tracks levels of chemicals related to physical effort in real time. The device, which can communicate with external devices via Bluetooth, can be used by athletes and physicians among others.
