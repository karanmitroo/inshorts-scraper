In a push for environment, Apple has collaborated with WWF for a 10-day campaign to launch ‘Apps for Earth’ on its App Store. The section features 27 exclusive apps, including Angry Birds 2 and Line, that are designed around the idea of conservation of forests, oceans, and wildlife. All proceeds from the app purchases will go to WWF.
