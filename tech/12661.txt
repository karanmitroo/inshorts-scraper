Japan's Hitachi on Monday said it will provide the world's fastest elevators, which can clock speeds of up to 72kmph, to the 111-storey, 530-metre-tall Guangzhou CTF Financial Centre due to be opened in 2016. It will be able to travel the length of the 440 metre shaft - from the first to 95th floor - in a stomach-churning 43 seconds.
