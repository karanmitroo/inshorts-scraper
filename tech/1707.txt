Apple's CEO Tim Cook earlier this week said, $999 (₹65,000) is a value price "for the technology you're getting" in the iPhone X. He said this in response to a question on whether the price for iPhone X is out of reach for the average American. The phone is priced at ₹89,000 (64 GB) and ₹1,02,000 (256 GB) in India.
