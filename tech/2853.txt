Apple's former head of iOS Scott Forstall has revealed that the project that led to iPhone's creation began because Steve Jobs "hated this guy at Microsoft...Anytime Steve had any interaction with the guy, he'd come back pissed off." The Microsoft employee talked about the company's tablet with stylus, which prompted Jobs to create a multitouch display without need for stylus.
