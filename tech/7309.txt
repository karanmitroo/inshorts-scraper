Google on Tuesday unveiled its 'Arts & Culture' app that lets users explore artworks and take 360 degree tours of museums, heritage sites, and landmarks via Google Cardboard. Users can discover artwork by time period, historical figures, and even by colour. By pointing their phone camera to a painting, users will be able to find more information about it.
