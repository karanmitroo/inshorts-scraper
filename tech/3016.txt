Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp has added photo filters, albums, and reply shortcuts to its iOS app. Users can choose from five filters when sharing a photograph and over four photos will automatically upload as an album rather than individual files. With the reply shortcuts, users can respond to a specific message in a chat simply by swiping on it.
