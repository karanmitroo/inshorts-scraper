Dean Smith from Australia recently sued the Museums Board of Victoria over negligence. Smith, while participating in a virtual reality race against Olympic medallist Cathy Freeman, ran into a wall, injuring himself at the Scienceworks museum last year. He claimed to have fractured one vertebra, a rib, and lost feeling in his arms, hands and fingers.
