Google has launched 'Window Wonderland', an interactive experience that allows users to take a virtual tour of the Christmas displays of shops in New York City. The feature, which exhibits decorations from 18 stores, aims to highlight the tradition which dates back nearly 150 years.   It includes window art displays from Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Burberry, Fendi and Cartier.
