Technology major Microsoft on Tuesday claimed that its speech recognition technology can now recognize the words in a conversation as good as a human does. The technology makes the same or fewer errors than professional transcriptionists. It is reportedly for the first time that a computer has recognized the words in a conversation as well as a person would.
