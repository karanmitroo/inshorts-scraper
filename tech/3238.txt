Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Wednesday said it is up to the technology sector to ensure that a dystopian future as imagined in George Orwell's novel '1984' doesn't come true. The book features a government that monitors and controls its citizens through technology. â€œThe future of computing is going to be defined by the choices that... developers make," Nadella added.
