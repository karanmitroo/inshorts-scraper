Samsung Tuesday launched its big-screen (5.5 inches) smartphone Galaxy Note-3 Neo, priced at Rs. 40,900. Despite being a cheaper variant of its popular flagship Note-3, Neo still includes most of the high-end features from Note-3 - such as Air Command and Multi Window, among others. It would be available in India later this month, the company said.
