Spanish mattress company Durmet claims to have created a smart mattress called â€˜Smarttress' to detect cheating by a partner. It has a 'Lover Detection System' with 24 sensors which can capture 'suspicious bed movements' and send alerts to both bed owners when the mattress is used. The app can also track a range of statistics like speed, intensity and impact.
