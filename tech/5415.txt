San Diego-based engineers have fabricated the world's first semiconductor-free, optically-controlled microelectronic device. Using a gold-based metamaterial, they built a microscale device that shows a 1,000% increase in conductivity when activated by low voltage and a low power laser. The discovery could lead to the development of more efficient solar panels.
