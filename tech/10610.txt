Physicist Stephen Hawking presented his new theories on black holes on Tuesday where he focused on the information paradox, which says the information about the star that forms a black hole is lost inside it. He said, "[T]he information is stored not in the interior of the black hole as one might expect, but in its boundary, the event horizon."
