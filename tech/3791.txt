Jeff Bezos, the Founder and CEO of Amazon, piloted a giant 13-foot-tall robot at MARS, an annual invite-only technology conference on Monday. Bezos was seen waving around the robot's arms at the conference. The robot named 'Method-2' is made by South Korean robotics company Hankook Mirae Technology and resembles the bipedal robots showed in the movie 'Avatar'.
