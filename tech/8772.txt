Sony has unveiled a wearable digital assistant called ‘Arc’. Meant to be worn around the neck, Arc can provide users with weather updates, local news and other location-based information. It can play back audio without the user needing to wear earbuds and also sports a hidden camera that only opens up if the device is told to take a photo.
