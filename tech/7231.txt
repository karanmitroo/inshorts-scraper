A private experimental project's solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse 2 completed the first ever round-the-world solar flight after it touched down in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. The plane, which has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 747, carried over 17,000 solar cells on its wings and began its circumnavigation in March 2015. It covered the 17-stage, 42,000-km journey in 505 hours.
