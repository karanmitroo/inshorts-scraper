Dating app Tinder has filed a complaint against 'Shinder', a dating app created by a British man in which he is the only male available to date. The man, Shed Simove, was blocked from trademarking the app's name. Simove claims to have also received a letter from elevator company Schindler asking him to not enter the elevator or escalator market.
