Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has said that the story about Apple-l and Apple-ll Computers starting in a garage, is a bit of a myth. The garage belonged to Steve Jobs' parents. However, there were no designs created, no breadboarding, no prototyping, nor any planning of products in the garage. It only made them "feel like home".
