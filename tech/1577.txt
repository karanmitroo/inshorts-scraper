US-based startup BioLite has developed a â‚¹13,000 Bluetooth-connected fire pit that allows users to control the strength of flames via an app. The fire pit's airflow system can be regulated by the app by tuning it to 'Low' for a mellow fire and 'High' for stronger flames. The startup also claims the fire pit improves combustion, making it smokeless.
