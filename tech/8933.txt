Germany-based company Brita has designed a smart water pitcher that can automatically order new filters for itself. The pitcher senses when a given filter has purified all the water it was meant to, after about 40 gallons, and orders a new one for $5.99 from Amazon using WiFi. The pitcher can be bought on Amazon for $45.
