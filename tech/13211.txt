Google confirmed issues with its popular Google Talk after many people reported problems of messages being sent to unintended recipients. "At this time Google Talk is not functioning correctly and we are continuously working to restore full functionality," conceded Google. Whether the issue is limited to the older Talk or is also impacting the newer Hangouts remained unclear.
