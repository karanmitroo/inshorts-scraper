WhatsApp has introduced a video streaming feature which will let users watch videos shared on the messaging app while they are being downloaded. The feature is currently available for Android beta users. Earlier, users could view a video only after it was completely downloaded. WhatsApp is also testing a Snapchat Stories-like feature.
