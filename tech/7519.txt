Microsoft is adding a wheelchair option for its Xbox game avatars through its upcoming update. The wheelchair option will be available for both female and male characters. However, it's not clear when the avatars will get the update. Earlier this year, toy maker Lego unveiled its first set including a mini-figure in a wheelchair.
