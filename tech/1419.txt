US-based media company CNN has received a waiver from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allowing its drones to fly over people. This reportedly is the first time the FAA has granted a waiver for unlimited flights over people. The device that was approved, a Snap drone, is designed to break apart in the event of a crash.
