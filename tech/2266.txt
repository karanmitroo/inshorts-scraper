Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange has offered a job to the Google employee James Damore, who was fired after writing an internal memo criticising the company's diversity policies. Assange took to Twitter to condemn Google for firing Damore, calling it an act of "censorship." He also linked a WikiLeaks article to the tweet called "Google Is Not What It Seems."
