Researchers from Japan have built a prototype electric fork that generates a salty taste by stimulating the tongue with electricity. When the user inserts the fork into the mouth with food while pressing a button on the handle, a gentle electric current is applied to the tongue. The handle of the fork has a rechargeable battery and electric circuit.
