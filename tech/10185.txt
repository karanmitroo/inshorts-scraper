Facebook has announced that it would launch an initiative called '2G Tuesdays' for its employees that would intentionally reduce their net speed to 2G to simulate the conditions of users who use Facebook on 2G connection. This optional feature available for Facebook's employees on Tuesdays would reportedly help them to develop technologies to enhance user experience on slow internet connections.
