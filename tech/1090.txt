Germany's telecommunications regulator has banned the sale of children's smartwatches, citing privacy concerns. The agency also urged parents whose children have the smartwatches to destroy them. Adding that by using the watches, parents can "secretly" listen to a child's environment, the agency said the devices are to be regarded as unauthorised transmitting systems.
