The battery-operated headphones of a woman has exploded on a flight from Beijing to Melbourne, causing her face and hair to burn. "I grabbed my face which caused headphones to go around my neck but they kept burning...They were sparking and had small amounts of fire," the woman said. The headphones stopped burning after being kept in a water-filled bucket.
