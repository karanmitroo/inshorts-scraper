The UK Parliament was hit by a cyber attack on Friday leaving MPs unable to access their emails remotely. "We are continuing to investigate this incident and take further measures to secure the computer network," officials said. The attack comes just days after reports that hackers had put passwords belonging to senior ministers and ambassadors up for sale online.
