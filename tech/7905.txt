US-based startup X Lab has developed 'Spendwallet', a $99 smart wallet that digitally holds up to 20 cards of a user into one device. To make payments, a user needs to tap the smart wallet on the card reader installed at the stores. The rechargeable wallet claims to last for a month in a single charge.
