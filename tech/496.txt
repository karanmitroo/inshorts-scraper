Open-source software operating systems Linux's Founder Linus Torvalds has slammed Intel's security patches for recently found bugs, calling them "complete and utter garbage". Adding that Intel wasn't taking the issue seriously, he said, "It's not that it's a nasty hack. It's much worse than that." He added that he didn't want to "see these garbage patches just mindlessly sent around".
