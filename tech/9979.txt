Microsoft's new Christmas commercial, released on Tuesday, features employees of rival company Apple. The ad shows Microsoft employees, along with a children’s youth choir, walk from the new Microsoft store to the Apple store on 5th Avenue, New York. As the group sings ‘Let there be peace on earth,’ Apple employees come out and both the groups share a hug.
