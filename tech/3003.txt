A group of college students from Washington who don't live with their families posted an advertisement on classifieds website Craigslist looking for a "generic father" to attend a Father's Day barbecue. The listing says the fake fathers will be required to "talk about dad things like lawnmowers" while drinking beer. Further, they must have 10 years of grilling experience.
