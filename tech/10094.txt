Construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), set to be the worldâ€™s largest telescope, began in the South American nation of Chile on Wednesday. According to scientists, the GMT would generate images 10 times sharper than those produced by the Hubble Space Telescope. The $500 million telescope is slated to be built by 2021 and commence operations in 2025.
