A recycling centre, Clean Bay Area, is looking for a woman who unknowingly dropped off a rare, first-generation Apple computer that fetched $200,000 at an auction. The computer was reportedly hand-assembled by Apple's Co-founders Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne in 1976. "We really couldn't believe our eyes. We thought it was fake," Clean Bay Area's VP Gichun said.
