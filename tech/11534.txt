The "Big Bang" Large Hadron Collider at Switzerland's particle research centre CERN was restarted on Sunday after being shut down two years for a refit. Scientists will start colliding particles in their search for dark matter from June 2015 at nearly twice the energy achieved in the first run in 2010-13 when the elusive Higgs Boson particle was first observed.
