Billionaire Elon Musk met with Hawthorne Mayor Alex Vargas this week to discuss the tunnel being dug by The Boring Company to help commuters avoid traffic. The two toured the Los Angeles facility, on which work began in May this year. Musk recently revealed that he had 'verbal approval' to build a Hyperloop tunnel connecting New York to Washington DC.
