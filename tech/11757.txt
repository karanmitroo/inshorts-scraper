In a move to provide internet access to those who don't have it, Facebook is set to launch the mobile application - internet.org, in collaboration with Reliance Communications. The application will exclusively be for RCom users, which will provide them basic internet services in categories such as health, education, communication, jobs and local information free of cost.
