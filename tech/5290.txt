BMW and Chinese technology major Baidu have called off their partnership to develop self-driving cars. "We have now found that the development pace and ideas of the two companies are a little different," said BMW's China CEO Olaf Kastner. Baidu had been using BMW 3 sedans for on-road tests in China, but will use Ford's Lincoln for its US testing.
