A robot killed a worker at a Volkswagen production plant in Germany after picking him up and crushing him against a metal plate, the company said on Wednesday. The unnamed 22-year-old victim was part of a team that was setting up the stationary robot that grabbed and configured auto parts. Volkswagen believes the malfunction occurred due to human error.
