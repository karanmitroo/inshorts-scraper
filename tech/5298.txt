USA's Honeywell Aerospace has modified a plane which enables it to be operated with a neuro-transmitting elastic cap, worn over the head by the pilot. The pilot wears the cap, which houses 32 electrodes, and manoeuvres the plane by focusing on the direction symbols on a screen. The brain's electrical activity is transmitted to the plane's control system.
