Swiss pharmaceutical company, Novartis, is reportedly planning to test the prototype of its “smart” contact lens on humans in 2016. The company had tied with Google to develop the lens which will restore the eye’s natural autofocus. The lens is meant for patients of presbyopic and age-related far-sightedness who cannot read without glasses.
