Apple's iPhone X users have reported that the device's touchscreen does not turn on for several seconds during an incoming call, which prevents them from answering or seeing who is calling. Apple has acknowledged the issue and said it was "looking into these reports". Earlier, iPhone X users also reported activation issues in their smartphones.
