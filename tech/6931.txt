A team of scientists at MIT have developed a new glass technology which is capable of changing shades faster and covering a broader spectrum of opacity than the present photochromic substances. The new material could be used to reduce glare, produce e-ink-style displays, and cut down on energy costs by going opaque for cooling purposes.
