A Twitter user testing Apple's upcoming operating system for iOS 11 has noticed that pressing the volume buttons will no longer cover the iPhone or iPad screen when videos are playing. Instead, the new volume indicator will appear discreetly on the top-right corner of the screen. Apple's iOS 11 is expected to be released to the public in autumn.
