Samsung has filed a patent for technology that projects a virtual user interface of a smartwatch display onto the wearer’s hand. The laser interface would project touch-sensitive “buttons” onto the hand, forearm or length of the arm for users to interact with larger, less-cumbersome screens. According to the patent, the feature isn’t limited to smartwatches and can also be used for VR/AR headsets.
