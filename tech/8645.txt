Google has announced that it is rebranding its Chromecast app to Google Cast app this week. The app allows video and audio streaming from Android devices to not just Googleâ€™s own thumb-sized Chromecast dongle, but also other third-party devices. The name change has occurred to better reflect this recent expansion of the platform, which also supports TVs, displays and speakers.
