Following the footsteps of MIT, Harvard and Stanford, the seven old IITs, in partnership with Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and NASSCOM are launching a bunch of free, online courses that could potentially help 100,000-150,000 people a year get high-quality education and make them job-ready. Students participating in these courses, offered using the model MOOC, will also get certificates after successful completion.
