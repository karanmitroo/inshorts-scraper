A group of researchers from India and New Zealand will investigate the possibilities of health impacts of electromagnetic radiation caused by the 5G networks. The project aims to develop new techniques to assess 5G wireless signals and their electromagnetic exposure to humans. The findings will be compared against the existing thresholds that have been set by several regulatory bodies.
