Japanese automaker Nissan has unveiled slippers, tables, and floor cushions that park themselves using autonomous driving technology. Piloted at the ProPILOT Park Ryokan Hotel in Japan, the technology makes the objects automatically return to their designated spots at the push of a button. The technology is being demonstrated to entertain guests and reduce staff workload, Nissan said.
