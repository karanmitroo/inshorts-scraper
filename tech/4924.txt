Business networking platform LinkedIn's training site Lynda has notified users of a database breach that includes the passwords of around 55,000 accounts. The website is resetting the login passwords even though it claimed all the passwords were "cryptographically salted and hashed" to prevent access. Nearly 117 million LinkedIn accounts were compromised after a similar password hack in 2012.
