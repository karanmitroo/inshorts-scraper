United States' first electricity generator, that generates power using the rise and fall of the waves, has begun operations in Hawaii's Kaneohe Bay. Dubbed the Lifesaver, the donut-shaped floating device has cables that rise and fall with waves, turning the wheels of its generators. By some estimates, if fully harnessed, wave energy could meet around 25% of US' power requirement.
