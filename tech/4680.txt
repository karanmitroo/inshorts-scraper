Mercedes' self-driving E-Class cars, which are expected to compete with Tesla's Autopilot system, have been granted a test license for autonomous driving in the US. The Drive Pilot technology by Mercedes will maintain the car's speed and keep it within its lane. It will request a driver response every 10 seconds, depending on current road conditions.
