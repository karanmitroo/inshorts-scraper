Internet giant Google has entered a key partnership with the Election Commission (EC) of India to help it manage online voter registration and facilitation services, ahead of the 2014 polls. Google will offer EC its resources to enable voters to locate their polling station using Google Maps. Notably, Google will not charge the EC for these services.
