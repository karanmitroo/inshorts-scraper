British luxury phone maker Vertu, which reportedly had debts of around ₹1,150 crore, is being wound up with the loss of 200 jobs. Vertu was founded in 1998 as the premium arm of mobile giant Nokia. After being spun-off in 2012, it changed ownership twice before being acquired by Turkish businessman Hakan Uzan for about ₹400 crore in March 2017.
