US-based startup Tanvas has created a prototype system that lets users feel fabrics and textures like cotton, corduroy, wood and grass through a touchscreen. The system uses statics to alter the friction that users' fingers feel as they move them across the touchscreen. Applications of the system include online shopping, more immersive video games or help the visually impaired.
