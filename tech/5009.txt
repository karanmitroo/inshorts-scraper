US President-elect Donald Trump has criticised Lockheed Martin's F-35 program on Monday, saying the cost was "out of control", following which the aerospace company's market value dropped over $3 billion. Earlier, Trump had disapproved of Boeing's Air Force One program over increasing costs. He has promised to save billions of dollars on military purchases after taking office.
