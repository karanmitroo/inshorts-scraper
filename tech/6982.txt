Taiwanese company Innerexile has made a $24 screen guard for Apple iPhone that is able to heal its scratches within a second. The 0.2 mm-thick screen guard uses microcapsules filled with a glue-like liquid that automatically fills the gaps created by a scratch. The company also makes similar cases for MacBooks.
