Google has developed a new camera, dubbed the "Art Camera", which is a custom-built, robotic camera capable of capturing gigapixel images quickly. The project, which was unveiled by the Google Cultural Institute, lets web users view artworks down to individual brush strokes. To achieve this, the camera, steered by a robotic system, took thousands of high-resolution close-ups of several artworks.
