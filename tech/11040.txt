A France-based startup Spinali Design has invented a first ever smart bikini that will help owners avoid sunburns. The swimsuit features a small detachable UV sensor that monitors the temperature and sends a message to the user’s smartphone when it senses they may be in danger. Priced at €149, the bikini will be made according to the buyer’s specifications.
