David Drummond, the Senior VP of corporate development at Google's parent company Alphabet, has left Uber's board of directors amid growing competition between the two companies over self-driving cars and other areas. He reportedly didn't attend recent board meetings due to the conflicts. He joined Uber's board in 2013 when Google Ventures invested $258 million in Uber, its largest investment.
