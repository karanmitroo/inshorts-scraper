Xiaomi has made the latest version of its operating system, MIUI 7, available in India for seven devices including Mi 4, Mi Pad, and Redmi Note. The update gives users personalisation options like Daily Lockscreens and System UIs. It also has the Showtime feature which plays a saved video of a caller, instead of the tradition name and number.
