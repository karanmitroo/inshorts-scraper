Ride-hailing service Uber on Tuesday announced the launch of a new feature called 'Trip Experiences' that connects the riders with their favorite applications at the start of a trip. With this, third party applications would be able to provide customized notifications, content, or ads to its users based on the location and the length of their trips.
