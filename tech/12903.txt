SkyDrive, the cloud storage platform accessible on a range of Microsoft devices including Xbox One, will be renamed as 'OneDrive'. The change follows a dispute with British telecommunication group BSkyB, which claimed Microsoft was infringing on its copyright and took its complaint to the European Union. A UK court ruled in favour of BSkyB, forcing Microsoft to rebrand its service.
