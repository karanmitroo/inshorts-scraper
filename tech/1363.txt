In a first, UK-based scientists have developed an affordable method to 3D print a flexible energy-storing wristband. The printing method stacks silicone, glue and gel electrolyte layer by layer to make a supercapacitor, which stores energy on its surface without chemical reactions as in a battery. The wristbands could be used in the future to power smartphones, said researchers.
