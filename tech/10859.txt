Google on Wednesday unveiled a new feature called "Purchases on Google," which allows users to buy items directly from mobile search advertisements. The users would get information on product ratings and availability at nearby stores of the advertised products that come up in search results, Google said. The feature uses saved payment credentials from the user's Google account for transactions.
