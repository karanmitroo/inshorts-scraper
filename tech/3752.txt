Canadian technology company BlackBerry has made an Android app for its devices that blacks out a smartphone's screen except for a small area to prevent other people from peeping. The viewing area on the Privacy Shade app can be moved or resized to view specific chats or apps only. Users can also change the transparency of the darkened screens.
