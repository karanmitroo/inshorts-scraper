Google on Monday announced 'Project Bloks', a hardware platform that will help educators build physical programming experiences to help kids learn to code. It consists of a 'Brain Board' that acts as the central processor and communicates with 'Base Boards' and 'Pucks'. Pucks are simple instructions that are passed on to the Base Board featuring haptic motors for real-time feedback.
