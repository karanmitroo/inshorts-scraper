In a great improvement in the distance that electric power can travel wirelessly, researchers have succeeded in developing a device that can charge 40 smartphones simultaneously, even if the power source is 5 meters away. The 3-meter-long "Dipole Coil Resonant System" is significantly smaller than "Coupled Magnetic Resonance System", which was developed in 2007 and can transfer energy upto 2.1m.
