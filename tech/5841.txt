Banker-turned-author Chetan Bhagat, whose book 'One Indian Girl', released recently, has said that Twitter is going to suffer and will close down like Orkut and Myspace in five years. Claiming that the platform has become a graveyard of bullies, Bhagat added, "Trolls have made Twitter negative to a point where celebrities have stopped talking much on the platform."
