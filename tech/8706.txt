Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Friday said that the microblogging site will stick to its 140-character limit, ending speculation that the company might abandon its trademark feature for a 10,000-character limit. "It's staying. It's a good constraint for us," Dorsey said. Twitter last year had dropped the 140-character limit from direct messages and allowed messages of up to 10,000 characters.
