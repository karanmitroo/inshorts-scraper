UK-based IntelligentX Brewing Company claims to be the first company to use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform to improve its beer recipes. The AI, being used as a Facebook Messenger bot, asks drinkers questions about the beer, their tastes and preferences. The answers to those questions are then used to find trends that could help improve the final product.
