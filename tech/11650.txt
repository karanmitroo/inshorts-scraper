As per reports, Apple is planning to release its new iPhones, featuring Force Touch-equipped displays, by the end of 2015.  The new models would be available in pink as well, along with its traditional silver, gold, and space gray colours. However, the new devices will not differ too dramatically from the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
