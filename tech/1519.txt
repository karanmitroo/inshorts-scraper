A Samsung Grand Duos 2013 model phone exploded in an Indonesian man's shirt pocket, earlier this week. The man, Yulianto, was seen falling onto the ground trying to rip his shirt off after the phone exploded. In response to the incident, Samsung said the battery on the used device was not manufactured by Samsung or a company authorised by Samsung.
