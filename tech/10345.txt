A 3D printed ice shelter, named Mars Ice House, has won NASAâ€™s 3D Printed Habitat Challenge Design Competition. Designed by Team Space Exploration Architecture and Clouds Architecture Office, the entry garnered a cash prize of $25,000. Assuming Mars has liquid water and low temperature, the design imagines how life could be sustained on the Red Planet in the future.
