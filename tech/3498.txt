Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin has said that the humanoid robot 'F.E.D.O.R.' which is being trained to shoot guns with both hands, is not a "Terminator". The robot has already been taught how to use keys, extinguish a fire, drive a car, and use a saw and a welding machine. F.E.D.O.R. will reportedly go aboard a spacecraft in 2021.
