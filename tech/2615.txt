Amazon has patented an underwater warehouse to store packages which will float to the surface at the time of delivery. The facilities will be located at the bottom of lakes, and packages will be fitted with balloons that inflate when triggered by acoustic signals. The packages will then be collected by trucks or drones to be taken to their destination.
