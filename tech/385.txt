Space exploration startup SpaceX has launched a used Falcon 9 rocket loaded with a geo-communications satellite GovSat-1 commissioned by the Luxembourg government. The satellite will support humanitarian and military operations for Luxembourg, among other communications functions. SpaceX said it won't attempt to recover the first stage of the rocket, which previously flew on a mission in May 2017.
