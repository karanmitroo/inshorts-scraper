A video showing a 10-year-old boy unlocking his mother's iPhone X bypassing Face ID has been posted on YouTube. The boy's mother claimed that her son was able to unlock her phone in the first attempt. However, he was not able to unlock the phone after she registered her face again under a different lighting.
