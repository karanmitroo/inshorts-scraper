According to security firm Palo Alto, Apple’s Mac computers have been attacked by the ransomware malware for the first time. Ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and then asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to retrieve it. The malware typically targets Microsoft’s Windows OS and begets hackers estimated ransoms of hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
