Amazon, which launched on July 16 1995, pays its employees upto $5,000 to quit their jobs under the 'Pay to Quit' program. Starting from $2,000, the 'Please Don’t Take This Offer' increases by $1,000 annually till it reaches $5,000. "An employee staying somewhere they don’t want to be isn’t healthy for the employee or the company,” explained CEO Jeff Bezos.
