Yahoo acquired photo-sharing website Flickr, and its parent company Ludicorp Research & Development, on March 20, 2005. Launched in February 2004, the Canada-based stand-alone websiteÂ allows users to upload photos from computers and phones, put together photo albums and post photos to blogs, among other things. At the time of acquisition, Flickr's seven employees moved to Yahoo.
