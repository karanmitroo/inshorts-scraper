Social media platform Facebook has issued an apology after taking down a photograph of a firefighter with severe burns on his face, twice. Facebook said that the picture had been "accidentally" removed by a member of its team. The photo of former Swedish firefighter Lasse Gustavson was posted to celebrate his 60th birthday.
