A US startup has developed a $129 smart mug 'Ember', which lets users adjust its temperature. While Ember's temperature can be controlled manually or through an app, its contents remain at the set temperature for two hours on the go or all day with its charging coaster. It features a stainless steel inner vessel and til-lit display on the outside.
