Intex Technologies said Monday that it had become the first local handset maker to begin selling Octacore smartphone in India. Octacore means eight processing cores built in together, which allows users to run multiple applications simultaneously without the phone coming to stand still or heating up. Intex plans to launch the 6-inch dual-SIM smartphone in Jan-2014 for around Rs.20,000.
