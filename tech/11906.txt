According to leaked screenshots, it has been revealed that Whatsapp will soon introduce a voice calling feature. This is a move to give stiff competition to Skype and other messaging firms. The move is expected to open up major new markets for the firm Facebook bought for $19 billion. The feature will work exactly like text or picture messages.
