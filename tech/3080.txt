Venture capitalist and Facebook board member Marc Andreessen has said the idea of automation stealing jobs is a "fallacy" that people panic about every 25-50 years. "People get all amped up about 'machines are going to take all the jobs' and it never happens," he said. Andreessen cited rise of automobile industry as an example of technology creating more jobs.
