Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Alibaba Founder Jack Ma restated that part of the 'secret sauce' of the company's success is that they have "so many women colleagues." The 53-year-old said, "women sacrifice more - they love it... they continue to do it." He added that at Alibaba, women care for others much more than men.
