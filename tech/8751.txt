The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has launched an Android mobile app that allows consumers to complain against the quality of packaged food and the food served in ready-to-eat outlets. Consumers can check their food against the appâ€™s safety parameters and report any food-related mishaps along with pictures. It also informs consumers about India's food safety laws.
