India will have no 2G internet subscribers left by June 2019, according to a report by research firm CyberMedia Research. With the availability of 4G cellular in smartphones, 4G is fast becoming the default internet access, the report said. The outcome was attributed to the cost of 4G chipsets and a competitive reduction in mobile data rates by service providers.
