Twitter on Wednesday launched a new official gaming dedicated account @TwitterGaming. The account posted a tweet the same day featuring an animated GIF of the famous Space Invaders 'Press Start' screen with the caption "Let's tweet". Notably, Twitter had previously launched its own gaming dedicated division and hired former YouTube executive Rodrigo Velloso as the director of gaming.
