NASA engineers recently raced their drones controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) against a professional human pilot. The AI drones, integrated with Google's Tango technology, consistently clocked 13.9 seconds while the human pilot averaged 11.1 seconds for a twisting obstacle course. AI drones could assist search and rescue operations at disaster sites and aid robots in navigation, said NASA.
