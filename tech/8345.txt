A US-based startup Pavlok has launched 'Shock Clock', a $79 band that uses electric shock to wake up users on the set time. Controlled through an app, the band vibrates, beeps and later zaps the user on not waking up at the set alarm time. The band also lets users enable their friends with an option to zap them awake.
