Google parent Alphabet has reportedly cancelled its deal under 'Project Wing' with coffee company Starbucks to make deliveries using drones. According to reports, the deal was dropped over disagreements about access to customer data provided to Alphabet by Starbucks. Earlier this year, Alphabet finalised a deal with American fast food chain Chipotle to deliver burritos using the unmanned vehicles.
