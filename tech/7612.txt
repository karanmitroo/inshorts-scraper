A YouTuber named Sufficiently Advanced has built an X-Men inspired flame throwing helmet and named it 'Cyclops Visor'. It is a welding helmet with a fuel tank, a pump, nozzles and pilot lights. On activating a switch on the side of the helmet, it shoots a jet of flames mixed with fuel to a distance of around ten feet.
