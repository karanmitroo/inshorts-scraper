Irish agri-tech startup Cainthus has rolled out a plan to produce a predictive imaging system that can identify cows from their facial features and hide patterns. The artificial intelligence (AI) system will use face recognition to track the behaviour, eating patterns, and overall health of livestock. It will then send instant alerts to farmers, helping them take on-farm decisions.
