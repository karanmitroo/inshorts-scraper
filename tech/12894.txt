Aimed to promote science, PM Manmohan Singh on Monday said - “To do science, someone must pay for it. We must increase our annual expenditure on science and technology to at-least 2% of GDP. This has to come from both government and industry.” The PM stated the above in his inaugural address at the 101st Indian Science Congress in Jammu.
