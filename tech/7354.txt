Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Sunday responded to the accusations of Google failing to pay taxes in Europe. Pichai said that Google has "invested heavily" in Europe and employed over 14,000 people of the continent. He further said that it is a challenge for a multinational company to come to terms with different laws and regulations in each country.
