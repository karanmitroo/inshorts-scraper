DataGravity, the first company to launch a data-aware storage platform last year, has announced version 2.0 of its storage appliance. The update focuses on data security, particularly knowing what files you have and who has been accessing them. It enables administrators to subscribe to alerts, so they can implicitly be proactive about the activity going on inside their storage appliance.
