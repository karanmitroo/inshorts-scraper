An artificial intelligence system known as 'Lengpudashi' beat a team of engineers, computer scientists, and investors in a Chinese poker competition this week to win over ₹1.8 crore. Lengpudashi, which means 'cold poker master', was created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. "People think that bluffing is very human... it turns out that’s not true," said one of Lengpudashi's creators.
