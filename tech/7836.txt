A 25-year-old man named Stan Larkin survived on a 'SynCardia' temporary total artificial heart for 555 days until a successful heart transplant earlier this month. His real heart was removed after being diagnosed with a condition that causes heart failure without warning. To keep the artificial heart going, Larkin carried a 6-kg wearable power supply in a backpack.
