Whirlpool's division W Labs has developed 'Vessi', a beer brewer for home priced at $1,800, which claims to brew beer within seven days. It consists of a single tank that ferments and carbonates the beer and lets users add flavours and additives. Further, the brewed beer can be filled into bottles or cans on a temperature selected by the user.
