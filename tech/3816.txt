Facezam, an app that would let users upload photos of strangers and search for their Facebook profiles, has been revealed to be a hoax by a marketing agency called Zacozo. The developers of the app admitted to the hoax after Facebook reached out to them to ensure Facezam wasn't using its user data illegally.
