China and US-based researchers have developed "atomristors", the thinnest data storage device with dense memory capacity. The team developed a 1.5-nanometre-thick memory cell using graphene (2D form of carbon) and semiconducting atomic sheets. Memory storage and transistors have been separate components on a microchip, but atomristors combine both functions on a single system, said researchers.
