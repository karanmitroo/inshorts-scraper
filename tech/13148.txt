Two years after its US launch, Google has finally brought its Chromebooks (laptops running on Google's Chrome OS) to India. The HP Chromebook 14, priced at Rs.26,990, features a 14-inch screen, 2GB RAM, 16GB internal-memory and 100GB cloud-storage. Majority of apps in Chrome OS are web-apps and it doesn't support a lot of windows applications like Photoshop, MS-Office and 3D-games.
