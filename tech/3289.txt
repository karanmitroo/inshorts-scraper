iPhone graphics chip supplier Imagination Technologies has announced plans to sell off two of its businesses amid a patent dispute with Apple. The chipmaker's stock plunged by 70% in a single day in April after announcing that Apple will stop using its intellectual property in new products. Imagination claims Apple cannot build its own chips without infringing on its patents.
