US Presidential election candidate Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka has launched a line of handbags for women that charges mobile phones and tablets. The collection ranges from small clutches to large totes priced between $95-$295. "Wearable tech makes so much sense for our customer - she's got a full life and plays many roles," said Ivanka.
