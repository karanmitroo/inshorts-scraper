Social media giant Facebook has started testing a 'Greetings' feature for users to send a wink, high-five, hug and a wave. The feature, which is an extended version of the 'Poke' feature, is available under the 'Hello' button on a user's profile. The feature also has an undo button in case a greeting is sent accidentally.
