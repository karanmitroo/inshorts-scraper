Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt revealed that he resisted the idea of building the Chrome browser and OS for six years, before being persuaded by Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. "But there is no question I am hugely supportive of Chrome and Chrome OS. They are game-changers," said Schmidt. Notably, Chrome browser was first launched on September 2, 2008.
