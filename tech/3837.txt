Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer will get a $23 million payout when the search engine is successfully sold to buyer Verizon in a $4.48 billion deal. That payout will be a mixture of cash, equity and benefits. Mayer, however, will step down from the Yahoo board and the remaining Yahoo business after sell-off of core internet business will be called 'Altaba'.
