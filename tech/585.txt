Google's former Security Engineer Cory Altheide has claimed the company stopped employees from pro-diversity discussions. In a memo written in 2016, Altheide said senior executives halted discussions in an internal thread, stating "Google is not a debate club." Altheide added he chose to leave Google after he was questioned over posting pro-diversity comments in another thread.
