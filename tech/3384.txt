Two of the world's biggest tech companies, Google and Facebook, fell victim to a 48-year-old man's $100 million phishing scam between 2013 and 2015. The man had posed as an Asian contractor to trick executives from Facebook and Google to cheat the companies. Both Google and Facebook admitted to the phishing scam and said the sum was successfully recovered.
