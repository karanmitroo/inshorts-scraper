Reacting to the change in Twitter's 140-character limit, a user tweeted, "Twitter will survive. Game of Thrones has been working without character limits for years, and people still love it." Another tweet read, "Twitter, finally you've realized how hard it is when you've got so much to say but you've only given us 140 characters".
