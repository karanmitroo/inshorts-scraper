Microsoft has apologized for its artificial intelligence-powered chatbot Tay’s “wildly inappropriate” tweets. The company said, “[W]e’ll... bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent”. Earlier, Microsoft had taken Tay offline within 24 hours of its launch after it started tweeting offensive and racist statements reportedly due to “a coordinated attack”.
