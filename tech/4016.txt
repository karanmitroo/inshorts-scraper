Google-owned robotics firm Boston Dynamics has released a video of its two-wheeled, four-legged hybrid robot named Handle. The 6.5-foot robot is capable of skating along on two wheels at 14 km-per-hour, lifting 45 kg, and jumping up to four-feet. The video shows the robot leaping over tables, navigating stairs, pulling off 360-degree turns, and managing to handle uneven terrain.
