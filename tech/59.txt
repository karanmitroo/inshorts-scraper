Apple has been granted a patent for a hinged screen functioning in place of a keyboard. The patent describes two devices, one of which has two screens, connected by a hinge, while the other describes a second keyboard-screen as an accessory for a device. It also describes polarisers for minimising reflections from the two screens onto each other.
