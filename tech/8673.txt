Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Jodhpur has developed a sensor capable of detecting radiation levels during a nuclear accident. The sensor, 'Derald Nuclear', can be fitted on a drone and can detect gamma radiation from a height of 50 m. "This perhaps is the only equipment that can detect radiation from radioactive substances this way", said a DRDO official.
