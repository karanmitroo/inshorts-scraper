Microsoft Co-founder Paul Allen on Wednesday unveiled the world's largest aircraft with a  385-foot wingspan, capable of launching rockets. Allen took six years to build the aircraft called 'Stratolaunch', which can carry up to 250 tonnes of cargo. The plane will work as an airborne rocket launcher, giving rockets a head start by carrying them up into the sky.
