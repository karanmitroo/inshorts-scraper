US-based firm One20 has come up with a social network-based mobile platform exclusively for truck drivers. The application features truck-safe navigation, truck-safe parking locations, and a rating and review system besides recommending places of interest to drivers. The app, which comes for free in both iOS and Android, is also available bundled with a Samsung Galaxy E tablet.
