Researchers from York University in Toronto have developed a device that can help detect the deadly E. coli bacteria in water in a few hours, instead of the few days taken by standard procedures. The results of the water test, estimated to cost around â‚¹155 per test, can also be broadcasted using a mobile app developed by the team.
