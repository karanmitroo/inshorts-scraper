A new face-recognition software is being tested at the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, to speed flyers through immigration faster amid tighter security after terrorist attacks. The new Vision-Box software checks passport pictures with faces from all 28 EU nations. Further, the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam is also testing a 'biometric boarding' project that uses face-recognition technology.
