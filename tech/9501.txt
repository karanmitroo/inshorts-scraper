The founders of social networking website 'Friends Reunited' have announced that they will soon shut down the platform. Calling it "sad", they attributed the closure of the website to its declined popularity and 'handful' active users. The UK-based social network was launched on July 1, 2000. Earlier, other social networks like Orkut, Friendster and MySpace went through the same fate.
