Alliance for Affordable Internet -a coalition of many government bodies, NGOs and private players- has been set up aimed at reducing cost of internet access worldwide. Backed by WWW Foundation and Google as one of the sponsors, it will help prices to fall below 5% of monthly income worldwide, which is currently 30.1% of average monthly income in developing countries.
