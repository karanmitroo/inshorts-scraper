Google's new US campus, the first built by Google from the scratch, will allow people inside the building without any approval and let them access retail stores and cafeterias made for Google employees. Scheduled to be completed in 2019, the 18-acre campus includes a two-storey building with glass walls and a canopy-like roof of solar panel tiles.
