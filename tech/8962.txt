Skype will shut down its in-app video messaging service Qik, that lets users share up to 42 seconds of videos with friends, by March 24. Skype said that it has already integrated all of Qik’s best features like filters and video messaging. Notably, Qik was acquired by Skype in 2011 and then its functionality was built into the Microsoft platform in 2014.
