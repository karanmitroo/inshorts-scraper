YouTuber JerryRigEverything uploaded a video earlier this week testing the iPhone 8's durability. Apart from testing if the phone was bend-proof, he subjected the iPhone 8 to a scratch test on the display, camera, and the back glass. He also used a lighter on the display which blackened out the pixels for a while but recovered after cooling down.
