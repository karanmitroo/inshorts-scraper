Dubai has started testing the world's first self-driving pods that can travel individually and can also couple together to behave like a bus. The pods, designed to travel short and medium distances at 20 kmph, can be coupled in 15 seconds and detached in 5 seconds. Each pod can carry 10 riders and last for 3 hours on single charge.
