Microblogging site Twitter has increased the display name character limit to 50 from the previous limit of 20 characters. "Add that middle name or even a few more emojis," Twitter said. This comes after Twitter increased the character limit from 140 to 280 for tweets in all languages except Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages.
