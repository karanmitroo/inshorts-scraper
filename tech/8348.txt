Google-backed American startup Magic Leap has released a video showcasing its head-mounted augmented reality technology. The video, which was shot directly through its headset, features a wearer opening up several notifications in a floating graphic in his room. Notably, the startup had raised over $1 billion in funding without giving a public demo of its technology.
