Telecom Major Bharti Airtel and Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei on Friday announced they have successfully conducted India's first-ever 5G trial, achieving a data speed of over 3 GB per second. This comes days after state-run BSNL signed a pact with Japan's NTT AT and their Indian partner Virgo Corps to create a "5G test-bed".
