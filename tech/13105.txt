The popular search engine, Google, has made a mistake once again. While searching for Dahyabhai Patel, son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, correct information is shown but the image that appears is of a same name person who is a peon in a School. Google also goofed earlier when it used yellow colour instead of saffron in its Independence Day doodle.
