The government has drafted a New Encryption Policy that proposes all encrypted messages (on SMS, Email, Whatsapp, Viber) must be stored for 90 days and should be made available to Law Enforcement Agencies as and when demanded, in plain text format. The proposed policy would apply to everyone including government departments, citizens, academic institutions and for all kind of communications.
