Apple has lost a trademark suit against Beijing's Xintong Tiandi Technology, which sells leather goods like handbags and phone cases with the brand name “IPHONE”. Xintong Tiandi registered the “IPHONE” trademark in 2007, about five years after Apple registered it. However, Apple reportedly failed to prove that it had high visibility in China before Xintong Tiandi entered the market.
