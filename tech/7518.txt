Microsoft on Tuesday launched 'Skype Meetings', a new free real-time audio and video conferencing tool specifically designed for small businesses, in the United States. For the initial two months, a maximum of 10 people will be allowed to join a meeting, through a personalised URL, which will drop to three later. It also allows PowerPoint collaboration and screen sharing.
