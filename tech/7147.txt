Researchers at Japan's National Institute for Materials Science have developed an organic/metal hybrid polymer display that can be cut without damaging it. The flexible screen currently has monochrome display and a limited display area. The screen can take any shape and needs a few seconds of power to adjust to new shape while maintaining its last information.
