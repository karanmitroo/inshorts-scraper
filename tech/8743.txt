Sony on Wednesday launched a new PlayStation Video app for the Android platform that allows its console owners to stream TV shows and movies previously purchased or rented from the PlayStation Store. The release also allows in-app purchases of new movies and episodes, making this the first time its users can watch PlayStation Store purchases on non-Sony devices.
