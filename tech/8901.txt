Instagram has banned users from putting 'add me' links to messaging apps Telegram and Snapchat in their profile bios. Such deep links allow users to quickly follow profiles on other social networks. The company said, “This was… not the way our platform was intended to be used”. Notably, users can still put links to other social networks in their profiles.
