Social media giant Facebook has changed its stance on banning a Pulitzer Prize-winning Vietnam war photograph depicting a naked 9-year-old fleeing napalm bombs. FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg was slammed for abusing his power to delete the picture. "Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance, we have decided to reinstate the image," Facebook said in a statement.
