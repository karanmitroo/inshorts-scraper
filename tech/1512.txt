According to cybersecurity account 'SwiftOnSecurity' on Twitter, a fake Chrome extension 'AdBlock Plus' passed through Google's verification with nearly 37,000 downloads on Chrome Web Store. SwiftOnSecurity said the fake extension was made by a "fraudulent developer who clones popular name and spams keywords." Google has now taken down the extension which was listed with the official Adblock Plus.
