NASA’s Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) instrument, to be launched on January 29, will measure the moisture lodged in Earth’s soils with exact accuracy and resolution. SMAP consists of three main parts – a radar, radiometer and the largest rotating mesh antenna ever deployed in space. This will be the fifth NASA Earth science mission launched within the last 12 months.
