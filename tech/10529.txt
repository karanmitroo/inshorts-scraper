NASA has begun the “intensive downlinking” phase with the New horizons spacecraft, wherein it will collect “tens” of gigabytes of data from the recorder on-board. New Horizons had flown by Pluto in July and had collected “the best datasets, the highest-resolution images and spectra, [and] the most important atmospheric datasets”, that will take about a year to be fully recovered.
