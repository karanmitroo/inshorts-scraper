Music streaming service SoundCloud on Wednesday launched its radio feature, Stations, that allows users to create customized radio stations based on preferred artists and songs. To create a new radio station, users have to search for a term, track or content stream, and then tap the 'Start Station' option. The feature is live on both Android and iOS.
