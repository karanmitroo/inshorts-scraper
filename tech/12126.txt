Marking a landmark in history, a  robotic spacecraft landed on a comet for the first time ever, on Wednesday. Rosetta and its lander Philae had travelled more than 6 million kilometers to catch up with the comet orbiting the sun at speeds of 135,000km/h. The European Space Agency got the information when Philae called home at about 1600 GMT (21:30).
