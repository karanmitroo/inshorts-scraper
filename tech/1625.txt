Researchers at a university in Zurich have developed an edible temperature sensor that can monitor food. The sensor's electrical filament, which is made of magnesium, silicon dioxide, and nitride, can be crumbled or folded and weighs about a fraction of a milligram. The sensor is 16 micrometers thick, making it thinner than a human hair.
