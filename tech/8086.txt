US-based Stanford University students have built a drone that can grip itself to rough surfaces, vertical walls and ceilings. The drone has micro-spines that use opposed-grip strategy to keep itself perched to the surface. After leaving the surface, the drone regains its usual flying pattern. Students claim that it can be used for earthquake rescue and environment monitoring in forests.
