Facebook has been sued in the US for negligence and wrongful death by the family of the man whose murder was streamed on the platform. The man's family has alleged that before committing murder, the murderer posted a video announcing his intent to kill and Facebook should have alerted the police immediately. The victim was killed in April last year.
