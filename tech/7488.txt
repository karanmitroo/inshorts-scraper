Harvard University researchers have used 200,000 genetically-engineered rat cells to develop a robot that looks like a stingray. The team used silicone for the robot's body and also to insulate its skleton, which was made of gold wire. The cells were designed to contract when exposed to a specific wavelength of light, helping the robot to mimic a stingray's movement.
