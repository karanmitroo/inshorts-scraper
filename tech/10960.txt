An unmanned SpaceX's rocket, Falcon 9, exploded and broke up on Sunday just minutes after its launch. “Something went wrong with the launch,” NASA said on Twitter, adding that "the vehicle has broken up. @SpaceX is putting together their anomaly team.”  This is the third failure of a space station resupply mission in eight months.
