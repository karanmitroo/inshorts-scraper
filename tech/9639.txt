California-based mobility startup Faraday Future on Monday unveiled an electric concept car claimed to be equipped with 1,000-horsepower engine. The one-seater concept car, named FFZERO1, can reach a top speed of 321 kmph and can go from zero to 100 kmph in less than three seconds. The real car would be seen "in a couple of years", the company said.
