Team collaboration application Slack on Thursday launched 'User Groups' that lets paid users send messages to a select group within an organisation regardless of the channels they are in. Slack also claims to have increased its user base to 1.7 million daily active users and 470,000 paid users from 1.1 million daily active users and 300,000 paid users in June.
