Arul Kumar, a 21-year-old engineering graduate in electronics and communications from Hindustan Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, has netted a $12,500 (Rs.8,25,000) bounty from Facebook after he found a critical bug that allowed anyone to delete any photo hosted on the website. Around a month ago, he discovered another bug for which he is yet to receive a sum of $1500.
