A US-based startup has developed a high resolution digital microscope named 'Nurugo Micro' with 400x magnification, which fixes to a smartphone with a clip. Controlled through an Android or iOS app, it does not require any power or charging and uses a smartphone's camera for magnification. Priced at $49, the microscope is 0.5 centimetre thick and weighs 3.89 grams.
