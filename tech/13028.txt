In the  latest update to Android(4.4.2), Google has removed an experimental privacy feature from it, that allowed users to block apps from collecting their personal information. It is  speculated that Android users, who do not wish to upgrade to Android 4.4.2, could be vulnerable to security risks. The company claims to have included the privacy feature accidentally, in  Android 4.3.
