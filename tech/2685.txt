According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is testing a feature to let users unlock iPhones with their face which will eventually replace the fingerprint sensor. The facial sensor can reportedly unlock iPhones within a "few hundred milliseconds", even if the device is laying flat on a table. However, the facial sensor might not be used in the upcoming iPhone variant.
