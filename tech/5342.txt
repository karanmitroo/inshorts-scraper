A YouTube video shows how to use the newly-launched video calling feature on WhatsApp. The feature, which has started rolling out to Android, iPhone, and Windows phones, can be accessed from the call icon on the top-right corner of a chat. Users can then choose to make either a voice or a video call to contacts with the updated app.
