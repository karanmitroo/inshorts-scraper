Instagram has released multiple account-switching feature for a limited number of iOS users after releasing the same feature for a few Android users. However, the users were reportedly not notified that they had the new feature. This feature will allow users to switch between accounts without having to log out. This reportedly could be a part of a slow roll-out.
