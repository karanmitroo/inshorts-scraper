The Ford Motor Company Monday unveiled an all-new GT supercar at the 2015 Detroit Auto Show. The supercar has a mid-mounted engine, rear-wheel-drive configuration, and a sleek, aerodynamic coupe body. It comes with an EcoBoost V-6 engine whose twin-turbochargers will help liberate more than 600 horsepower. The car will be available for sale in the second half of 2016.
