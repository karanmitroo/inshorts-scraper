An American dentist, Seth Lookhart, was recently accused of "unlawful dental acts" as he allegedly pulled out a patient's tooth while riding a hoverboard. The recently-filed case stated that around July 2016, Lookhart performed such a dental extraction and sent the video to several people. Lookhart reportedly stated that the procedure represented a "new standard of care".
