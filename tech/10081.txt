American astronomer Andrew Douglass recorded history’s first meteor shower on November 12, 1799. He witnessed the annual Leonids meteor shower while on a ship off southern Florida. He wrote in his journal that the “whole heaven appeared as if illuminated with sky rockets, flying in an infinity of directions… they continued until put out by the light of the sun”.
