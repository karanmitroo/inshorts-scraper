Photo and video sharing platform Snapchat on Saturday rebranded itself as 'Snap'. The company also forayed into the hardware segment by launching a pair of smart glasses called 'Spectacles', that take 10-second videos. "Now that we are developing other products, like Spectacles, we need a name that goes beyond just one product," said Snapchat's Co-founder Evan Spiegel.
