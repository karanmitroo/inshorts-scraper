A US-based couple has been arrested in Utah for using a drone to spy on their neighbours and peep into their bathrooms and bedrooms. The couple was charged with voyeurism by electronic equipment. The drone was turned over to police by a man who spotted it flying outside his window and followed it until it landed in a nearby park.
