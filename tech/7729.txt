US-based firm Space Data Corporation has filed a lawsuit against Google accusing the company of infringing two of its patents for Project Loon. Loon is a balloon-based project aimed at providing internet access to remote and rural areas. As per the complaint filed earlier in the week, Google founders visited Space Data Corporation's headquarters in 2008 to discuss potential partnerships.
