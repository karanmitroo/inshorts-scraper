A security robot posted at an office building in Washington, DC drowned itself by entering a fountain inside the office campus. Initial reports suggested that the robot apparently took a wrong turn. The robot, a Knightscope K5, is a fully self-driving robot used to monitor crimes in school, office and public buildings.
