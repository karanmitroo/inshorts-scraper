Austrian researchers have created a sock using conductive fabric to help provide lower limb amputees with a natural sense of touch through prosthetic limbs. The sock creates a pressure-sensitive grid covering the entire foot and ankle, which is connected to a ring of vibrating motors. Pressure on a certain part of the foot causes motors to vibrate at different frequencies.
