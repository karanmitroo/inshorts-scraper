According to astrobiologists at the University of East Anglia, Earth will become inhabitable somewhere between 1.75 and 3.25-billion years from now, after which Earth will be in the 'hot-zone' of Sun, with temperatures so high that the seas would evaporate leading to extinction of all life-forms. However, the researchers hope that Mars will become habitable as Earth becomes a cauldron.
