South Korean electronics maker Samsung will resume selling its latest Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in its home market from September 28. Earlier this month, the company issued a recall of the smartphone from 10 markets over reports of overheating of batteries. Analysts believe that the recall will cost Samsung up to $5 billion in revenue this year.
