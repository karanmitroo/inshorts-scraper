Former Apple engineer Ken Kocienda, who is credited with creating iPhone's software keyboard, marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by sharing a picture of two early prototypes. "I kept those devices in my desk drawer for years. When I left Apple, returning this hardware was tough, like saying goodbye to old friends," he said in a tweet.
