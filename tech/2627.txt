A picture of a woman in UK using her iMac desktop computer while on a train has recently gone viral. The commuter had set up a 21-inch iMac along with a keyboard and mouse on a folding tray. "I had to look twice, I was shocked to see such a large computer," said the Twitter user who shared the image.
