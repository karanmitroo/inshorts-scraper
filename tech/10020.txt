An app called 'Ringo' now allows Indian users to make calls within the country at a cost of 19 paise per minute. Using Ringo, users can also make calls to landline numbers or to someone who does not have the app in his/her smartphone. Claiming to make Internet-free calls, Ringo connects the caller and the recipient over a bridge call.
