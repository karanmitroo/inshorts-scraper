Technology giant Google is building a tabletop smart screen, codenamed Manhattan, for video calling and more to compete with Amazon's smart speaker Echo. The device will have a 7-inch screen and run a version of Android. It will also offer YouTube, Google Assistant, Google Photos, and act as a 'hub' for other smart home devices.
