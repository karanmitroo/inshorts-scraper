Philips has launched a motion sensor for smart lights called 'Hue', priced at $40. The Hue lights turn on when users walk in front of the sensor. The device can be paired with the Hue app, which lets users choose specific lighting scenes and adjust motion sensitivity. Philips claims the device can run for two-to-three years with two AAA batteries.
