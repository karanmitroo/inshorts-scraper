Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp on Friday went down in several countries around the world, including India and the United States. Users reported that they were unable to send or receive messages and said that the service continued to say 'Connecting'. WhatsApp Web, which uses the phone's connection, also went down along with the app.
