A group affiliating itself with hacker group Anonymous has compromised servers at Freedom Hosting II, a service for hosting websites accessible only through Tor software. Over 10,000 Tor-based websites, constituting about 20% of the 'dark web', displayed the announcement, "Hello, Freedom Hosting II, you have been hacked." The group offers to sell the compromised data back for just over $100.
