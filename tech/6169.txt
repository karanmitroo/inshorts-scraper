A new smartphone app called 'Driving Barista' has been launched in Japan that rewards drivers with a free coffee voucher if they drive for 100 kilometres without looking at their phones. The app uses a phone's inbuilt gyroscope and GPS to check if the phone has been lifted and how much distance has been covered respectively.
