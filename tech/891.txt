The Supreme Court has asked the Union of India's nodal agency to set up a meeting with Google, Yahoo and others to remove sex determination content. The agency was set up in September to redress complaints seeking removal of the same from search engines. Earlier in April, the SC had asked Internet companies to ban advertisements for sex determination tests.
