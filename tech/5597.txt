Apple has said that it's "out of the standalone display business", confirming that the company will no longer make its own external display monitors. Apple has instead designed two new monitors of 4K and 5K displays with South Korean electronics maker LG, which will be available later this year. The brightness of the displays will be adjustable through Mac.
