Xiaomi Co-founder Lei Jun during a corporate event said that the company does not make waterproof smartphones because it would cost around 20-30% more to its buyers. Jun added that waterproofing doesn't guarantee long-term safety as even a minor crack could render the waterproofing ineffective. Jun said that Xiaomi could waterproof its phones if customers are willing to pay more.
