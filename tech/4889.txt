KFC has partnered with Chinese tech major Baidu to open a smart restaurant in Beijing which recommends meals by scanning customers' faces. Smart kiosks will detect the customer's age, gender and infer their mood. The system is likely to suggest "roasted chicken wings and coke" to men in their 20s and "porridge and soybean milk" to females in their 50s.
