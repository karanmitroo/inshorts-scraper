Facebook is testing a new feature under which some users are seeing 'Suggested Topics' appear in their status update boxes. These topics include trending subjects in Hashtags like #LovingDay and #WorldBikeNakedDay. Facebook also tracks user's commenting activity to recommend the appropriate topic for their next update. However, Facebook hasn't made any announcement about the feature yet.
