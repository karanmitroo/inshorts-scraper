Microsoft on Tuesday unveiled Project Springfield, a cloud-based tool aimed to help developers find and remove bugs in their applications. The tool combines fuzz testing, an automated way of testing code by firing semi-random input, with artificial intelligence tools that ask smarter what-if questions on detecting potential security issues. Developers can now sign up for the preview.
