Marathon runner Jane Seo, who finished runner-up at the Fort Lauderdale A1A Half Marathon in New York, was caught cutting corners during the race and then doctoring tracking data to back up her false finish time. The cheating was brought to light by independent marathon investigator Derek Murphy, observing that her entry was filled in manually and lacked GPS data.
