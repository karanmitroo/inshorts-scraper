A new UK study found that 70% of kids know how to use the gadgets before they even start primary school. Also, more than 29% can play games on smartphones and tablets before they can string a sentence together. Parental encouragement is one such reason for this, as more than 42% of them end up buying electronic-devices for educational usage.
