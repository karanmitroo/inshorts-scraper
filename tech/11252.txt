A team of Yale and Harvard biologists have successfully conducted an experiment, which allows them to create a chicken embryo with dinosaur-like snouts. The study published in the journal 'Evolution' was done with the aim to understand the evolution of beak into birds around 150 million-years-ago. Scientists searched for possible shifts in gene expression that correlated with the transition.
