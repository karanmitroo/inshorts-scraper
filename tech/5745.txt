Chinese automotive manufacturing company Geely has launched a new car brand called  Lynk & Co that claims its electric compact SUV '01' is "the most connected car in the world". The 01 is said to have the first dedicated app store for cars that includes a feature through which users can give friends access to the car through digital keys.
