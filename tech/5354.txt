A chatbot to help potential US immigrants complete visa applications has been launched on Facebook Messenger. 'Visabot' generates a questionnaire for applicants, following which it provides instructions to send relevant documents to immigration officials. Available in beta, Visabot's support currently extends to B-2 visas for business and travel, and O-1 for exceptional individuals.
