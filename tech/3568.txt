Engineers have developed a new cooling technology that uses 'jumping droplets' to cool processors and power electronics. When placed beneath electronics, the droplets vaporise after absorbing the electronics' heat escaping towards cooling structures on the floor. The floor made of a hydrophobic material repels the recondensed merging droplets making them jump away to the top for recooling.
