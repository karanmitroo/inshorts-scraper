Europe-based scientists have developed the first portable bionic hand that mimics the sense of touch, which allowed a woman to "feel" with her arm after about 25 years of losing it. The prosthetic hand has sensors to detect whether an object is soft or hard. The computer-processed information is relayed to the brain via electrodes implanted in the upper arm.
