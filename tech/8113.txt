Researchers from the University of Washington have developed a battery-free wireless smart paper that senses seven gestures including touching, sliding and hand waving to perform various actions. Ultra-thin Radio Frequency Identification labels make normal paper in books, documents, paper planes and origami interactive. These labels cost about 10 cents each and can be stuck onto any paper.
