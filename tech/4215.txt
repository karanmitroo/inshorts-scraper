Two senators have questioned Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer about two data breaches disclosed in 2016, one of which was the world's biggest data breach. The senators accused Yahoo of avoiding discussion on the hacks and cancelling a congressional staff briefing at the last minute. Yahoo has also been asked of the measures taken to avoid such breaches in the future.
