After Verizon closed its acquisition of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer resigned as CEO and has written a letter to the company's staff. Mayer wrote, "Itâ€™s been my great honour...to be a part of this team for the last 5 years." She further listed several achievements of Yahoo, including its stock hitting a 17-year high, more than tripling since July 2012.
