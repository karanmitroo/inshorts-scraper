Two thousand pigeons with LED lights strapped to their legs lit up the New York skyline when released by artist Duke Riley at the Brooklyn Navy Yard as part of his 'Fly by Night' project. The project pays homage to the practice of pigeon keeping. Further, the show will be repeated every weekend evening from May 7 through June 12.
