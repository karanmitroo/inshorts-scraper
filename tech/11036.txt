At a conference held in San Diego, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) agreed on preliminary definitions for the 5G standard for mobile networking. Networks compliant with 5G will provide speeds of up to 20Gbps (Gigabits per second), 20 times faster than the 4G specification. The increase in data-speeds and bandwidth will open up access to higher resolution 4K video content.
