A 13-year-old school boy, Akshat Mittal, has offered a carpooling website as a solution to the Delhi government's odd-even rule for cars from January 1. Mittal's website, 'Odd-even.com' will offer possible carpooling matches according to the preference of users who register on the website. While the website is already functional, there are plans for launching a mobile app.
