Google has launched Photos, an image sharing app compatible with Android, iOS and desktops, which offers unlimited storage. The new service can host both images and videos and can handle individual pictures of up to 16 megapixels plus footage shot in full 1080p HD without having to resort to compression. Photos is compatible with the popular social networks like Facebook.
