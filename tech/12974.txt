Syrian Electronic Army Wednesday claimed credit for hacking into the social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter) of Internet calling service 'Skype'. "Don't use Microsoft emails (Hotmail, Outlook), they are monitoring your accounts and selling the data to the governments," the hacking group apparently posted on Skype's official Twitter feed. Notably, Skype was reportedly part of the NSA's program to monitor communications.
