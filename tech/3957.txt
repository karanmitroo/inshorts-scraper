American carmaker Ford Motor Company has begun testing 3D printing of large-scale as well as customised one-piece car parts. "Printed parts are lighter in weight than traditionally manufactured parts, and may help improve fuel efficiency," said Ford. With 3D printing technology, Ford says it can reduce the cost as well as the time taken to build the car parts.
