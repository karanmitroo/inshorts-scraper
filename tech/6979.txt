The Australian government on Tuesday set up a new team to investigate the use of online platforms for cyber crime like money laundering and terrorism financing. The unit will also identify patterns that may indicate large-scale financial scams. "Modern technologies are presenting new and evolving threats, none more so than from malicious cyber activity", said the Australian Minister for Justice.
