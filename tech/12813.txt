Chicago-based aerospace and defence contractor Boeing Co on Wednesday unveiled an Android smartphone that in addition to encrypting calls, during any attempt to open the casing deletes all data and renders the device inoperable. Boeing's tamper-proof phone is aimed at government agencies and contractors who need to keep communication and data secure.
