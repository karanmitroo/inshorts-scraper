Chip manufacturer Nvidia, in collaboration with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), has created the 'Virtual Eye' â€“ a system that creates a virtual scene by fusing footage from two cameras. It can help emergency responders or military personnel to send a pair of camera-equipped drones or robots in dangerous surroundings to execute rescue operations or spot enemies.
