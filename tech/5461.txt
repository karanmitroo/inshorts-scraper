South Korean prosecutors raided tech major Samsung's offices on Tuesday to look for evidence that it illegally provided gifts for President Park Geun-hye's confidante Choi Soon-sil. The raid was to look in the case wherein Park let Choi view confidential documents. Notably, Choi has been accused of using her relationship with the President to collect donations from contributors like Samsung.
