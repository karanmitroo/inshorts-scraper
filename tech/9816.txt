A group of Australian astronomers on Thursday identified a planet, orbiting a dwarf star 14 light years away named Wolf 1061, as the closest potentially habitable body outside the solar system. "The planet sits within the 'Goldilocks' zone where it might be possible for liquid water -- and maybe even life -- to exist", said the lead of the study.
