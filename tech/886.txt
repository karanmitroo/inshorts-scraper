Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak, along with other technologists, has written an open letter urging for the cancellation of voting on a proposal to end net neutrality and called it an "imminent threat". The US Federal Communications Commission's proposal is based on "factually inaccurate understanding of Internet technology," he added. The voting is scheduled to happen on December 14.
