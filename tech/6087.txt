Danny Meyer, the Founder of a New York-based hospitality group, has equipped all the employees across the group's restaurants with Apple Watch. Connected to a dedicated app, the watch will allow managers to keep a track on how long a table is occupied. The app will also maintain a profile of each guest's past orders and allergies.
