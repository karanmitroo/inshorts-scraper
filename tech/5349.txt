The US Army is testing a new anti-air device called the 'Phaser' designed to take down multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in a single shot. Developed by Massachusetts-based defence contractor Raytheon, the 'Phaser' has a microwave-emitting dish mounted on a diesel generator power source. It tracks targets using an external radar system and fires bursts of microwave radiation.
