Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops have failed the battery tests by consumer-advocacy organisation Consumer Reports, becoming the first MacBooks to not receive 'recommended ratings' from the group. Consumer Reports said that battery life results were highly inconsistent on each of the three new MacBook Pros. Apple has said it is working with the organisation to understand their battery tests.
