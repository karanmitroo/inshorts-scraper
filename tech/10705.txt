Micro-blogging site Twitter on Wednesday lifted its character limit on direct messages between users, saying that it would make exchanging private messages "more powerful and fun". Earlier, direct messages on the site had the same limit of 140 characters that applies to tweets. "You can now chat on (and on) in a single Direct Message," product manager Sachin Agarwal said.
