NASA has begun work to build a supersonic passenger jet claimed to be safer, quieter and more affordable. The agency has awarded its first contract, worth $20 million, to a US-based company to develop a preliminary design of an aircraft which surpasses the speed of sound. The first flight tests of the supersonic aircraft are expected to start around 2020.
