Walmart has applied for a US patent for a floating warehouse that could make deliveries via drones, which would bring products from the aircraft down to shoppers' homes. The blimp-like machine could fly up to 1,000 feet, and would be operated either autonomously or by a remote pilot. It would come with multiple launching pads for drones to deploy from.
