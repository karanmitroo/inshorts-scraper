A huge asteroid, called UW-158, can be seen passing by the Earth at about 10pm GMT on Sunday. Believed to have a 90 million tonne core of platinum, worth $5 trillion, the asteroid will be 30 times closer than the nearest planet around that time. Asteroid UW-158 is classified as 'X-type', meaning it is composed mostly of metal.
