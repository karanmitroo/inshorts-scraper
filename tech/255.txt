Campbell Brown, Facebook's Head of news partnerships at a recent interview said, "People don't come to Facebook for news. They come to Facebook for friends and family." Brown also said that publishers should feel free to leave Facebook if they feel the platform isn't working for them. "My job is not to make publishers happy," she added.
