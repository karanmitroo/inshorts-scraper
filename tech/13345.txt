LG Display has launched the world's thinnest full-HD LCD panel for smartphones which is just 2.2mm thin. LG has used the Advanced One-Glass-Solution (OGS) technology in the panel, which it says has been deployed for the first time. The move certainly signals that high-end smartphones of the future will be thinner and have bigger displays.
