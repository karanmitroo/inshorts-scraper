HP has developed a screen called 'Sure View' which can block viewing angles at the press of a keyboard shortcut, making it difficult to spy on what's being displayed. Creating a 70-degree straight-on viewing angle, the screen cuts 95% of light on both sides. The 1080p screen supports touch and will be available on HP's EliteBook 1040 and EliteBook 840.
