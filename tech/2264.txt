Ex-Google engineer James Damore on Wednesday said, "I really thought this was a problem Google had to fix," while talking about his memo that claimed conservative viewpoints are suppressed at the company. Damore, who was fired after the 10-page 'anti-diversity' note went viral, added that people "who aren't on the left feel like they need to stay in the closet".
