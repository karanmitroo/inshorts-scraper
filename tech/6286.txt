The first homepage of micro-blogging platform Twitter, which launched in 2006, only featured a green 'Twttr' logo. The homepage said, "If you have a cell and can txt, you'll never be bored again...EVER!!" The company, which relaxed its 140-character limit on Monday, adopted the current blue bird as its official logo in 2012.
