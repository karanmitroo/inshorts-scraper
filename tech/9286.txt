NASA has released a virtual reality video of its battery-powered GL-10 (or Greased Lightning) drone. The video shows the drone flying in the sky, letting users experience the flight in 360°. The drone is a 28-kilogram prototype that can switch between helicopter and airplane modes, enabling it to take off vertically like a chopper, and fly at speed like an airplane.
