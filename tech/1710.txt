US-based startup Pi claims that it has developed a device that can charge smartphones with magnetic waves. The conical charger operates on wireless charging technology that is used in Apple or Android smartphones. The device does not use a cable or a pad to charge smartphones and can charge multiple devices within about a foot's distance in any direction.
