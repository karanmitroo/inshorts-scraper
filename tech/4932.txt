The Washington Post has launched a Google Chrome extension called "RealDonaldContext" that claims to let users check the accuracy of US President-elect Donald Trump's tweets. Donald Trump has tweeted over 34,000 times and has 17.4 million followers on the platform. In June, Trump temporarily banned The Washington Post from covering his Presidential campaign's events, calling the paper "dishonest."
