Taking a leaf from Snapchat and Twitter, Instagram has launched a video channel that will let users see curated, video-only content streams around a specific event. Available via the applicationâ€™s Explore tab, the channel's first album is dedicated to immersive videos from Halloween. The feature, in which videos are reportedly handpicked by an editorial team, is live in the US.
