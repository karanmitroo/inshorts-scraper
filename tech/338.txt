South Australia is planning to use Tesla batteries to build what it claims would be the world's largest virtual power plant, for at least 50,000 homes. The project will begin with a trial of 1,100 properties, having the storage installed free of cost. The facility could provide capacity as much as a large gas turbine, Tesla said in a statement.
