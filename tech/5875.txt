Silicon Valley technology company Palantir has rejected claims made by the US Department of Labor that accused Palantir of discrimination against Asian job applicants. Palantir said that the government's analysis "hinges entirely on a flawed and illogical statistical analysis of data." The company argued that Asians are well represented in Palantir, with at least 25% of its workforce being Asian.
