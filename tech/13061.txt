Though Facebook didn't came to India for campus recruitment this year, it has offered seven PPO, 4 of them non-IIT students, with a package of $100,000. Notably, the company had rejected IIIT-H's invitation to participate in campus recruitment last year, but 3 out of the 4 non-IITians are from IIIT-H. The rest are from NIT-T, IIT-B, IIT-M, and IIT-R.
