Google's machine learning team Google Brain has developed technology to create enhanced images from photos made of 8X8 pixels. The technology uses artificial intelligence to try to approximate what the original image might be, had it been downsized to 64 pixels. Similar high-resolution images are cross referred to check for patterns, which are used to fill out the low-resolution images.
