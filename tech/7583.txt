IBM researchers have discovered a one-step recycling process to help convert old smartphones and CDs into non-toxic, high-strength plastics that can be used for water purification, fiber optics and medical equipment. The team added a fluoride reactant and heat to old CDs to create this new plastic that showed to have better temperature and chemical resistance than the original substance.
