Twitter limited the account of American ex-sheriff David A Clarke to 'read-only' mode for posting violent tweets against the media. One of the tweets included a picture of one wrestler with Clarke's picture on it while kicking another wrestler bearing the CNN logo. Clarke resigned last year to work as a vocal surrogate for President Donald Trump during the campaign.
