An incident of Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei allegedly hacking state-owned BSNL network was brought to the notice of the Parliament on Wednesday. The matter is being investigated by the government. Earlier also in 2012, a committee of US lawmakers on intelligence had levelled charges of cyber espionage against Huawei, but the company had strongly denied them.
