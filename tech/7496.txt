A motor-assisted glove called 'RobotGlove' built jointly by NASA and the General Motors, was on Wednesday licensed by a Swedish medical technology firm Bioservo Technologies. RoboGlove includes pressure sensors and artificial tendons that multiply the force and grip of the wearer. General Motors said that it will test the glove in its plants situated in the United States.
