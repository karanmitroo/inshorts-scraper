Social networking giant Facebook has rolled out a new feature for its users, called 'On This Day'. The nostalgia feature shows the users what they posted exactly a year back, like photos from exactly one year ago. The feature will reportedly be extended globally over the next few days and will be accessible on Facebook's bookmarks menu.
