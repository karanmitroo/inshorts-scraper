Apple is shutting down its iTunes Allowance service on May 25. iTunes Allowance automatically replenishes children's balance every month with a set amount, from $10 to $50. Apple has already stopped allowing new users to sign up for the feature. As an alternative, Apple suggests using Family Sharing, that gives up to six family members access to each other's purchases.
