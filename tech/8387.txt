An Indian-origin engineer-led team in the US has developed a circuit that can double the speed of Wi-Fi. The circuit is based on 'full-duplex radio integrated circuits', meaning it can simultaneously transmit and receive signals using the same frequency, thereby doubling the capacity. Until now, receivers and transmitters either worked at different times or simultaneously at different frequencies.
