Forbes Brazil has launched a print campaign against gender pay gap by publishing female versions of three of the world's richest billionaires, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft's Bill Gates, and Mexico's richest person Carlos Slim. The magazine said, if these people were named 'Marcia Zuckerberg', 'Billie Gates', and 'Carla Slim', they would earn much less than they actually earn now.
