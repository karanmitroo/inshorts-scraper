US President Donald Trump has claimed that Apple CEO Tim Cook told him the company will build "three big plants, beautiful plants" in the US. While campaigning, Trump said, "I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China." In May, Apple announced it will invest $1 billion in US manufacturing.
