Hillary Clinton on Wednesday said that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos saved The Washington Post newspaper by buying it in 2013. "I think a lot of people, a lot of his peers and friends, thought â€” why would you buy this ancient medium called a newspaper?," she said, adding that, "Newspapers like the Post still drive news."
