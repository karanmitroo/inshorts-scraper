Donald Trump has reportedly surrendered his Android smartphone ahead of his appointment as the 45th President of the United States on Friday. He will use a more secure and encrypted handset approved by the Secret Service. Trump will reportedly not be able to access the internet through the encrypted device, despite his earlier promise to continue tweeting after assuming office.
