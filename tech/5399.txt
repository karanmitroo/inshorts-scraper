A New York-based startup, EnGoPlanet has installed smart street lights in Las Vegas, which are powered by the sunlight and the pedestrians' footsteps. While the street lights have solar panels installed on them, special pads put on the sidewalks absorb the kinetic energy produced by the footsteps. The street lights also serve as Wi-Fi hotspots and device charging stations.
