NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on Sunday took to Twitter to express his concerns over demands to link Aadhaar to services, saying, "Such demands must be criminalised." He further called Aadhaar "an improper gate to service". His tweet came in response to an article by former RAW head KC Verma, who slammed the need to link Aadhaar number to various services.
