According to India Today, the government has proposed to build an application called Unified Mobile Application for New age Governance (UMANG), which would let people access e-Gov services. The mobile application would include Central and state services, and let people apply for passports and file income-tax returns. An official said, "It would be like easy on-boarding of government departments."
