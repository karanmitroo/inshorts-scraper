David Gudeman, one of two ex-Google engineers suing the company for alleged discrimination, has said the discussions at the company are dominated by a "hate group". He also said the group promoting "racism and misandry" wants to use Google for social change rather than delivering service. He further said that he does not hate Google or the people working there.
