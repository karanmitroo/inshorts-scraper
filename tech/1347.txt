South Korean electronics giant Samsung has patented another 'foldable' smartphone concept, according to drawings submitted to Korean Intellectual Property Office. The device reportedly has two displays, one of which is flexible and can be folded from one side. Samsung filed a similar patent last year, which also stated that the device would feature a secondary display, like in flip phones.
