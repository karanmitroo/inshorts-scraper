US-based fitness app Pact has agreed to pay $940,000 to settle allegations of its unfair and deceptive practices. Pact app promised users financial rewards for meeting fitness targets and charged users who fail. The Federal Trade Commission alleged that Pact charged its users monetary penalty even when the users met their targets and even after they cancelled the service.
