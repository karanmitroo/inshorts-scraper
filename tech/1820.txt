Technology giant Apple's facial recognition technology Face ID failed to recognise its software chief Craig Federighi's face during the iPhone X launch on Tuesday. "Unlocking it is as easy as looking at it and swiping up..." he said, while the device refused to unlock. The iPhone X's Face ID has replaced the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the iPhone.
