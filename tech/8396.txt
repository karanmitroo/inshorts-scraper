Edward Snowden has collaborated with French music producer Jean-Michel Jarre to create a song called ‘Exit’. Jarre describes the song as a “speedy techno track evoking the constant and hectic production of data and the obsessive quest for more information on everything and everybody.” The track will feature in Jarre’s upcoming album, and is available to stream and purchase digitally.
