British company, OwnFone, claims to have put the world's first Braille phone for sale in UK, which costs just 60 pounds. "This is the first phone to have a 3D printed keypad and for people who can't read Braille," said its inventor, Tom Sunderland. The phone has been designed for instant connection of blind users with their friends and family.
