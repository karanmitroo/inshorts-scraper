The world's first passenger drone 'Ehang 184', capable of autonomously carrying a person in the air for 23 minutes has received clearance for testing in Nevada, US. The vertical take off drone can fly at altitudes up to 3.5 km at a speed of 100 km/h once a passenger inputs the destination. It's expected to begin testing later this year.
