Microsoft-owned video call application Skype has extended its real-time translation feature to support mobile and landline calls, even if the receiver of the call doesn't have Skype. The app supports translation in nine languages, including English, French, Chinese, Italian, Arabic, and Russian. The feature, which was introduced in 2014, was limited to Skype-to-Skype calls until now.
