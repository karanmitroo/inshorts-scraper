Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have discovered that jumping water droplets can generate small amounts of electricity, which can be used to charge electronic devices, and to produce clean water. The system is based on earlier findings that droplets on a superhydrophobic surface convert surface energy to kinetic energy as they merge to form larger droplets.
