China has banned highway testing of self-driving cars until the rules governing the testing of autonomous cars go into effect. According to a new report by Bloomberg, the country's auto industry regulator is already working with police to create these rules. This comes after Germany announced that it is drafting legislation that would place "black boxes" in self-driving vehicles.
