Facebook on Thursday launched 'Facebook for nonprofits', a website for non-profit organisations and non-governmental organisations to raise awareness and funds. It helps users in setting up a Facebook page, enhance it and analyse engagement, create posts and a campaign strategy. It also features success stories of non-profit organisations that used Facebook to achieve the desired results.
