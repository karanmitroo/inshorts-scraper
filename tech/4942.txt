Apple launched its Bluetooth-connected AirPods this week after a two-month delay. Using proximity sensors, AirPods automatically start playing music when they are plugged into the users' ears and pause if a pod falls off. The earphones can be paired with any Apple device with an iCloud ID and double tapping them activates Siri on the user's iPhone or Mac.
