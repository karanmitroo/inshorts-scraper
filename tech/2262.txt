Twitter users on Tuesday responded to Google firing a software engineer who wrote a memo that asserted that gender inequality in tech jobs was because of biological differences. Some users created their own versions of Google Doodles, including one which said "Boycott Google". Another doodle replaced the 'o' in Google with the Nazi logo.
