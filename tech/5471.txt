Intel on Friday set a world record for the Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously, by setting off 500 drones in the sky for a light show. Each fitted with an LED light, the drones moved as a single fleet, operated by one person with a laptop. The drones formed the number '500' and Intel's logo in the sky.
