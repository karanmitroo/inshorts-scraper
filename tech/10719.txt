NASA's Curiosity Rover has captured an image that shows a female-like creature among the piles of rock on planet Mars. A website dedicated to the sightings of extra-terrestrial life has termed this image as a 'proof of life' on Mars. The image also shows a track in between a manhole and a small house-like tent apart from the long-haired 'woman'.
