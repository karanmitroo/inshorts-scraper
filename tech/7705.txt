Over 800 Google employees in over 20 countries celebrated 'Lady Day' by adding the word 'Lady' to their respective job titles against an Alphabet shareholder's sexist remark. The shareholder referred to Alphabet's CFO Ruth Porat as 'the Lady CFO' during a meeting. Men and women at Google adopted the 'Lady' prefix in a protest with the tagline "Actually...it's just CFO."
