British automotive technology parts supplier Delphi on Monday announced a partnership with Singapore to start a pilot program for a self-driving taxi service. The system will work similar to ride-hailing services like Uber. Delphi plans to combine the cars, inter-vehicle communications systems, transactions, cloud services and security into a complete ecosystem which it plans to launch in 2022.
