Intel partnered with Xiaomi-backed robotics startup Ninebot to unveil a new Segway that can transform into a robot. The vehicle which can reach 18kmph and can run for around 30km on a single charge would be capable of sensing its surroundings, and recognising objects and people. The developer edition of the platform would be released in the second-half of 2016.
