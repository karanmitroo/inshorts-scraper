Social media giant Facebook is testing a 'Snooze' feature to let users temporarily mute friends. The feature allows users to unfollow friends, Pages or groups for either 24 hours, a week or 30 days. Snooze can be accessed by clicking on the horizontal dots present to the right of the name of a friend or Page.
