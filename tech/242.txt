World's first robot ski competition was held in South Korea in which self-operational humanoid skiers with two legs participated wearing skis. The robots were reportedly equipped with sensors, batteries and deep learning algorithms that allowed them to move on their own. Eight teams from local universities and tech firms took part in the competition, reports said.
