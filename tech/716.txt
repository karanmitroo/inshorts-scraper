A 6 inches wide and 6 feet long piece of a solar panel has been stolen from China's recently-opened highway which is built with wireless charging systems for electric vehicles. The one-kilometre-long road contains over 10,000 photovoltaic panels that convert sunlight into electricity. It is China's first and the world's second photovoltaic highway.
