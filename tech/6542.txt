A 42-year-old fugitive charged for possessing marijuana was arrested in Florida after he changed his Facebook profile picture to a wanted poster of himself. The poster showed the man's mug shot and other details. "I wish he would take it down! The cops use Facebook now!" one of his family members had commented on the picture.
