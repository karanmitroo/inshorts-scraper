Cyber security firm FireEye has been accused of trying to sell its software to security analyst Jerry Gamblin by comparing Hurricane Matthew to cyber attacks. The email starts with, "I hope you are staying dry out there." Gamblin shared the email on Twitter captioned, "using a hurricane that killed over 1,000 people in a sales email is distasteful."
