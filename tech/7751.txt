Micro-blogging site Twitter's venture capital arm has invested $70 million in audio streaming company SoundCloud, as part of a funding round that is expected to close at $100 million. The funding will reportedly value SoundCloud at $700 million. Notably, Twitter in 2014 considered acquiring SoundCloud but later changed its mind.
