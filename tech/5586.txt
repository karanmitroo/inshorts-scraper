A 9-year-old boy was on Friday ran over and killed in Japan by a truck driver who was playing Pok√©mon Go while driving. The driver reportedly did not see the boy as he was crossing the street. The driver has been arrested and he confessed that he typically keeps the game's app open while he drives.
