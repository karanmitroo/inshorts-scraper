Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos has said that the company faces many cyber threats but runs its own security "like a college campus". He made the remark during an internal discussion with employees on the hacking threats to the network. However, Stamos later said that the words "college campus" were merely "a figure of speech".
