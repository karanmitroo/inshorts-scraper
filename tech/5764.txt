Google on Thursday opened its first pop-up store in New York City, where people can experience the company's newly-launched gadgets including Pixel phones and Daydream VR headset. It has glass cubicles designed to look like a living room and a kitchen, where Google's smart assistant 'Home' is showcased. The store is a couple of blocks away from rival Apple's store.
