A Japanese firm has created 'Mocoro', a robotic microfiber mop ball that rolls around collecting dust and pet hair. Priced at $39 on Amazon, the cleaner has a timer of 15 minutes but does not have any 'smart' sensors and wanders in any random direction. Mocoro can last for up to three hours on a single charge.
