Officials said the Pentagon had successfully tested a swarm of 103 Perdix micro-drones, one of the largest micro-drone swarms ever tested at a single instance. The micro-drone swarm, which was tested in California in October, included micro-drones measuring around six inches. The drones were launched from three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.
