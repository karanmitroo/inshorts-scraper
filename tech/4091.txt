International Space Station on Thursday successfully captured SpaceX's Dragon cargo spacecraft that was launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Sunday. Dragon is expected to be unpacked in around four weeks, after which it will be sent on a five and a half hour return mission to Earth. The original docking attempt was aborted on Wednesday after a navigational error.
