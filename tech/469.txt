Former employees of learning platform Unacademy have developed an app called 'Loco' which helps users earn money by answering questions. The platform holds two 15-minute live-streamed quiz sessions where the participant has to answer 10 questions correctly. The quiz, which is based on varied topics, is conducted each weekday and one each on weekends at 10:00 PM.
