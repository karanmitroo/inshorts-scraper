Apple has resubmitted its application for opening single-brand retail stores in India. The company had first sought permission for the same in January, but due to certain gaps in the application, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) asked it for more information. Further, Xiaomi has also reportedly submitted an application to open single-brand retail stores in the country.
