Google on Tuesday made its 26 Tbps high-speed undersea cable live in Asia linking Japan on to Taiwan. "Just how fast is 26 Tbps? Every 15 seconds, every person in Taiwan could send a selfie of themselves to â€‹a friend in Japan," said Google. The new cable will allow Google services like Gmail and YouTube to load faster in Asia.
