A company called Escape Computing has reportedly set up ATM-like kiosks in Ethiopia that load pirated movies onto users' pen drives. The machines, which have been set up in malls across the country, have a monitor with a USB port and let users browse through an archive of movies. Each feature film can be downloaded for as little as â‚¹8.
