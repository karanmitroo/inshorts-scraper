Technology company BlackBerry has launched a cloud-based software cybersecurity product called 'Jarvis' that can detect vulnerabilities in software used in connected and autonomous vehicles. The automakers will have online access to Jarvis and can scan any number of binary files at every stage of software development. Jarvis is also applicable to industries including healthcare, BlackBerry said.
