According to a new study, one in six smartphone users have been a victim of cyber-attack. Furthermore, 60% of smartphone users and almost half of tablet users are vulnerable to hacking as these devices have no protection against malicious software. The cyber-attacks range from phishing emails to session hijacking attacks where a user's Web browsing is interrupted by a hacker.
