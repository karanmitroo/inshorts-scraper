Snapchat has received up to 83% negative reviews on the App Store after a redesign in countries including Australia, Canada, and the UK. Users complained of difficulty in finding favourite features and that the app has become more confusing. Evan Spiegel, Co-founder and CEO of Snapchat, had announced redesigning the app in November 2017, to separate media and social communications.
