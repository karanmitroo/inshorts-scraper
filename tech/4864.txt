Barbie's voice-controlled smart 'Dreamhouse', which was received by many kids as a Christmas present, started showing error messages against their voice commands. Kids complained of receiving 'Error Code 18' messages while trying to play with the toy. Launched earlier this year, the house was meant to allow opening doors, controlling elevator, and lights, on user's voice commands.
