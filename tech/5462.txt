Around 20% of vacuum cleaners around the world are now robots, according to robot manufacturer iRobot's CEO Colin Angle. He added that iRobot's Roomba vacuum robot makes up about 70% of that market, with around 14 million units sold worldwide so far. Founded in 1990, the Massachusetts-based company now focusses on making robots for the home consumer space.
