Hundreds of Pokémon Go mobile game players on Friday rushed to New York's Central Park to catch a rare Pokémon, causing a stampede. Reacting to the incident, Central Park tweeted, "Dear #PokemonGO hunters: if Raichu is hiding somewhere off limits, you don’t #gottacatchemall! Pls DO NOT hop fences." Notably, Pokémon Go has crossed Twitter's daily active users in the US.
