Computer security researchers from the University of Michigan and the University of South Carolina have successfully hacked a smartphone and a fitness band through sound waves. This was made possible by controlling the gadgets' accelerometers by playing specially crafted sounds. Researchers were able to add fake steps to a Fitbit band and play a malicious music file on hacked smartphone.
