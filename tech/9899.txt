Facebook on Monday reportedly shut down Creative Labs, its two-year-old initiative that provided companies with a platform to build standalone apps. In addition, Facebook has pulled off photo-sharing app Slingshot, anonymous chat app Rooms, and collaborative video app Riff. While Slingshot and Riff are no longer on their respective app stores, Rooms will entirely shut down on December 23.
