The US Justice Department has made it mandatory for federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to procure search warrants before tracking cellphone locations. According to the policy, the data of the phones other than the one targeted has to now be removed within 30 days. This comes in the wake of the recent legalisation of NSA's phone surveillance program.
