Facebookâ€™s Connectivity Lab, the social media giant's internet technology research wing, has made a world record by transferring data wirelessly for over 13.2 kilometres at 20 Gbps. The 20 Gbps speed is enough to stream 1,000 ultra-high-definition videos simultaneously, according to Facebook. The previous record was held by German scientists who transferred data for over 37 kilometres at 6 Gbps.
