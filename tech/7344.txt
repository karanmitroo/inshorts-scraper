Yahoo founders used an exclamation mark in the brand name because 'Yahoo' had previously been used for knives, canoes and barbecue sauce. The company's logo still retains the punctuation, and in its latest revision in 2013 the exclamation mark was further tilted by nine degrees. On Monday, Yahoo posted a net loss of over $400 million for the last quarter.
