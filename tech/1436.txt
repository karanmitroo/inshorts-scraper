E-commerce major Amazon has patented a drone for delivering charge to electric vehicles while in motion. The patent describes that the autonomous drone would identify the car from a code on its roof, and then land to begin topping up the battery. The drone would also use multiple authentication processes to confirm that it is interacting with the correct vehicle.
