A Switzerland-based cybersecurity company has found that at least 28 models of HP laptops and tablets were shipped with pre-installed software that tracks everything that users type on the keyboard, including passwords. The 'keylogger' malware was hidden in audio drivers issued by HP in 2015. HP has now issued patches to delete the keylogger, claiming that it was installed mistakenly.
