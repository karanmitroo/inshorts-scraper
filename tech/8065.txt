Australian researchers have developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has performed the experiment to create a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) – 2001 Nobel Prize-winning discovery. A BEC is a state of matter of a dilute gas of photon-like particles cooled to temperatures around –273.15ºC. They found that the condensates can be created faster, under more conditions and in greater quantities.
