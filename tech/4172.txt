Samsung Group's heir Jay Y Lee was on Friday arrested on charges of bribery, perjury and embezzlement. Lee allegedly bribed South Korea's impeached President Park Geun-hye $38 million for political favours. It may take about 18 months for a trial and verdict. The decision of his arrest was taken amid the risk that he might destroy evidence or flee.
