Technology giant Google's name originated from misspelling of the word "googol" which is a mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. The name reflects Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin's mission to organise infinite amount of information on the web. Google is celebrating its 19th anniversary since its incorporation on September 4, 1998.
