NASA has released a dozen new images of its Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars that are clicked by the rover itself. It took those selfies using its seven-feet-long robotic arm. Shot on August 5, the images were stitched together to form a self-portrait of the rover atop the Red Planet’s ‘Buckskin’ rock formation.
