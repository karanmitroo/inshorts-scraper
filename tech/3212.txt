Thai government threatened to shut down access to Facebook in the country unless it removed 131 "illicit" pages by 10 am on Tuesday, including a video of the King wearing a crop top. The footage was reportedly filmed in Germany last year and was widely shared on social media. Facebook is still accessible in Thailand despite the deadline having passed.
