American financial services corporation Mastercard has created a credit card with a built-in fingerprint scanner, allowing its users to make payments by scanning their fingerprint instead of providing a PIN or a signature. The card is no thicker than a normal credit card. It works with all existing chip-and-PIN readers and is currently being trialled in South Africa.
