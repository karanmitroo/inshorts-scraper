The United States recently witnessed its first ever successful ship-to-shore drone delivery. A drone successfully delivered medical supplies to the New Jersey coastline straight from the deck of a ship. The delivery was made to test whether drones could be used to carry medical supplies to humans in areas which cannot be accessed during storms, earthquakes or other disasters.
