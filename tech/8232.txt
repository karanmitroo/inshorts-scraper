A federal judge signed a warrant ordering a woman, Paytsar Bkhchadzhyan, to unlock her fingerprint-locked phone, as reported by The Los Angeles Times. She was convicted for identity theft and was taken into custody. Referring to the case, a US-based law professor said that compelling a person in custody to perform such action breached the 5th Amendment's protection against self-incrimination.
