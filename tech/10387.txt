Australian woman Lucy Kelly made a “telepresence robot” to buy an iPhone 6S on Friday. The remotely-controlled robot had reached Apple's store at 5am on Thursday to secure the fourth spot in line. It had an iPad—featuring Kelly’s face—attached to a pole on wheels. “It is a cool demonstration of what the future of technology will be,” Kelly said.
