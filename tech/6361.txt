New York is suspending the web-browsing capabilities of its sidewalk kiosks after complaints of people using them to watch porn. Over the past eight months, 400 such kiosks have been installed in the city under the 'LinkNYC' program. The kiosks will still provide free domestic calls, phone charging and WiFi for the usersâ€™ own devices.
