Google parent Alphabet on Thursday revealed its fourth-quarter earnings at $26 billion, up 22% from a year earlier. The earnings missed analysts' expectations, mostly due to a one-time tax payment that pushed the tax rate to 22% from a 5% rate a year earlier. Alphabet shares fell 2.2% in extended trading since the company reported its fourth-quarter results.
