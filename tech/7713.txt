US-based researchers have developed a set of open-source web programming language extensions, called GreenWeb, that allows people to save battery power while browsing on mobile devices. The team integrated GreenWeb into Google Chrome and reported energy savings of 30% to 66% over Android's default mode. The GreenWeb framework also assists developers in turning their web pages energy-friendly.
