Scientists have claimed that a major part of the 1,000 existing galaxies have “metamorphosed” since their inception. Through NASA’s Hubble telescope and European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, they have come to show that the number of stars in a disc-shaped galaxy has decreased from 83% to 49% through the years. The remaining stars are reportedly located in oval-shaped galaxies.
