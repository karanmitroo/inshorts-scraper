Three US-based students have made a website 'Museum of Endangered Sounds', that showcases sounds from old technologies and electronics equipment. It contains sounds from Remington typewriters, VCRs, cassettes, Nokia ringtone, Tetris brick game and dial-up connections to Microsoft Windows 95 startup tones. Launched in 2012, the website currently has 33 sounds of gadgets that are no longer in use.
