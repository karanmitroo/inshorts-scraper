Germany has test launched surveillance cameras with biometric face recognition capability at one of Berlin's railway stations. The test aims to determine whether the cameras can automatically recognise faces of specific persons and single them out from a crowd. Officials said that potential threats could be exposed and averted ahead of planned attacks through the use of this technology.
