New Audi cars in the US will come with a system which will provide drivers with the countdown of when a traffic light turns green from red. The traffic light information system will communicate with the city's municipal traffic signals to gather the required data. The system will be available on select 2017 Audi Q7, A4 and A4 allroad models.
