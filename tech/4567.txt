Stolen prototypes of the world's first three-screen laptops by Razer recently surfaced for sale on Alibaba-owned e-commerce website Taobao for nearly ₹15 lakh. However, the listing for the laptops, which were stolen from CES 2017, was removed from the Chinese website after being noticed. Razer had offered ₹18 lakh for information leading to the recovery of its Project Valerie prototypes.
