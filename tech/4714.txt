Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday revealed that while getting interviewed for Google on April Fool's Day in 2004, he believed Gmail, which had been announced that day, was a joke. "People kept asking me what I thought of Gmail...but I couldn't answer it well," he said. Pichai recalled that he was treated to ice cream during the interview.
