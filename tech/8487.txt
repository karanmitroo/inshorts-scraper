Facebook on Friday started allowing verified pages to share branded content on its platform. Verified pages are usually owned by big brands, publishers and celebrities. They can also tag the sponsor in a branded content post. Facebook describes branded content as any post, with text, Instant Articles, 360° videos and Live Videos, that specifically features a third-party product or brand.
