Facebook on Thursday launched the Photo Magic face recognition feature to its standalone Messenger app, ahead of the holiday season. Photo Magic scans through a userâ€™s photo library and via face recognition, automatically recommends images that can be sent to friends. Facebook has also added the ability to customize Messenger conversations by adding specific colours, emojis and nicknames to them.
