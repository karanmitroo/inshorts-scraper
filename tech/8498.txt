SurveyMonkey has launched a mobile app insight platform called SurveyMonkey Intelligence. It tracks information like active weekly and monthly users, user engagement, leaderboards based on various metrics, audience demographics, and download and revenue numbers. The platform runs on a freemium model, with users receiving up to 14 days of data, along with limited metrics, at the basic level.
