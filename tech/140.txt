Researchers have developed a 3D-printed clip-on device that is capable of enabling microscopic visualisation of samples ranging from plant to mammalian cells. The device uses the internal flash or sunlight as the illumination source to visualise the cells. The team anticipates that the microscope can be used to test water cleanliness, detect disease and to analyse blood samples for parasites.
