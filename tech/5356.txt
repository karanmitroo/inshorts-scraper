Search engine Yahoo has revealed that it has been sued 23 times for a data breach that affected at least 500 million accounts in 2014. Yahoo had confirmed the hack in September this year and asked the affected users to change their passwords. It also claimed that a "state-sponsored actor" had access to the company's network during the hack.
