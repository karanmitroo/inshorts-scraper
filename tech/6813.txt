Over 30 technology and communication firms, including Apple, Google, AT&T and Verizon, on Friday said they are joining the US government to restrict pre-recorded, automated phone calls called 'robocalls'. The 'Robocall Strike Force' hopes to use Caller ID verification standards and will report to the government with "plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions".
