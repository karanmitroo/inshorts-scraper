Isro scientists, on Monday, successfully test-fired the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft's liquid engine for four seconds before the final firing to get into Mars' orbit on Wednesday. On September 24 it will be put in action along with eight thrusters to slow down Mangalyaan so it can be injected into a safe orbit around the Red Planet.
