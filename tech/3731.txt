Four jail inmates of Haryana's Bhondsi Jail have entered the Limca Book of Records for making an app called 'Phoenix'. Installed at 11 Haryana prisons, the app helps in managing prison canteens and case history of prisoners. To make the app, prisoners were for the first time, sent to other jails within the state for “work purposes.”
