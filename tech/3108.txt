Stanford researchers have found that fitness trackers don't accurately measure the number of calories burned. Comparing breathing measurements, the study on 60 volunteers wearing seven brands of trackers revealed the most accurate device was off by 27% while the least accurate was off by 93%. However, the measured heart rate was within 5% error when compared with electrocardiograph data.
