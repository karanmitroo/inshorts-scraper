Samsung may release its own Google Glass-like device called Gear Glass as early as September, according to a new report from Korea. Gear Glass is likely to run on the Tizen OS, an open-source software that Samsung has played a large role in developing. Earlier in Oct, Russian blogger Eldar Murtazin had predicted its launch in April or May.
