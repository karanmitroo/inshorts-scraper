Auto major BMW exhibited a motorcycle helmet at the CES 2016 with a glass-like heads-up-display, that can show information like speed limits, directions, and incoming phone calls in a userâ€™s field of view. The helmet, currently in the prototype stage, can also display road safety updates and maps. The company is planning to launch the product within a few years.
