Scientists at CERN have produced quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter thought to have existed right at the birth of the universe, with fewer particles than previously thought possible. The material was discovered by colliding protons with lead nuclei at high energy inside the supercollider's Compact Muon Solenoid detector. Physicists have dubbed the resulting plasma the "littlest liquid."
