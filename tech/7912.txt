Amsterdam-based entrepreneur Marc Kohlbrugge has made an online scoreboard 'Highscore.money', which lets users pay to get their name included. The more the users pay, the higher they get on the scoreboard. "People spend a lot of money on nonsense just to impress the people around them," said Kohlbrugge. The entrepreneur claims to have made $770 from the scoreboard so far.
