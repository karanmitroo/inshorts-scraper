China-based startup Luckey has created a smart glass panel called 'Nums' that attaches on top of a MacBook's multi-touch trackpad, adding an overlay for a number pad. It can also be configured to launch users' preferred apps and websites with a swipe. Nums creators claim the panel will not interfere with the trackpad's normal use.
