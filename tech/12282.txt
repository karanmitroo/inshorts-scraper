A start-up named Pavlok, owned by Indian-origin inventor Maneesh Sethi, has developed a wearable smartband which will shock its users if they fiddle with their goals. The band might shock if the user misses going to the gym, texts an ex or ignores his alarm clock. The shock can be adjusted between 17-340 volts, 'very noticeable' according to the makers.
