A new wristband named the Cicret Bracelet, has been designed to turn a user's wrist into a smartphone just on a twist of the arm. The device works through WiFi, Bluetooth and a Micro USB port, and projects an Android interface onto the userâ€™s arm, which can be used to send emails, answer calls play games and browse the web.
