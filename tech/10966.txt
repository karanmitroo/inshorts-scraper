June 30, 2015 will officially be one second longer than usual days because a "leap" second will be added, NASA has explained. "The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down a bit, so leap seconds are a way to account for that", a NASA scientist said. The extra second will be added to June 30 at 11:59:59 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
