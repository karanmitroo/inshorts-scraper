Apple in a recent statement said the reports claiming that it allowed its suppliers to reduce the accuracy of iPhone X's Face ID to speed up production are "completely false". Acknowledging the delay in iPhone X production, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said, "We'll see what happens". The iPhone X is set to launch officially on November 3.
