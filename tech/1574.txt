Google and Facebook displayed fake news on their platforms by misidentifying the man who killed over 50 people in Las Vegas mass shooting on Sunday. On being searched for 'Geary Danley' Google displayed links from the website 4chan which wrongly identified Danley as the shooter. Facebook's 'Trending Topic' page also directed users to links of Russian propaganda site.
