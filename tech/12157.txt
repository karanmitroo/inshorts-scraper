Road Transport and Highways Minister, Nitin Gadkari, has said that electronic toll collection (ETC) systems will be installed in at least one lane of 350 toll plazas across national highways by Dec-end. Given the average waiting time of 10 minutes at toll plazas, there is scope to save Rs 7,000 crore through fuel savings, Gadkari added.
