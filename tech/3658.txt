A Canadian startup has created the 'Uvolt Watch' which has a removable 600 mAh battery pack to charge smartphones. The face of the â‚¹13,000 watch is a solar panel that recharges the power bank's batteries. Additionally, each link of the watch strap contains a miniature power bank that can together fully recharge the main battery once it has been drained.
