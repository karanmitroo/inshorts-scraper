Hunter Walk, ex-Product Management Director at Google, has revealed it was Google's decision to remove YouTube as a default built-in app from iPhones in iOS 6. Walk said YouTube wanted to "take back control of our app" as Apple had made the inbuilt app itself. From 2012 onwards, iPhone users have been required to download the app from the store.
