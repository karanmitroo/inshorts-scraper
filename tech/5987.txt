Replacement units of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone have reportedly caused injuries to users due to overheating in two separate instances, after a similar incident occurred earlier this week on an airline flight. A 13-year-old in the US felt a burning sensation while holding her Note 7, while another mobile set caused acute bronchitis to a user due to smoke.
