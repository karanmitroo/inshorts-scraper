A nine-minute YouTube video shows late Apple CEO Steve Jobs introducing the first ever iPod, 15 years ago on October 23, 2001. The device was capable of carrying "1,000 songs in your pocket" because of its ultra-thin hard drive. iPod's battery could last 10 hours of continuous music, with the gadget being lighter than most cell phones of the time.
