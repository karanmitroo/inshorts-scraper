Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was trolled on Monday after he shared a set of pictures showing him driving a tractor and feeding a calf at a US farm. "Zuckerberg needs to stop acting like he's normal. Everyone knows he's rich," tweeted a user. Another user tweeted, "Zuckerberg is now 15 photos away before he is announced as a 2020 candidate".
