Researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, at Olfactor Labs, California has developed the world's first lightweight patch called "KiteTM Mosquito Patch" - a cheap sticker that can make people 'invisible' to mosquitoes. Kite, which is small enough to be worn virtually without notice, protects the user for 48-hours by impairing mosquitoes' carbon-dioxide detection machinery, their primary method of tracking human blood meals.
