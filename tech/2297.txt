Google's VP of Diversity, Integrity and Governance Danielle Brown has responded to the 10-page anti-diversity memo reportedly written by one of its employees. She said that the document was not a viewpoint that the company endorsed or promoted. However, Brown also added that Google fosters "a culture in which those with alternative views... feel safe sharing their opinions."
