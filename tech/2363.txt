A US judge has ruled that politicians cannot block people on social media as it violates their right to freedom of speech. A lawyer had earlier argued that politicians' Facebook pages don't represent the government as the country's resources aren't used to maintain them. Earlier this year, seven people sued US President Donald Trump for blocking them on Twitter.
