Search giant Google was incorporated 19 years ago on 4th September, 1998 by Co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google's homepage has maintained its minimalistic look since its incorporation as its founders did not have adequate knowledge of HTML. Notably, Google's homepage has been changed at least seven times over the years.
