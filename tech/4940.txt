Instagram said that it has fixed a bug that reportedly increased the reach of posts that were geo-tagged in "Singapore, Singapore" even if the users were not at the location. The hack is said to have existed since November 30 and was reportedly used by popular Instagrammers King Bach and Dan Bilzerian to increase engagement on their posts.
