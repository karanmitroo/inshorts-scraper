French grocer Monoprix has released a video mocking Amazon's 'Go' stores which will detect items picked and charge customers through an app without having to wait in lines. Monoprix's ad is a recreation of Amazon's and depicts its 10-year-old service that lets users walk out after choosing what they want and then delivers it to their house within an hour.
