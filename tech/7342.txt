Snapchat announced on Tuesday that users can now send their Bitmoji to each other in chats or snaps. Users can link their Bitmoji accounts in Snapchat, with their avatars appearing ready to use. If a user doesn't have Bitmoji, an account can be created directly within the app. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips last March for a reported sum of $100 million.
