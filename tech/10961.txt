Apple has reportedly removed four civil war-themed games from its App store that featured Confederate flags, as general displeasure grew when photos of the 21-year-old racially-driven Charleston Church shooter with the flag were found online. Retailers like Walmart and Sears Holdings have also stopped selling the flag and other Confederacy symbols, as have Google, Amazon and eBay.
