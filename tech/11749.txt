Japan's largest bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is employing ‘Nao’, a multilingual 5.4-kg robot to deal with customers in branches. The robot is programmed to speak 19 languages and analyse facial expressions. The 1ft 11 inches tall humanoid developed by the French company Aldebaran Robotics will begin work on a trial basis at one or two branches.
