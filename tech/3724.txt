A US court has ruled that former Philadelphia police officer Francis Rawls will remain jailed indefinitely unless he agrees to unlock two encrypted hard drives, which are believed to contain images depicting child sexual abuse. Rawls, who has been in jail since 2015, has cited the fifth amendment for not unlocking the drives, which protects him from self-incrimination.
