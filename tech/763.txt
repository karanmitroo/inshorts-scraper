A high-altitude balloon, launched by Google under "Project Loon" to provide internet in remote parts of the earth, has crashed in Kenya. The balloon, a part of a 10-balloon batch, was deployed for testing in various Kenyan towns earlier this year. "The device from project loon indicates it fell after its expiry period of six months," a police official said.
