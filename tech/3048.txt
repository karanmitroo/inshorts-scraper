E-commerce major Amazon has been granted a patent for shipping labels with inbuilt parachutes that can be used to drop packages being delivered via drones. The patent details how the label could also incorporate shock absorbers and a network of sensors to track the package's descent. Amazon completed its first drone delivery without a human pilot in December 2016.
