MIT researchers have created a device, called 'EQ-Radio', that can detect a person's emotions using only wireless radio signals. The device first transmits a signal and then analyses the signals reflected off the person's body to detect the emotions, with around 87% accuracy. As per an MIT professor, the device could be applied across entertainment, consumer advertising and healthcare industries.
