The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) launched the Disaster Ready Assam (DRA) app on the ASDMA website and Google Play Store on Friday. The app will make a userâ€™s location traceable with a location tracking system, so ASDMA can alert the concerned authorities for necessary action. The app has inbuilt features which can disseminate safety information on various hazards.
