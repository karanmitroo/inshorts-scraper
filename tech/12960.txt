Sony has unveiled its waterproof smartphone- the Xperia Z1s that will cost $528 and hit stores on January-22. According to Sony, the Z1s can be submerged up to 4.5 feet deep into water for 30 minutes. Unlike Xperia Z's inability to snap shots underwater because of touchscreen controls, the Z1s has a physical button that can trigger underwater shots.
