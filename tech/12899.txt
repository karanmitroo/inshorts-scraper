Samsung Electronics Co is all set to unveil its Galaxy S5 smartphone on February 24 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (Spain). The S5 is widely expected to feature biometric functions such as iris recognition or a fingerprint scanner. The launch has been brought forward by around three weeks as S4 sales were weaker than expected, analysts said.
