Alaska-based companies Native Kikiktagruk Inupiat Corp and Vertical Harvest Hydroponics are using soil-free techniques to grow vegetables in an attempt to solve food shortage issues in Arctic communities.  Their indoor gardens grow vegetables like kale and lettuce in nutrient solutions inside insulated shipping containers filled with LED lights, without warm climate or soil requirements.
