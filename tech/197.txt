Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma has claimed the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) asked the company to delay its UPI launch so that Google could launch its payments app. Google launched 'Tez' in September last year. "The problem is about an Indian company being treated like a third world country by... the law," Sharma added.
