As part of its RockSat-X program, NASA launched science experiments of seven college students into space for 15 minutes on Tuesday. The program gives students an opportunity to design experiments for space flight. This yearâ€™s experiments include a 3D printer designed to operate in space. The small Terrier-Improved Malemute rocket took off from NASA's Wallops Island Flight Facility.
