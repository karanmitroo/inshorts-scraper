For effective redressal of grievances posted on Twitter, the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to launch 'Twitter Seva' service with the help of Twitter India. Once launched, all tweets related to the ministry will be made available in aggregated form to a designated officer. Notably, ministries of external affairs, railways, and commerce are already using this software.
