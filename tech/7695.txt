In a first for the company, Blue Origin will live-stream its reusable New Shepard suborbital vehicle's next launch on Sunday. The live-stream will be available on the company website starting at 7:15 pm IST. Founder Jeff Bezos had previously announced that the vehicle will land with an intentionally failed parachute to demonstrate the company's ability to handle a failed scenario.
