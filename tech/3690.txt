A security researcher has accused Microsoft of allowing anyone to search for users' sensitive files on its document sharing site 'Docs.com'. The researcher claimed users didn't realise that documents like password lists and credit card statements were published publicly by default. Microsoft pulled the search feature from its website later, but the files were still cached in Google search results.
