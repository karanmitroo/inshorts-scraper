Facebook on Wednesday clarified that the widely shared privacy notice claiming to protect users' data on its platform is actually a hoax. The company issued a fact-check statement that said, "Donâ€™t believe it. Our terms say clearly: You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook." The hoax had also surfaced earlier in 2012, 2014 and 2015.
