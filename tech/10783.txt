In its quest for aliens, NASA has sent to outer space a series of Earth sounds including music from different eras, and greetings in 55 languages, including Hindi, Marathi and Bengali. The Hindi recording says, “Prithvi ke wasiyon ke aur se namaskar,” and can be accessed on SoundCloud. This is in addition to the sounds that were sent in 1977.
