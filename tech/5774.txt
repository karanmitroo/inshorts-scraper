In response to a question about the safety of Tesla's autonomous systems, CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday said, "In writing some article that's negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle, you're killing people." He added that he finds the media coverage of Autopilot crashes "quite disturbing", as they are "basically almost none" relative to manual crashes.
