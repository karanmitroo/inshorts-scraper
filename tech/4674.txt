Washington-based startup Ossia has created ceiling tiles called Cota which can wirelessly charge electronic devices within a 30-foot radius. The company makes small power receivers that can be embedded into smartphones, standard-size batteries or other devices like smoke alarms to make them compatible with the tiles. Up to four Cota tiles can be linked together to expand the charging radius.
