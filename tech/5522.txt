Microsoft on Wednesday launched 'Microsoft Teams', a chat tool for businesses. The messaging service integrates Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Skype into the platform. Microsoft Teams, which will be offered to the 85 million monthly users of Microsoft's Office 365 software suite, will rival communication app Slack which was founded in 2009 and the newly-launched Facebook Workplace service.
