Google Hangouts has added 20 new emoticon shortcuts in its latest update. The shortcuts feature emoticons like 'shrug', 'facepalm', 'dealwithit', 'tableflip' and 'facepalm'. The latest Hangouts update also features a new in-app browser option setting called 'Browse with Hangouts', but it is reportedly only available to some users.
