Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi is planning to launch a crowdfunding platform in India that will help startups working on consumer electronics to raise funds and sell their products through the medium. Xiaomi already runs a similar crowdfunding platform in its home market China. "We'll have to change certain things before we can launch in India," said Xiaomi VP Hugo Barra.
