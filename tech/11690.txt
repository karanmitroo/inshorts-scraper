YouTube is all set to release a new app for children on Feb 23, called YouTube Kids, which will run on smartphones and tablets and focus on kid-appropriate content. It will feature kid-friendly design, with big icons and minimal scrolling and feature parental controls such as a timer that can be used to limit a child's screen time.
