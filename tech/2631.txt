Wearable products startup Jawbone, which had raised nearly $1 billion, has entered into liquidation proceedings. It counts Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, JP Morgan, Mayfield and Khosla among its investors. However, Jawbone's CEO Hosain Rahman has already founded a new startup called Jawbone Health Hub with an unrelated investor to make health-related hardware and software.
