Tech giant Google has been reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency by consumer watchdog Taenk for possibly violating privacy laws by not capping the amount of time personal data is stored on Google's servers. "We have become aware of the fact that Google today has 9-10 years of data on users with a Google account," the watchdog stated.
