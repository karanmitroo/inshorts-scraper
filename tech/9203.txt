Lawyers have pledged to file a lawsuit against Apple after its latest upgrade permanently disabled repaired iPhones and showed an 'Error 53' message. Apple's latest "security feature" disables iPhones with the home button and/or touch ID fingerprint recognition that are not original. The lawyers claim this is a criminal offence that intentionally destroys the property of another.
