A 26-year-old woman drove her car into a T-Mobile store in Florida after she was denied of a free iPhone replacement. The woman had earlier demanded the store to give her a free iPhone in place of the one she owned, with a cracked screen. The crash injured a store employee and caused $30,000 worth of damage to the store.
