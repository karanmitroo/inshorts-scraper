Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on Wednesday admitted it is "totally inappropriate and a fail on our part" to allow offensive keywords as targeting criteria for advertising. In a Facebook post, Sandberg said Facebook "never intended... this functionality being used this way". Facebook is adding "more human review" to automated processes to prevent such offensive terms from appearing, she added.
