Microsoft has launched 'Color binoculars', an iOS app that promises to enable users suffering from the three most common forms of colour blindness, to see a broader spectrum of colours. The app adjusts the actual colours to replace difficult colour combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.
