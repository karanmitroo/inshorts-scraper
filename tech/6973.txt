Russian computer scientist Valery Spiridonov has built an autopilot system for wheelchairs. The device, which can be attached to any electric wheelchair, uses cameras and sensors to map surroundings, enabling users to control their chairs via voice command on a smartphone app. Victim of a degenerative muscular disease, Spiridonov has volunteered to have the world's first head transplant surgery.
