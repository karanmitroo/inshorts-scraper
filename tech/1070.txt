Austria-based physicists have claimed to successfully couple nano-resonators on silicon chips, which release photons at precisely the same frequency to create a quantum entangled state. The prototype device connected the chips using 70 meters of optical fibre over a distance of 20 cm. The advancement could help develop spy-proof quantum internet using future quantum computers, physicists said.
