During the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, US marshals raided a Chinese  startup Changzhou First International Trade's hoverboard booth on Friday and confiscated their vehicles. The booth was raided one week after Silicon Valley startup 'Future Motion' filed a patent infringement case against the Chinese startup for the single wheel balancing hoverboards.
