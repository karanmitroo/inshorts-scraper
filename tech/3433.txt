Google's Co-founder Sergey Brin is secretly building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at NASA, according to a Bloomberg report. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over multiple NASA hangars and turned them into laboratories for the company. The report says the engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the airship, which fills up almost the entire hangar.
