A nine-year-old American boy has built a mechanical prosthetic hand for a local high school teacher with the help of his brother and father. The family owns a domestic 3D printer, which they keep updating with additional parts. After working on a prototype, the boy assembled the final 3D-printed version at home, which was then delivered to the teacher.
