Considered the most tech-savy president, US President Barack Obama, uses a customized BlackBerry phone. The phone features a special security software called SecureVoice, developed by the National Security Agency. Obama's Blackberry has no games, no selfie-camera or texting function. Stripped of every built-in feature that a hacker might exploit, the phone carries top-notch encryption features.
