NASAâ€™s Hubble telescope has captured an image of a planetary nebula, called NGC 6818 or Little Gem Nebula, which shows a bright and colourful cloud of dust and gas. Located roughly 6,000 light-years away from Earth, the nebula shows two layers of gas: a spherical outer region and a brighter, vase-shaped interior bubble.
