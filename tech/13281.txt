The space station's 36-year-old 1977 probe Voyager 1 , 13 billion miles from the Earth, has become the first human made object which has finally reached the interstellar space. It left behind the solar system a year ago, thus throwing itself into the deepest corners of space, but NASA didn't have the official data to confirm its location until recently.
