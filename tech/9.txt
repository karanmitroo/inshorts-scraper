A Chinese woman has claimed that her two-year-old son locked her iPhone for nearly 48 years by repeatedly entering the wrong password. The woman took the phone to a technician who suggested performing a factory reset, but instead decided to wait for two months. A picture of the iPhone locked for 25,114,984 minutes has gone viral.
