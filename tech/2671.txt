David Kenny, Senior Vice President for IBM's supercomputer Watson, recently discussed the societal implications of artificial intelligence. Kenny said that he disagrees with the 'dystopian' view that robots will cause massive job loss or that an AI 'overlord' will control humanity. "Real disaster would be abandoning...cognitive technology before its full potential can be realised," he added.
