Hackers on Saturday night set off all 156 emergency sirens in Dallas, Texas for about 90 minutes in one of the largest breaches of a siren warning system. The sirens are used to warn citizens of emergencies. "Every time we thought we turned it off, sirens would sound again... whoever was hacking us was continuously hacking us," said an official.
