A team of engineers in the US and Hong Kong has developed a â‚¹8,300 smart watch Aircon which cools or warms the body within minutes. It contains a device in its straps which fits on the inner wrist for maximum transfer of temperature. It then sends signals to the brain through the nerves to generate pulses of heat or cold.
