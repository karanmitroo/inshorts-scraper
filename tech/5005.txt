Developer Abhishek Singh has built a robot that responds to human speech through GIFs. According to the developer, the bot named 'Peeqo' is a mash-up of "Amazon Echo and a Disney character". The robot, which is a full-fledged entertainment system, can also remind its distracted owner to focus on tasks at hand, the developer claimed.
