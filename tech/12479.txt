Facebook on Monday introduced a new feature that helps you bookmark posts and read them later. The 'save' option will not only allow bookmarking of posts and links, but also let you share your saved posts with friends. Moreover, it will remind you of 'saved' posts, periodically. It'll be rolled out on various platforms over the next few days.
