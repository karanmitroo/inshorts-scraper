The first international beauty contest judged by Artificial Intelligence has chosen 44 winners, almost all of whom are white, a few are Asian and one is dark-skinned. Beauty.AI was to judge factors including facial symmetry and wrinkles to identify the most attractive of the approximately 6,000 contestants. About 75% of the contestants were European and white, while 7% were Indians.
