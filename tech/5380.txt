Netherlands-based startup Sleep.ai has developed an 'anti-snore' wearable electronic device. Designed as a band that wraps around a wearer's arm, the device vibrates whenever its partner smartphone app detects snoring, in an effort to coax a person into turning over to their side. The device has been launched for crowdfunding on Kickstarter with a price tag of $77.
