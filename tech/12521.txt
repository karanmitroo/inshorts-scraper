Electronic giant LG on Thursday announced that it has developed an 18 inch flexible OLED panel which is roll-able. The flexible panel can be rolled up to a radius of 3 cm without affecting the function of the display. “This indicates that we can bring rollable TVs of more than 50 inches to the market in the future,” LG said.
