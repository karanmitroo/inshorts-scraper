Yahoo Mail on Thursday introduced support for Gmail under its multiple mailbox management feature, letting users access multiple mailboxes from right within Yahoo Mail. With this, Yahoo-specific features like password-free sign-in will be integrated to Gmail and all users actions like marking e-mails spam will be synced across all accounts. Yahoo has already integrated Outlook, Hotmail, and AOL.
