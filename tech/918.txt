Android Co-founder Andy Rubin has reportedly returned to his smartphone startup Essential after taking a leave of absence last month to "deal with personal matters". The leave followed a report which alleged that he had maintained a relationship with a subordinate at Google which was deemed as "improper" and "showed bad judgement". Andy Rubin had left Google in 2014.
