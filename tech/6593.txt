Google has reportedly suspended its Project Ara, an initiative to make modular smartphones with interchangeable modules for components like camera and battery. The company is said to not make the smartphone itself, but license the technology to other partners. The decision is an effort to unify Google's hardware development. Earlier this year, Google announced to launch the smartphone in 2017.
