Billionaire Elon Musk-led Tesla has finished building the world's biggest lithium-ion battery system in South Australia and is expected to test it soon. The 129 MWh Powerpack system will provide power for more than 30,000 homes, Tesla had earlier claimed. The battery itself will be charged by a wind farm and then deliver electricity during peak hours.
