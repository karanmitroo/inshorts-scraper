US financial services company MasterCard has rolled out 'Identity Check', an app that uses facial biometrics for payment authentication, in Europe. The app will be made available to MasterCard users globally in early 2017, according to a report. The app supports both selfies and fingerprint biometrics, offering users a choice of authenticating a mobile payment at the point of purchase.
