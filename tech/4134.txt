Photo-sharing mobile app Snapchat is reportedly planning to launch an Android smartphone focused on new camera features. The startup has reportedly built a smartphone prototype with a 360Â° camera and buttons that let users scroll through filters, and a one-touch capture function for easy sharing. It might also include a lock screen allowing users to access Snapchat notifications and updates.
