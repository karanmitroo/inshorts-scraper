Microblogging platform Twitter has said that it will remove verification badges from users who violate its rules. Twitter also said that it was reworking on its entire verification process which gives public figures a blue check mark next to their names. It came after Twitter faced criticism for verifying the account of the white supremacist rally organiser in Charlottesville, Virginia.
