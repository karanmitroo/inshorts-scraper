According to a cybersecurity expert, the Petya ransomware attack infected as many as 5,000 systems within 10 minutes initially. Petya is based on the same Windows exploit as WannaCry, but uses a strengthened method to spread itself. The attack, which has since spread to over three lakh computers, hit Ukrainian government systems and large corporations across India, Europe, and US.
