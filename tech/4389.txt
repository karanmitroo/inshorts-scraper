Facebook data claims that a man accused by Italian prosecutors of being one of the world's most wanted people smugglers Medhanie Yehdego Mered is actually an innocent refugee named Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. Facebook has submitted in court a file containing details of Berhe's Facebook profile, including IP addresses and access to his account to prove that he is not guilty.
