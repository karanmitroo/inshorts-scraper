European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has unveiled a self-driving electric transportation concept called 'Pop.Up' which uses drones to airlift car pods to avoid traffic. An Airbus platform allows passengers to book their rides and sends them self-driving cars. The 8.5-foot-long cars are carried through the air by a drone and dropped to the destination to avoid traffic.
