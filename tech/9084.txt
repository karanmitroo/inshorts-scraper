In a gradual roll-out, Facebook is launching its Live Video feature across the world starting with UK, Germany, Brazil and South Africa. The content sharing feature allows users to live broadcast videos on their News Feeds, and also track the number of people watching them. The feature was previously restricted to users in the US, public figures and verified pages.
