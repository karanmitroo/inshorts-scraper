Facebook on Thursday rolled out a new update for its Messenger app that will allow users to send their location directly inside the conversation. This feature will replace the previous location-sharing feature and will also let users share the location of some other particular place, Facebook said in a statement. The feature is currently available on iOS and Android devices.
