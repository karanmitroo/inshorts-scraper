LinkedIn on Tuesday launched the revamped version of its mobile app on Android and iOS, which was first previewed in October by CEO Jeff Weiner. In an attempt to de-clutter the app, the new design features five major tabs on the home screen, including private messaging that feels like texting. Its central feed is reportedly similar to Facebookâ€™s News Feed.
