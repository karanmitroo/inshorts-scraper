Samsonite has developed a beacon device called Track&Go that allows users to privately track their luggage. To execute this, the Bluetooth device, built into Samsonite suitcases, will use an open privacy/security protocol by Google called EIDs. Samsonite aims to launch the first suitcases featuring Track&Go in the European market by year end, followed by other international markets.
