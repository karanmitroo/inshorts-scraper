A Bengaluru-based startup called CloneMe is offering customers miniaturised replicas of themselves, using 3D printing technology. The customer's body is scanned on a turntable and the process is similar to photography and completely safe, the company's co-founder said. This process takes about 30 seconds. Statuettes are then produced and delivered in four to seven days.
