According to a patent filed by Facebook earlier this month, the social networking platform may replace emojis with a user's face through the facial recognition technology. Facebook will reportedly sort through the tagged photos of the users to find faces that best match the emoji for use. For example, a smiling emoji may be replaced with a user's smiling face.
