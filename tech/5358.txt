A Russian court has upheld a decision to block social networking platform LinkedIn, ruling that the company did not comply with the country's data protection rules. The rules require all personal data of Russian citizens to be stored on servers inside the country itself. Commenting on the ban, an official said, "This also concerns Facebook, Twitter and all foreign companies."
