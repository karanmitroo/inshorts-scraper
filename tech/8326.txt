US-based researchers have created a nanowire-based battery material that can be recharged over 100,000 times without degrading its power or capacity. A standard lithium-ion battery, used in most of the smartphones, have 300 to 500 charge cycles in it before its capacity starts decaying. In initial testing, the material was recharged 200,000 times without any capacity or power loss.
