The official website of IIT Delhi was hacked on Tuesday to show a message addressed to the government and the people of India saying "Pakistan Zindabad" at the end of the page. The hacked website played an obscene song in the background, and asserted "Kashmir will be Pakistan". It also showed YouTube videos on Indian Army's alleged brutality in Kashmir.
