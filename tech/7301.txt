E-commerce platform Amazon on Thursday patented a 'Multi-use UAV docking station system', aiming to convert existing city infrastructure like street lamps into charging stations for delivery drones. The patent suggests that the docking stations besides increasing a drone's flying range, will allow a drone to land, avoid bad weather, drop off and pick up packages, and even provide Wi-Fi hotspots.
