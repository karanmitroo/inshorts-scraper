Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre has made 'Atmos 568', a â‚¹19 lakh clock that uses only atmospheric pressure to run itself. Small fluctuations in the temperature can charge the clock and a shift of only one degree hotter or colder charges the clock enough to last for 48 hours. The maker claims the clock will show accurate time for almost 4,000 years.
