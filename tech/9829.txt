Apple on Wednesday shut down Topsy Labs, its social analytics platform that specialised in analysing Twitter data. Topsyâ€™s website now redirects visitors to an Apple support page and its last tweet read, "We've searched our last tweet". Apple had reportedly acquired the company for over $200 million in December 2013.
