ISRO on Wednesday successfully carried the first Trajectory Correction Manoeuvre (TCM) of India's maiden mission to Mars. Four TCMs are planned to fine tune the trajectory of the spacecraft so as to keep it in the precise intended track.  At present, the spacecraft is travelling some 29 lakh kilometres away from Earth.
