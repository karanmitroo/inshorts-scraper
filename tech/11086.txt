Spain-based NeuroDigital Technologies has developed Gloveone, a new pair of gloves that lets users touch virtual objects. The gloves have 10 sensors that translate sensations to vibrations, to detect shape and weight when interacting with virtual objects. The sensors can also detect each other to produce effects like that of firing a gun. The pairs will be launched in 2016.
