A US court has dismissed a class action lawsuit which accused Google of paying female employees less than male counterparts. Adding that two of the three plaintiffs could not prove their claims, the court asked that a new complaint be filed for only specific groups of women affected by pay discrimination. It also observed that the lawsuit was too vague.
