The mobile application of American publisher New York Post, owned by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, was hacked on Saturday to send notifications like "Heil President Donald Trump". Reportedly, the push alerts also included lyrics from rock band Nirvana's song 'Come As You Are'. The publisher later apologised for the alerts and said its systems had been "compromised".
