A US-based firm has developed seawater-powered aluminium batteries that provide a ten-fold increase in range over traditional lithium-ion batteries used for unpiloted underwater vehicles. The durable battery contains an alkaline electrolyte which is only activated when flooded with water. Once the anode corrodes, it can be replaced, providing a low-cost and safer alternative to lithium batteries.
