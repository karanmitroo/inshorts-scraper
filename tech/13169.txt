A patent pending technology developed by VTT Technical Research Centre, Finland, allows files to be shared by just using touch directly or via cloud whereby a ring, structure nail or wristband acts as a user interface. The new 'InTouch' allows a file to be touched on one screen with a structure nail and transferred through the nail to another smartphone.
