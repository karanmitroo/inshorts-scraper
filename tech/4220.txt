Apple has released a trailer for its upcoming reality TV show, which will let developers pitch ideas for mobile applications to Jessica Alba, Gary Vaynerchuk, Gwyneth Paltrow and Will.i.am. The developers will have a minute to explain their ideas while travelling down an escalator. The potential backers will then swipe left or right to indicate their interest in the idea.
