The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Monday announced that India will test a reusable launch vehicle next month, a technology that will bring down costs of launching satellites significantly. "The launch vehicle will be landing first time in the ocean and the ultimate attempt is to make it land at an air-strip at Sriharikota," ISRO chairman Kiran Kumar revealed.
