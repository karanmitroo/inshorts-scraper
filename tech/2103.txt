Facebook employee Chukwuemeka Afigbo uploaded a video to Twitter on Wednesday which shows an automatic bathroom soap dispenser only responding to people with light skin. The soap dispenser operates using infrared sensors which fail to detect darker skin as it absorbs more light. As a result, the skin surface is unable to reflect enough light to activate the dispensing mechanism.
