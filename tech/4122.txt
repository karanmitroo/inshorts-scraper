A New Zealand court ruled on Monday that internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom was eligible for extradition to the US over online piracy allegations linked to his now-defunct website 'Megaupload'. Dotcom's lawyer said the decision was "extremely disappointing". Megaupload reportedly cost film companies $500 million (₹3,300 crore) and generated $175 million (₹1,100 crore) by offering pirated content.
