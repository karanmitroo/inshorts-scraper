Amsterdam-based VanMoof has developed a smart e-bike called the Electrified S. The internet-connected bike features a 250 W electric motor, a GPS and a touch screen for controlling speed. Users can also lock up the bike, turn its lights on or adjust its speed from their smartphones. Further, the bike can cover 75 miles on a full charge.
