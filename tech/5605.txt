The new MacBook Pro computers unveiled by Apple on Thursday will ship without the magnetic MagSafe charging port that the company has been using for a decade. Instead, the laptops will have four USB-C ports to charge it and connect other devices. Users of Apple's iPhone smartphones will have to use a dongle to connect their phones to the laptops.
