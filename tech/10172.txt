According to a new NASA study on Monday, enough ice is being gained by Antarctica to surpass the losses incurred from melting of glaciers. Net gain of 112 billion tonnes of ice a year was recorded from 1992-2001, which slowed to 82 billion tonnes between 2003-2008. Expanded Antarctic ice comes from extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago, it observed.
