US regulators on Thursday voted to open nearly 11 gigahertz of high-frequency spectrum to help carriers create 5G wireless applications and networks, making US the first country to do so. 5G networks are expected to be at least 10 times faster than 4G networks. South Korea and Japan plan to deploy 5G by 2018 and 2020 respectively.
