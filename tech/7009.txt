Scientists have created a highly breathable material that may be made into smart 'second skin' uniforms to protect soldiers from biological agents and chemical hazards in the field. The team integrated the polymer with carbon nanotubes to act as moisture conductive pores. The size of these pores is 5,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.
