Facebook on Wednesday revealed that it's working on a system to let humans type with just their brain. The optical imaging system will scan users' brains hundred times per second to detect them speaking silently in their head and translate it into text. According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the system will be 5 times faster than typing on phones.
