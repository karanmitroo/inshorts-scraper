Peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent on Thursday launched a new ad-supported on-demand audio and video streaming app called BitTorrent Now. The platform will work like any other on-demand streaming service, but will offer content majorly from independent artists. Its Android app was made available on the day of the launch, with the iOS and Apple TV apps to follow soon.
