A Chinese court has ruled that technology major Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus smartphones do not infringe on design patents held by domestic phone maker Shenzhen Baili. The court also overturned a 2016 ruling, which banned Apple from selling the two iPhone models in Beijing. According to the court, regulators had issued the ban without real proof of wrongdoing.
