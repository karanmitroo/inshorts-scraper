US-based startup Eight has created a smart mattress cover 'Luna', that manages bed's temperature and tracks the user's sleep. Controlled through a dedicated app, Luna learns the user's regular bedtime and sets the bed to a comfortable temperature that helps in falling asleep faster. It also records sleep, heart rate and breathing rate and comes with an in-built alarm.
