Facebook has launched a 'Save Free Basics in India' campaign which claims to "support digital equality in India". Indian Facebook users get a notification urging them to send a pre-filled message to TRAI in support of 'Free Basics', formerly known as internet.org. The move comes after TRAI reopened the debate on net neutrality and differential pricing.
