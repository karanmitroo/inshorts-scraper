According to sources, Apple Inc is planning to unveil a song-discovery feature in an update of its iOS mobile software that will let users identify a song and its artist using an iPhone or iPad. The song-identification feature will reportedly be integrated into the mobile software, which means that consumers don't need to separately download it.
