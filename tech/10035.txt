A team of doctors from Japan and US have grown vocal cords from human cells. The doctors took healthy connective tissue and lining cells taken from the vocal cords of five patients and assembled them into layers resembling the structure of healthy vocal cords. The grown vocal cords were also not rejected when transplanted on mice with human-like immune system.
