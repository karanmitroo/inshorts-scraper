HP named its first product 'Model 200A' to seem like an established company with a strong product line. The frequency-generating audio oscillator was priced at $55, whereas competitive oscillators were sold at about $500. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who incorporated HP on August 18, 1947, formalised their partnership after selling eight modified oscillators to Walt Disney Studios.
