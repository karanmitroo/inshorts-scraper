iPhone X users have reported that they are facing 'distortion' or 'buzzing' sound from the smartphone's front-facing earpiece speaker at high volume. Users claimed that the distorting sound occurs with audio playback, including phone calls, music, alarms and ringtones. Earlier, users had also reported 'crackling' sound in the earpieces of some iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus smartphones.
