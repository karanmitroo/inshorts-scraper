US-based stratospheric flight startup World View on Saturday launched its first space balloon from its headquarters in the US. The balloons, called Stratollites are high-altitude crafts that can operate at the upper edge of Earth's atmosphere for scientific and observational purposes. The startup claims Stratollite flight platform costs a fraction of the cost of existing technology.
