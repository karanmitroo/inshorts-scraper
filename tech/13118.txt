In a research, called the ultra-parallel visible light communications project, UK scientists achieved record data transmission speeds of 10 gigabits per second(250 times faster than 'superfast' broadband). The micro-LED light bulbs used in the transmission were enabled to handle millions of changes in light intensity per second using digital modulation technique. This allows high speed transmission of large binary data.
