US-based startup Socratic run by engineers including one of Indian-origin, has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) app that provides solutions to algebra equations by just clicking a picture of questions. The app reads both math and science questions - even handwritten ones - and gives students step-by-step solutions. It also shows graphs, videos and definitions to support the solutions.
