Amazon on Thursday reported its highest ever net profit of $482 million in the quarter ended December, a 125.23% surge against the year-ago period. The company's sales in 2015 surpassed $100 billion for the first time in its history. Its special membership program, Amazon Prime, grew 50% in 2015. Its record numbers come as US brick-and-mortar retailers continued to struggle.
