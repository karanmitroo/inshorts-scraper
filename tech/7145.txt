Founders of Google's Project Ara initiative have created a smart lamp called 'Peak' that helps in teaching good habits to its users. Peak sends encouraging text messages to the users and recommends little steps to take towards the larger goals set by them. The lamp records the progress made and celebrates it with a burst of light.
