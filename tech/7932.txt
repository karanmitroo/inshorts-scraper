Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, for the third consecutive time, successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket on a drone ship at sea after it was launched on Saturday carrying the 'THAICOM 8' satellite. The satellite, which was put into an elliptical orbit 22,000 miles above sea level, is a commercial communications satellite intended to serve parts of India, Africa and South-East Asia.
