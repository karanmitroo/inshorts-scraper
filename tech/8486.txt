Elon Musk-owned company SpaceX on Friday successfully landed the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket on a drone ship at sea, after launching it to the International Space Station. It's the first time SpaceX has been able to pull off an ocean landing, after four failed attempts. With this, SpaceX has landed its rockets both on ground and ocean.
