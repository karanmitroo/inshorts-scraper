As part of Google's 'Safe Browsing' campaign, the company has started blocking torrent website 'The Pirate Bay' and marked it as "deceptive" on Chrome and Firefox web browsers. However, users can get around this message by clicking 'visit this unsafe site' in Chrome or 'Ignore this warning' in Firefox. Google has already been flagging sites with deceptive advertisements as unsafe.
