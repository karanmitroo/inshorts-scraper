WikiLeaks on Thursday made US President Barack Obama's personal email address 'bobama@ameritech.net' public. A reply from Obama through the email reveals that he uses a BlackBerry phone and his email domain is supplied by AT&T. The email, however, has been disabled and the emails sent to the address are bouncing back.
