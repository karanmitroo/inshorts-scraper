LG has announced to hold a movie-themed event on October 1 in New York where its V10 smartphone is speculated to be launched. Similar to the Samsung Continuum smartphone from 2010, V10 reportedly features secondary display, i.e., it has a small auxiliary ticker display above the main display. This will possibly be used to show messages and other notifications.
