Apple on Thursday appointed Jeff Williams as the Chief Operating Officer (COO), a position left vacant since Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook assumed his post in 2011. Williams, who has previously served as the Senior Vice President of operations and overseen the development of the Apple Watch, is now only the fourth C-level executive at Apple.
