The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked passengers to avoid carrying Samsung Note devices aboard planes after a Galaxy Note 2 phone caught fire on Friday morning on a Chennai-bound flight. DGCA has summoned Samsung officials to its office on Monday. Earlier, Samsung had issued a global recall of its Note 7 smartphones over reports of exploding batteries.
