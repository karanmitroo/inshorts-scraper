Facebook's artificial intelligence system malfunctioned on Thursday and mistakenly notified some users to celebrate 46 years of their friendship. Facebook's spokesperson claimed they have identified the bug and that the team is fixing it. This reportedly could be due to Facebook's code confusing the start date of friendship with the system start date on Unix systems (1 January 1970).
