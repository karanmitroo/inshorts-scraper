Microsoft has launched the Xbox Onesie jumpsuit, a one-piece zip-up casual garment available in white or black, for its gamer community in Australia. It features enlarged pockets to fit an Xbox Controller and Media Remotes, an arm pouch for a mobile phone, forearm grips to prevent slipping, and an extra-large hood to accommodate headsets.
