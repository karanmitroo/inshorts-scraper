Sanmay Ved, a former Google employee, was able to buy Google.com for a minute for $12 while he was browsing Google Domains, the companyâ€™s website buying service. He then reportedly received e-mails with internal information before Google Domains canceled the sale and refunded the money. "The scary part was I had access to webmaster controls for a minute," Ved said.
