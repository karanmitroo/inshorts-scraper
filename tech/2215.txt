HBO last month reportedly offered â‚¹1.6 crore to hackers who claimed to have stolen TV series Game of Thrones' script as "bug bounty payment". The hackers reportedly stole 1.5 terabytes of data and demanded a multimillion-dollar ransom in Bitcoin to prevent leaks. HBO further asked the hackers to extend the deadline for one week "in the spirit of professional cooperation".
