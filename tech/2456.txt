Harvard researchers have modified an analytical tool that uses Google Search data to track dengue in less developed countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Thailand. The team calculated dengue prevalence based on the assumption that more dengue-related searches occur when more people are infected. The method could potentially be used to alert governments on anticipation of elevated dengue incidence.
