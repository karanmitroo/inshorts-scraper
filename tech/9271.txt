Arjun S, a 15-year-old Chennai boy, has developed a mobile app which helps parents track the position of their childrenâ€™s school buses whenever they want. Called LOCATERA, it is a tri-app solution, meaning, three apps work together. These include the attendant (bus driver), the admin (school), and parent apps. Arjun used Massachusetts Institute of Technology's programming tool to develop LOCATERA.
