Amazon is collaborating with SmartThings, an IoT company aimed at creating smart homes, to power various home automation features with Amazon Echo, its voice-powered personal assistant device. Amazon Echo will reportedly soon be able to power any SmartThings-compatible device through a simple shout-out. This includes non-SmartThings items that are plugged into a SmartThings Power Outlet.
