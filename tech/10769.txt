American technology corporation IBM has decided to acquire Merge Healthcare, an image-focused healthcare firm, for $1 billion. The deal, which is IBM’s largest health-related acquisition since April, will enable the company’s Watson Health Cloud to analyze and cross-reference Merge's medical images. This will reportedly amount to 315 billion data points and 90 million unique records.
