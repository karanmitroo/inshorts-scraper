A US Marine soldiers group has written to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg urging her to take personal interest in fighting Facebook groups that post nude pictures of female soldiers without consent. "Help lead this battle in the cyber war against...nonconsensual photo sharing through social media," it said. The group suggested that Facebook should eliminate such groups, pages, and users "quickly."
