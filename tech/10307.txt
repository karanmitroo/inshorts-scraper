According to data from NASAâ€™s Mars Curiosity rover, the Red Planet had lakes of liquid water about 3.3 to 3.8 billion years ago. The sediments from those lakes have reportedly formed the foundation of Mount Sharp, the mountain in the middle of the huge crater that the rover is currently exploring. Recently, NASA had found flowing water on Mars.
