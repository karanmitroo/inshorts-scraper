Technology major Google on Tuesday rolled out a job search feature in the US that lets users search for jobs across portals like LinkedIn, Monster, and Facebook among others. Users will be able to see the postings simply by searching for queries like "jobs near me" or "teaching jobs." The listings will also show employers' ratings alongside the job description.
