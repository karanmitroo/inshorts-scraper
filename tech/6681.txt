Nike's fitness app 'Nike+ Running' users are upset over the latest redesign of the app, which has eliminated certain previously available functionalities and features. Renamed as 'Nike+ Run Club', the app's average rating has reduced to 1.5 stars on the Apple's App Store post redesign. The redesign has removed motivational trophies and made sharing progress on social media difficult.
