British anti-garbage startup LitterGram has been asked by Instagram's lawyers to change its name as the use of "gram" could undermine Instagram's brand. LitterGram lets users share photos of garbage, geotag its location and report it to the local council. The use of photography and social aspects of the app have also been argued as being similar to Instagram.
