European Space Agency's spacecraft Philae that landed on a comet has found some organic material on its surface, indicating an abundance of alien microbial life. As per reports, the organic-rich black crust of the comet, named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, was likely caused by microorganisms living beneath an icy surface. Philae had landed on the comet in November last year.
