The Internet Archive, which keeps a store of everything on the internet, announced plans to shift its data to Canada from the US, to keep it "safe" after Donald Trump was elected US President. Trump had earlier suggested "closing up" the internet to prevent children and ISIS recruiters from using it. The archive also sought donations to fund the procedure.
