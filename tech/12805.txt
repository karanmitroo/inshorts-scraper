US firm Hennessey has developed the world's fastest car - Venom GT - with a top speed of 435 kilometres per hour. It broke the previous best record of 431 km/hr set by Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. However, the record will not go into the "Guinness Book of Records" as the Venom could only be driven one way.
