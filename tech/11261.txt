Scientists at the Tokohu University of Japan claim to have discovered a new state of matter, Jahn-Teller-metal, which combines the properties of an insulator, superconductor, metal and magnet. According to the scientists, the discovery could help in the development of new molecular materials that are superconductors at even higher temperatures.
