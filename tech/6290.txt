Norwegian editor Espen Egil Hansen has accused social media giant Facebook's Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg of avoiding debate on censorship and challenged him to publicly discuss the same. Hansen said, "Zuckerberg is de facto the most powerful editor-in-chief on the globe". Earlier this month, Hansen successfully made Facebook turn back its censorship of the famous “napalm girl” photograph.
