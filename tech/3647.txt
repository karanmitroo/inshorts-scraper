Animal welfare organisation PETA has written a letter to gaming major Nintendo criticising its newly-launched cow milking video game. "Our staffers and activists have recently played the cow-milking minigame for Nintendo Switch and realized youâ€™ve taken all the cruelty out of milking...it is NEVER that pleasant for these animals. Can we have some realism here, please?" the letter read.
