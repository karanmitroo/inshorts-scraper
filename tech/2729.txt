The German parliament on Friday passed a bill under which social media companies could face fines of up to â‚¬50 million for failing to remove hate speech. The firms will be given 24 hours to block or delete any inappropriate content. They will also have to publish a report every six months, describing actions taken over complaints of hate speech.
