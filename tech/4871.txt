Stephen Davies and Drew Murray provide free 3D prosthetic hands and arms for children who are born without them. They have open-sourced a blueprint, meaning anyone with the required equipment can make one. Known as 'Team Unlimbited', their project is funded by themselves as well as donations. Each hand costs about £30 (approximately ₹2499) and 12 hours to make.
