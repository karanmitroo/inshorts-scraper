Campbell Brown, Facebook's Head of News Partnerships, at a recent interview said, "My job is not to go recruit people from news organisations to put their stuff on Facebook." Brown added that her job is to ensure that quality news is published on Facebook. She further highlighted that people don't come to Facebook for news, but for friends and family.
