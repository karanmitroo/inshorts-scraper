Technology giant Apple is reportedly blocking third-party apps from using its emoji in screenshots and other promotional material, citing violation of rules. The issue came to light after numerous developers reported App Store rejections resulting from their apps featuring Apple's emoji designs. Notably, Apple owns a copyright for its emoji designs and also introduced a keyboard for them in 2011.
