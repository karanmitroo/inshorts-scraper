China's 'Transit Elevated Bus' concept that glides over the traffic and allows cars to pass underneath it, is being called a scam by the state's media. "The TES was little more than a publicity stunt...a lending scam that has duped retail Chinese investors by promising unreal returns," said a report. Earlier this month, the bus reportedly completed a test run.
