ESPN has started pulling down its videos from YouTube after the latter announced the launch of its ad-free subscription service in United States, YouTube Red. Media analysts reportedly said that the reason behind ESPN's move were its contracts with cable and satellite companies. Video creators will have to be on Red for their videos to be on the ad-free platform.
