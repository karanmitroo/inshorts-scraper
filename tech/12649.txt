In a remarkable development, the Israeli company, Water-Gen, has developed a new and inexpensive technology that produces drinking water from thin air. Using the technology, a litre of water can be produced for a mere Rs 1.50, the company claims. The system can produce 250-800 litres of potable water a day, depending on temperature and humidity conditions.
