NASA will launch a sounding-rocket on Thursday to adjust the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) instrument aboard its Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The SDO studies the solar atmosphere to decipher the Sun’s influence on Earth and near-Earth space for NASA. This will be the seventh calibration mission for NASA’s SDO mission as solar instruments are known to get worn-out very quickly.
