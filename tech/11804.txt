Office 2016, the updated version of Microsoft Office, will be available in the second half of 2015. It will be optimized for Windows 10. "We will have more to share on Office 2016 in the coming months, but this suite will remain the comprehensive Office experience you're long familiar with" said Microsoft Office general manager Julia White.
