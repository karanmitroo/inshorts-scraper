Apple on Tuesday launched a new smartwatch 'Watch Series 3' with built-in cellular connectivity at a starting price of $399. The watch, which has an electronic SIM integrated directly into it, shares the same phone number as the user's existing iPhone. The Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled watch is swim-proof and promises all-day battery.
