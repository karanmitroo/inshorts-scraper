Masayasu Ito, the Executive Vice President of Sony's video game console PlayStation, admitted in a recent interview that the PlayStation Virtual Reality (VR) will not match the VR quality of the Oculus Rift. He also said that the PlayStation VR "is more for everyday use, so it has to be easy to use and it has to be affordable".
