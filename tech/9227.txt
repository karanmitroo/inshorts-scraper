American sporting goods company Wilson has developed a smart ball for American Football called ‘Wilson X Connected Football’. The ball has embedded sensors that measure gameplay statistics like distance, speed and spin rate of the ball, for comparison and analysis. The information gathered is sent to a Bluetooth-connected smartphone app. The ball works for two years on a single charge.
