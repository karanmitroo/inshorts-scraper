Facebook has announced its Instant Articles will now support 360-degree content. This means that publishers can include 360-degree images and videos in-line, which users can then navigate by turning their mobile device, or tapping and dragging. Introduced in 2015, Instant Articles displays publishers' content in a faster-loading view when accessed on mobile devices.
