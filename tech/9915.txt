According to security firm Symantec, fake LinkedIn profiles are being used by fraudsters to collect contact information of business professionals and use them to send spear-phishing e-mails. Symantec said, "We were able to confirm this by using reverse image search tools like TinEye andÂ Google's Search by Image". Mostly, these scammers pose as recruiters and use display pictures of women.
