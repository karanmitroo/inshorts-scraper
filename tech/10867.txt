Scientists in a new study have discovered the world's oldest fossil animal sperm, dating back almost 50 million years. The researchers found the sperm fragments embedded within the walls of a fossilized cocoon. The scientists said they suspect that an ancient relative of 'clitellate annelid' of the leeches family, created the cocoon while mating, and released its sperm inside.
