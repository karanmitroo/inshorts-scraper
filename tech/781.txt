Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro has discovered a cryptocurrency mining malware called Digmine, which is spreading via Facebook Messenger. The malware, which mines cryptocurrency 'Monero', is sent to users disguised as a video file and manipulates Messenger to forward it to users' friends. However, it only affects the Messenger's desktop/web browser (Chrome) version, according to the firm.
