Microsoft is partnering with Chinese internet giant Baidu to push for Windows 10 in China. Baidu will enable users to upgrade to Windows 10 through a distribution channel and introduce its universal applications on the OS. In return, Microsoft will feature Baidu as the default search engine on its Edge browser. Currently, roughly 10 million Chinese devices have Windows 10.
