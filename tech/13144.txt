Serian Electronic Army, infamous for high-profile attacks on media organizations, claimed to have hacked President Obama's Twitter and Facebook accounts. But it appears that SEA actually altered the links in the posts updated on Twitter and Facebook by Obama's account, instead of hacking them. All altered links redirected to a 24-minute video titled 'Syria facing terrorism' and contained graphic violence.
