Snapchat on Thursday started selling its 'Spectacles' smart sunglasses for $130 (â‚¹8,700) through vending machines called 'Snapbots' which will travel around the US. The Snapbots feature a display that lets shoppers virtually try on the glasses in coral, black or teal colour. Spectacles feature an in-built camera and can be connected to smartphones to take and send 10-second snaps.
