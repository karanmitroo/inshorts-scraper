Ransomware dupes people into clicking an infected pop-up advertisement, visiting an infected website, or downloading a malicious file. The malware then locks up files on a user's computer till the hackers' demands are met. In Friday's WannaCry ransomware, attackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows which was leaked last month, reportedly as part of a US spy agency's hacking tools.
