A design by students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), on Saturday, won the competition for designing 'Hyperloop pods'. The contest saw participation from around 1,000 college students. Proposed by Tesla founder Elon Musk, Hyperloop is a conceptual high-speed ground transport system, wherein 'pods' of 20 to 30 people travel through a 12-foot tube at speeds of around 1,127 kmph.
