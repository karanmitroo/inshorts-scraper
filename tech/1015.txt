Scientists are developing global-scale "quantum internet", which uses quantum bits instead of classical bits. While classical bits can store either 0 or 1, quantum bits can superpose both (00, 11, 01, 10) to store more information. Further, any interference between the transmission nodes of quantum entangled (paired) data bits changes the encryption key, which renders the signal "unhackable".
