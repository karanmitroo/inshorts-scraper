High-speed transportation startup Hyperloop One, while unveiling the prospective Europe routes, said that the system will be able to cover the 3-hour train journey from Paris to London in 20 minutes at nearly 1,100 kmph. The system will be able to transport people sitting in pods floating in an electromagnetic field through air-evacuated tubes.
