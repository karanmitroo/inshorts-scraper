Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company is considering adding a 'dislike' button, as that is one of the most requested feature. "Often people tell us that they don't feel comfortable pressing 'like' because 'like' isn't the appropriate sentiment", he said, also saying that it would be made sure that it doesn't become a way to demean posts.
