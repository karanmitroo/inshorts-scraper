Technology giant Apple on Tuesday rolled out an update to fix a disruptive sound issue in the earpieces of some iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus smartphones. Earlier users reported hearing  'crackling' sound during some phone and Facetime calls. The update, iOS 11.0.2, also addresses issues that could cause some photos to become hidden.
