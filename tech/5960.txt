Social networking giant Facebook has officially launched its private social networks for companies, called "Workplace". Facebook is also releasing "Multi-Company Groups" which allow employees from different organisations to work together without using their personal Facebook accounts . There is also a separate Work Chat app which enables employees to keep in touch while they're out of the office.
