In a first, a new zero-gravity 'ISSpresso' coffee machine is set to be delivered to the International Space System. The machine will be carried to the orbital station this weekend by Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Samantha will be the "first astronaut in the history of the conquest of space to savour an authentic Italian espresso in the orbit," said officials.
