Google on Wednesday launched a feature called 'Your Timeline' in Google Maps that shares with the users all the places they have been. However, it works only if the users chose to store their location history with Google. The feature, which is clubbed with the Google Photos service, also allows the users to view the photos taken on specific trips.
