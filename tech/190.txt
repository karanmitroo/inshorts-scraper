Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma has said, "Facebook is one of the most evil companies in the world right now." Sharma's statement comes after Facebook-owned WhatsApp launched its digital payments service via UPI platform in India. He explained that the lack of three-factor authentication in WhatsApp's platform leaves users vulnerable to hacks and poses a "bigger security threat."
