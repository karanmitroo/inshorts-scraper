Finnish startup Polar has created a smart workout shirt called 'Team Pro Shirt' that has a pair of sensors embedded into the fabric that contact with the skin to track the user's heart rate in real-time. A built-in sensor in the back collar tracks the wearer's speed, distance and acceleration. The shirt will be available for buying from March.
