NASA’s Jupiter mission, Juno spacecraft, is carrying three 1.5 inch Lego figures to Jupiter’s orbit - one is of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, and other two of the Roman God, Jupiter and his wife, Juno. Galileo’s miniature has a telescope, Juno has a magnifying glass to signify her quest for truth, while Jupiter holds a lightning bolt.
