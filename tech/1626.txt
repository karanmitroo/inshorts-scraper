Japanese scientists have invented a loop-based approach to quantum computing that would allow a larger number of calculations than existing quantum computers. Under the new method, many pulses of light, each carrying information, go in a loop circuit indefinitely. The "ultimate" quantum computing method would allow a single circuit to process over 1 million quantum bits (qubits), said researchers.
