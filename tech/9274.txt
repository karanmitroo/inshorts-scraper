According to reports, Apple Retail stores will start accepting iPhones with damaged screens, buttons and cameras in exchange for credit towards buying newer models. However, only iPhones with damage "within reason" will be accepted under Apple's Reuse and Recycling trade-in program. This is expected to encourage customers to upgrade their iPhones rather than repair damage.
