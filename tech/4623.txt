Video game company ZeniMax has sued Facebook-owned Oculus for stealing key technology and promoting a fake origin story to hide the truth. ZeniMax accused Oculus' Co-founder Palmer Luckey of spreading a "false and fanciful story that Luckey was the brilliant inventor of VR technology who had developed that technology in his parents' garage. That story was utterly and completely false."
