Google on Wednesday displayed a fake story about aliens "sucking energy from the sun" as the first result when searching for "aliens". Google's redesign makes stories that load faster on mobiles more prominent and labels them 'Top stories'. Google recently announced that it would stop advertisements being placed on sites with misleading information in an effort to curb fake news.
