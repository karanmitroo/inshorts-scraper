Norwegian technology company Opera Software has introduced free and unlimited Virtual Private Network (VPN) feature into its desktop browser, making it the first major browser to offer an integrated VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted connection over a less secure network. It can be used to improve public Wi-Fi security, hide user's IP address and bypasses certain website access restrictions.
