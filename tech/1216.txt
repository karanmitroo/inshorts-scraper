Google spinoff Waymo has announced that it has deployed self-driving cars without a driver behind the wheel on public roads in Arizona, US. Waymo also said passengers will begin riding in its self-driving minivans in the next few months. The test without a human in the driver's seat is a first in the race to develop fully autonomous cars.
