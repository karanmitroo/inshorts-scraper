High-end digital photography equipment manufacturer Phase One on Monday launched a new 100-megapixel camera which uses a sensor, co-developed with Sony. Unlike many cameras which create images with a 14-bit colour spectrum, Phase One's XF 100 MP produces 16-bit colour images. The company has started shipping the new camera that comes with a price tag of $48,990.
