Maruti Suzuki is planning to launch the country's cheapest automatic car early next month. The company has chosen Alto 1000cc for its automatic variant. Expected to be priced under Rs 4 lakh, the car will use the Auto-Gear Shift technology that the company had deployed on Celerio. The new Alto will have a fuel efficiency of 24 kmpl.
