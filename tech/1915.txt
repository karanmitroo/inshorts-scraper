The government on Saturday issued an alert for 'Locky' ransomware that locks all files on a computer and demands 0.5 Bitcoins (around â‚¹1.5 lakh) to unlock them. The ransomware is being spread through a spam email in circulation through over 23 million messages containing common subjects like "please print" and "documents". The message directs users to download Locky ransomware's variants.
