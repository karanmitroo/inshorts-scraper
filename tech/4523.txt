National Park Service, a US federal agency that manages and conserves monuments and national parks, has apologised for "mistaken retweets" against US President Donald Trump. The agency had retweeted photos reflecting the difference in crowd size between Obama's inauguration in 2009 and Trump's in 2017. The tweets reportedly caused the Washington support office to ban the agency from Twitter.
