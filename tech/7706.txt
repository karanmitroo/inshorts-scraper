The US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter on Friday thanked an 18-year-old teen for hacking the Pentagon's websites and finding security vulnerabilities before the US adversaries did. The teen had reported six loopholes in the government websites. A pilot program 'Hack the Pentagon' was recently held by the US government where the hackers were rewarded for discovering 138 security vulnerabilities.
