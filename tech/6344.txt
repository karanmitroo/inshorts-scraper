British airline Virgin Atlantic, in collaboration with Illinois-based green technology firm LanzaTech, has synthesised more than 5,600 litres of jet fuel derived from industrial gases released by steel mills. Using a fermentation process, the team turned the potential pollutant gases into a low-carbon ethanol which could produce up to 65% less emissions as compared to conventional jet fuel.
