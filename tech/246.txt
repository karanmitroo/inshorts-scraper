A research by MIT's Media Lab has found that facial recognition technology is biased and shows inaccuracies in gender identification depending on a person's skin colour. As per the results, gender was misidentified in less than 1% lighter-skinned males as compared to 35% dark-skinned females. The research was conducted using facial recognition systems of Microsoft, IBM, and China's Megvii.
