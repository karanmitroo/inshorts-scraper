Match-making portal BharatMatrimony has launched '2gether', an app that lets couples chat privately, make calls and exchange texts, emojis, pictures and videos. Users can also set reminders for important dates, share location with their partner and archive favourite moments as memories. The app claims that all of the information shared on its platform is encrypted.
