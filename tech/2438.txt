In order to help creators monetise their content without allowing piracy to run rampant, Facebook has acquired content rights management startup Source3, including its team and technology. Source3's technology allows Facebook to keep a track of user-generated content and help them take action against infringers over copyrights and trademarks. Founded in 2014, Source3 had raised over $4 million.
