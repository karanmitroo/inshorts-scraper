A new bathroom gadget Urinary 2.0 comes with a bidet that automates the cleaning process after urinating, making it entirely hands-free. The urinal has sensors that monitor the stream and activate the cleaning mechanism. Still in its prototype stage, the smart urinal also sprays soapy water for three seconds and dries the area afterwards.
