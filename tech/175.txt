Google on Monday announced that users can now pay utility bills with its Unified Payments Interface-based payment app 'Tez', without any transaction charges. The feature includes bills for electricity, gas, water, DTH as well as mobile postpaid bills and recharge. It will also send notifications when the bill arrives and allow users to check whether they have paid a bill.
