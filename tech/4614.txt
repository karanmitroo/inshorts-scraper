Google parent Alphabet has confirmed that the company has dropped the 'Titan' plan to provide internet through solar-powered drones. The company has instead decided to go ahead with Project Loon, where it will provide internet through high-altitude balloons in remote locations. Staffers working on Titan have been absorbed by Project Loon, and drone delivery plan Project Wing.
