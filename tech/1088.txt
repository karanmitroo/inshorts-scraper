Social media giant Facebook is testing a feature on its app that allows users to buy and sell used goods in Mumbai. Called 'Marketplace', it lets users post advertisements for the goods they want to sell and browse through the advertisements posted by others. Facebook launched Marketplace in the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand last year.
