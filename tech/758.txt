A video showing an 85-year-old woman talking to Google's digital assistant Google Home Mini went viral this week after she received the device as a Christmas gift. In the two-minute-long video, the woman is seen getting scared and gasping at the home assistant. She is also seen instructing the device with "Okay goo goo" instead of "Ok Google".
