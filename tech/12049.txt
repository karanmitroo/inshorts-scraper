A team led by wildlife biologist Vidya Athreya of the Wildlife Conservation Society, has found that leopards know how to share space with humans. When spotted near human settlements, they may be 'resident animals', instead of having strayed from their natural habitat. Five leopards were radio-collared in order to conduct this study.
