Tesla CEO Elon Musk bought a silver McLaren F1 car for $1 million in 1999 after selling his first company Zip2. "There are 62 McLaren F1s in the world, and I will own one of them," Musk had commented then. In 2000, Musk was driving his McLaren F1 with Peter Thiel, his fellow Co-founder at PayPal, when he crashed it.
