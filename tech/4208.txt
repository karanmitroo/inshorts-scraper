Social network aggregation startup Flipboard's CEO Mike McCue in a recent interview compared getting news solely from Facebook to eating "potato chips all day long." He added, "I think of news feeds as the 'mystery meat' of your information diet."  He said that some platforms believe a piece is a "great story because the most people are clicking on it."
