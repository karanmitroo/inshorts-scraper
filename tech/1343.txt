Apple's latest iPhone X will cost $279 (over â‚¹18,000) for out-of-warranty screen repair, according to the iPhone maker. The price is twice the cost of an iPhone 6 screen replacement ($129) and about 65% higher than a new iPhone 8 screen ($169). However, under AppleCare+, the iPhone X screen repair will still cost $29 and $99 for other damages.
