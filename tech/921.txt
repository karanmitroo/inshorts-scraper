Technology giant Apple is in talks to acquire music recognition app Shazam in a $401-million deal, according to reports. The deal which is expected to be announced next week might value the UK-based Shazam below its last valuation of around $1 billion, the reports added. Shazam app lets users identify songs by listening to an audio clip via microphone.
