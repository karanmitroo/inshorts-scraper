The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has proposed recommendations on the implementation of a single all-in-one emergency number 112 across India, similar to the 911 service in the US. TRAI also recommended that existing emergency numbers such as 100, 101, 102, and 108 will be retained as secondary numbers and calls made to these should be re-routed to 112.
