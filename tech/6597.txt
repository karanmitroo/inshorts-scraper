The investment bank that advised SolarCity in its $2.6 billion sale to Tesla, Lazard made a mistake in its analysis and valued SolarCity $400 million less. During analysis, Lazard double-counted SolarCity's projected indebtedness. The mistake was discovered two weeks after the deal was signed. However, both the companies have agreed that the error won't change their view of the deal.
