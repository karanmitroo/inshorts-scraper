Hyderabad-based startup Feel Good Innovations has developed car and bike seats which it claims can reduce jerks by 46% while driving. Called 'Fego Float', it has air cells that keep a thin layer of air between the rider and vehicle, to evenly distribute pressure on a user's back. The seat can be attached to a car or bike's usual seat.
