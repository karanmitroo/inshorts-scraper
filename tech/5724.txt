Music-focused social network SoundShare has launched an iMessage app that allows sharing entire tracks over text messaging. The app is an update to SoundShare's main iOS app, which offers a platform for users to find and follow others and create collaborative playlists. Users can look for a song in the search bar, and tap to send it to a friend.
