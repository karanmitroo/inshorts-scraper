In a first of its kind, #Almostforgot is a heartbeat controlled music video by artist J Views. 
Users can place their finger over the back camera lens of the iPhone and the video uses a technology that analyses subtle changes in the skin complexion with each heartbeat.
The song fluctuates in speed with the pulse while producing synchronised visuals.
