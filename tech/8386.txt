French jet ski champion Franky Zapata's firm has developed 'FlyBoard Air', a hoverboard that can reach up to 10,000 ft in the in air. The hoverboard claims to fly for about 10 minutes and achieves a top speed of 150 kilometres per hour. Controlled through a joystick-like device, it took four years for the company to make the hoverboard.
