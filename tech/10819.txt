The first unmanned factory has been set up at Dongguan city in China by a firm that specializes in precision technology. All the processes are operated by computer-controlled robots, computer numerical control machining equipment, unmanned transport trucks, and automated warehouse equipment. The technical staff just sits at the computer and monitors through a central control system.
