The US Navy has banned e-cigarettes across its entire fleet after the devices' lithium-ion batteries exploded in 15 incidents between October 2015 and June 2016. In two of these incidents, the e-cigarettes exploded while they were in the sailors' mouths. Everyone aboard the US naval ships, including civilians or visitors, have been asked to abide by the ban.
