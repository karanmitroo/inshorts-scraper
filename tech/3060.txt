E-commerce major Amazon has started issuing over ₹450 crore in refunds for unauthorised in-app purchases made by children. Children were able to make in-app purchases of up to ₹6,300 without entering a password. In 2014, the Federal Trade Commission had accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to make such online purchases while playing mobile games.
