A team of researchers have found that a wearable device, called 'OFF! Clip-On', could help against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary carrier of Zika, dengue and chikungunya. The device releases vapour of an insecticide using a battery-powered fan to repel mosquitoes. The wearable was tested in Florida, which showed that it can repel mosquitoes up to 0.3 metres.
