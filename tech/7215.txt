Cybersecurity company Bastille released its research called 'KeySniffer' on Tuesday, which is a set of vulnerabilities affecting wireless keyboards. The research revealed that keyboards from eight manufacturers use unencrypted radio communication, which can be attacked using equipment costing less than $100. An attacker can record all the keystrokes typed by the victim from over 250 feet away.
