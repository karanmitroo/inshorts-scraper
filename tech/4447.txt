US President Donald Trump is reportedly still using his old and unsecured Android phone and even posting tweets through it. This comes after reports suggested that Trump will have to surrender his phone ahead of his appointment as the US President over security reasons. He was set to receive a secure and encrypted handset approved by the Secret Service.
