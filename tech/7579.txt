YouTuber 'Styropyro' has created a 200-watt "laser bazooka", reportedly 400 times more powerful than the most-dangerous lab laser. Styropyro said that its total power consumption is around a kilowatt, roughly the same as that of a microwave oven. It was built from scrap metal and laser diodes which are run through an optical component to combine into one strong beam.
