Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp is testing a new feature called 'Status', which is similar to Snapchat's Stories. WhatsApp's new feature lets users share mood-setting pictures and videos with custom elements such as emoji, with the content disappearing in 24 hours after itâ€™s shared. The feature is currently available only to the registered public beta testers of WhatsApp.
