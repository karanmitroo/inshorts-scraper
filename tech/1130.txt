The Chinese government has announced that it will build an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered police station without any human personnel. The station will be open to the public 24/7 and will feature face-scanning technology to replace ID Cards. It will offer services specifically focused on issues with tests for drivers using a simulator, managing records and paperwork, among other activities.
