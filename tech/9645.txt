California-based Lumosity on Tuesday agreed to pay $2 million, fined by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to settle alleged deceptive advertising of their "brain training" game application, that claims to improve mental strength. As part of the agreement, the company needs to notify its users of the situation and help them to cancel their auto-renewal to avoid future billing.
