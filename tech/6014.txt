US Department of Energy has created the world's smallest transistor with a working one-nanometre gate, about 50,000 times thinner than human hair. The prototype was built with semiconductor materials called transition metal dichalcogenides, instead of silicon. Interestingly, the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer limit on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors.
