Social networking giant Facebook is posting old photographs and posts of users without their permission, reportedly due to a technical glitch. The posts reportedly appear like they have been published for the first time, without any likes and comments but with a fresh timestamp. The company, meanwhile, said they are aware of the issue "and are investigating".
