Norway is set to become the first nation to switch off its FM radio network, with the parliament approving a proposal to shift to Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB). This was opposed by 66% Norwegians over concerns that they may miss emergency warnings broadcasted via radio. The shutdown will begin on January 11 in the northern city of Bodoe.
