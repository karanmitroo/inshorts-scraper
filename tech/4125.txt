Canada-based researchers have pioneered 'perovskite solar cells', cheaper than commercial solar cells, that could be imprinted on any surface to generate solar electricity. A technology to coat an electron-selective layer for extraction of generated electricity on the cells was developed which made the cells function at 20% energy efficiency for more than 500 hours, the researchers said.
