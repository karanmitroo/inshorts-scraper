Airplanes often use air-to-ground (ATG) connectivity to provide WiFi to passengers aboard a flight. Using the transmission technique, mobile broadband towers on the ground send signals up to an aircraft's antennae. Airplanes also use satellite technology, through which a plane connects to satellites in the geostationary orbit which help to transmit signals to Earth via receivers and transmitters.
