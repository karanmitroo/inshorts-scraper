Chinese internet major Baidu's COO and ex-Microsoft executive Qi Lu in a recent interview said Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is far ahead of Google and Microsoft in the US in terms of artificial intelligence. He said companies made the same mistake of focussing on phones instead of "an AI-first device". "AI-first.. has to be voice or... facial recognition," Lu explained.
