According to media reports, Facebook is building a stand-alone camera app to foster immediate capturing and sharing of media. The app opens straight into a camera, like Snapchat, and also allows users to broadcast live video footages via Facebook Live. However, the prototype app is in its experimental stage and may never witness a public release, the reports added.
