Chinese social media app WeChat's built-in translation feature translated the Chinese phrase that commonly means 'black foreigner' to racial slur 'n***er', a user claimed. Other users also noted that the app used the racial slur in negative contexts, including phrases like "A n***er is a thief". WeChat has apologised for the incident and said it has fixed the problem.
