American teenager Erik Finman, who became a millionaire after investing $1,000 in Bitcoin in 2011, has partnered with NASA to launch Taylor Swift's album '1989' into space. The project will launch a mini satellite into space with recordings of various artists. It's meant to commemorate 40th anniversary of astronomer Carl Sagan's Golden Record which was sent into space in 1977.
