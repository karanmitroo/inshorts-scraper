Facebook users who clicked on the "9/11" trending topic on Friday were directed to a tabloid story, which claimed that "bombs were planted in Twin Towers" and "controlled demolitions" destroyed the World Trade Center towers rather than aeroplane crashes. The story was removed by Facebook after it was spotted by a news website.
