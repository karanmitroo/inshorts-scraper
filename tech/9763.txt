The architect of Google’s headquarters, Clive Wilkinson, has proposed a semi-serious plan to move London’s office spaces a level upward from the residences. Named “The Endless Workplace”, the design proposes an open office park that will hover over the city, which the workers will travel to in pneumatic tubes vertically. The city is reportedly facing a worsening commuting problem.
