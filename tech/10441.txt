A US appeals on Thursday ruled that Apple was entitled to an injunction barring Samsung from selling products that were an infringement to Apple's patents. The case involves iPhone's slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quicklinks features. The court said Apple's proposed injunction didn't call for a ban on the sale of Samsung devices, but that the features be rolled back.
