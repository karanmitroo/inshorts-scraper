Pinterest unveiled buyable “Pins,” a way for pinners to buy products directly on the social network, in San Francisco on Tuesday. The "online bulletin board" lets users discover and share things they like, from recipes, craft projects and accessories among others. Pinterest buy buttons will debut on iPhones and iPads in the United States this month.
