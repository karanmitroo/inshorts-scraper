US-based startup Darwin Life aims to help women aged over 40 get pregnant with "designer babies". The treatment is called 'spindle nuclear transfer', often referred to as a three-parent-baby technique, and it is outlawed in the United States. Company's Founder John Zang has said that the firm will offer the service only overseas for now.
