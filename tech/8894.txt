As part of the ‘Digital India’ campaign, the government will digitalize 1.5 lakh post offices across India, including 1.3 lakh post offices in rural areas, by March 2017. A budget of ₹4,909 crore has been allocated for the same. Further, postmen across the country would be provided with solar-powered handheld devices that would be connected to national data centers.
