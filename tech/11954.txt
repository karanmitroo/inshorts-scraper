Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has rejected the idea of a "dislike" button on Facebook. "That's not something that we think is good for the world," Zuckerberg said. He added that "like" and "dislike" buttons could turn into a voting system to judge post, saying that "there are more sentiments that people want to express."
