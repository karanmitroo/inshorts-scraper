The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has called for global registration of all drones. The ICAO has proposed the formation of the registry to make tracking data accessible in real time. It will also host a symposium later this month on registering and tracking of drones, along with geofencing-like systems to prevent their operation in restricted areas.
