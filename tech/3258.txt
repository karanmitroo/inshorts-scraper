Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a new method called 'Electrick' to turn any surface into a touchscreen with conductive spray paint. The method uses a software algorithm to measure changes in the flow of electricity across a conductive surface when users press their fingers against it. The scientists demonstrated Electrick on objects like toys, guitars, and walls.
