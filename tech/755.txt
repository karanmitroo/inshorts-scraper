NASA has teamed up with the US government's military research body, DARPA, to build robotic satellites that can be used to sabotage enemy satellites, as well as refuel and repair friendly satellites. These robotic satellites called "Service stations in orbit" also aim to reduce space pollution caused by broken satellites abandoned in the space.
