Microsoft's Xbox Elite controller has customisation options that allow accessibility to help differently-abled gamers play. The $150 controller is customisable on a physical and software level, featuring removable analog sticks and extra buttons on the back of the handgrip. Typically, controllers designed for people with special needs cost more than $400, placing them out of reach for many people.
