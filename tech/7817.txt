Google image search has been slammed for being racist after a US student pointed out the difference between results for "Three black teenagers" and "Three white teenagers". While image search for black teenagers showed images of prisoners' mugshots, searching white teenagers showed images of smiling young people. Similarly, searching "unprofessional hairstyles" showed images of black women.
