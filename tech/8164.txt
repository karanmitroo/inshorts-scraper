Researchers from Queen's University have developed what they claim is the "world's first holographic flexible smartphone" display, dubbed HoloFlex. The display features a flexible 1,920x1,080 HD OLED screen fitted with tiny lenses that lets multiple people simultaneously view in 3D without any external aids. The result was a 160x104 resolution display that allows 3D viewing from nearly any angle.
