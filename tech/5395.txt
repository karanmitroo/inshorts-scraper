British scientists have developed a USB stick-based test to measure levels of HIV in the blood that produces results in under half an hour. The computer plug-in needs a single drop of blood to conduct the test and transmits the results to a mobile device. The technology could allow patients to monitor HIV levels at home with 95% accuracy.
