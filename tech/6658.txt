Sony is running a campaign in Japan to crowdfund an e-paper display wristwatch called 'FES Watch U', which comes with a steel body and an always-on face. The watch's face and bands feature e-paper display, allowing users to customise the watch's appearance. Priced between $430 to $590, the watch is not expected to be sold outside Japan.
