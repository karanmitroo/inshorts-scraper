Hong Kong-based Info Billion Technology has developed a smart notebook called IDNbook which retains a user's original handwriting and transfers the hand-written notes to smartphones/cloud in real time via Bluetooth. Priced at $199, it uses inductive touch 3D technology to capture strokes by sensing pressure. Users can also edit or refine their original notes and sketches using its app.
