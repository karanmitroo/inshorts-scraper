Researchers at University of Warsaw have created a 15 mm robo-caterpillar that moves on light input. The researchers claim the robot can climb slopes, squeeze into minuscule spaces and move objects ten times its size. The robot is made of shape-shifting materials called Liquid Crystalline Elastomers which contract under a light source and form waves which propel the robot forward.
