The External Affairs Ministry on Thursday launched an app integrating the websites and social media handles of over 170 Indian missions abroad on a common platform. The app has been developed by Facebook for free, an official from the social media firm said. This is in sync with Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's activism over Twitter, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
