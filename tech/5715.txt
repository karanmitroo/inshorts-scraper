Apple is facing stiff opposition from the local residents of an Ireland town over building a $925 million (approximately â‚¹6k crore) data center. Apple received the construction permission from the local planning body in August, but local residents have launched a High Court bid against the center. The HC review may delay Apple's project by 18 months.
