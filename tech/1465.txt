US-based scientists have developed an ultra-sensitive camera capable of sensing both colour and polarisation that mimics the eye of the mantis shrimp. Mantis shrimp, considered one of the best hunters in shallow waters, has 16 different types of colour receptors, whereas, the human eye has only three. The new camera can potentially improve early cancer detection, said researchers.
