A campaign on Indiegogo for Omate Rise, a standalone smartwatch, reached its funding goal in 15 minutes. The water-resistant smartwatch runs the full Android 5.1 Lollipop version (not Android Wear) and has its own 3G data connection. It is currently available on Indiegogo starting at $199 but is expected to cost $349 after its launch in March 2016.
