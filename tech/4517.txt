Twitter users have complained of a glitch that made them follow US President Donald Trump's newly-acquired POTUS handle automatically despite having blocked the account. Some users also said that they were unable to unfollow POTUS now that Barack Obama is no longer the President. Twitter acknowledged the issue and claims to have fixed the difficulties faced by "migrating users" now.
