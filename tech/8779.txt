A study by Australian scientists found that Twitter can be used for the management, real-time monitoring, and prediction of the economic impact of natural disasters. To achieve this, hundreds of millions of geo-located tweets referencing to disaster-related topics were collected from 50 metropolitan areas in the US and were studied alongside the granted aid and insurance claims for the disasters.
