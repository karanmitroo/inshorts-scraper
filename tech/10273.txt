A US jury found Apple guilty of patent infringement by using the technology owned by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing arm without its permission. The patent was for a technology that improves processor efficiency, which is currently used in Apple's iPhone 5s, 6 and iPad. Apple could face fines up to $862.4 million in damages or more.
