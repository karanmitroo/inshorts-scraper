Apple has identified a bug in Safari browser that caused product rating organisation Consumer Reports to have inconsistent battery life when testing new MacBook Pros. The organisation said the laptop's battery life ranged from 3.75-19.5 hours during testing. Apple also claimed that Consumer Reports was using a hidden setting which isn't used by customers and doesn't reflect real-world usage.
