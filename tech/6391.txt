The first known person to unlock an iPhone, George Hotz on Tuesday unveiled 'Comma One', a $999 kit that turns select cars to self-driving vehicles. The first product of his startup, named Comma.ai, when fitted into a car wouldn't require a driver to touch the wheel or the brake. Hotz will start shipping the kit by the end of 2016.
