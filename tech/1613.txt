MIT researchers have developed shape-shifting robots that can be controlled via magnets to make it walk, roll, sail, and glide. The device carries out these actions by wearing "origami" exoskeletons, made from sheets of plastic that fold into specific shapes when heated. After finishing the task, it can shed its "skin" by immersing itself in water, which dissolves the exoskeleton.
