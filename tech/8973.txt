An Australian neurosurgeon, Ralph Mobbs performed a surgery by implanting 3D-printed titanium vertebrae in a 60-year-old patient suffering from chordoma, a rare form of cancer that occurs in bones. This was the first time such an operation had been attempted. Mobbs worked with an Australian medical device manufacturer to create perfect replicas of the patient's top two vertebrae for practice.
