YouTuber Colin Furze has built a rideable hoverbike that has no steering system and goes up to a couple of feet high. The seatless, brake-less bike is powered by two motorised propellers and has some of its parts supplied by Ford, Furze claims. He has previously built Wolverine claws, shoes to walk on ceiling, Iron Man suit and jet-powered bicycle.
