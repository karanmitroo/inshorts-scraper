Attempting to exploit the mushrooming mobile advertising market, Tata Teleservices will soon launch a mobile advertising application which will provide free voice minutes to users for viewing ads on their handsets. "Users will be instantly rewarded with one minute of talk-time for each advertisement viewed," the official said. The application, named GET, is compatible with Android, Java, Symbian and Blackberry.
