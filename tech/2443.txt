Google will reportedly name the upcoming Android 8.0 'Octopus', contrary to earlier reports that it would be named 'Oreo'. In the latest beta version, developers have reported seeing an octopus in place of the easter egg, marking a departure from the usual dessert names of past releases. Android O is set to release on Google's Pixel smartphones later this year.
