Professional social network LinkedIn on Tuesday launched a new video feature which lets its influential users create 30-second videos to address questions from its user community. Influencers can create videos using a dedicated iOS and Android app called 'Record', which is accessible only to these invited influencers. Users can view these videos along with other videos posted by these influencers.
