An American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger's e-cigarette overheated and caught fire on Friday. The flight was diverted and its passengers were put on another plane. Over 60 instances of e-cigarette explosions due to battery malfunctions have been identified in the US in 2015 and early 2016.
