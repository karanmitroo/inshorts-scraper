Researchers from the University of Sheffield, UK and other European countries have developed the Fly-Bag, a bag with bomb proof lining to be used in the luggage hold of aircrafts. The Fly-Bag is made from layers of fabrics and composites that impart high strength, impact, and heat resistance. Real life explosive tests have demonstrated that the bag does not tear.
