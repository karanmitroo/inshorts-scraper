YouTube on Thursday announced that the video-site will now support 60 frames-per-second (fps) for live streaming by enabling HTML5 playback. With this feature, YouTube is planning to compete with services like Twitch for live game streaming. It was only last October when YouTube began offering 60fps playback of videos. The feature is available as an “early preview” on HTML5-compatible browsers.
