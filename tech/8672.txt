Sulon Technologies, a Toronto-based startup, has developed 'Sulon Q', a headset which allows virtual reality, augmented reality and spatial computing without connecting to a smartphone or a computer. The headset has a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution OLED display, which is sharper than both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets. It comes with spatial earbuds to create three-dimensional sound of space.
