Russian startup Apis Cor has 3D printed a residential house within a day at ₹6.76 lakh, making it the first time a house was printed wholly on site, rather than assembled from pre-printed panels. The single-floor house was built using a special concrete mixture, that was used as printing ink. The house-building printer can operate even in temperatures below -35°C.
