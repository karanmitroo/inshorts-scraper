Samsung has delayed the launch of its smartphone, Samsung Z, which operates on the Tizen OS, in order to "enhance the Tizen ecosystem", it said in an emailed statement. The phone was to launch in Russia, in June. Tizen is an open source, Linux-based system that the South Korean company is using to end its reliance on Google's Android OS.
