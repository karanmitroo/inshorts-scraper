A smartphone app, Noom, developed by a New York tech-startup will enable users to track their exercise and eating habits to control Type-2 diabetes risk (non-insulin-dependent diabetes). The app will give a 16-week diabetes education program on smartphone and provide health consultants to ask any related queries. It will be distributed to at-risk patients in New York City area.
