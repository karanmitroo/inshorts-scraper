The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has allowed consumers to file complaints against “false, misleading or offensive” ads through WhatsApp. Consumers can now send pictures, screen shots and links of print ads, hoardings, packaging, websites and videos to +91 77-100-12345. The advertising watchdog will initially lodge suo-moto complaints and then take them further if found valid.
