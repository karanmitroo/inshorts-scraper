Pakistan and Afghanistan plan to use Google Maps to help settle a border dispute that led to the death of eight civilians in clashes last week, officials from both sides have said. Notably, Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre border with its western neighbour when it gained independence in 1947, however, Afghanistan never formally recognised it.
