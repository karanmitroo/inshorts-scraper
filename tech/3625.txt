In a 1980 video, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs revealed the company, which was founded on April 1, 1976, was named 'Apple Computers' so as to list it before his previous employer Atari, in phonebooks. Jobs said the name epitomised "simplicity" and "sophistication". The company decided to go with 'Apple' unless a better name was suggested by "5 o'clock that day".
