Three IIIT Idupulapaya (Andhra Pradesh) students - Sandeep Konam, Mansoor Basha and Renuka Lakshmi - have developed a multi-functional real time path programmable robot that takes the path specified by the user. “Programmable robots can keep houses clean, modulate light, humidity and temperature to suit our requirements and control security systems and engage in a spectrum of tasks,” said Sandeep.
