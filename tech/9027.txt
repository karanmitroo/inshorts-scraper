Facebook has launched a birthday video cam on iOS that allows users to express birthday wishes by recording 15-second clips that can be shared to a friend's timeline. Users can also select from various birthday-themed frames for their video messages. The feature aims to make birthday messages more personal and is expected to come on Android in the coming months.
