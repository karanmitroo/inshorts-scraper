Facebook launched its news app 'Notify' for iPhone users in the United States on Wednesday. The app curates and aggregates news content from organisations like Fox News, Washington Post and CBS. With features like personalisation and sharing content directly from the lock screen, Notify is expected to help Facebook compete with Twitter's 'Moments' and help users follow live events better.
