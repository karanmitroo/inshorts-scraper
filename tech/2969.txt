A rare pair of shoes made by technology major Apple in the early 1990s is expected to sell for at least ₹9.6 lakh in an auction on June 11. The shoes, which have Apple's old rainbow logo, were made exclusively for company employees. Last year, a leather jacket worn by Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was auctioned for over ₹14 lakh.
