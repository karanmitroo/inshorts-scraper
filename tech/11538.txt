The department of atomic energy (DAE) has given its approval to set up the country's own thermo-nuclear fusion reactor. India, which is contributing to set up world's biggest energy research project, ITER (France), will use that knowledge to establish demonstrator reactors at home. At present, all nuclear plants in India are based on fission.
