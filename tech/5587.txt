Website domain provider GoDaddy has made a search engine that lets users check and register for available web domain names including emojis. Users can combine various emojis to make an emoji domain name for their website. The emoji domain names are 100% compatible with all browsers and the '.ws' extension is one of the very few extensions that support emojis.
