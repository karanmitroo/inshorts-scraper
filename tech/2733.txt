According to official documents, PayPal Co-founder and US President Donald Trump's adviser Peter Thiel was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011 despite spending just 12 days there over four short trips. Applicants are usually required to be in New Zealand for 1,350 days in five years. Thiel's citizenship has been under scrutiny since it was revealed earlier this year.
