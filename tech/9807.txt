Facebook is testing a new feature on the web that prompts users to ‘click for more’ while watching a video. Clicking on the prompt, or anywhere on the screen, expands the video, providing users with a bigger view and a collection of related videos and video ads. Earlier, videos used to simply pause when users clicked anywhere on the screen.
