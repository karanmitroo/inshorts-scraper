Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, was sentenced to six months in prison Wednesday for hacking Ramsay's company computers in order to steal his personal and financial information. Hutcheson conspired with his sons to infiltrate Ramsay's company systems nearly 2,000 times between October 2010 and March 2011. Ramsay had sacked Hutcheson from the CEO role at his company.
