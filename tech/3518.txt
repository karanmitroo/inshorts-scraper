The current rating of Snapchat's iOS app has dropped to mere one star over Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel's alleged remark of India being a "poor" country made in 2015. Several Indians are said to have uninstalled the app and many have given a one-star rating to the app with negative reviews. Snapchat's Android app rating has fallen to 3.9 stars.
