Google has launched the 'Two-wheeler' mode on Maps in India, a feature which will show the fastest route and directions to two-wheeler riders to reach their entered destination. The feature will be available alongside the 'Drive', 'Train or Bus', and 'Walk' options. The 'Two-wheeler' mode is currently available on Android smartphones.
