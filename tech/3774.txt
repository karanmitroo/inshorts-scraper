Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates on Monday met US President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss Trump's budget proposal that would impose cuts on foreign aid. This comes after Trump claimed the budget would "prioritise the security and well-being of Americans" and Gates responded with an article arguing that providing overseas aid helps to "keep Americans safe."
