Italy-based design firm Carlo Ratti Associati has designed 'Lift-Bit', which it claims to be the world's first internet-connected sofa that can be controlled through a tablet or a hand gesture. The sofa is made up of a number of motorised modular sections or stools that can be moved around, raised or lowered to create different seating positions.
