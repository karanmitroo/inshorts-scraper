Researchers at the University of Maryland have built the first fully programmable and reconfigurable quantum computer module. Called a module because of its ability to connect with copies of itself, the device takes advantage of the unique properties offered by trapped ions to run any algorithm on five quantum bits, or qubitsâ€”the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer.
