Microsoft's former CEO Steve Ballmer in a recent interview revealed that he once offered Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to buy his company for $24 billion. While Zuckerberg refused the offer, Ballmer said, "I respect that. You have to have a willing seller". Zuckerberg is currently the fifth richest person in the world with a net worth of $56.6 billion.
