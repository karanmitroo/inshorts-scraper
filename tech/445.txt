US-based VC firm Social Capital's CEO Chamath Palihapitiya has said, "Amazon's strategy is probably to starve their competitors to death." He believes, given that e-commerce is a gross margin negative business, the winner will likely be the "irrational actor". "I'm glad Amazon is being irrational... my equity will be better served if Amazon wins by investing in India," he added.
