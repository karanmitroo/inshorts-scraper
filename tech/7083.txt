Google's Alphabet has received permission from the US Federal Aviation Authority to test delivery drones in the country under its 'Project Wing'. According to The White House, deliveries below 400 feet at six sanctioned sites will be tested through the drones. Alphabet's drones take off vertically and then fly like a fixed-wing plane.
