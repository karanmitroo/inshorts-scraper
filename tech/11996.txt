Four students - three boys and a girl - from IIT-Kanpur have turned down the jobs which would have paid them over Rs.1 crore annually. Interestingly, two of the students reportedly have settled for lower salaries in order to work in profiles which they found to be more suitable for them. The other two trumped the offers to pursue higher studies.
