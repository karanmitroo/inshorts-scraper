Following a petition that garnered over 70,000 votes, Microsoft has once again allowed OneDrive users to have 15GB of free storage. Last month, the company had reduced OneDriveâ€™s free storage capacity from 15GB to 5GB. However, the said change is not automatic and users will still need to opt-in by January 31 to keep their free storage.
