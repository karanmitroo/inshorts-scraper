Germany-based Ballfinger has created an analogue reel-to-reel tape player for â‚¹19.3 lakh which can take up to 30 cm reels and has a digital display. Reel-to-reel tape recorders hold the recording on a reel, instead of on a cassette. The first successful magnetic recording device was made in the 1890s, while the magnetic tape was developed in the 1920s.
