Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs had resigned as the CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011, handing over the reins to Tim Cook. "I've always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties…as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come,” Jobs said in his resignation.
