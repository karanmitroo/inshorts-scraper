Born on October 31, 1926, Indian-American physicist Narinder Singh Kapany is regarded the father of fibre optics. Being taught in school that light can only travel in straight lines, Kapany successfully demonstrated light transmission in bent glass fibres during his research at Imperial College London. Kapany published an article in 1960, using the term 'fibre optics' for the first time.
