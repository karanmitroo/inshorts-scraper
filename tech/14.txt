The wreckage of US aircraft carrier Lexington, which was lost during the WWII, has been discovered in the Coral Sea by a search team led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The warship sank with 216 crew members and 35 aircraft in 1942 during what is believed to be the first carrier battle in history, 'the Battle of the Coral Sea'.
