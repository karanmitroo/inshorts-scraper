Talking about artificial intelligence (AI), ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt at a recent event said, "It makes you smarter... but I wouldn't put it in charge of command and control." Adding that the AI technology has serious errors in it, he said, "They should not be used with life-critical decisions." "The technology is just not reliable enough," he added.
