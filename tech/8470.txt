Tokyo-based Smartmedical has launched an app for the Apple Watch that identifies and tracks users’ emotions through their voices. Called EmoWatch, the app analyses pitch, volume and speed of users’ voices to understand their energy levels and judge emotions like anger, calmness, joy or sorrow. EmoWatch works with any language as it only detects vocal characteristics, not meanings.
