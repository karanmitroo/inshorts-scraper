Microsoft Co-founder Paul Allen revealed that as a high school student, he spent a lot of time in Washington University's computer lab but was eventually kicked out for being too noisy. Further, he took some equipment from the lab home without authorisation. "Since no one was using it, we'd taken it so we could keep working off campus," Allen explained.
