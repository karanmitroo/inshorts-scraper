A 21-year-old woman in China has been rendered partially blind after playing video games on her smartphone for 24 hours. The woman was reportedly playing a multi-player online game when she suddenly lost vision from her right eye. According to the doctors, the blindness was caused by eye strain from looking at the screen for too long without a break.
