Electronics manufacturer Samsung claims to have found a 'quick fix' to prevent the batteries of its Galaxy Note 7 devices from catching fire. The company will issue a software update for its recalled smartphones that will limit them to a 60% charge to avoid overheating. The update for South Korean users will start from September 20.
