Digital employee named 'Amelia' will be employed by the Enfield Council in London later this year to answer customer queries. Created by US-based company IPsoft, the virtual assistant can analyse natural language, understand context, apply logic, learn, resolve problems and even sense emotions. If Amelia cannot answer a question, it calls the human colleagues and learns from them.
