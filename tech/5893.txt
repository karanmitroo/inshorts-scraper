American cloud computing company Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff said on Friday that his company won't make a bid to buy Twitter because it was not the right fit. Following the announcement, Twitter shares fell as much as 8.5% to $16.28, while Salesforce shares rose by 6% to $74.91 per share. Salesforce was one of the last remaining bidders for Twitter.
