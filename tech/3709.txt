Japan's largest toilet maker Toto has opened a high-tech experiential showroom called 'Concept 190' in San Francisco, where it has invited people to pee and poo to experience its different toilet seats. On entering the bathroom, the lights turn on and the toilet seat lifts up automatically. During the demo, space sceneries are also projected on the bathroom walls.
