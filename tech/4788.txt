California-based startup Motiv has created a water-resistant smart ring that tracks users' activity, heart rate and sleep. The titanium-encased wearable also measures steps taken, calories burned and distance covered and shares it to a connected iOS app. Priced at $199 (â‚¹13,600), Motiv Ring claims a battery life of up to five days on a 90-minute charge.
