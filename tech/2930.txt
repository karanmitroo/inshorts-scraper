The government has launched a new initiative called 'Tele-Law', which will provide free legal assistance to people in rural areas, through video conferencing. Training will also be provided to village women, who will act as paralegal volunteers for villagers. Government-appointed lawyers will provide advice and training on issues like women and child rights, domestic violence and land disputes.
