The verified Twitter account of fast-food chain McDonald's on Thursday posted a tweet against US President Donald Trump, claiming that he has "tiny hands". The tweet, which had been pinned, was deleted nearly 20 minutes after it was posted. Refuting rumours that the tweet had mistakenly been posted by one of its employees, McDonald's said its account had been compromised.
