Hyperloop One on Thursday successfully conducted the first public test of its high-speed transport system which achieved 187km/h speed in 1.1 seconds in Nevada, US. Brainchild of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the system will help people travel in pods running through a vacuum tube. It claims to cover a 616-kilometre distance between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 30 minutes.
