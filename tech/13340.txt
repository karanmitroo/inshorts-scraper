Engineer Andreas Hammar built a "Sweat Machine" for UNICEF that squeezes the sweat from people's clothes and then purifies the liquid to create drinking water, as a part of UNICEF Sweden's campaign to raise awareness of lack of clean water in many parts of the world. The creators said more than 1,000-people have "drunk other's sweat" in Gothenburg city.
