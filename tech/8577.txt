Gamer Chloe Desmoineaux has turned a tube of lipstick into a trigger for playing the popular first-person shooter video game Counter-Strike. The lipstick is connected to the computer using a Makey Makey kit, that enables users to turn everyday objects into touchpads, and acts as a weapon trigger when raised to the lips. Notably, Desmoineaux calls the new game Lipstrike.
