A US startup has developed glowing plants that provide natural light without electricity. The glowing plant uses DNA from luminous living organisms like fireflies and other bacteria. These DNAs are collected and imbibed into real plants which glow in the dark. These plants are made using synthetic biology and a special software called Genome Compiler.
