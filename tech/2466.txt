Technology major Microsoft has taken over at least 70 different domain names used by hacking group Fancy Bear in the past year. The domain names including 'livemicrosoft.net' and 'rsshotmail.com' violated Microsoft's trademarks and were used by hackers to communicate with malware installed on users' computers. Fancy Bear is believed to be associated with Russian military intelligence agency GRU.
