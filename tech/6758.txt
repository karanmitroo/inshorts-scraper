Norwegian startup 'No Isolation' has developed a robot that enables children recovering from long-term illness to attend school and communicate with friends from their sickbed. The avatar robot can be placed on a desk at school and can be controlled from home using cameras, microphones, and speakers, allowing the children to avoid social isolation caused by long-term absence.
