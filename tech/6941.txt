Google Ventures' Founder Bill Maris has quit the venture capital firm, and will be replaced by one of his deputies, David Krane. When asked for the reason, he said, "If it (GV) weren’t in great shape, that would be the wrong time to leave. I’m leaving because everything is great." Interestingly, Maris didn't hold a board seat at the firm.
