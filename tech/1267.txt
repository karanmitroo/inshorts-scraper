Google on Friday served its employees an 'Android Burger' which had cheese below the patty. This comes after Google CEO Sundar Pichai responded to a user's tweet, saying he will "drop everything else" and address the burger emoji issue. The user had tweeted how Google places the cheese underneath while Apple puts it on top in the burger emoji.
