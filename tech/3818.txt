Google's Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil has said that computers will soon have human-level intelligence and help humankind become "funnier" and "sexier". "We're really going to exemplify all the things that we value in humans to a greater degree," he added. Kurzweil also predicted that by 2029 human brains will be fitted with computers and connected to a cloud.
