Two artists, Michael Farrell and Cliff Haynes, have made a working camera using 32,000 plastic straws in place of a lens. The 'Straw Camera' has straws arranged in honeycomb fashion inside a wooden box and takes photos that resemble pointillist artwork. Each straw has its own hue and density, which contributes to the look of the final image.
