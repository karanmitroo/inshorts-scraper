Social media giant Facebook has bought conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup Ozlo for an undisclosed amount to boost its own AI system. The startup will help Facebook Messenger build a virtual assistant for users. This comes after Facebook shut down one of its Artificial Intelligence systems after chatbots programmed to converse in English started speaking in their own language.
