Snapchat has taken down a filter it had introduced on Tuesday after allegations that the filter promotes racial stereotypes against Asians. The filter featured a caricature-like face with squinty eyes, which a Twitter user called "the most overly racist filter ever”. Meanwhile, Snapchat has said the filter was Anime-inspired and was "meant to be playful".
