A viral content website, Dose, on Saturday started a Facebook live-stream of a charging Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, hoping to see it explode. "How long until it explodes?" the website asked on the live-stream, which has garnered over 5.3 million views so far. Notably, Samsung has recalled its Note 7 smartphones globally over battery explosions.
