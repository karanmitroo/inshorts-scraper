Ride-hailing startup Uber has reportedly shortlisted Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Meg Whitman as one of its six CEO candidates. The startup is expected to name a new leader to succeed Travis Kalanick by early September. Other female tech leaders like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Arianna Huffington, and ex-Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer are also said to be in contention for the post.
