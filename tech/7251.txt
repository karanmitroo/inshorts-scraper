The US Border Patrol Agents apprehended two juveniles crossing the US-Canadian Border illegally last week while they were playing the Pokémon GO game. "Both juveniles were so captivated by their Pokémon GO games that they lost track of where they were", an officer said. They were later reunited with their mothers at a nearby border patrol station, the agency added.
