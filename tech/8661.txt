The US Justice Department on Monday postponed the hearing in the Apple-FBI case as the FBI said it may not need Apple's assistance to unlock the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. It said that an outside party may possibly unlock the iPhone. The Justice Department added that it would file a status report by April 5.
