The websites and databases of seven Indian missions in Europe and Africa were reportedly hacked and the data from their servers were put online on Monday. Details including names, email IDs, phone numbers and even passport numbers of over 750 Indians were leaked online. One of the hackers said that the hack was committed as Indian Embassy's security was poor.
