Former Apple Senior Vice President of iOS Scott Forstall has revealed how Steve Jobs used to "scam" the company's cafeteria. Jobs always insisted paying for Forstall's lunch and payments at Apple's cafeteria were processed through scanning badges and deducted from employees' salaries. Jobs later revealed, "I only get paid $1 a year. I don't know who's paying every time!"
