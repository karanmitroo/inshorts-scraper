Aimed at engaging fans in the upcoming Wimbledon tournament, Twitter announced a new set of Wimbledon-themed emoji via Serena Williams' timeline on Saturday. Twitter said it wants to create "a friendly battle of conversation" among fans. The '#Wimbledon' brings up a tennis racquet. #TheQueue, #TheHill (Henman Hill) or #TheWorld (outside SW19) will let users broadcast where they're watching from.
