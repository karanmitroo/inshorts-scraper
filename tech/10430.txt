NASA, along with a Brooklyn-based company Honeybee Robotics, is reportedly working on developing a shotgun to be used on asteroids in space. The device will be designed to check if an asteroid is strong enough to be landed upon for a probe. The space shotgun will measure an asteroid's overall surface strength by firing balls at it.
