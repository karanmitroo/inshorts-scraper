Snapchat's 26-year-old Co-founder Evan Spiegel on Saturday got married to 34-year-old supermodel Miranda Kerr after dating her for over two years. The couple, who got engaged in July last year, first met at a Louis Vuitton dinner in New York in 2014. This is Kerr's second marriage after previously being wed to British actor Orlando Bloom for three years.
