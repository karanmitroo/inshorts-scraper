Elizabeth Holmes, CEO of US-based blood analysis startup Theranos, presented a new device called 'miniLab' on Monday which claims to run up to 40 tests on 160 microlitres of blood sample. She also presented clinical data for 11 tests which has been sent to authorities for validation. Earlier in July, Theranos was sued for inaccurate results on its blood tests.
