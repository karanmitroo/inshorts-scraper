Electronics major Samsung has responded to a hacker group's video that shows how the iris scanner on its latest flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 can be hacked. "Although the video appears simple, it is hard to see that happening in real life...You need a camera that can capture infrared light, which is no longer available in the market," said Samsung's spokesperson.
