Italy-based fashion company Stone Island has made a sweater called Ice Knit that changes colour when exposed to cold temperature. It consists of an outer layer of thermo-sensitive yarn which changes colour from yellow-to-orange or emerald-to-military-green depending on the intensity of the cold. The inner layer is made of wool to prevent body heat from interfering with the colour change.
