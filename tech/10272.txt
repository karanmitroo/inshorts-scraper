According to a paper published in the US National Academy of Sciences, greenhouse gases, overfishing and localised pollution are increasing the risk of food chain collapse in the oceans. The oceans are getting warmer, becoming more acidic and having less oxygen making it difficult for the species to adapt to climate change and sea levels to rise.
