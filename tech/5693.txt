Treating photodetectors, used in smartphone cameras, with UV light improves their frequency response, according to a study by Moscow-based researchers. They found that exposing a polymer-based photodetector incorporated with zinc oxide nanoparticles to UV light for 30 seconds increased its sensitivity nearly 5,000 times. The process is "quick, cheap and efficient", the researchers claimed.
