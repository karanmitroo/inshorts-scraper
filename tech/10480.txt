Google is set to collaborate with the Indian Railways to provide free high-speed WiFi across 400 railway stations in India. For the initiative, named 'Project Nilgiri', Google will use the Google Fibre Project, popular for providing fast internet in the USA. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed within the next 4 months.
