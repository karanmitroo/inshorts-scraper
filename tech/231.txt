In an interview, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said, "what you think is tasteless is not necessarily what someone else would think is tasteless." Wojcicki was asked why YouTuber Logan Paul's channel was not deleted after he posted videos of alleged suicide victim and a dead rat being tasered. It wasn't enough that a creator's video is considered tasteless, she added.
