In order to replace defective airbags, Japanese carmaker Nissan will recall 9,000 units of its compact car Micra and mid-sized sedan Sunny in India. The company will replace safety airbags made by its supplier Tataka (covers cars manufactured between 2008 to 2012). The replace won't cost customers anything, and the notifications will start going out soon, said a company spokesperson.
