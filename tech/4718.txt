Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been holding weekly meetings at the Menlo Park headquarters for a decade, where he shares the upcoming product details with 16,000 employees, including interns. Facebook employees are warned in advance that they could be fired for leaking any information. In 2015, Zuckerberg fired one of the employees for leaking news of Facebook's messaging assistant.
