Indonesiaâ€™s first domestically made satellite, Lapan A2/Orari, will reportedly be launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on September 27. The multi-spectral, remote-sensing satellite is a successor to Lapan A1/Tubsat launched in 2007, again from India. The satellite will orbit the Earth 14 times a day and will monitor ships and sea movements in Indonesian waters.
