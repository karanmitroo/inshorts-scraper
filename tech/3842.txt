Stanford scientists have created a flexible plastic electrode using a soup thickener. The team used plastic polymers and added the soup ingredient to create a conductive material. The material with "uncompromised electrical performance and high stretchability" could one day be used in better brain-monitoring electronics and smart clothing embedded with heart sensors, LEDs, said the lab director.
