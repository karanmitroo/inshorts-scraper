WikiLeaks on Friday posted on Twitter that it will start a rival service because of “cyber feudalism”. This comes after Twitter banned Milo Yiannopoulos, technology editor of a news site, for allegedly leading an online troll against Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey replied saying, "We don't ban people for expressing their thoughts. Targeted abuse... is not allowed".
