Security solutions firm FireEye's report has claimed that India is a “strategic target” for cyber crime, with an estimate of 38% Indian organisations being exposed to targeted attacks in the first half of 2015. This shows a 23% increase from 2014. The firm claimed this surge owed to India digitising its sensitive information with projects like Digital India.
