A US-based startup has developed a â‚¹15,000 'Volterman' smart wallet with GPS and a camera to help track down the thief in case it is stolen. When the wallet is in 'lost' mode, it takes a picture of anybody who opens it and sends it to the owner's smartphone. It also has a battery pack and can offer WiFi hotspots.
