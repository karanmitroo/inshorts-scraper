San Francisco-based startup Fove has developed eye-tracking for virtual reality (VR) that  "allows users to go inside the world that's behind the display", according to the Co-founder Yuka Kojima. The technology can have various applications like playing video games or enabling disabled people to control devices using their eyes. It could also be helpful for training pilots and surgeons.
