Facebook has started testing a feature which requires users to upload their photos for account verification. The company confirmed the same and said it was intended to help "catch suspicious activity at various points of interaction on the site" including creating accounts or sending friend requests. Facebook is yet to comment on when it will roll out the feature globally.
