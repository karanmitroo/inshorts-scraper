South Korea has launched a pilot called 'Pink Light', which lets pregnant women get seats in the trains through a bluetooth-connected beacon. Light-up signs have been installed in the Korean trains which illuminate when a pregnant woman with the beacon comes near a seat.  Once the system detects the woman is seated, the light switches off.
