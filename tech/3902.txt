Public schools and certain businesses with solar panels in the UK will reportedly face an 800% raise in taxes, as per a law that goes into effect in April. Subsidies for solar farms and incentives for homeowners to use solar panels have also been cut. UK's Solar Trade Association called the planned tax policy "absurd" and "nonsensical".
