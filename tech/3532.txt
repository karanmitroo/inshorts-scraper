Chinese delivery giant Shentong has hired robots to sort packages at its warehouse, which it claims halves the costs required to employ humans. The robots handle 2 lakh packages a day, each weighing up to 8 kg, at 9.8 feet per second. It reportedly takes the robots three hours to sort as many parcels as humans would in five hours.
