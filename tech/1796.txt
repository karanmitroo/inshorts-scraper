US-based startup Moona has created a â‚¹25,000 smart device that regulates pillow temperature. It includes a foam pad which is tethered to a water container that regulates the water's temperature and sends it through a pipe in the pad. The app connected device also features a built-in sleep tracker and claims to rouse the user by warming up the pad.
