Crowdfunding website Indiegogo has shut down the Canada-based Frank phone's crowdfunding campaign as it violated the website's "Terms of Use". The website claimed that it had received reports that a nearly identical version of the smartphone was already available on China's e-commerce platform Alibaba. Indiegogo also confirmed that the backers of the smartphone will be refunded.
