Facebook shut down its Snapchat-like app Lifestage designed for teenagers on August 4 from the App Store. The app, which was released almost one year ago, allowed users with age limit of 21 to connect with other students. According to Facebook, the app hadn't been updated for months and never managed to reach the top charts during its short lifespan.
