Technology major Samsung's spinoff startup has developed a $119 smart waist belt that measures a user's waist size, counts steps taken and tracks sitting time. The collected data is available on a dedicated app for the belt, which also monitors overeating patterns. Made for both men and women, the belt has a battery life of up to 20 days.
