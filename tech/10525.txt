Microsoft is reportedly planning to make its internal tool for running hackathons public by 2016 to help organizations better administer hackathons. It will initially provide the tool, called ‘Hackathon interactive project site,’ to select colleges for a test drive. The tool enabled 13,000 employees to simultaneously work on 1,700 projects in Microsoft's annual hackathon event held in July.
