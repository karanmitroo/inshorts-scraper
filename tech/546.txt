UK-based entrepreneurs have designed a fitness app Sweatcoin that pays users to be physically active using accelerometers and GPS location. The app, which is currently active in the US, UK, and Ireland, pays digital "sweatcoins" for the number of steps users take daily as measured on their smartphones. The coins can be exchanged for fitness-related products and other services.
