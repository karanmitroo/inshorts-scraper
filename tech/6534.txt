Apple has begun rolling out personalised music playlists to Apple Music subscribers on iOS 10 and Mac OS Sierra, which are in beta-test mode. The 'My New Music Mix' playlist offers 25 tracks selected based on users' listening preferences, with new tunes updated once every week. This comes ahead of Apples's expected iPhone launch event on September 7.
