Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp is reportedly testing a feature to allow group administrators to restrict the activities of other members of the group. Once restricted, other members will not be able to send messages, photographs, videos, documents or voice messages. They will have to use the 'Message Admin' button to post a message or share media to the group.
