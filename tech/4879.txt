Swedish carmaker Volvo has launched a 'Red Key' that restricts the car's top speed to 120 kmph and makes the adaptive cruise control maintain maximum distance from the car in front. The maximum volume of the audio is also reduced and features like distance alert and traffic sign recognition are permanently activated when the car is driven with Red Key.
