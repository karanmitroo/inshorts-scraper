Tech giant Google's name is a misspelling of the word "googol," which is a mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. The name reflects Founders Larry and Sergey's mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of information on the web. The search engine is celebrating its 18th birthday on Tuesday.
