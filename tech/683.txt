SpaceX has reportedly lost the 'secret' satellite Zuma commissioned by the US government after it failed to reach the orbit. The Strategic Command, which monitors man-made objects in space, said it did not track any new satellites since the launch. Reports suggest that the payload did not separate from the Falcon 9's upper stage and fell back to Earth.
