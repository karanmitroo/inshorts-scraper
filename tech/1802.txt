US President Donald Trump on Wednesday blocked a Chinese government-financed firm's acquisition of US-based technology firm Lattice Semiconductor citing national security. "Credible evidence leads me to believe the buyers might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the US," he said. Following Trump's announcement, the company said it was cancelling the proposed sale.
