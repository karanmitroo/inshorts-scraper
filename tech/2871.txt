Dutch startup Hugsy has raised over â‚¹1 crore in seed funding via the Leapfunder European angel investor network for a smart baby blanket. The blanket provides babies with their mother's smell, heartbeat, and the feeling of being hugged, claims Hugsy COO Jody van den Tillaart. The blanket can reportedly relieve stress and promote deeper sleep in babies.
