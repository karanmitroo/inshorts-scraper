Google has completed the $1.1-billion deal with electronics company HTC, under which Google acquired part of HTC's engineering and design teams. The deal also includes employees that have worked on Google's Pixel smartphones. It was announced in September last year and also included a non-exclusive license for HTC intellectual property.
