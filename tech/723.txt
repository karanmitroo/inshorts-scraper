The term 'Robotics' was coined by Russian-born American science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov and it was used for the first time in his short story called 'Liar!' which was published in 1941. Asimov also proposed the three "Laws of Robotics" in 1942 which describe the definition and characteristics of a robot. Notably, Isaac Asimov was born on January 2, 1920.
