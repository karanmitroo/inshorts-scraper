Facebook has apologized to its users for its automated "Year in Review" feature, which posts a series of pictures from the past year on the users' timelines, with the tagline "it has been a great year". The feature came under scathing attack for its "inadvertent algorithmic cruelty" which made many users relive the deaths of their loved ones.
