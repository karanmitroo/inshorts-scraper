South Korean electronics giant Samsung has trolled Google by releasing a video touting the quality of the screens of its Galaxy smartphones. This comes after users reported Pixel 2 XL's screens turning grey within a week of the device's usage which suggests burn-in. Samsung captioned the video, "Top tech reviewers share their thoughts on the amazing Galaxy screen".
