Apple CEO Tim Cook on Sunday said that the company will not take a cue from Microsoft's Surface tablet to converge the iPad and the MacBook. This comes in the wake of Cook earlier stating that the iPad Pro replaces PCs. However, he clarified that he doesnâ€™t consider MacBooks and Windows-based PCs to be the same.
