Israeli artist Eyal Gever has launched a project titled '#Laugh' that will let people send sounds of their laughter to be 3D-printed in the International Space Station. People can download the #Laugh app to record their laugh, and the laugh voted the best will then be beamed up to the ISS, 3D-printed and ejected from the station into the orbit.
