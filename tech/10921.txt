The astronomers of the Open University, UK have discovered the first ever family of five stars bound to each other by gravity. This "truly exotic star system" is located around 250 light-years away from the Milkyway galaxy in the constellation of Ursa Major. There could sometimes be five Suns of different brightnesses lighting up the landscape, a researcher said.
