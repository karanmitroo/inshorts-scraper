In a bid to compete with Amazonâ€™s delivery drones, search giant Google has patented self-driving delivery trucks. Once the truck reaches the customers, they are expected to unlock their delivery locker with a code. After the item is retrieved, the truck would drive off to the next delivery spot. Notably, Google's self-driving systems can be considered "drivers" under law.
