Product comparison website Finder has launched 'iBag2' which locks itself if shoppers exceed their spending goals. The $5,000 bag is equipped with a 10,000 mAh power bank, vibration motors and LED lights which light up blue and vibrate each time a user's wallet is taken out as a reminder of spending goals. The bag also sends reminders for reapplying sunscreen.
