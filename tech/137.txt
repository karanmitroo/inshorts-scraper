World's richest man Jeff Bezos on Tuesday revealed installation of the 500-feet-tall clock, which will keep time for 10,000 years, has begun in the US. The '10,000 Year Clock', is designed to tick once a year, while another hand will advance once every 100 years. It will be powered by day and night thermal cycles, and synchronised at solar noon.
