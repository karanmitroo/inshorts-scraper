India is planning to set up a satellite tracking and imaging centre in southern Vietnam, giving the country access to pictures from Indian earth observation satellites that cover the region, including China and the South China Sea. The state-run ISRO will set up the data reception centre in Ho Chi Minh to monitor Indian satellite launches, the Indian officials said.
