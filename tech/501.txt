A memo written by the chief lawyer of Snapchat's parent company Snap, which threatened the employees against leaking information, was leaked this week. "You will lose your job and we will pursue any and all legal remedies against you," it read. It also warned the employees that the government could put them in jail for leaking confidential information.
