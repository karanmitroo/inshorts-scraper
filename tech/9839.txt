The BangladeshÂ Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has directed telecom service providers to block Twitter, Skype and video calling service IMO in the country with immediate effect. Earlier in November, Facebook, Viber and WhatsApp were blocked in Bangladesh after the death penalties of two opposition leaders were upheld by the Supreme Court. However, it lifted the Facebook ban on December 10.
