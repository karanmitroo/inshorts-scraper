A Chinese startup has developed 'Jackom R3 Smart Ring', which acts as a smart ID card to unlock doors, smartphones, make payments and transfer data at 106 kbps. Connected through an app, the $19 ring also saves private information including accounts, schedule and memos. The waterproof and dust-proof ring is available in different sizes and does not require charging.
