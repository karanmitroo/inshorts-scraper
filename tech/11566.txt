India Saturday launched IRNSS-1D, fourth of its seven satellites that would form a navigation satellite network, on board PSLV-C27 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. PSLV-C27 successfully placed the satellite, weighing 1,425kg, in a sub-geostationary orbit. After injection into the preliminary orbit, the two solar panels of IRNSS-1D were deployed in quick succession.
