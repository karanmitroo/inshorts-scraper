Sony has filed a patent for a bracelet that recognises voices to help users remember names of people they meet. The bracelet starts recording when it detects a handshake-like movement and stores the sound profile with the associated name on the user's smartphone. On hearing a previously stored voice, the name of the person is displayed on the smartphone screen.
