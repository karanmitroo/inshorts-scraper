Microsoft has launched a new Bing app for Android that focuses on common searches people need to access while on the go. It features a barcode scanner for price comparisons and a tool to find the cheapest gas prices. Microsoft has also updated its iOS Bing app, where users can browse deals, sorted by proximity, right from the homepage.
