Facebook's Director of AI (artificial intelligence) Research Yann LeCun has claimed that world's first robot citizen Sophia is not intelligent, has no feelings and "zero understanding of what it says." His comment came in response to Sophia's tweet which said it was "hurt" by LeCun's comment around its AI. LeCun had previously stated that the humanoid's AI is "complete bullsh*t".
