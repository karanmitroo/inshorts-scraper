Microsoft on Wednesday announced that it will bring GNU project's Unix-like command line user interface 'Bash shell' to Windows. The release would let developers execute Bash scripts and Linux command-line tools on Windows. For this, Microsoft collaborated with Canonical, the creator of Ubuntu Linux, and built a new Linux-like infrastructure called 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' within Windows.
