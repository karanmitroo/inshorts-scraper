Google is experimenting with allowing celebrities and brands to directly post to its search results page. This new format will let any celebrity or organization have a dedicated Twitter-like feed built right into Googleâ€™s search engine. Further, users will be able to share individual posts directly from the search results page, but not like or comment on any of them.
