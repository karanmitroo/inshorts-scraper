Reacting to privacy concerns regarding Aadhaar, Infosys Co-founder and former UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani has said, "The biggest privacy risk is your smartphone". He added that a person's location, messages and call records can be obtained on real-time basis through a smartphone. "Aadhaar is a sporadic thingâ€”it is episodic, for instance, when I go and open an account," Nilekani said.
