Responding to a user's tweet on Google's burger emoji, CEO Sundar Pichai on Saturday tweeted, "Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday:) if folks can agree on the correct way to do this!" User had pointed out how Google places the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top in the burger emoji.
