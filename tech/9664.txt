A study by Facebook and marketing agency Neuro-Insight reportedly found that the consumers performed better for memory encoding from Facebook advertisements than television's. In the study, a group of users was shown a TV show with ads while another group browsed their Facebook news feeds. On the next day both the groups watched the same ads during a TV show.
