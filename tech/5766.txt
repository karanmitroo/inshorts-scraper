British physicist Professor Stephen Hawking at the inauguration of Cambridge University's artificial intelligence (AI) centre on Wednesday said that AI will either "transform" society or destroy it. "Success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation...but it could also be the last unless we learn how to avoid the risks," he said.
