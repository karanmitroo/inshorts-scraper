The Income Tax Department has activated Aadhaar and net banking-based e-filing verification system for taxpayers to file the first appeal before a tax officer, similar to the online filing of Income Tax Returns. Under this, the electronic verification code to validate the appeal forms would be generated using the Aadhaar database or the net banking identity of the filer.
