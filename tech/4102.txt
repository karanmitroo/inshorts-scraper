US-based researchers have created an atomic force microscope (AFM), about 1 square centimetre in size, on a single chip. The design consists of a printed circuit board and sensors which move across surfaces to map out its contours, translating the microscopic movements into images. The advancement would reduce the price of AFM systems by several thousand dollars, the researchers said.
