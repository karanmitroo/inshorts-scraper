Grooveshark, a music sharing service established in 2006, announced it was shutting down on Thursday. The move is part of a settlement Grooveshark reached in several lawsuits regarding music piracy. The service had millions of users at its peak but faced legal issues for not possessing licenses from rights holders for the vast amount of music on it.
