The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to launch record 103 satellites in a single flight in February first week. As many as 100 of the satellites to be launched are from foreign nations. Earlier, ISRO had said it will launch 83 satellites but the launch got delayed due to the addition of more satellites, an official said.
