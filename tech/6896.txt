Researchers from Saudi Arabia claim to have created lightbulbs that can transmit data at a record speed of 2 GB per second, about 40 times faster than existing Li-Fi devices. Usual methods of Visible Light Communication-based Li-Fi technology transmit data using LEDs, which have a limited bandwidth. The researchers have developed a nanocrystal-based converter that enables faster data transmission.
