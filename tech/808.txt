German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp AG has developed elevators called 'Multi' which can operate without cables, and is starting trials for the first system. The elevator can move up and across shafts with the help of magnets instead of being attached to ropes and pulleys. The lift is expected to make its debut at OVG's East Side Tower in Berlin in 2020.
