India's latest communication satellite GSAT-18 was successfully launched on Thursday by the heavy duty Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou in French Guiana. The launch was deferred by 24 hours owing to bad weather conditions. ISRO's GSAT-18 will add to India's fleet of 14 operational telecommunication satellites and is the 20th Indian satellite launched by the European Space Agency (ESA).
