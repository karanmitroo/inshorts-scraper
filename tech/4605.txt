Facebook has confirmed that it is testing a fake news filtering tool in Germany, addressing the country's concerns that fake stories could influence its upcoming federal election. The tool will enable Facebook's Germany users to flag potentially fake stories. If found fake by Facebook's fact checkers, the story will be marked as 'disputed' in users' news feed.
