French presidential candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon recently spoke simultaneously at seven rallies using a 3D technology. While he was physically present at one of the rallies, his image was projected to the crowds at six other locations at the same time. The first round of voting for French presidential elections took place on Sunday.
