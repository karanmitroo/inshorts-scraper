Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah has inaugurated an online geospatial platform for tracking the property tax collection across Bengaluru. This will enable residents to know the property tax they have paid over the years. The colour green on any property indicates tax being paid since 2009. Pink would mean a default for a year, and deep pink would indicate a long-term defaulter.
