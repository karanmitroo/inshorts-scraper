Microsoft on Tuesday announced "Surface as a Service" program, a new initiative that will allow businesses to lease Surface devices, alongside subscriptions to its Office 365 and Windows 10 products. The company said that this move will help in expanding Surface's footprint in the enterprise and will also allow its customers to benefit from access to the latest hardware.
