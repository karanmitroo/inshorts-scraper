A British man has created a website called 'SorryForTheInconvenience.co.uk' that aggregates the apologies posted by UK rail operators to their Twitter pages whenever there is a delay or service disruption. There have been over 2,70,000 apologies this year so far, with major train operators like Southern Rail and Great Western averaging over 100 apologies daily.
