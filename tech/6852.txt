Finland has reportedly started real-world testing of autonomous self-driving mini buses on its public roads in the capital Helsinki. The 12-seater EasyMile EZ10 autonomous mini buses, which are intended as short-range shuttles for people, will run for almost a month during the test. Interestingly, road laws in Finland do not require vehicles to have a driver.
