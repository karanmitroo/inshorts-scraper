Apple has reportedly got the rifle emoji removed from Unicode's list of new emoji candidates for 2016. Unicode is the technical organisation in charge of selecting and overseeing emojis, where Apple is one of the largest member companies. The organisation's committee decided not to mark rifle as an emoji, but to add it as a black and white symbol.
