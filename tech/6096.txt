Researchers from the Stanford University have developed a low-cost, plastic-based fabric that  allows a human to feel up to three degrees cooler than wearing cotton clothes. The fabric does not trap the body heat and allows it to pass through in the form of infrared radiation. The fabric is currently solid and flat, but misses a texture.
