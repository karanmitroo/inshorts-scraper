US-based startup Ocean Aero has created a new 13.5 feet long drone called 'Submaran S10' that does not need any external fuel and is wholly powered by the solar and the wind energy. It can function both as a sailboat-like water drone and also as an underwater submarine. The self-driving drone can dive to the depths of about 660 feet.
