India on Monday successfully test-fired Agni-V, its longest range surface-to-surface nuclear-capable missile, from Abdul Kalam Island off Odisha coast. The 17-metre-tall missile can carry a nuclear warhead of about 1.5 tonnes to a distance of over 5,000 km. Notably, India is the sixth country after France, China, Russia, USA, and UK to have a missile with over 5,000 km range.
