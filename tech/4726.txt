Google CEO Sundar Pichai, while speaking at his alma mater IIT Kharagpur on Thursday, said that getting into elite institutions does not guarantee success in life. "It's remarkable to be at IIT, but later in life you see that people from all walks of life do well," he added. Pichai also said that academics is very important but not everything.
