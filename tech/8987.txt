Berlin-based online music streaming service SoundCloud has launched Pulse, a dedicated mobile application for artists and creators, on the iOS platform. The same was launched on the Android platform in November last year. The app allows the artists and creators to upload sounds either publicly or privately and get up to date statistics on the performance of those sounds.
