A 31-year-old Singapore-based man has been sentenced to 16 months in jail for scamming 15 iPhone 7 Plus buyers to make nearly $7,000 in profits. The man promised to sell the iPhones to potential buyers if they paid a deposit on Carousell, an online consumer-to-consumer marketplace. After receiving the funds, the man would cut off communication with the buyer.
