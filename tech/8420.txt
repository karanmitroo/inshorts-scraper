Twenty-four-year-old American, Ian Burkhart, who was left paralysed five years back, has regained control over his right hand and fingers because of a chip that was implanted in his brain two years ago. The chip transmits Burkhart's thoughts to his hand muscles bypassing the spinal cord, making it the first time a paralysed patient regained body control through brain signals.
