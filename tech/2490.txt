Social media giant Facebook's R&D division Building 8 is reportedly working on modular smartphones with detachable parts. The company has filed for a patent that details a "modular electromagnetic device" that will let users switch out "outdated" components. Building 8 is led by Regina Dugan, a former Google executive who oversaw the development of its now-scrapped modular smartphone Project Ara.
