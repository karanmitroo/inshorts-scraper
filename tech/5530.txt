Texas-based startup Arovia has developed a high-resolution 24-inch screen that collapses & expands like an umbrella. Called the Spontaneous Pop-up Display (SPUD), the device uses a flexible polymer that can't get cracked and is also washable. SPUD can be connected to a smartphone, tablet or laptop and has four times more screen area than a 13-inch laptop screen.
