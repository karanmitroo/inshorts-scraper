According to investigators, the Bangladesh Bank heist occurred because it did not have a firewall and used second-hand, $10 switches. This comes after cyber criminals broke into the bankâ€™s system in February and made fraudulent transfers of $81 million to Philippines. Notably, this was one of the largest amounts stolen from a bank at one go.
