Scientists at Harvard University have developed a flat, electronic, artificial eye that automatically stretches to focus and correct several factors contributing to blurry images. It can simultaneously focus, control aberrations caused by astigmatism, as well as perform image shift, researchers said. According to them, the metalens can change its focus in real time, just like the human eye.
