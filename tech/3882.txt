Pokémon franchise manager, The Pokémon Company, has recalled its Pikachu and Monster Ball themed mobile batteries citing defective manufacturing causing abnormal heat generation. The heat generation even caused some of the batteries to release smoke. While the batteries were available only across Pokémon franchise stores in Japan, they have been found to be on sale on Amazon and eBay overseas.
