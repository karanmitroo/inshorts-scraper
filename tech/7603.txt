In a pilot program, Seoul has installed traffic signs to alert pedestrians of the danger of using smartphones while walking on the street. The signs have been put in five areas which witnessed high cases of smartphone-related accidents of citizens aged between 10-30 years. One of the signs reads "Walk Safely" to alert pedestrians looking at their smartphones while walking.
