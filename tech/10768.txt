Google has announced that it would restrict Chrome add-ons if the extensions deployed "deceptive tactics" to dupe its browser's users. In the latest move to tighten Chrome's extension ecosystem, Google will disable inline installation for extensions linked to deceptive sites. Inline add-on installation was being supported by the company since Chrome 15, a version that appeared in October 2011.
