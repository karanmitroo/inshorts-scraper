At the PAX East gaming festival in Boston, peripheral maker Logitech created a pixelated display, dubbed ‘The Great Wall of Logitech G’, using 160 light-up G810 keyboards. The multi-colour gaming keyboards, where each key acted as a pixel, allow users to personalize the backlight on every individual key and create preset layouts for different games and controller setups.
