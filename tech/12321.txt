The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a circular to all affiliated schools demanding arrangements for students to watch Mangal-yaan's entry into the Mars orbit live on Wednesday. Doordarshan will telecast the historic event live from 6:45 a.m onwards. If the mission succeeds, India will be the only country to send a probe to Mars in its first attempt.
