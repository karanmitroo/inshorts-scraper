German sportswear manufacturer Adidas on Wednesday announced that it will open a robot-staffed 'Speedfactory' in the United States by the second half of 2017. The 74,000-square-foot factory will employ 160 people to oversee the production of 50,000 pairs of shoes per year. The factory will lead to "endless opportunities for customisation", said Adidas in a statement.
