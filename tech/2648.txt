Geothermal startup Dandelion, which was born at Google's parent company Alphabet's accelerator X, has left Alphabet to become an independent company. Dandelion's geothermal systems let users pump heat out of their house, into the ground. Alphabet owns some equity in the company in exchange for time, resources, and funding it gave to Dandelion.
