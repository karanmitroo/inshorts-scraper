The Raspberry Pi Foundation has launched the Raspberry Pi 3 microcomputer for $35. The third-generation model features Bluetooth 4.0, built-in WiFi support and a faster 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 processor. The low-cost, credit card-sized device was first launched exactly four years ago as an easy point-of-entry for budding programmers and can be plugged into a computer monitor or TV.
