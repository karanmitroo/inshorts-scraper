Technology giant Google has acquired UK-based startup Redux focused on technology that uses vibrations to turn screens into speakers. The startup also uses vibrations to simulate touchable buttons on 2D displays. Redux developed technology that eliminates the need for small speakers in mobile phones to free up space, the startup said on its now-defunct website.
