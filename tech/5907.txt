Three US airlines are fitting their planes with fire-containment bags capable of sealing up an overheating smartphone or laptop battery to prevent a disaster mid-air. The red-coloured bags typically sell for $1,800 (₹1,20,000) each and can withstand temperatures of up to 1,760° Celsius. This follows the Federal Aviation Administration recording 23 incidents of overheating batteries in 2016 so far.
