Dubai Police, IBM, and Google have developed a 'Robocop' prototype that was unveiled a Dubai's annual electronic trade show recently. The virtual assistant system uses Artificial Intelligence and can spot people from 10-20 metres of distance, approach them, and greet them. It is expected to be deployed at tourist attractions like Burj Khalifa by 2017, Dubai Police said.
