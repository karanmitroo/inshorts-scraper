Instagram on Wednesday extended the duration of video ads on its platform to 60 seconds from 30 seconds. The first companies to avail this service are T-Mobile and Warner Brothers. Earlier in September, Instagram had begun selling ads in 30 more countries in a bid to better monetise its platform. Notably, the general public can post only 15-second videos.
