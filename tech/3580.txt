Facebook's virtual reality unit Oculus VR has been sued for allegedly incorporating California-based startup ImmersiON-VRelia's patented technology into its Rift VR headset without authorisation. The patent referred to in the lawsuit describes a method of generating left and right perspectives in a 3D video game. Facebook had acquired Oculus for an estimated $3 billion in 2014.
