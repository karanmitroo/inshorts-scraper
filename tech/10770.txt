NASAâ€™s Deep Space Climate Observatory has captured the dark side of the moon, in a fully illuminated series of photographs taken by a camera aboard a NASA satellite. The images, which were taken on July 16, show a crater and a large plain called the Mare Moscoviense on the lunar surface as it moves across the sunlit Pacific Ocean.
