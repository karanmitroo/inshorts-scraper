Technology major Google is reportedly working on over-ear headphones with Bluetooth capabilities. The headphones will also have a built-in microphone for answering calls and a traditional audio cable for tethered listening. However, reports added that the headphones could also be an upgrade to existing headphones that Google issues to its employees.
