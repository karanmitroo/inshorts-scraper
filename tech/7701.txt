Microsoft has funded a software, developed by Dartmouth College professor Hany Farid, that can find and eliminate online extremist content. The software, which was unveiled on Friday, analyses online images, videos and audio files, and matches it to a database of known extremist content. If it matches, social media and technology companies can flag such content or remove it altogether.
