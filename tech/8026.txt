Nokia on Wednesday announced plans to enter the Android smartphone and tablet market. It revealed that HMD Global Oy will acquire the rights to use the 'Nokia' name on its Android smartphones and tablets for the next 10 years. This comes after Microsoft sold Nokia's feature phone business in a group deal that included HMD Global Oy and FIH Mobile.
