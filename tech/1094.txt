Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson on Friday showcased India's first-ever live 5G end-to-end demonstration. It was performed using Ericsson's 5G test bed and 5G New Radio, which delivered a 5.7 Gbps throughput and ultra-low latency of 3 milliseconds. The demonstration was organised as the government is planning to roll out the 5G network by 2020, Ericsson said.
