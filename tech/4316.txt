Police in Ohio, US have used data from a man's artificial pacemaker to charge him with burning his own home for insurance money. The cardiologist who reviewed the pacemaker's data concluded it was "improbable" that the man was able to pack a bag and exit through his bedroom window in a short period of time due to his medical conditions.
