'Azadi ki Udaan', a mobile app seeks to address questions of differently-abled women in rural areas. Jointly developed by SMRC and Inflexi Technology, the app provides information on domestic violence, government schemes, and rights of women with disabilities. Currently active in four states, the app is also linked to an interactive voice recording system to address women's queries.
