IBM has announced an industry-first initiative to build commercially available universal quantum computing systems. 'IBM Q' quantum systems and services would be delivered via the IBM Cloud platform. While IBM supercomputers, such as Watson, can help find patterns buried in vast amounts of existing data, quantum computers will deliver solutions to problems where patterns cannot be seen.
