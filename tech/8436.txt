Facebook Messenger has added Dropbox support, allowing users to share Dropbox files directly in their Messenger conversations. This is the first time Messenger has partnered with a cloud-based file sharing service. While photos and videos will appear instantly in-chat, non-visual files will be linked to the Dropbox mobile app. This will prevent Facebook from hosting PowerPoints and PDFs.
