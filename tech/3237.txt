A website for 'Hydra', the terrorist organisation in Marvel's Captain America has reportedly been hijacked to redirect visitors to US President Donald Trump's official White House page. The 'Hail Hydra' URL was originally registered in 2014 in Queensland, Australia. The fictional organisation is depicted as a Nazi cult and the phrase 'Hail Hydra' means pledging loyalty to the group.
