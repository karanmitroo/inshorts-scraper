Mobile network provider EE has unveiled plans to use drones and balloons to provide 4G coverage to UK's rural areas. The helium balloons, called 'Helikite', hover at a height of about 150 feet and can cover an area 4 kilometres wide. However, the drones can provide coverage over an area 2 kilometres wide for a few hours.
