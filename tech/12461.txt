According to a new report from Android Police, Google is reportedly working with Motorola on a 5.9-inch smartphone which will supposedly come with a fingerprint sensor. The size is unusually large for a smartphone, as most phablets fall into the 5.3-5.7-inch range. The device will reportedly launch with major US carriers in November.
