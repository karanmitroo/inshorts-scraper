A US-based startup has created a â‚¹16,000 smart ring called 'Token', which it claims can open doors, start cars, make credit card transactions and sign into computers. The startup has partnered with companies like MasterCard, Microsoft and Visa to allow the functions. The ring has a fingerprint sensor on the inside to authorise transactions with a tap of the finger.
