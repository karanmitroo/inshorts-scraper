Swedish home electronics major Electrolux is testing a "laundry Uber" where users can pay to clean their clothes at someone else's home. The company believes that sharing a washing machine will let users recover the cost of expensive equipment that stays idle most of the time. Electrolux has not said when this service will be launched to the public.
