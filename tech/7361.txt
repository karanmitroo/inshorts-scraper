Shares of a bankrupt company, 'Tweeter' Home Entertainment, surged by nearly 1000% after its stock symbol was confused with microblogging site Twitter's symbol at the time of its IPO in 2013. Launched 10 years ago in 2006, Twitter listed its shares under the ticker TWTR, while Tweeter's stocks were listed under TWTRQ, causing investors to buy the wrong shares.
