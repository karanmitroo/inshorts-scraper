British programmer Tom Scott has created a huge keyboard dedicated specifically to emojis. Built from 14 individual keyboards, the device accommodates over 1,000 emojis that are grouped in sections like faces, animals and hand gestures for easier access. Scott claims that the keyboard—which can be plugged into a laptop—features “every possible emoji.”
