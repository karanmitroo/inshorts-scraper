An iOS app, 'I Am Rich' was launched in 2008, with the only purpose of showing that the buyer could afford it. Sold for $999.99, the highest price for which an app can be distributed on the App Store, it showed a glowing red gem with the text "I am rich, I deserv it, I am good, healthy & successful".
