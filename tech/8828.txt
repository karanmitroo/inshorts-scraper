In a Facebook post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company has built an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that analyzed 15.6 billion satellite images to create population maps across 21.6 million square kilometers. By doing so, Facebook could understand where to send its solar-powered planes to provide internet access. These results will be shared openly for other organisations, he added.
