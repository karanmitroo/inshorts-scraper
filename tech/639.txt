Former Google engineer, James Damore, who was fired over an anti-diversity 'sexist' memo last year, has filed a lawsuit against the firm alleging discrimination. He claims Google "ostracised, belittled and punished" him and a plaintiff for their views. In the memo, Damore had questioned Google's diversity efforts and blamed biological differences, not discrimination, for fewer women in tech roles.
