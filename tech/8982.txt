Microsoft has officially killed Project Astoria, its initiative that aimed at allowing developers to port their Android apps to Windows 10. Further, Microsoft recently acquired Xamarin, a company that deals in multiplatform apps and whose toolset can now be used by developers for cross-platform applications. Notably, Microsoft already has a tool in place to port iOS apps to Windows 10.
