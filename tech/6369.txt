Microsoft on Thursday released a new video comparing the battery lives of laptops running Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera web browsers to demonstrate the Windows 10 anniversary update. The video shows Microsoft Edge lasting 45% longer than Chrome's latest version. Last week, Google had posted a video claiming that Chrome's latest update would give its users additional runtime.
