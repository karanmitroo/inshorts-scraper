Europe-based startup Treepex has developed a pocket-sized device called 'Treepex' which it claims can transform polluted air into fresh oxygen and mineral-enriched air. The device recreates living plant cells responsible for photosynthesis and compresses them into a cartridge, the startup said. It also connects to a user's phone through an app and helps monitor air quality and lung activity.
