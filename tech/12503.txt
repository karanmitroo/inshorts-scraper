PM Narendra Modi on Monday praised the cost-effective nature of Indian space programme, saying its Mars mission had reportedly cost less than the big budget Hollywood science fiction "Gravity", which was made at an estimated US$ 100 million. He was in Sriharikota, witnessing the successful launch of the PSLV C23 rocket that injected five foreign satellites into intended orbit.
