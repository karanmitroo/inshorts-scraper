Technology giant Apple has acquired US-based machine learning platform for developers and data scientists, Turi for a reported $200 million. Previously known as 'Dato', the startup changed its name to Turi in July this year after a trademark dispute. â€œThe company buys smaller technology companies from time to time", said Apple in a statement.
