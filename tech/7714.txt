Twitter has introduced emoji keyword targeting for ads which will enable advertisers to target their ads and tweets based on the use of emojis. The new feature uses emoji activity as a signal of a person's mood and mindset. Advertisers can avail the emoji-based ad-targeting with the help of select Twitter partners including AdParlor, Amobee and HYFN.
