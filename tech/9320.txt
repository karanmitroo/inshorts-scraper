Jeans that claim to slim one's thighs while hydrating the user's skin have been launched by American brand Guess, in its Smart GUESS Technology collection. The JeanCare collection uses the brand's Slimtex technology, which will "shape-up" and mould to the wearer's body. The apparels additionally have ginkgo extract, which aids blood flow and vitamin E, which nourishes the skin.
