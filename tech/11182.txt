Microsoft researchers have developed an imaging technology that can automatically identify the objects in a picture, interpret what is going on and write an accurate caption explaining it. “The machine has been trained to understand how a human understands the image,” said Xiaodong He, a researcher. The technology could lead to a future version of Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant.
