Brave Software has raised $4.5 million in funding to continue the development of its open source web browser which blocks ads and other trackers while surfing. Founded by former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, it claims to offer 40-60% speed increase on desktop and 200-400% on mobile devices. It also supports fingerprint shields, phishing protection, malware filtering and encrypted data traffic.
