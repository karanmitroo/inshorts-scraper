A research carried out by a team from Oxford University has found that the HIV virus's ability to cause AIDS has reduced considerably, due to the rapid evolution of human immunodeficiency virus, and widespread access to antiretroviral therapy. The research was carried out on 2000 women with chronic HIV infection, in Botswana and South Africa, two countries worst-affected by AIDS.
