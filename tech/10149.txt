Two NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), Scott Kelly and Kjell Lindgren, undertook their second spacewalk on Friday. While on the spacewalk, that went on for seven hours and 48 minutes, a truss cooling system on the ISS was restored to its original configuration. Earlier on October 28, the duo had conducted their first spacewalk.
