Genomics research and diagnostics firm MedGenome is reportedly building India-specific baseline data to develop gene-based diagnostic kits with higher accuracy. “We really don’t have enough data on the Indian population. Many of the diagnostics and drug dosages are meant for a Caucasian population,” said Sam Santhosh, the firm's CEO. MedGenome raised $20 million from Sequoia Capital in July.
