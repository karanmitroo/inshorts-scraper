One of the very first Apple computers, hand-built by Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at a garage in 1976, is set to be auctioned at an estimate of £330,000 (approximately Rs 3.3 crores). The pre-assembled computer, which is only a motherboard, was originally sold to Apple's first client, the Byte Shop for just £437.
