NASA's Voyager I, that was sent into space in 1977, has relayed a message from a distance of 19.5 billion kilometers from Earth about a ‘tsunami wave’ released by the sun as a coronal mass ejection of a magnetic cloud of plasma. The Voyager had penetrated into the deeper space beyond the solar system about two years ago.
