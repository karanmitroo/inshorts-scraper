The design shop behind the new London Tube, PriestmanGoode has designed a pair of transformable train seats that can accommodate 15â€“30% more passengers. While one of the seats can be folded to create more space, an adjustable seat on the side can be opened during overcrowding. Another seat design includes less wide seats and reduced gaps between rows.
