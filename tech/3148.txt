Hackers behind the global WannaCry ransomware attack, that has hit 150 countries since Friday, have earned about ₹55 lakh so far. Elliptic Enterprises, a London-based company that tracks illicit use of Bitcoin, tracked the current balance of the three Bitcoin addresses known to be associated with WannaCry. The malware locked up users' computers and demanded ₹20,000-₹38,000 as ransom in Bitcoin.
