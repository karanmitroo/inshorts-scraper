A Las Vegas strip club called The Sapphire Gentleman's Club showcased pole-dancing robots at the electronics show CES 2018. The robots, created by British artist Giles Walker, had CCTV cameras for faces, and wore high heels while dancing around the pole. They danced to music by 50 Cent and Pharrell, with dollar bills scattered on the stage.
