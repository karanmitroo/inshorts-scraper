Google parent company Alphabet's Chairman Eric Schmidt has said that the technology major "can't guarantee... but can get pretty close" to ensuring that an ad doesn't show up next to offensive content on its platforms. This comes after brands like BBC, Domino's, and Hyundai boycotted Google and withdrew their ads in the UK for appearing next to videos promoting terrorism.
