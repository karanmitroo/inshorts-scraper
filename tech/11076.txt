According to reports, BlackBerry is planning to launch an Android smartphone soon. A sliding phone, which was shown at this year's Mobile World Congress, is likely to use Google's OS, reports claim. The move is reportedly being taken to focus on software and device management. BlackBerry, which once dominated smartphone sales, now has a market share of less than 1%.
