Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo on Saturday tweeted, "If you don't get invited to this meeting and want to know what it was like, just drink a bottle of gin and then waterboard yourself". He was referring to a meeting between Trump and technology leaders including Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook, scheduled for later this month.
