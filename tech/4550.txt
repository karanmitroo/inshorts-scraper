US-based Black Lives Matter organisation has launched a 'Mark Yourself Unsafe' tool that allows social media users to mark themselves unsafe for being black in America, according to reports. The tool aims to highlight racial discrimination across the country. "We need to take action...to raise awareness about how racism impacts our families and communities," the organisation said.
