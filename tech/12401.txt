Former Microsoft CEO, Steven Ballmer, Tuesday said he is stepping down as a member of the company's board of directors. "Given my confidence and the multitude of new commitments I am taking on now, I think it would be impractical for me to continue to serve on the board, and it is best for me to move off," Ballmer added.
