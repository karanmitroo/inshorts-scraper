Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday shared a picture with his daughter Maxima, on his Facebook account. The Facebook Co-founder posted, "The joys of fatherhood. Stretching after a long swim and bike. Max tries to stretch like dad and kicks me in the face. Beast gets jealous and sits on my head. And one more coming soon!"
