A team of researchers from Google and The University of Washington has developed a new way of creating time-lapse video by collating millions of images available online from Flickr, Picasa & other sites. Using sophisticated algorithms, the project clusters 86 million photos and stitches them together into landmarks and popular viewpoints. The researchers will release their code and results soon.
