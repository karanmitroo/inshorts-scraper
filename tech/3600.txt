A disaster-proof emergency vault called the 'Arctic World Archive' has been opened nearly 1,000 kilometres away from the North Pole in Svalbard, Norway, to store data expected to last between 500-1,000 years. Norwegian company Piql puts the digital data onto a photosensitive, multi-layered analogue film. The film is then placed into a secure box and put inside the vault.
