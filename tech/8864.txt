The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the US Department of Defense recently unveiled the concept design for its latest vertical take off and landing aircraft called X-Plane. The aircraft, which can reach a speed of 740.8 kmph, will use a 4,000-horsepower engine creating three megawatts of electricity to power 24 fans for creating the required thrust.
