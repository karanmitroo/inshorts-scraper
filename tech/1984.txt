According to reports, Apple will remove the home button for a larger screen in one version of the upcoming iPhone. It will be replaced by a thin software bar to access the multitasking menu or open the iPhone by dragging it into the middle of the screen. The phones will also have on-screen gesture controls involving a dock of icons.
