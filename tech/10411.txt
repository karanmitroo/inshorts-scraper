Twitter is reportedly experimenting with the idea of letting users tweet polls. It has made a feature available to a subset of users—including CFO Anthony Noto—where they can embed polls into their tweets. Users can vote on these polls from Twitter's website or mobile applications. However, it’s unclear whether the feature will be rolled out to a wider audience.
