US-based Alan Dorfman and Jayson Esterow have created the Pongbot, a robotic cup holder that adds moving targets to beer pong. Equipped with a holder to hold up to five cups, the Pongbot can be set to move randomly around a table or can be controlled via a remote. Priced at $40, the product has been launched on Kickstarter.
