Whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks on Wednesday claimed its latest release of nearly 9,000 secret CIA documents on the agency's hacking capabilities accounts for under 1% of its larger 'Vault7' series. However, it did not reveal when it will publish rest of the documents. Interestingly, the documents reveal that CIA can hide its hacking fingerprint and attribute it to others, including Russia.
