At least 28 Chinese app developers have filed a complaint against Apple alleging that the tech giant removed their apps from the App Store without proper explanation. The developers also alleged that Apple is charging excessive fees for in-app purchases. However, an Apple spokeswoman said that guidelines for publishing apps on the App Store are consistent across all countries.
