A Twitter user has highlighted that Apple categorises users' photos under 'brassiere' category in the Photos app. While a few users tweeted that the category compiles their private pictures, some reports said it yielded a user's image in a dress. Apple introduced image recognition technology last year which curates and searches users' photos to detect people, pets and others.
