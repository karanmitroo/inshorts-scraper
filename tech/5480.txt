Computer science researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, have developed a new tool for electronic railway interlocking system, which prevents trains from colliding into each other. The tool has already been successfully tested in several railway yards, the lead researcher said, and claimed that it can be extended to study and develop optimum traffic operation plans.
