A team of MIT researchers has developed an anonymity network, called Riffle, following the revelation of vulnerabilities in the widely-popular anonymity network 'Tor'. Apart from the existing techniques being used by Tor, Riffle adds two more layers of security â€“ making every server permute the order of messages it receives and keeping any malicious server from leaking the incoming data.
