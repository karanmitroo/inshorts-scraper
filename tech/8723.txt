Indian-origin researchers have developed a new sonar technology called FingerIO that allows to interact with smart devices by gesturing in mid-air or on other surfaces. It turns a device into a sonar system using its microphones and speakers to track fine-grained finger movements. The project's application could enable using devices inside a pocket, as sound waves can travel through fabric.
