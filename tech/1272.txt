British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will soon reach a level where it will be a "new form of life that will outperform humans". The Cambridge University Professor said he fears someone could design an AI that improves and replicates itself, which "may replace humans altogether". Hawking, however, didn't specify a timeline for his predictions.
