Google-owned Motorola has applied to patent a skin tattoo, which will have a transceiver microphone embedded into it, enabling wireless communication with the user's smartphone. The microphone would pick up the sounds of a person and send them wirelessly to a smartphone. Developed by Massachusetts-based engineering firm MC10, the tattoo is meant for reducing the acoustic noise in loud environments.
