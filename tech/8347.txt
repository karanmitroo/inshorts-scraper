Samsung has launched 'Samsung Safety Screen', an Android app that helps children to hold devices at a safe distance from their eyes. Using front camera for the user's facial recognition, the app calculates the optimal distance. When the childâ€™s eyes are close to the screen, the app pops up an animation advising the child to move back.
