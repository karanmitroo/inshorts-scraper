US-based startup Radient Micro-Tech has received patents for a technology that charges phones by capturing energy from their radio waves. The concept aims to repurpose a phoneâ€™s screen into an energy harvesting antenna to absorb and reuse its own wasted radiated power and extend battery life by 30%. The company claims to be the first to patent "greener wireless charging".
