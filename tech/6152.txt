Pepe the Frog, a green frog with red lips known better as "sad frog meme", has been labelled an "online hate symbol" by the Anti-Defamation League. This comes after Hillary Clinton's campaign pointed to Pepe as the common factor linking Donald Trump and the white supremacist movement. Pepe was originally created by cartoonist Matt Furie in 2005.
