Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday unveiled plans to expand the company into car-sharing, electric trucks, buses and solar energy systems. The car-sharing feature would let Tesla owners add their cars to the Tesla shared fleet to generate income when their cars are not in use. Musk also announced that the electric trucks and buses will be unveiled next year.
