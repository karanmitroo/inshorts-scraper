McAfee founder John McAfee has backed Apple in the ongoing San Bernardino controversy by saying that the FBI is "asking every owner of an iPhone to make their phone susceptible to bad hackers". Notably, Apple had been asked to create a backdoor access to the San Bernardino gunmen's iPhone. Previously, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had backed FBI over the issue.
