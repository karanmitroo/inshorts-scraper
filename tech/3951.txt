New Zealand-based DB Breweries has created a machine that crushes empty beer bottles into a sand substitute in five seconds. The sand is distributed to construction companies and concrete manufacturers, reducing need for coastally dredged sand. The machine has a dual vacuum system which removes silica dust and plastic labels and creates 200 grams of sand substitute from every bottle.
