Japanese automaker Toyota's luxury car division Lexus has covered one of its cars in 41,999 programmable LED lights that change colour on owner's gestures and respond to the music being played. The hand-placed LEDs, if placed end-to-end, would stretch at least 800 metres in length. However, the LED-lit car cannot be purchased as it has just been made for display.
