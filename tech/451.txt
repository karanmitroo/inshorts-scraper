YouTube's ads were hijacked using Google's ad service to access users' computers to mine cryptocurrency, security research firm Trend Micro has reported. They said the ads, containing JavaScript that mines the digital coin called Monero, were displayed in countries including Japan, France, and Italy. Google confirmed the same and added that the ads were blocked in less than two hours.
