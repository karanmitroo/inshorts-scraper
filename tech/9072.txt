Googleâ€™s online language translation tool now covers 103 languages after it added 13 new ones including Sindhi, Hawaiian and Kurdish. It claims that the service, which started in April 2006, now covers 99% of the online population. To add a new language, it must be a written language with a significant amount of translations already online, the company explained.
