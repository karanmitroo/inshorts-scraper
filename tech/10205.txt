Facebook’s Chief Product Officer Chris Cox has reportedly instructed an unknown number of employees to compulsorily use Android phones. This has been done keeping in mind that a large chunk of users access the platform through Android devices. Cox said he wants his employees to “report bugs and live in the same experience that most Facebook users experience today”.
