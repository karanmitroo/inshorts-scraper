Researchers from Princeton and John Hopkins have collaborated together to develop a bionic ear to help restore hearing impairments. The 'ultimate in human-machine chimera' was made possible by interweaving biological tissue with electronics, the Washington Times reported. Researchers first obtained a 3D computer-aided design of an ear, modified it and then produced it with the help of a 3D printer.
