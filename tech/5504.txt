YouTube content creator 'Mr. Volt' has shared a six-minute video showcasing a cell phone prototype with a rotary dial and enough memory to store a single phone number. The cell phone can perform functions like making calls, sending texts and tuning into the radio. The case of the phone is made from a mixture of aluminium, brass, and 3D-printed plastic.
