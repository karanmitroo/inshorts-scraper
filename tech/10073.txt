Apple on Sunday announced that its first Southeast Asian retail store, to shortly open in Singapore, will be entirely powered by solar energy. The company has collaborated with solar energy developer Sunseap Group that will reportedly provide 100% renewable electricity to all Apple operations in Singapore. Apple currently has such green stores in the US, Europe and China.
