A Brazilian judge on Tuesday ordered phone carriers to block access to Whatsapp, following the company's refusal to comply with a previous court order to reveal user information. Temporary blackouts were ordered against Whatsapp twice since December, but were overturned by higher courts. Whatsapp CEO has posted on Facebook saying, "We are being asked for information we don't have".
