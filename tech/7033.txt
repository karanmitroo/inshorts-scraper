US-based startup Visionary VR has unveiled its new product, called Mindshow, that lets users define their environments, interactive surroundings and create content in first person perspective. Users can create characters with their own voice and movements and even participate in scenes created by friends. Currently in early stages of rollout, Mindshow has opened sign-ups for early access.
