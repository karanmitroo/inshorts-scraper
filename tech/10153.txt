Twitter on Wednesday launched a custom-made emoji for Indian government’s #MakeInIndia campaign. The emoji features the campaign’s official logo with a black lion on an orange background. This makes 'Make in India' the first non-US brand to get a hashtag-activated emoji for itself on Twitter. Other brands to have such emojis include Coca-Cola, Star Wars and Dominos.
