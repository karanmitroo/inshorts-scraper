The public federal prosecutor in Amazonas, Brazil said the court has frozen Facebook's funds worth $11.7 million for failing to supply WhatsApp data of the users under criminal investigation. The frozen funds correspond to the fines for failing to comply with court order to turn over data, it added. Notably, Brazilian courts have suspended WhatsApp nationwide three times since December.
