Stanford researchers have developed a deep learning based artificial intelligence that they claim is as good as human doctors at detecting skin cancer by looking at clinical images. Harnessed using Google's image recognition algorithm, the AI trained using almost 130,000 skin disease images, could further be developed for smartphones to facilitate easy access and early detection, researchers said.
