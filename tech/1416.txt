Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is planning to launch sequels to its $100 billion Vision Fund, according to SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. "The Vision Fund was just the first step, 10 trillion yen ($88BN) is simply not enough," Son said. He also said, "Vision Funds 2, 3 and 4 will be established every two to three years."
