Users testing Google's upcoming Android O have suggested that the latest Android operating system could be named 'Oatmeal Cookie', based on references to 'OC' in its source code. This follows screenshots shared by Twitter users who found an 'Oatmeal Cookie' reference in the slides presented during Google I/O last month. Previous rumours hinted that Android O will be called 'Oreo'.
