PayPal has launched PayPal.me, a platform on which users will be able to setup personalised URLs (paypal.me/username) and share money through it. Users can create their own profiles and make payments through text, email, instant messenger, and social media. In the peer-to-peer payment domain, the company also provides services like the Venmo app and the ‘request money’ feature.
