South Korean electronics maker LG on Friday unveiled a refrigerator prototype with a 27-inch long Windows 10 tablet mounted on one of its doors. It's powered by an Intel Atom processor located at the top of the refrigerator. The tablet's surface turns translucent, revealing the fridgeâ€™s contents so that users can virtually pin things like purchase dates on the surface.
