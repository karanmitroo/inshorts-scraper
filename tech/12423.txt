Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter account was hacked on Thursday, the government press service said. The hacker declared the PM's resignation and his interest to work as a freelance photographer. Some of the tweets were "I resign. I am ashamed for the actions of the government. I'm sorry," and "I've been longing to say this. Vova [Putin]! you are wrong!".
