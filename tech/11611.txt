Doctors in South Africa have successfully carried out the world's first penis transplant on a young man whose organ was amputated following a messed-up circumcision ritual, a hospital said Friday. According to doctors, the transplant procedure could also be applied to men who have lost their penises to cancer or as a measure to cure severe erectile dysfunction.
