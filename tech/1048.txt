Apple researchers have revealed self-driving car research which could be used to detect objects like pedestrians and cyclists in a recently-published paper. The scientists Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel proposed a new software approach called "VoxelNet" for helping computers detect three-dimensional objects. However, the iPhone maker Apple has not made any comment on the published research paper.
