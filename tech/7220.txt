A new clothing line called Aerochromics has launched three shirts, starting at $500, which change colour on detecting either carbon monoxide, particle pollution, or radioactivity. The 'Reactive Particle Pollution' shirt, for example, alerts wearers when they enter a concentrated area of particle pollution by activating heat pads that change the white dots on the shirt to black.
