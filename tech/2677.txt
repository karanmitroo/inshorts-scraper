Researchers have developed technology for smart car headlights that let drivers see through heavy rain or snow. The system tracks motion of raindrops and then applies an algorithm to predict where those particles will be a few moments later. It then deactivates light beams that would reflect off the particles in their predicted positions, preventing glare that would distract drivers.
