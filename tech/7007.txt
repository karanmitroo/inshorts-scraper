University of Oxford researchers have achieved a quantum logic gate with record-breaking 99.9% precision, reaching the benchmark required theoretically to build a quantum computer. The logic gate, which is the fundamental unit of a quantum computer, places two atoms in a state of 'quantum entanglement', which means that measuring the property of one atom gives information about the other.
