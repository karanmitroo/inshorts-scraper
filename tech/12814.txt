Researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (US) have developed a bio-battery, that consumes sugar to generate electricity enough to power a smartphone for 10 days after a single charge. Notably, the prototype version has the potential to be lighter and more powerful than the batteries typically found in todayâ€™s portable electronic devices, including smartphones.
