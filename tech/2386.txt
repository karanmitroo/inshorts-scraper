Apple has issued a statement regarding removal of major Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps from the China App Store. In January, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that all VPNs must obtain a license from the government. "We have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations," the statement read.
