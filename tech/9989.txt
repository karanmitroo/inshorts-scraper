Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) started organising training workshops for its volunteers to ensure "safe" use of social media. The volunteers are made aware of the Information Technology Act and have been asked to re-tweet RSS leaders to increase the group's social media popularity. "Volunteers are learning to post positive messages of RSS ideology on the social media," an official said.
