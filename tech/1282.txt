IIT Madras students have set Asia and India records for operating the largest number of robots to clean an area. About 270 students attended the workshop where 45 smartphone-controlled robots with rotating scrub pads and a central suction mechanism swept a 750-square-foot area for over 15 minutes. The workshop's aim was to spread awareness about "Swachh Bharat", said the institute.
