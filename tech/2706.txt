The Tipsy Robot Bar in Las Vegas, US has robot bartenders that serve drinks to people. Two robotic arms mix drinks from the 152 bottles of liquor, juice and soda suspended overhead. After ordering, customers are sent a barcode to their phone which is then scanned into the system. They are then alerted when their drink is ready.
