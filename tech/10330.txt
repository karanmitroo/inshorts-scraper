Facebook on Monday said that it will launch a satellite to expand internet access in more than 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The satellite, called AMOS-6, will be launched in partnership with French satellite operator Eutelsat, in 2016. According to a UN report, internet connectivity presently reaches less than 2% of the population in certain countries in the region.
