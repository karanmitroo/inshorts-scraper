US-based Sleep Number has unveiled a smart bed that learns sleepers' bedtime routines and pre-heats the foot of the bed. On sensing that a sleeper is snoring on their back, the bed automatically raises their head seven degrees. It also has a smart alarm that wakes users up during their desired wake-up time window.
