Under its new CEO Vishal Sikka, Infosys is planning to create an Infosys Masters and may be even a Doctorate programme. "People can acquire credits taking courses, and if, say, over a 5-year period, they accumulate enough credit points, we will call them Infosys Master," said UB Pravin Rao, COO of Infosys.
