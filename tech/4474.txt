Russian startup Aerodyne RC has developed a â‚¹13,000 drone named 'Nimbus 195' that can even survive a car passing over it. The drone, with a full carbon fibre monocoque body, is weatherproof and can fly up to speeds of 160 kmph. It provides a flight time of three to ten minutes once it is fully charged.
