A 25-year-old man named Zach Champion has created a Twitter account '@ItalianComments' to showcase comments of Italians angry over Italian dishes cooked wrongly by other people. "I've got 780 screenshots that are waiting to go up. I'm pretty much set for two years," he said. "We're not just offended, we are actually vomiting," reads one of the featured comments.
