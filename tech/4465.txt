The Co-founder of American Wi-Fi video streaming camera startup Dropcam, which was acquired by Google subsidiary Nest in 2014 for $555 million, Greg Duffy has joined Apple. The move comes after Duffy reportedly accused Nest founder Tony Fadell of "holding back all progress" of his products. Duffy quit Nest but served nearly eight months at Google.
