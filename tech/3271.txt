In an interview on Monday, Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg shared the first line of her journal, which she started writing after her husband passed away in 2015. She said, "I'm going to bury my husband. I don't know why I'm writing this," is the first line of her journal. Sandberg said writing the journal helped her to cope with isolation.
