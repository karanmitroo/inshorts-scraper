A California-based startup has created OaSense, a smart shower head that helps save water with a presence-detecting sensor. It can detect when a user is under the shower and pauses the water flow when the user steps away. OaSense has a button for switching between 'sense' and 'standard' modes and its power lasts over one year with four replaceable batteries.
