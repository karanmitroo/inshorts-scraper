The Telangana government on Saturday signed an MoU with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for setting up a Telangana Water Resources Information System (TWRIS) on ISROâ€™s geo-portal Bhuvan (similar to Google Earth). The system aims at capturing and marking every field-level irrigation structure, including dams/barrages, canals and field channels, on the satellite visualisation tool.
