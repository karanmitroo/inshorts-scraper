An Italian startup has created a smartphone case called 'Mokase' that stores, heats, and dispenses coffee. Priced at about â‚¹5,700, the case can store an espresso shot of 25 ml and heat it up to 50-60 degrees Celsius when required. The case's coffee cartridge is made up of an aluminium-silicon alloy that heats the coffee using a built-in battery.
