Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, is considering setting up a display-making plant in US in an investment that would exceed $7 billion (over â‚¹47,000 crore), CEO Terry Gou said on Sunday. This could create 30,000-50,000 jobs in the US, he said. The plan comes after US President Donald Trump pledged to put "America First" in his inauguration speech.
