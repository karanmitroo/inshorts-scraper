Crowdfunding platform Kickstarter has suspended the campaign for 'Mokase' smartphone case that claimed to store, heat, and dispense coffee. Kickstarter says that Mokase's creators were unable to produce a prototype that met its standards. The case requires pouches of liquid coffee which would be warmed to about 50 to 60 degrees Celsius using a built-in battery.
