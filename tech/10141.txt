Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has chosen Varanasi to introduce an entrepreneur-driven pilot project for providing low-cost internet to villages. The tech company will fund local entrepreneurs to build devices to solve India's bandwidth issues. The technology, called TVWS (TV white spaces), will be tapped for utilising unused spectrum in between TV channels in a boost to the Digital India initiative.
