Apologising for Twitter failing to tackle abusive tweets, the microblogging site's former CEO Dick Costolo on Wednesday said, "I wish I could turn back the clock and go back to 2010 and stop abuse on Twitter by creating specific bar for how to behave on the platform". He added, "I take responsibility for not taking the bull by the horns".
