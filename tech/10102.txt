Apple launched its music streaming service, Apple Music, for Android users four months after it was available on the company's native devices. This will give Android users access to purchases from iTunes store for the first time. Features like "For You" recommendations, Beats 1 radio station and three-month free trial are expected to help Apple reach Android's user base.
