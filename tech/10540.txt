Microsoft has announced its acquisition of VoloMetrix, a Seattle-based analytics company. VoloMetrix’s software collaborates with group applications like calendar and e-mail and collects employee metadata to help businesses function in a better way. This will reportedly be integrated into Office 365, through Microsoft’s Delve Organizational Analytics product set to launch later this year.
