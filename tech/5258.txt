A new free desktop app called 'Touché' claims to let users experience the 'Touch Bar,' the new hardware feature in Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops. It is aimed at MacBook buyers who want to experience the feature before they buy the laptop. The app simulates Apple’s new touchscreen display for shortcuts and brings up Touch Bar options on the screen.
