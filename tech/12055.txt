Twitter has launched a search engine to help users search through tweets. The feature allows users to search through every tweet sent on the service since 2006 when Twitter was launched. The company's search infrastructure engineer Yi Zhuang said the search service efficiently indexes roughly half a trillion documents and “serves queries with an average latency of under 100 milliseconds”.
