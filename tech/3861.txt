South Korean electronics major Samsung on Friday completed its biggest-ever acquisition by buying US-based auto and audio product maker Harman for $8 billion in an all-cash deal. Harman is the parent company of brands like JBL, Lexicon, AKG and Mark Levinson. The move is speculated to help Samsung's push in the smart home and car market.
