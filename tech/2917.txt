Researchers at IIT Kharagpur have used silk to develop an electronic fabric. The fabric can generate current from mechanical movement and also when exposed to light in visible and UV range. The biodegradable and stretchable technology combines silk proteins, zinc oxide, and gold nanoparticles. The self-powered photodetector material could be used by soldiers in remote locations, researchers said.
