Content-sharing platform Pinterest has launched a new feature called 'Pin Collective' to match brands and advertisers with content creators. Using the feature, brands will be able to create more viral pins, which will increase engagement and generate revenue for Pinterest. Brands will pay creators directly for their work, and all negotiations will be managed by the brands and creators.
