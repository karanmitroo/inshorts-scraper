Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg at an event earlier this week while talking about sexual harassment at workplaces said, "We can't tolerate Harvey Weinstein-like behaviour." She also said, "It's about the people around them that know and don't do anything." Last week, Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexually harassing actresses for decades.
