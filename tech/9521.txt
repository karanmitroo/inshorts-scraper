Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official website got a makeover on Friday to become accessible on mobile phones. The revamped website now allows visitors to write directly to the PM. It provides detailed information about Modi’s foreign visits and all government initiatives including Swachh Bharat and Make in India. It also features Modi's live speeches and 'Mann Ki Baat' radio programme.
