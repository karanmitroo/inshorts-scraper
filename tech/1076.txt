Talking about the experience at Instagram before it was acquired by Facebook in 2012, its Co-founder Mike Krieger has said they had "no management experience." Krieger added that the amount of output Instagram had and the size of the community it supported was "totally disproportionate" to the team size. He emphasised that in 2012, Instagram was "very slow at hiring."
