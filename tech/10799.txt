US President Barack Obama has signed an executive order authorising the creation of a new supercomputing research initiative called the National Strategic Computing Initiative to create the fastest computer by 2025. The computer will be 20 times faster than the current fastest machine, Tianhe-2, in China. It would be capable of making one quintillion (a billion billion) calculations per second.
