NASA has announced the 'Electric Aircraft Testbed', a new research wing to test electric aircraft at the NASA Glenn Research Centre's Plum Brook Station in Ohio. The facility will enable NASA engineers to design, develop and test electric aircraft like the GL-10 Greased Lightning VTOL. NASA had earlier announced its goal to transition to electric aircraft systems within 10 years.
