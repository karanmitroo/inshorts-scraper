Google has defeated a legal action started by the US Authors Association and US publishers in 2005, who alleged Google of creating a digital library amounting to massive copyright infringement. US court dismissed the case accepting Google's arguments of the library's fair use. Google had scanned more than 30 million works by April-2013 to include in its digital library.
