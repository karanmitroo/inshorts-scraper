Researchers from the University of Columbia have successfully created the world's smallest light bulb from a one-atom-thick layer of graphene. The ultra-thin graphene turns into a superheated filament at a temperature of about 2500Â°C and its light can be seen with naked eyes. The promising research is expected to help in transforming smartphones, buildings and satellites, among others.
