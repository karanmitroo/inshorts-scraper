A Dutch patient recently received a 'click-on prosthetic arm' that can be controlled with his thoughts. The arm is directly connected to the bone while the "mind control" is enabled by connecting patient's nerves to the arm, with a Bluetooth bracelet to receive signals. The click-on device doesn't need a prosthesis socket and can be removed easily, doctors said.
