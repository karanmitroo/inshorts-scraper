Advertising agencies in Brazil have installed two billboards which claim to attract and kill mosquitoes by faking human breathing and sweat. They emit carbon dioxide and a lactic acid solution to reproduce a human being's odour, sweat and breath. With a range of tracking mosquitoes up to 2.5 km, the billboards trap the mosquitoes till they die.
