US Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert has publicly blamed North Korea for the cyber attack dubbed as 'WannaCry' which hit around 3 lakh computers in 150 countries in May this year. "We do not make this allegation lightly. It is based on evidence," Bossert said. The UK and technology giant Microsoft had also earlier accused North Korea of the attack.
