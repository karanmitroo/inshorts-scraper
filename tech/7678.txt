PayPal Co-founder and early Facebook backer Peter Thiel was on Tuesday re-elected to the Facebook's board of directors despite the backlash against him for funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit against Gawker Media. Facebook’s entire board was re-elected, including Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen and others. Earlier this month, Sandberg said that the company wouldn’t remove Thiel.
