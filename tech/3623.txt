Hacker magazine '2600' has reinstated a bounty of â‚¹6.5 lakh for submission of complete federal tax returns of US President Donald Trump to seek "truth and accountability". However, 2600 added that it is "not an appeal for people to hack the IRS." Founded in 1984, the magazine was named after the frequency that gave hackers ability to control landline phones.
