Three former workers of electric carmaker Tesla's Fremont factory have filed a lawsuit against the company over racial harassment. The lawsuit, filed by three African-American men, claims that they were repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and drawings by their co-workers. One of the plaintiffs also said he was subjected to the 'n-word' regularly, and that Tesla took no action.
