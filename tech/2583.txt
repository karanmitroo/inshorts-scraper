A group of seven people who were blocked by US President Donald Trump's personal Twitter account '@realDonaldTrump', sued Trump and two White House aides on Tuesday. The people argued that since Trump is a government official, his account amounts to a public forum, from which he cannot bar people. They further said that Trump's action violates their free speech right.
