Google and Microsoft recently reached an agreement under which the two firms will drop all pending regulatory complaints against each other across the globe. The two parties also agreed to try to settle any future issues among themselves before involving the regulators. Notably, Microsoft had first filed a complaint against Google in 2015, accusing it of anti-competitive search business practices.
