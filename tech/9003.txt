Google will shut down 'Google Compare', its comparison service in the US and the UK, by March 23. The website offers deals for a range of financial products including credit cards, mortgages and travel/home insurance policies. Google said that the platform received a good level of traffic from users, but when it came to revenue and activity, it “hasn’t driven the success we hoped for”.
