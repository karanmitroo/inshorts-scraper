US-based startup LifeDoor has unveiled a device at CES 2018, that can automatically close doors inside a home in the event of a fire. The device can be installed on any standard door by attaching it to the door's hinge and also illuminates the room when it detects smoke. It also sounds a security alarm to wake the room's occupants.
