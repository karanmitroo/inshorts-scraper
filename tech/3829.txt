Russia on Thursday denied the involvement of its officials in the hacking of 50 crore Yahoo accounts in 2014. This comes after the US officially charged two Russian Federal Security Service officers and two criminal hackers for the breach. Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added that the authorities found out about the charges from the media instead of official channels.
