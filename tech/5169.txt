The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is planning to open a section of Phase-III in March next year, which will run driverless trains and new coaches made by a Korean manufacturer. In its first year, the trains will run on an 'Autopilot' mode with a supervising driver. By 2018, DMRC plans to make the trains completely driverless.
