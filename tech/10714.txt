State-run BSNL has started talks with five telecom firms for initiating intra-circle roaming, its chairman and managing director Anupam Shrivastava said. This is being reportedly done in a bid to address the problem of call drops and optimize usage of scarce spectrum. Shrivastava, however, said nothing concrete had been planned on the issue of sharing and trading of spectrum.
