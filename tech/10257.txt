A new discovery by researchers at the Stanford University on the heart cells could lead to a new treatment of heart disease. They found cells that can grow into fresh arteries and restore blood supply. This could be used in therapies that  manoeuvre the cells into forming new arteries capable of diverting blood around diseased and blocked blood vessels.
