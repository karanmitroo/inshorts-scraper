An original and working Apple-1 computer built by Apple Co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976 was sold for ₹2.3 crore at an auction last week. The computer is one of the 66 still considered to be in existence and was originally sold for about ₹43,000 ($666.66). Wozniak once revealed Apple-1's price was $666.66 as he "liked repeating digits."
