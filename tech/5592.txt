Texas-based egg manufacturer Vital Farms and Israel-based electronics firm Novatrans are partnering on TeraEgg, a technology that identifies the sex of a chicken before it hatches. The technique captures and uses terahertz spectroscopy to analyse the gas emanating from the pores of eggs. This could prevent the unnecessary hatching and killing of male chickens.
