German researchers have created a 'Faceless Recognition System' that identifies people through photos even when their faces are blurred. The algorithm can predict the identity of unclear faces by looking for previously-observed patterns around their head and body. It can identify 69.6% of blurred faces accurately by using an average of 1.25 tagged images of a person's fully visible face.
