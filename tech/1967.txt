Yahoo's first CEO Timothy Koogle is selling his house for  $19.4 million. The 5,440-square-foot house, which was built in 1955, has four bedrooms, a guest house, and an outdoor terrace. Adding that he and his wife have "a bunch of other properties", Koogle said, "We've started to realise that we don't use all those very much, which is silly."
