A computer keyboard expert has developed the Keyboard Force Curve Gauge, a device to chart the relationship between the distance of a keypress and the force it transfers from the point of click to release. Reportedly, the man spent four years and $1,000 developing the device, in an attempt to make a quantitative tool to compare the 'tactility' of keyboards.
