American computer technology major Oracle's 72-year-old Co-founder, Larry Ellison's net worth has jumped by $5 billion in two days to hit $61.8 billion. The jump in his net worth came from his around 25% stake in Oracle, after his company's shares soared following fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. Ellison is currently the seventh richest person in the world.
