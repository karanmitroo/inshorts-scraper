Smartphone chip maker Qualcomm has developed a computer board for drones called Snapdragon Flight. The system-on-a-chip device includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, a satellite navigation system and 4K video processing. The incorporation of the device will reportedly bring the cost of drones down to below $300. The compact computer board will first operate in a Chinese Yuneec drone in 2016.
