Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter with reference to Google's AI-based 'Clips' camera and tweeted, "This doesn't even *seem* innocent." However, Google has reportedly declined to comment on Musk's tweet. The $249 (â‚¹16,300) 'Clips' is a lightweight, hands-free camera which uses artificial intelligence (AI) processing on-device and machine learning to automatically click pictures.
