Phone directory app Truecaller has launched a new smart SMS app, Truemessenger, for Android devices. The app replaces the standard SMS app and lets a user identify the actual identity of the message sender. Just like Truecaller, it also helps block or report spam, fraud, telemarketing, sales, and unknown phone numbers. The app is currently available exclusively in India.
