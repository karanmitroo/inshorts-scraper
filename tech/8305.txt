French company Orée has launched an ink stylus for $300 that lets users transfer their drawings from paper to iOS or Android devices. Called Stylograph, the pen tracks users’ strokes on a special ‘stone mineral’ paper via its accelerometer and camera, and transfers the same to a matching app. The device can also save drawings to its own internal memory.
