Social media major Facebook has lost a copyright infringement case against Italian social media company Climbook. Facebook had filed a legal complaint against the company in 2015, alleging that Climbook was similar in its "structural, visual, phonetic, and conceptual" design. Italy's patent office ruled that it is "highly improbable" for an average user to confuse between the two brands.
