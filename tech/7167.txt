Australian design firm BÃ¼ro North has developed a 'Smart Tactile Paving' system for in-ground traffic lights to prevent pedestrians on their smartphones from walking onto roads. The bumpy tactile panels consisting of LED lights glow red and green to alert walkers whether to cross the road or not. A German municipality had also introduced similar lights earlier this year.
