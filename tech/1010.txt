Android Co-founder Andy Rubin left Google in 2014 after an investigation found that he had maintained an 'inappropriate relationship' with a subordinate, according to reports. The investigation reportedly concluded that "Rubin's behaviour was improper and showed bad judgement." Rubin has reportedly also taken a leave of absence from his startup Essential, following the investigation.
