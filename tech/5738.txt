Samsung on Friday replaced actor Amitabh Bachchan's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone with a Galaxy S7 handset. This comes after the actor in September took to Twitter to complain about his Galaxy Note 7 device, which was not charging beyond 60%. Bachchan had also said he would throw away his Samsung device and buy an iPhone instead if it isn't fixed.
