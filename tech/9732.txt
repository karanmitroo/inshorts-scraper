As per German website Macerkopf, WhatsApp might soon launch video calling support on its platform. Leaked screenshots on the website show an ongoing video call in WhatsApp on iOS. Users can also get the option to mute the call and switch between the front and back cameras. This feature is reportedly being tested internally for WhatsApp version 2.12.16.2 for iOS.
