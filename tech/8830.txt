Google's DeepMind Artificial Intelligence (AI) 'AlphaGo' on Wednesday defeated the 33-year-old 'Go' World champion Lee Sedol from Korea in the first match of their five-match battle. China-originated 'Go' is a board game played on a 19x19 matrix and is considered to be more complex than chess. Notably, the AI had defeated the European champion 5-0 earlier in the year.
