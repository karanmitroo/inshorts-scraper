According to a study by Ericsson, 25% of urban Indian mobile users have issues like network, mobile internet or billing and charging, with their service operators. But only half of these are reported, as customers don't want to go through the troubles of contacting service operator. Operators lack customers' trust that their issue will eventually get resolved, the study added.
