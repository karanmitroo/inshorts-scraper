Software engineer Scotty Allen has shared a video that shows him assembling an iPhone 6S smartphone using mobile phone parts purchased from Shenzhen in China. Allen estimates he spent over ₹64,000 on tools and components but the actual parts used in the phone cost about ₹19,000. Most of the parts Allen used came from recycled or broken iPhone 6S devices.
