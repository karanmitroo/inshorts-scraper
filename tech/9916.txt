Alphabet has made its Google Life Sciences division independent (previously under Google X) and renamed it ‘Verily’. According to Verily’s website, it aims at bringing "together technology and life sciences to uncover new truths about health and disease”. The company is currently developing a smart contact lens with a glucose sensor embedded in it.
