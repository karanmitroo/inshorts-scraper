Software giant Microsoft will end free mainstream support for Win-7 on Jan-13, 2015, but users will continue to get security updates till 2020. There's some speculation that, given the popularity of Windows 7, Microsoft might change its mind as the date nears and continue to support it a bit longer. The company had ended Windows XP support earlier this year.
