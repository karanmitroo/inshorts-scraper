Technology giant Apple's former chipmaker Imagination Technologies has agreed to its sale to China-backed private equity firm Canyon Bridge for about $743 million. The UK-based chip supplier had put itself on sale in June, three months after announcing that Apple will stop using its intellectual property in new products. The acquisition excludes Imagination's US-based unit, MIPS.
