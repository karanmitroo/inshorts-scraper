An AI-based speech analyser named Emma has claimed that the speechwriter of Steve Jobs and current Apple CEO Tim Cook is the same. It compared Jobs' 2005 Stanford commencement speech and iPhone 4 keynote to Cook's speeches. Emma, which uses self-learning algorithms to analyse writing style, claimed to be 100% sure the speeches were written by the same speechwriter.
