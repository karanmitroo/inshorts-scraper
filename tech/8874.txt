Researchers have found a way to remotely monitor experiments on tiny models of human organs using GoogleÂ Glass. Such experiments simulate the activities, mechanics and physiological responses of entire organs and organ systems and require near-constant monitoring. Through this, researchers can also run experiments involving highly infectious bacteria or radioactive materials from a safe distance.
