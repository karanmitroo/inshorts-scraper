Apple launched the iPad Air 2, the iPad mini 3 and a new iMac with a retina, during an event on Thursday. Both the new iPads have been given a thinner look with Touch ID fingerprint sensors, and will be available in the gold colour as well. The new iMac with a 5k high-resolution-screen was the star of the night.
