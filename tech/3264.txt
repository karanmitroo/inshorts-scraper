Microsoft's General Manager of Surface Engineering Pete Kyriacou has said that the fabric on its Surface Laptop keyboard should be cared for like luxury handbags or cars. Kyriacou said the fabric has a specialised coating to avoid stains as "you can coat it with a Scotchgard or something like that and make it rubbery, but it won't be luxury."
