Facebook Messenger has globally launched its free group calling feature on both Android and iOS. Users can tap on the 'phone' icon in group conversations to initiate a group call, and then manage individual participants on the next screen. Participants can also join an on-going call by tapping on the same icon. Notably, the maximum participant limit is 50.
