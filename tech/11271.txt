Google will begin testing "the world's first fully self-driving vehicle" of its own design on public roads this summer. Engineers will operate 25 prototype vehicles, which use the same software as Google's self-driving Lexus RX450h sport utility vehicles, Google said on Friday. It would test new passenger and pedestrian protection technologies, including a foam front end and a flexible windshield.
