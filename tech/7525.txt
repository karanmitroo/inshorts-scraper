A 68-year-old cancer survivor, Shirley Anderson has received a 3D-printed silicon jaw after losing his tongue, lower jaw and Adam's apple during treatment. Indiana University's doctor Travis Bellicchi and his team generated the jaw's 3D model after taking photos of Andersonâ€™s face from different angles. The 3D-printed jaw is lighter, cheaper and looks more natural than the traditional clay jaws.
