Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak during a roundtable at Singapore said Apple under Cook has never "made a product that is real awful and ugly." Wozniak added, "I very much admire Tim Cook for standing up for the privacy of individuals." Cook will be completing five years as Apple CEO on August 24, after taking over from Steve Jobs in 2011.
