Elon Musk-led SpaceX has launched the Zuma spacecraft commissioned by the US government for an undisclosed mission on its first flight of 2018. The launch was followed by a recovery of the first stage booster used with the Falcon 9 rocket. In 2017, SpaceX launched 18 rockets, setting the record for most launches in one year by a private company.
