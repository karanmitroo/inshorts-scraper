Chinese wallet app Alipay, founded by billionaire Jack Ma, has launched 'Circles', a social media service that mostly allows only women to publicly share images or videos. The platform divides men on the basis of their credit rating scores, and those with low scores cannot comment on the pictures, they can only like the photos or leave 'tips' for them.
