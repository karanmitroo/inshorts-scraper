Search engine major Google has been spotted showing a carousel with selected websites that have been flagged for piracy on searching for 'torrent sites' or 'best torrent sites'. The carousel shows more than a dozen websites including The Pirate Bay and Torrent Project. Notably, Google signed a deal with the UK government to demote links to websites with pirated content.
