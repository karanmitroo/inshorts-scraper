The Wi-Fi project of the NDMC started with Khan Market becoming the first area to provide the facility. "The Wi-Fi facility started a few days ago and is running successfully," said O P Mishra, Project Handler. Visitors can connect to the internet providing details like their e-mail ID and mobile number. Connaught Place is set to provide the service next.
