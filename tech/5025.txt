German sports accessories maker Adidas has opened a hi-tech four-storey store in New York, which provides wearables to help customers pick the right shoes. The store has a virtual reality experience zone, a touchscreen that allows customising shoes, and treadmills where customers can try shoes. All the hangers and mannequins at the new store are made from recycled ocean plastic.
