Social networking giant Facebook on Thursday debuted an optional new feature for its mobile app called “Nearby Friends.” The feature uses your smartphone's GPS system to tell your Facebook friends you are nearby, provided they have the feature turned on. It will become available in the Android and iOS Facebook apps in the coming weeks.
