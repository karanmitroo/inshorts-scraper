US space agency NASA plans to hand over control of the International Space Station to a commercial owner sometime around the mid-2020s, a NASA spokesperson has said. "Our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity... so that research can continue in low-earth orbit", he added. However, NASA did not specify any potential buyer.
