Microsoft has announced it will now notify users if their Outlook or OneDrive accounts are being targets of state-sponsored attacks. Microsoft said, “We’re taking this additional step…because it is likely that the attack could be more sophisticated than attacks from cybercriminals.” This comes after it was reported that Microsoft did not alert Hotmail users of accounts being hacked in 2011.
