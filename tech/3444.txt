Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks on Monday joked that he portrays Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in his upcoming movie 'The Circle'. Hanks plays a Silicon Valley tycoon heading a social media company in the film. "I'm not in as good a shape. I didn't exercise or eat as well as you did, but I played you," Hanks told Dorsey.
