According to reports, electronics major Samsung might be planning to do away with the 'Note' branding altogether after completely stopping production of its Note 7 smartphone earlier this week. A survey by the company reportedly found that over 50% of South Korean users have a negative view of the 'Note' brand. Samsung had introduced the first Galaxy Note in 2011.
