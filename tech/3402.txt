After mastering 40 human languages, Swedish startup Gavagai Ab is hoping to use its language analysis software to study communication methods employed by dolphins. Using the artificial intelligence data, researchers would compile a dolphin language directory. The four-year dolphin project will help the company sharpen its $10-million AI tool for other analytical tasks, said the startup's CEO.
