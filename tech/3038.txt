A German tourist board has digitally added swimming shorts to a photo of a nude Hercules statue at a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This comes after Facebook rejected the original photograph for violating advertising guidelines. The social media platform says it doesn't allow "advertising pictures or videos that show nudity, even if they are portraits for artistic or pedagogic reasons."
