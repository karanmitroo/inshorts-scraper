The official account of Sweden, which is run by a different person every week and handled by the Swedish Institute overall, recently blocked and later unblocked 14,000 Twitter accounts. The accounts, including the account of Israel's ambassador to Sweden, were blocked in consent with the institute on the grounds of hate speech. However, the accounts were unblocked when people protested.
