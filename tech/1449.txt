China is developing a facial recognition system that can identify any one of its 1.3 billion citizens within three seconds. The project was launched by China's Ministry of Public Security in 2015 and will help match a person's facial appearance with an ID photo. According to experts, it'll take at least 13 terabytes to store portraits of all citizens.
