Swedish streaming music service Spotify has been sued by US-based Wixen Music Publishing over copyright infringement. The lawsuit which was filed in December 2017, accuses Spotify of "knowingly, intentionally, and repeatedly" reproducing and engaging in unauthorised distribution of the copyrighted musical compositions of Wixen's clients. Wixen has demanded at least $1.6 billion in damages.
