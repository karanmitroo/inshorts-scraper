India's 1.3 lakh postmen in rural regions will soon use network-connected handheld terminals for postal delivery. The devices will have a biometric module to authenticate an individual's identity using the Aadhaar number, solar-powered panel for charging terminals and a thermal printer to print receipts. The initiative is aimed at preventing postal losses and minimizing procedural delays.
