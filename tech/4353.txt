Ride-hailing service Uber has filed for a patent which will allow it to show UberPool riders the Facebook friends and interests they have in common with their fellow passengers. Uber also plans to use social media data to send riders notifications on the Uber app if a fellow passenger attended the same school or grew up in the same city.
