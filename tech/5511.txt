Motorola on Thursday launched a contest to create modular accessories for its Moto Z phones called 'Moto Mods'. Contestants will have to build a prototype and fund it on Indiegogo from where ten ideas will be selected for potential investment of $1 million. Existing Moto Mods let users add movie projectors, speakers, cameras or extra battery packs to their phones.
