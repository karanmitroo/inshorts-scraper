The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Thursday said that it plans to launch its fourth regional navigation satellite - IRNSS-1D - on March 28. Earlier, the satellite was to be launched on March 9, but it was deferred after the space agency found some fault in it. India aims to launch a total of 7 such satellites by 2015.
