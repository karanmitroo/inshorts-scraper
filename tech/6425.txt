Silicon Valley-based Internet of Things (IoT) company People Power has developed a security camera robot called 'Presence 360', that uses old smartphones as surveillance cameras. Placing an unused smartphone into the robot's adjustable arms, users can remotely monitor their rooms in 360 degrees. Using the Presence app, the robot starts recording videos and alerts users whenever motion is detected.
