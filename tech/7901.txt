After British-Israeli startup Sirin Labs launched the Solarin smartphone priced at $14,000, claiming to be the most secure phone, users reacted with tweets like "$14000? This phone is also pretty secure from customers" and "Sirin Labs build the Rolls Royce of smartphones". "The launch might be a little bit Skynet, but the #SOLARIN is pretty darn cool", read another tweet.
