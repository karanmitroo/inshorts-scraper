US-based web designer Ben Gillin has launched a set of emojis for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. Called 'Kimunji', the series features Kim, his father and his grandfather. Gillin said Kimunji was launched to mock the "terrible" 'Kimoji' app, a set of emojis featuring Kim Kardashian. He added that he hopes it gets people talking about North Korea.
