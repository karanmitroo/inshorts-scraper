German engineering company Siemens has created spider-shaped robots that are equipped with 3D printers to build a city on Moon. The robots can brave through nuclear blizzards and talk to each other to divide work. The robots are shaped like a spider because a spider has the most efficient structure as it can move both forward and sideways, researchers said.
