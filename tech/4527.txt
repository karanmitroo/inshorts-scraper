Bob Burrough, a former employee who worked at Apple for seven years with both CEOs Steve Jobs and Tim Cook, has said that Cook made Apple a 'boring' company. "Tim Cook fired Scott Forstall (Apple's software head) and aligned the executive staff so as to have peace...which is to say there is no conflict," Burrough said.
