Japanese company Yukai Engineering has unveiled a pillow with robotic tail that wags when stroked by a user. Called 'Qoobo', it detects strokes through the accelerometer present inside its body and will reportedly have an eight-hour battery life with USB charging. Qoobo is expected to ship next year and will be available in two variants, 'husky gray' and 'French brown'.
