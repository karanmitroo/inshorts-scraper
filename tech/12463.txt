Social networking sites like Bubblews and BonzoMe pay users for posts that attract traffic and advertisers. "I just feel like everyone on social networks has been taken advantage of for long enough," says Michael Nusbaum, a surgeon who created BonzoMe, which is paying its users upto 80% of its ad revenue. Bubblews plans to pay its users in $50 increments.
