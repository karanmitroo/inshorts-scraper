Replacing the ageing iPad 2, Apple has re-launched its fourth-generation iPad (16GB version) with 9.7-inch Retina display. The iPad 4 comes with Apple's dual-core A6X chip and a five-megapixel camera. Before the re-launch, it was priced at Rs 28,000 (Wi-Fi model) and Rs 35,000 (4G-capable model). However, the new pricing has not been revealed yet.
