Google has filed a patent for an augmented reality-based "Interactive Book" that would feature motion and pressure sensors embedded within its pages. Further, the sensors would project visuals onto the pages through a small device seated at the book's spine. The book would also feature embedded speakers to further enhance the on-page action.
