The World Wide Web, an information space where web resources can be accessed through the internet, was opened to the public 25 years ago on August 23, 1991. It was invented by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN, a European organisation for nuclear research. The web was originally developed for sharing information between scientists across the world.
