The Army is ready to induct the first artillery subunit of six 155mm Howitzers guns 'Dhanush', which is expected to outdo Swedish Bofors in range, accuracy, reliability, angle of fire and shoot-and-scoot capabilities. The Defence Research and Development Organisation started the 155 mm artillery gun project after Army's plan for modernisation were hit by Bofors scandal in the mid-1980s.
