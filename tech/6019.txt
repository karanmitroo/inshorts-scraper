Twitter user Sarah Nyberg has created a software bot to engage "internet bigots" to fight by tweeting controversial statements. The bot is named Liz and tweets inflammatory statements from her handle @arguetron, in order to "bait internet bigots into fighting with it for hours." The software, however, denies being a bot when called out.
