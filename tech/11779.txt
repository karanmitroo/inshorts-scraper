In yet another technological milestone in the countryâ€™s missile programme, India Saturday successfully carried out the canister-based trial of Agni-V, which is the country's most potent strategic missile. The 17-metre-long, three-stage solid-fuelled missile, developed indigenously by DRDO, is capable of delivering a 1.1 nuclear warhead over a distance of 5,000 km.
