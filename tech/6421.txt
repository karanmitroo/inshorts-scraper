Facebook-owned photo and video sharing platform Instagram has launched a keyword moderation tool to allow its users to control the offensive comments posted on their pictures. The feature allows its users to list words that they consider offensive or inappropriate. Once listed, the comments including those words would be hidden from the user's posts.
