Chinese TV and smartphone startup LeEco has said it will lay off 325 employees, or around 70% of its workforce in the US and focus mainly on Chinese-speaking American households. LeEco had launched its US operations in October 2016. This comes a few days after LeEco's Founder Jia Yueting announced he was stepping down as the CEO.
