The FBI has reportedly asked Israeli firm CelleBrite to unlock San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. Earlier, the FBI had said that it may not need Appleâ€™s help to unlock the iPhone as it had found an outside party to do the job. Notably, CelleBrite specialises in phone-oriented forensic software and can physically extract the memory of locked iOS devices.
