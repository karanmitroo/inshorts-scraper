Google is testing a tool called Bulletin that would allow anyone to publish information about local interests like bookstore readings, sporting events, or street closures. The company described Bulletin as a lightweight app for capturing photos and videoclips from the phone and publishing them without having to create a blog. The service is currently being piloted in select US cities.
