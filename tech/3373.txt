American comedian Stephen Colbert recently trolled Google Co-founder Larry Page-backed startup's 'flying car' made to be flown above water. Calling it another thing that will be bought by the douchebags, Colbert said, "it looks like a mini trampoline had sex with a wiener-mobile". Unveiled a week ago, the 'flying car' is set to launch by the end of this year.
