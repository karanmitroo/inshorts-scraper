Tech giant Apple is facing a lawsuit after 2 people sued the company claiming that the flagship iOS 8 reserves a lot of memory for itself, about which users were not informed. The complainants say that the operating system can occupy upto 23.1% space, and is a way of getting people sign up for the paid iCloud storage system.
