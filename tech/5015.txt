Legion, the group of hackers who hacked Twitter accounts of several personalities including Rahul Gandhi and Vijay Mallya, said in an interview that they were just a "group of computer geeks who were addicted to crime and drugs." The group added they have no political motives behind their recent hacks. Ex-IPL chairman Lalit Modi is their next target, Legion claimed.
