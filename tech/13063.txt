Google's new robotic grocery delivery service is expected to challenge Amazon's drone project that envisages transporting goods to its customers by air. Reportedly, Google's robots could be paired with its self-driving car research to help automate the delivery of goods to people's doors. Google said it has taken over seven robotics companies in the past half-a-year to develop its product.
