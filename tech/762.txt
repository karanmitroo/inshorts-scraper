Facebook has apologised after an investigation found inconsistencies in removing 'offensive' posts which are reported by users. The investigation which analysed 900 posts found that content reviewers at Facebook make different decisions with similar content and do not always abide by Facebook's community guidelines. Based on samples, Facebook admitted the mistake and said it "must do better."
