Apple has officially been served a warrant to unlock the iPhone SE of the man responsible for the shooting in a church in Texas, US earlier this month. The warrant seeks access to calls, contacts, messages, passwords, social media, photos, videos, and other data on the iPhone. However, Apple is yet to respond officially to the issued search warrant.
