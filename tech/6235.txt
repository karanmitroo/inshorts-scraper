The Founders of the mobile operating system Android had run out of cash in 2003 before being bailed out by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steve Perlman. The company was paid $10,000 in cash by Steve without accepting any equity in the company. Android was later acquired by Google in 2005, and the first version was released on September 23, 2008.
