Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday took to Twitter to reply to a post by Wall Street Journal about Tesla's self-driving car project. "WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now." he wrote in reply to a user's tweet, "WSJ not a huge fan of @elonmusk."
