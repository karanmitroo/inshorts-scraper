MIT researchers have developed an ink that changes the colour of 3D-printed plastic objects when exposed to ultraviolet light for 20 minutes. Researchers said people are consuming a lot more now compared to 20 years ago and generating a lot of waste. "By changing an object's colour, you don't have to create a whole new object every time," they added.
