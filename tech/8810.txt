California-based startup Brain of Things has built fully-automated apartments called ‘robot homes’. The apartments learn the residents’ habits and accordingly execute functions like switching on the lights, lifting the blinds and feeding the pets. Featuring 20 sensors each, the smart houses can detect pipe leaks and beam a live video feed on the resident’s phone if someone’s at the door.
