The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Director Christopher Wray on Monday said that the agency has been unable to open nearly 7,000 encrypted devices this year. "To put it mildly, this is a huge, huge problem," he said. Wray's remarks follow the iPhone hacking case in 2016, when the FBI demanded that Apple hack into a device for investigation.
