A Pakistani pizzeria has introduced a robot waitress that can greet customers and serve meals. It resembles a slender woman wearing a long dress, and its engineer said he added a scarf to prevent offending conservative patrons. The restaurateur said sales had doubled, and added, "I used to sell pizzas, but now restaurant owners want to buy robots from me."
