Flipkart has launched a browser-app hybrid application called Flipkart Lite for customers who do not want the app for various reasons to allow them to use the website straight from links on other websites and social media. It is optimised for low-bandwidth connections and offers app-like features like notifications and home screen. It is currently available only on Google Chrome.
