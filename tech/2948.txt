After selling the rights to use its name in the US to Chinese manufacturer Hisense in 2015, Japanese corporation Sharp has claimed that Hisense is damaging the brand with "shoddily manufactured" TVs. Sharp has sued the Chinese firm to get back US name rights, stating that Hisense gave consumers deceptive information about picture size, brightness levels and the 4K resolution.
