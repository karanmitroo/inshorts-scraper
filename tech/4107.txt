Google's Senior Vice President of Android Hiroshi Lockheimer on Monday tweeted a GIF of Oreo cake, leading to speculation that Android O might be named after Oreo biscuits. Lockheimer is known to troll users with misleading Android hints. He had tweeted a menu's picture with 'Nutella pizzetta' on it before the release of Android N, which was eventually named Nougat.
