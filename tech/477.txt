Microsoft will use Deep Neural Networks to enable high-quality Indian language translations, the company announced on Thursday. It recognises speech to convert into text, eliminates errors in the data, translates it to the target language, and synthesises the text-based translation into speech. It also puts every word within the context of other words in the sentence to better the translation.
