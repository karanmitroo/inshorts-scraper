An unmanned Russian cargo spacecraft ferrying supplies to International Space Station, has lost control and is plunging back to earth, a Russian space agency official said Wednesday. "It has started descending. It has nowhere else to go," he said. If control is not regained, the spacecraft will come down. However, little of the vessel will survive re-entry into Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
