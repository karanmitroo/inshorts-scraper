A Palestinian computer engineer has reportedly been sentenced to nine years in prison for hacking Israeli drones for the terror group Islamic Jihad. The man was accused of developing a software to intercept real-time video footage "from the skies of Gaza" from Israel's military drones. The 23-year-old hacker allegedly also tapped into Tel Aviv's airport security to view passenger lists.
