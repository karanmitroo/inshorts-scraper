New York-based KeyMe, which lets users make digital copies of physical keys in under 30 seconds, has raised $15 million in Series C funding round, bringing the company's total funding to around $50 million. Founded in 2012, KeyMe enables customers to save their keys in the cloud, and recover a copy securely using fingerprint scanning at any of its kiosks.
