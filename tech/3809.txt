Australian consumer advocacy group Choice has released videos that show a hired actor spending 8 hours and 59 minutes to read the complete terms and conditions of Amazon Kindle. The e-reader's terms and conditions are 73,198 words long. The group has encouraged viewers to sign a petition demanding that such contract agreements should be easier for consumers to read.
