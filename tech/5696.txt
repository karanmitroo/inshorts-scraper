Tokyo-based scientists have demonstrated a way to project images onto objects that are moving unpredictably. For this, they combined two technologiesâ€“ a high-speed projector that can project 8-bit images at 1,000 frames-per-second and high-speed non-rigid surface tracking that follows the surface at the same rate. The team suggested the advancement could help develop 'interactive clothing'.
