Twitter’s Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has not posted on Instagram since the photo sharing site was acquired by Facebook in April 2012. Twitter, which was launched 10 years ago on July 15, reportedly ‘expressed interest’ in buying Instagram, months before its acquisition for $1 billion. Interestingly, Dorsey was one of the early investors of Instagram.
