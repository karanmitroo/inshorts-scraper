Russian social media network VKontakte allowed its users to remain anonymous for a day, letting them post on their friends' timelines with their name and profile picture hidden. The event was dedicated to mark Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to blow up the British Parliament on November 5, 1605. VKontakte considers Guy Fawkes' 'V' mask "a symbol of freedom and justice".
