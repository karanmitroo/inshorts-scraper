Dutch company Manus VR has developed virtual reality gloves that essentially turn users’ hands into game controllers. Using high-tech sensors, the washable gloves allow players to use natural hand and finger motions to play VR games instead of using external handheld controllers. The gloves cost $250 and are compatible with HTC Vive VR, Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR headsets.
