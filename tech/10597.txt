Google is reportedly testing a new feature in its Maps app that will detect when photos are taken at restaurants, and offer to attach them to the establishment's location. Currently, the feature is only available to Local Guides at level three and above, i.e, people who've contributed more than 50 reviews under a community of top reviewers on Google.
