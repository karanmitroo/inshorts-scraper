Anti-virus software McAfee's creator John McAfee has sued Intel over the company's warning to not use his name in new ventures. Intel bought McAfee software in 2010 and renamed it 'Intel Security'. While McAfee is planning to rename a digital gaming company as 'John McAfee Global Technologies', Intel says that any use of his name will infringe the companyâ€™s trademarks.
