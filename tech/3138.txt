A photo-clicking app on a stolen cellphone helped Ghaziabad Police trace a gang of three alleged robbers. The app clicked pictures of people who tried unlocking the phone, sending them to the owner's email address. The police said an accused, Nadeem, lured his friends into stealing because he had "several girlfriends" and not enough money to spend on them.
