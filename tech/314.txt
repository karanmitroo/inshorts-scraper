Google has released a new version of its GIF-making Android app 'Motion Stills' which adds augmented reality (AR) objects to GIFs and videos. Users can add chickens, dinosaurs and other objects to any horizontal surface in the shot. It also features instant motion tracking technology making it easy to insert objects while capturing footage.
