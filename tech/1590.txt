South Korea-based robot cleaner manufacturer Everybot has developed a â‚¹22,800 remote-controlled device named 'Everybot' to vacuum clean and mop floors. The oval-shaped device features multi-directional sensors to avoid obstacles and vertical drop-offs like staircases, or countertops. It also has a light sensor, which allows it to move into open space after mopping under furniture or the bed.
