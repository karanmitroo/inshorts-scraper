Singapore-based researchers have successfully transferred lemonade's taste through the internet. They used sensors to collect the colour and acidity of fresh lemonade, which was sent to a digital tumbler full of water. The tumbler's LEDs replicated the colour and electrodes reproduced the sourness on drinkers' taste buds. However, the artificially produced lemonade was less sour than the original.
