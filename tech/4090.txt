Japan's SoftBank Group on Thursday denied it was in talks with Vodafone's Indian unit and Idea Cellular to pick up a stake in a potential merger between the two. "We underline that we have held no such discussions and media reports about the same are baseless," said SoftBank's spokesperson. The merged entity could reportedly generate revenues of over â‚¹80,000 crore.
