Chinese drone company DJI has announced plans to open a 1,395-square-metre indoor arena for customers to learn how to fly a drone. The venue will be equipped with an adjustable LED-lit circuit to let people test their skills and an LCD TV for a first-person view from their drone. The arena will also be open for drone racing events.
