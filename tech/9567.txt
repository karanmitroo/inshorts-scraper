According to Chen Xudong, a senior executive at Lenovo, Google Play Services “will definitely re-enter the Chinese market this year”. The company had pulled out of China in 2010 after it refused to adhere to the government’s censorship policies. Google’s major services, including Google Maps and Google Now, are currently absent from China.
