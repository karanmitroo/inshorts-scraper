An international team of researchers has discovered the first earth-sized planet within the "habitable zone" of another star. The exoplanet, dubbed Kepler-186f, is located some 500 light years from Earth. "The discovery of Kepler-186f is a significant step toward finding worlds like our planet Earth," said Paul Hertz, Nasa's Astrophysics Division director.
