Indian smartphone manufacturer Micromax is developing its own operating system as well as a suite of services and apps which will run across its phones, tablets, televisions and wearables. The first smartphones with the new OS will reportedly be available by the end of this financial year. Xiaomi, Microsoft, and Samsung have done the same in the past.
