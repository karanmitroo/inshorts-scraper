The United Kingdom's public service broadcaster BBC suffered a cyber attack on Thursday rendering its main news website and other sites offline. The service was reportedly offline for over three hours. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyber attack was reportedly launched from multiple sources to crash the broadcaster's online services by swamping them with more traffic than their capacity.
