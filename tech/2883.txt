Google-owned video sharing platform YouTube on Friday suffered a brief outage in the US, Japan, Australia and some other regions. It remains unclear what caused the outage as YouTube's support team didn't confirm the outage on its official social media channels. While YouTube's website was up and running after some time, the mobile app took longer to come to normalcy.
