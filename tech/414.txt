A US woman has claimed that she placed an Amazon order for sauna hats from a seller named 'RussianBear' but instead received a $100 vial of a cancer drug that includes blue scorpion venom. The woman, Meagan Day, said she was refunded for the hats but is hoping to capitalise on the scorpion venom because it "is apparently very valuable".
