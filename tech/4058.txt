Ride-hailing startup Uber has called allegations by Google spinoff Waymo that Uber stole its self-driving car technology a "baseless attempt to slow down a competitor". Waymo's lawsuit claims that a former Google engineer stole 14,000 confidential documents, which he used to build cars for Uber's autonomous truck subsidiary Otto. Waymo is seeking the return of the allegedly stolen materials.
