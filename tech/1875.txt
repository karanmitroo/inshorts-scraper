In a first, US-based researchers have developed a lithium-ion battery that uses an inflammable water-in-salt gel electrolyte. The water-based electrolyte, even if exposed to the lithium anode, reacts slowly, preventing fire and explosion, otherwise caused in some commercially available non-aqueous batteries. The battery reaches the 4.0 volt mark desired for household electronics, researchers said.
