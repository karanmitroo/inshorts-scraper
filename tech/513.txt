Apple CEO Tim Cook has said, "I don't have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on... I don't want them on a social network." Cook also emphasised that he doesn't believe in the overuse of technology. "I'm not a person that says we've achieved success if you're using it all the time," Cook added.
