IBM has decided to all forego rights to an out-of-office email system patent, less than two months after receiving it. The system notifies people when the email recipient is not at their place of work. IBM faced criticism over the patent as it goes against a 2014 ruling disallowing companies to patent "abstract" software by tying it to "generic hardware".
