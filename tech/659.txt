US-based startup Modius Health has unveiled a headset called Modius at CES 2018 which claims to help in weight loss by sending electrical signals to the brain. Modius claims to stimulate the user's brain, making them want to eat less. Priced at $499, the headset is made of white plastic and has two bits that hang behind a user's ears.
