Photo-sharing app Instagram has rolled out its 'Stories' feature on mobile web. Stories appear at the top of the page when viewed on web and users can tap on the arrow icons to navigate between them. Although the users currently cannot post Stories on the web, the Facebook-owned app added it will launch the feature in coming months.
