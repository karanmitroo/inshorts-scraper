A team of researchers from UCLA developed a new high strength metal composite, which is very light in weight, by fusing magnesium and nanoparticles of silicon carbide compound. It has the highest strength-to-weight ratio among the materials with the same density. The applications of such a metal can prove helpful in manufacturing light-weight cars, planes and spaceships.
