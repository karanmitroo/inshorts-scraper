US-based startup Matrix Industries has developed a â‚¹11,000 smartwatch called 'Matrix PowerWatch' which can be powered by body heat. The watch uses thermoelectric technology to convert body heat into an energy source that can charge the battery continuously without cables. It also measures calories burned, activity level and sleep which can be tracked using a mobile app.
