South Korea-based researchers developed an aqueous hybrid energy storage device that can be charged within 20-30 seconds via a USB cable or a solar panel. The device showed 100-fold higher power density compared to conventional aqueous batteries while maintaining 100% capacity at a high charge/discharge current. The anode was made from a graphene-based polymer and cathode from a metal oxide.
