Google's video sharing platform YouTube has started rolling out notices below videos uploaded by news broadcasters that receive some level of government or public funding. The notice will appear below a video and above its title and will also include a link to a news broadcaster's Wikipedia page, YouTube said. The feature is currently available in the United States.
