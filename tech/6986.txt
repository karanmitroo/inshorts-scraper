Canadian startup Grobo has launched a device that lets users grow cannabis at home via a connected app. Users can fill the device's reservoir with water and nutrients, insert seeds into its base and start the growing process via the app. The $899 device monitors the condition of the plant, adjusts its watering schedule, and informs when ready to harvest.
