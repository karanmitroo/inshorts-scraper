Technology news website Techdirt has said that it is "fighting for (its) life" after being sued by Indian-origin scientist Shiva Ayyadurai for questioning his claims that he invented email. "This fight could very well be the end of Techdirt, even if we are completely on the right side of the law," said the company in a blog.
