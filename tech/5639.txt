Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on Wednesday said he would have pursued buying Twitter if shareholders had not learned of his plans. The CEO of the cloud computing company said, "We've never had a deal leak before...We had to stop because I'm running the business in partnership with my shareholders." Disney and Google have also reportedly refused to buy Twitter.
