In a breakthrough, scientists in the UK have achieved the "fastest ever" broadband speeds of 1.4 terabits per second - enough to transmit 44 high-definition movies at once. Remarkably, the joint test by British Telecom and Alcatel-Lucent achieved the speed on the existing fibre network in London i.e. in "real world" conditions, outside testing labs.
