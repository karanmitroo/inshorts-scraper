Google on Monday updated its 'Google Flights' app to notify users when the price of a flight is expected to increase. A pop-up card will indicate how much the cost will go up for selected flights and in how many days. Additionally, the app will share tips on how to find cheaper tickets by showing nearby airports and alternative dates.
