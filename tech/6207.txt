Social media giant Facebook has apologised for disabling the accounts of several Palestinian journalists and activists. "The pages were removed in error and restored as soon as we were able to investigate," said Facebook. The journalists, however, believe that Facebook bowed to the pressure by the Israeli government to rein in content that, Israel feels, incites violence.
