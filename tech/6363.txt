Apple on Thursday disabled the option to search for "butt" GIFs in iMessage after it was discovered that the first result was a sexualised image from the animated series 'My Little Pony'. Search results for words like "breasts", "ass", "sex" and "porn" are already blocked from the messaging service. GIF search is a default part of the latest iMessage update.
