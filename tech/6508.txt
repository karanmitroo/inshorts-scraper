The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) has launched an app to help activists under threat of 'enforced disappearance'. The app, disguised as a calculator, sends an email containing the activist's arrest location to their emergency contacts and the ECRF when a code is entered. According to the ECRF, 1,250 people disappeared in the first eight months of 2015.
