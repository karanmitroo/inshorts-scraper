Barbie manufacturer Mattel on Saturday unveiled 'The Hello Barbie Dreamhouse', a Wi-Fi enabled smart house for the doll. Controlled through a dedicated app, the doll house talks directly to the kids through voice recognition. The kids can customise the colours of the light in various rooms, control elevator, request breakfast and turn party mode on through voice commands.
