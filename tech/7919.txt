University of Basel researchers have developed 'vitrivr', an open-source system that allows searching for items from image and video databases using hand-drawn sketches on tablets or interactive paper. Users can draw specific movement directions to search for videos with particular objects in motion. The searches can also be augmented by a range of other query types for more specific results.
