In a letter to Apple, investors Jana Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) have urged the smartphone maker to address the growing addiction of iPhones among youth. They also asked the company to consider developing software that will let parents limit children's phone usage. Jana and CalSTRS together reportedly control Apple shares worth about $2 billion.
