A team of six NASA recruits has begun a year-long isolation programme in a dome in Hawaii to simulate life as it would be on Mars. The dome, which is 11m in diameter and 6m tall, is self-contained and solar-powered. The team has an astrobiologist, a physicist, a pilot, a doctor/journalist, an architect, and a soil scientist.
