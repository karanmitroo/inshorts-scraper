After the US transferred complete control of internet registries to ICANN, the security of the Internet's core is now controlled by seven members of the organisation. The seven members with secret keys can together unlock a master-key to access ICANN's database that manages web addresses. People controlling this database could control the Internet by directing people's access to the web.
