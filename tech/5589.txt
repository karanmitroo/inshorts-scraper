Carnegie Mellon University researchers have created the first programming language to build reliable software for computers that operate by harvesting energy from their environment. The new language, called Chain, modifies the way computational operations manipulate the computer's memory, to ensure tasks execute correctly despite arbitrary power failures that occur in energy-harvesting devices.
