Google has released a new app, called Verne: The Himalayas, that enables exploring Google Maps' 3D imagery of the Himalayas alongside a 500-foot yeti, named Verne. It acts like a third-person adventure game where a user is controlling the yeti through onscreen controls. Google had previously built similar 3D imagery of New York City, the Grand Canyon and Mont Blanc.
