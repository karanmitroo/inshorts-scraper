With a record 40.4 percent conversion efficiency, Australian researchers have set a world record for the highest levels of solar power efficiency ever achieved, a report said Monday. This has eclipsed the previous world solar power efficiency record of 36 percent. The development is expected to make the solar energy a stronger competitor of fossil fuels.
