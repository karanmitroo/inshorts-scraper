Researchers have created the world's smallest working violin by incorporating Google's Project Soli, a tiny radar-based chip that detects mid-air finger movements with a Wekinator device. When users rub their thumb and forefinger over the device, the chip converts the movements into a sound similar to a violin. To recreate the violin sound, the device was taught different finger movements.
