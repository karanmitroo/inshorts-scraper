Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform Instagram has started testing 'Direct', a standalone app which offers private messaging for users. When a user installs Direct, the inbox will disappear from the Instagram app and can only be accessed in the new messaging app. Direct will be Facebook's third standalone messaging application after WhatsApp and Messenger.
