Dating app Tinder has introduced a new swipe-up option to let a user 'super like' someone's profile. Also, when the 'super liked' person comes across the person's profile who has 'super liked' him/her, they will see a blue coloured badge on their profile. The feature is currently being tested with users in Australia, giving them one 'super like' per day.
