Britain's Peter Higgs and Belgium's Francois Englert have been jointly awarded 2013-Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for predicting the existence of the Higgs boson. The two scientists had been favourites to share the $1.25 million prize after their theoretical work was finally vindicated by experiments at the CERN research centre's gigantic particle collider.
