Researchers at University of Oklahoma have developed a robotic exoskeleton that helps children susceptible to develop cerebral palsy. Power steering of the motorised device gives babies the ability to learn to crawl normally, promoting brain growth and development of motor skills. The team has also developed a method to detect the illness in children aged two to eight months.
