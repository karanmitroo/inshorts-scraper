iOS beta app 'Hater,' created by former Goldman Sachs employee Brendan Alper, matches people based on what they dislike from 3,000 pre-determined topics. The list of potential dislikes includes butt selfies, slow walkers, and Donald Trump among others. Users are required to swipe down to hate, up to love, left to dislike or right to like.
