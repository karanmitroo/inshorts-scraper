Swedish startup MyFC on Wednesday unveiled a new device called JAQ that uses salt water and oxygen to convert chemical energy into electricity, which in turn can be used to charge mobiles. The device contains a credit card-shaped 'power card' filled with salt water which can be inserted into a port, generating around 1,800 mAH electricity.
