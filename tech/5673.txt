US' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has tested a parasailing radar array using its robotic 'Sea Hunter' boat. The array was flown up to 1,000 feet, where its surface tracking radar has six times more range than at ship level. This could lead to unmanned warships that easily detect potential threats before they come within firing range.
