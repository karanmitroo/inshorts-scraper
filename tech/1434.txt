Social media platform Twitter on Thursday introduced a safety calendar on features to curb online harassment and abuse. It includes suspending accounts of violent groups, along with a ban on abusive or hateful usernames. The move comes a week after CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that the platform wasn't doing enough to tackle bullies and trolls.
