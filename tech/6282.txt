California-based startup LuDela has developed a 'smart' candle with a real flame for $99 which can be lit, extinguished and controlled via an app. Branded as the "world's safest" candle, it auto extinguishes when knocked over and also has a timer and child lock. The battery-powered candle also ensures that hot candle wax doesn't drip.
