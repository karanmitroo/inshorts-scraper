South Korea has taken a government website showing the number of women of childbearing age, between 15 and 49 years, by district and region offline just a day after launch. A notice on the site said it was undergoing corrections to reflect public opinion. The pink-coloured map was reportedly part of the government's drive to reverse a falling birth rate.
