US-based startup Onvi has developed a smart electronic toothbrush 'Prophix', which live streams the inside of the users' mouth on their smartphones through an app. Priced at $400, it also allows users to take pictures of the interior of their mouths and choose from various attachments including mirror, rubber scaler and others. Prophix's app also provides tips to improve brushing.
