Watchmaker Grayton has made a new watch called 'Origin' featuring a mechanical dial paired with a smart strap that tracks fitness activity and controls music through a button. The fitness activity data can be seen on a smartphone connected to the strap through a dedicated app. The band charges through a USB port hidden under the end of the strap.
