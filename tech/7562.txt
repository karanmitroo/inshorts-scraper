San Francisco is seeking to put a 'Tech tax' bill for a citywide vote in November this year. The bill states that the city's large technology employers, potentially including Google, Twitter, Uber, Airbnb and Salesforce, would need to pay a 1.5% payroll tax. An estimated $120 million revenue from tax will be used to provide affordable housing to the poor.
