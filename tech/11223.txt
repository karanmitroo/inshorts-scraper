Google has filed a patent for toys that will be designed to interact wirelessly with media devices. The animal-shaped toys will use microphones, speakers and cameras for listening, turning their heads and taking commands from children to play music. The "anthropomorphic device" was designed by Wayne deVaul and Daniel Aminzade.
