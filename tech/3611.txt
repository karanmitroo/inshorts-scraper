British fashion students have created 3D printing machine 'Kniterate' that knits digital designs into items like sweaters and scarves. Priced at about â‚¹4.8 lakh, Kniterate will have a connected smartphone app to let users create designs, select the colour and customise the type of stitches among other things. The machine then uses colourful yarn to 'print' out the wearable items.
