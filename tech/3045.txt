The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday granted bail to former Managing Director Mohit Goel and Sumit Kumar of Noida-based company Ringing Bells that claimed to make the world's cheapest smartphone 'Freedom 251'. The two were arrested in February after a Ghaziabad-based distributor alleged that the company had 'defrauded' him of â‚¹16 lakh.
