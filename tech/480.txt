Facebook employee Matt King, who lost his sight, is working to verbalise online content and enable the visually impaired to 'see' and determine appropriate content on the platform. King also worked on 'screen reader' which uses audio cues or braille to 'see' content on the screen. He previously worked on 'automated alt-text' which describes audibly what is in Facebook images.
