Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan has unveiled 'ProPILOT Chair', a self-driving chair which uses the technology developed for its autonomous cars. The self-propelling chair detects surrounding chairs and follows the chair ahead of it, maintaining a fixed distance and travelling along a set path. The chair has been made available to Japanese restaurants on rent to let waiting guests sit.
