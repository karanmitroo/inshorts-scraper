A US-based startup ZEROi has created a â‚¹8,000 Bluetooth-connected hat that lets users listen to music or make phone calls without earphones. It comes with four built-in bone conduction speakers that transfer sound to users' inner ear by transmitting sound waves through the bones in the skull. The water-resistant hat can last up to 5 hours on a single charge.
