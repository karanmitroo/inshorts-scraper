Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during the automaker's quarterly earnings call, said that "it's not clear" what technology major Apple is doing on the car front. Apple was recently granted a permit to test self-driving car technology on public roads. According to reports, Apple is not developing its own car, but building autonomous technology that it can license to other companies.
