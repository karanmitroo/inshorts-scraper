Facebook has been accused of age discrimination after a report showed that they allowed employers to exclude older users from seeing their job ads. Companies mentioned in the report, including Amazon and Verizon, were found to have used ads targeting certain age groups. Last month, Facebook was also accused of excluding users by 'ethnic' and 'multicultural' affinities in housing ads.
