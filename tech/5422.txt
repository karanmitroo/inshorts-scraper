US-based food ordering major Grubhub's CEO Matt Maloney on Wednesday wrote an anti-Donald Trump e-mail to his employees, asking the ones supporting Trump's 'hateful attitude' to resign. "While demeaning, insulting and ridiculing minorities, immigrants and the physically/mentally disabled worked for Trump, I want to be clear that this behaviour and views, have no place at Grubhub," he said.
