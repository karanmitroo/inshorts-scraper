The Swiss firm, Swiss Space Systems, has just launched what it claims will be the world's cheapest ZeroG flight - at price starting Rs.1.58 lakh (1,600 pounds). The passengers will get a feeling of weightlessness for just over six minutes in total - allowing them to feel similar sensations to that of an astronaut floating on the International Space Station.
