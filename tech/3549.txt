Google is reportedly in talks to invest $875 million (over â‚¹5,600 crore) in LG Display to develop a stable supply of flexible OLED screens for its Pixel smartphones. The move would also reduce Google's reliance on suppliers like Samsung Display. This comes after reports suggested that Apple has ordered 70 million OLED panels from Samsung for its upcoming iPhone smartphones.
