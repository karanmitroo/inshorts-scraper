Amazon has patented a voice-controlled drone that's small enough to fit in the pocket. Amazon says that the drone can help find lost cars in parking lots, lost children in a grocery store, and tell how many persons are ahead of the owner in a queue. It would also respond to instructions from an app and return to its owner.
