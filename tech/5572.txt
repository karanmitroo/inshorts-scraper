An Israeli firm named Aquarius Engines claims to have created an internal combustion engine with more than twice the efficiency of currently available alternatives. The $100 engine, which the firm says can allow cars to run up to 1,600 km on a full tank, replaces the traditional multiple-vertical piston engine with a novel single-horizontal piston design.
