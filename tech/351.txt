Yahoo once made an offer to buy social networking site Facebook for $1 billion in 2006, but the offer was turned down by Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook is currently worth about $550 billion while Yahoo was acquired by Verizon for $4.5 billion last year. Notably, the social networking site was founded as 'The Facebook' on February 4, 2004.
