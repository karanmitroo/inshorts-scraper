Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison claim to have developed the world's fastest stretchable and wearable integrated circuits which contain two small intertwining power transmission lines in repeating S-curves. The 25-micrometre thick circuits operate at 40 gigahertz and features metal blocks that act as shields from any interference while also providing flexibility.
