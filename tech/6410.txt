California-based mobile accessories company Spigen has developed a cable priced at $10 to strap Apple's upcoming wireless AirPods together. Users can place the rubber strap around their neck like regular earbuds to keep the AirPods from getting lost. Apple AirPods will retail for $159 starting from October.
