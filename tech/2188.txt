Elon Musk-backed startup OpenAI's bot on Friday defeated the world champion human player Danylo 'Dendi' Ishutin in a demonstration match of online game Dota 2. Dendi forfeited future matches against the bot after losing two consecutive matches. OpenAI engineers claimed the bot learned enough to beat Dota 2 pros in just two weeks of real-time learning.
