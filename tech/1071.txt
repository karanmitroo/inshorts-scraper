Instagram Co-founder Mike Krieger, who was born in Brazil, has said he "almost" didn't start Instagram with Kevin Systrom because he wasn't able to get an American visa to be his Co-founder. Krieger added, "when you're founding a company... you can't wait for months" to get the visa. He said that Systrom had already raised funding before he signed in.
