Researchers at Disney's innovation labs have developed a method that can identify different gadgets based on their electromagnetic fields. The team tested 40 devices including 24-inch Dell LCD displays, Lightsaber toys and iPhone 6 handsets. The gadgets' electromagnetic signals were fed into a specialized software through a scanner, which then created a digital fingerprint of each device.
