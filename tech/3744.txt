British police have released an audio clip of a four-year-old boy who used Apple's digital assistant Siri to call emergency services and save his mother's life. After finding his mother lying motionless, the boy pressed her thumb to her iPhone's home button to access Siri. Paramedics reached the location in 13 minutes to give the woman life-saving first aid.
