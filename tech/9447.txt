Google blocked 780 million 'bad ads' in 2015, an increase of almost 50% from the previous year. It also suspended 10,000 websites and 18,000 accounts for selling fake goods, and blocked over 12.5 million ads for trying to sell unapproved drugs and pharmaceuticals. Bad ads cover the likes of malware, the promotion of fake or illicit goods and intrusive ads that cover up content.
