US startup Moonshine Crea has developed a unisex shoe 'MoonWalker' that defies gravity and gives the user a feeling of walking on the Moon's surface. The moon-walking sensation comes from within the two layers of the shoe which consists of magnets placed with opposite poles that are repulsive. The repulsion makes the person wearing the shoe feel light.
