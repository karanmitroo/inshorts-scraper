Over 600 Facebook users, belonging to West Bengal's tribal communities, have decided to hold a 'Kolkata Adibasi Facebook Meet' on April-5, to use Facebook for the development of the communities. "We are trying to translate the virtual friendship into real bonding so that this platform can be used to promote development and unity among the tribal members," an organiser said.
