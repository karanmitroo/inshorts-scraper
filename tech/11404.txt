NASA has officially launched a project to find life beyond our solar system. Called 'The Nexus for Exoplanet System Science', the project will help NASA develop missions to hunt for exoplanets in the 2020s and beyond. The project aims at "a synthesised approach in the search for planets with the greatest potential for signs of life", a NASA researcher said.
