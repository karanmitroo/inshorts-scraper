Several official Facebook Pages belonging to news company CNN were on Sunday briefly taken over by hacker group OurMine. On each page, the group left its logo and a message that read, "Hey, it's OurMine we are just testing your security, please contact us for more information". Previously, the group had hacked Twitter accounts of Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg.
