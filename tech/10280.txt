Scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US have concluded that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the present rate, the Antarctic ice shelves would be in danger of collapse by 2100. The findings were based on satellite observations of surface melting and climate simulations. Widespread collapse of Antarctic ice shelves could lead to dramatic sea level rise.
