Dashrath Patel, a repairman from Gujarat, has developed an 'AC Sofa', which works like a split AC and consumes less electricity than tower air-conditioners. Patel was helped by an NID alumnus Ankit Vyas. "The air-flow will come out from the hand-rest part of the sofa", Vyas said. Patel plans to launch the sofa in the market at Rs 1-1.25 lakh.
