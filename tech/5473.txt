Apple is temporarily cutting prices of its USB-C adapters for connecting smartphones to its new MacBook Pro laptops following complaints about connectivity issues. The laptops only feature four USB-C ports and a headphone jack. "We recognize that many users rely on legacy connectors to get work done today... We want to help them move to the latest technology," said Apple.
