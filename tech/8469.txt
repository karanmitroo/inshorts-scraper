Alphabet-owned Schaft has unveiled a new two-legged robot in Tokyo that has rigid legs that slide up and down like rails, and no arms. The robot can lift without bending, climb stairs and carry payloads of up to 60 kilograms. It is also shown navigating a forest floor, rocky beach, snowy field, and even vacuuming stairs with its feet.
