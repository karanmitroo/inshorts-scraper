Apple has won a trademark case against Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi for registering 'Mi Pad' tablet computer as an EU trademark. Apple opposed the application filed by Xiaomi in 2014 claiming that the name was similar to 'iPad'. The presence of an additional letter 'm' at the beginning of 'Mi Pad' isn't sufficient to offset the similarity, the court said.
