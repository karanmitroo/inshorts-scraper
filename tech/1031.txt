US-based image-sharing platform Imgur has reported a data breach which occurred in 2014 and affected email addresses and passwords of 1.7 million user accounts. Imgur claimed that it was notified of a potential security breach this week and said that personally-identifying information such as addresses weren't compromised. Breach might have occurred due to an older hashing algorithm, Imgur added.
