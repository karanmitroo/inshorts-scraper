The US state of Washington has filed a lawsuit against Indian tech support firm iYogi for allegedly pressuring customers to buy unnecessary software. The lawsuit claims iYogi associated itself to major tech companies in online ads, and alarmed consumers by claiming benign complex files were "infected" to sell tech support. Americans reportedly lose $1.5 billion annually in tech support scams.
