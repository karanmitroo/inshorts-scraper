The new operating system of Apple - Yosemite - is now available as a free download starting Thursday. The latest OS allows users search for content on the computer and on the Internet at once, similar to a feature that was seen in Microsoft's Windows 8.1 system. The OS also provides more privacy controls to Mac's Safari Web browser.
