Facebook has apologised for a 'bug' on Messenger that suggests the vomit sticker when searching for 'liberals' or 'feminism', after it was pointed out by users through Twitter. The company said that the search algorithm was being fixed to rectify the problem. The algorithm is built to suggest the most appropriate stickers when a particular keyword is searched for.
