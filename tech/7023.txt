Carnegie Mellon University's team was awarded $2 million on Friday after their project "Mayhem" won the first all-machine cyber hacking tournament by US Defence agency, DARPA. The teams' systems had to perform certain tasks while constantly being fed new bug-filled code with security holes and inefficiencies. Teams had to protect their own data while attempting to access others' data.
