Coffee chain Starbucks will reportedly launch its mobile payment and loyalty app in India this year. Besides allowing users to make payments through the app and adding loyalty points directly to the customers' accounts, the app will also show the nearest store location and menu options. Starbucks entered India in 2012 by forming a joint venture with Tata Global Beverages.
