A team of astronomers led by Indian-origin scientist have discovered a supermassive black hole at the center of the smallest galaxy M60-UCD1. The dwarf galaxy is located 54 million light years from Earth and is much smaller than our own Milky Way. M60-UCD1 is packed with 140 million stars within a diameter of 300 light-years–1/500th of our galaxy’s diameter.
