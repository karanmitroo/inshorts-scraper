China will have most robots in the world, in its production plants by 2017, International Federation of Robotics said. Currently, China lags far behind other countries in terms of robot density, with just 30 robots per 10,000 workers in manufacturing industries. But a race by car-makers to build plants will double the number of industrial robots to 428,000 by 2017.
