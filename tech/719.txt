Apple's offer to replace batteries at $29 may cut sales of new handsets by 16 million units in 2018, according to Barclays. Out of an estimated 519 million users eligible for the offer, 10% are likely to accept it and 30% of those will likely not buy an iPhone. The offer came after Apple admitted to slowing down old iPhones.
