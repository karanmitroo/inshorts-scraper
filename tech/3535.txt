Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has said that the social media platform's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the reason she's still "walking" after the death of her husband in 2015. "When I felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry, I would grab him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me," she added.
