US-based scientists have made a paper-thin, flexible device using nanotechnology. The material can act as a microphone by converting mechanical energy (sound vibrations) to electrical. Inversely, when embedded on a flag, the nano-fabric turned it into a loudspeaker when powered via a music player. The breakthrough could lead to foldable loudspeakers, and even talking newspapers, scientists said.
