According to a Tumblr post, a user named 'perchbird' uses a DJI phantom drone to cheat at Nintendo's recently released record-breaking augmented reality game Pokémon Go. He reportedly used an app called AirDroid to mirror his phone's screen to his laptop. Since the AirDroid app requires internet to operate, the drone was restricted to the WiFi's broadcast area of 50 feet.
