US-based startup Puretta has developed a device which claims to clean poop particles from toothbrushes by sterilising them using UV light. The device, called 'Puretta' is a wall attachment with a toothbrush holder, toothpaste, and floss dispenser, and also has a solar panel for charging. Priced between ₹3,800 to ₹4,800, the device is expected to ship in October 2017.
