NASA, in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the US, has successfully flown 22 drones simultaneously in several locations over the span of three hours to test a drone traffic management system. The space agency called this the most complex test yet of a drone traffic management system and the firstÂ and the largest demonstration of its kind.
