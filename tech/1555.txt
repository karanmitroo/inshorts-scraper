British Interior Minister Amber Rudd on Tuesday said that WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption communication services allowed paedophiles and other criminals to operate beyond the reach of the law. Adding that she wants the "flawed" technology to be changed, Rudd called on technology giants including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft to go further and faster to counter extremist material.
