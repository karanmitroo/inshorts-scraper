Ex-Google engineer James Damore, who was fired this week over 10-page anti-diversity memo, has revealed he started writing the memo while on a 12-hour flight. Damore revealed that he created the document to clear his thoughts after attending a "secretive" diversity training session. Damore claims there was "hypocrisy in a lot of the things" that were discussed at the session.
