New Zealand-based Apple carrier Spark used 100 mini robots instead of humans to line-up in the queue to buy the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at an Apple Store. The 100 Alpha 1 robots were specially purchased by the company for the purpose. The humans assigned to each robot had the option of watching a live-stream of the queue.
