In a final roundup, Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) program AlphaGo on Tuesday beat world champion Lee Sedol by 4-1 to win the five-game series of the Chinese board game ‘Go’. AlphaGo had already clinched a series victory with its third consecutive win last Saturday. Last year, AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a human professional player at the game.
