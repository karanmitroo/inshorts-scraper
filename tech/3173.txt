Instagram's VP of Product Kevin Weil, when questioned about the platform copying features introduced by Snapchat, said, "This is the way the tech industry works." He added, "Good ideas start in one place and spread across the industry...Kudos to Snapchat for being the first." Weil compared the 'Stories' feature to hashtags which originated from Twitter but spread to other platforms.
