To mark the 400th death anniversary of William Shakespeare, Twitter on Saturday launched a dedicated Shakespeare emoji. Twitter has also launched a dedicated hashtag #ShakespeareLives to let users tweet their tribute to the English poet, playwright and actor. The micro-blogging platform will also post tweets from users imagining what Shakespeare would tweet if he were alive.
