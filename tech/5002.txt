Swiss startup Moskito has created a smartwatch whose dial can be detached from the straps and mounted between the handlebars of a bicycle to act as a speedometer. In the speedometer mode, the watch's second hand shows the current speed and the minute hand shows the total distance travelled. The device also shows call and text notifications from Bluetooth-connect smartphones.
