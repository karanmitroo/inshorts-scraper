Facebook has launched its 'Marketplace' to buy and sell used goods and services across categories such as electronics, entertainment, and housing in India. For used goods, it allows sellers to register by including details like price, category, location and images.  The platform also allows buyers to see details like product condition, usage pattern and time of purchase.
