Samsung will cut OLED panel production in response to Apple's decision to reduce iPhone X output following weak demand, Nikkei Asian Review reported. While the initial plan was to supply panels for 45-50 million iPhones, Samsung now plans to manufacture panels for 20 million iPhones. Samsung's display business is expected to see a year-on-year profit decline for 2018's first half.
