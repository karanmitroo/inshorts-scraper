Talking about Steve Jobs, Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak said the former "didn't know anything about insides of a computer". "I knew Steve Jobs for five years before Apple. He wasn't an engineer but he knew how to look at products. Steve wanted to live a zero money life, he was more of a true hippie," added Wozniak.
