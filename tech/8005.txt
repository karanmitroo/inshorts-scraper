Google's Project Jacquard and Levi's have jointly developed 'Commuter', a washable smart jacket that allows cyclists to control their music, answer phone calls and access navigation by tapping and swiping on the sleeve. A smart Jacquard tag is embedded in the jacketâ€™s sleeve which can be pulled out and charged via USB. The jacket will be publicly available in 2017.
