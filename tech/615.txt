Facebook has revamped its News Feed to prioritise content from users' friends and family, instead of content from publishers and brands. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was "changing the goal from focusing on helping users find relevant content to helping them have more meaningful social interactions". He added the move would affect short-term engagement, but would be beneficial overall.
