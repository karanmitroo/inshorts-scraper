MIT researchers have developed a new photography technique that can produce glare-less photos by beaming light on to the objects in the photos and then measuring the arrival times and the intensity of the reflected light. This technique could enable removing reflections from digital photographs shot through surfaces like glass. The team had collaborated with Microsoft Research for the development.
