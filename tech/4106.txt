A Twitter user with the handle @pixelatedboat has shared an edited version of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent post with his wife Priscilla Chan. The original post shows the two reading a newspaper with the caption thanking journalists who "put their lives in danger to surface the truth." However, the edited post shows Zuckerberg making fun of a journalist.
