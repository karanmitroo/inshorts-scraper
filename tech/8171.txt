Delta Air Lines is set to introduce a technology which it claims will allow passengers to track their bags and ensure that they never lose their baggage again. The airlines will use RFID-embedded paper bag tags and an app that will allow the tracking of bags at each stage till the right owner picks it up at the airport.
