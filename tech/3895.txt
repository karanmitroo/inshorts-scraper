App development program IranCubator has launched an application called 'Hamdam' that acts as a period tracker, but secretly gives Iranian women information about birth control, divorce, and domestic violence. The app also explains the legal language the women can use in a marriage contract for better rights pertaining to child custody, the ability to work, or to go to school.
