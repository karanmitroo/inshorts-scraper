Intel and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust have jointly created a smart bangle called 'Coel' that provides around 80 pre-recorded pregnancy tips to women. The bangle is water resistant and made of high-quality durable plastic, capable to last for 10 months on a single charge. It can also alert about the presence and level of indoor air pollution.
