South Korean electronics maker Samsung on Monday bought Harman, a US-based auto and audio product making company, for $8 billion in an all-cash deal. The move will help Samsung in its plan to enter the smart car market. Samsung said this is the largest ever overseas deal by a single South Korean company.
