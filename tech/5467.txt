After a user claimed that his Reliance Lyf smartphone exploded and caught fire on Saturday, Jammu and Kashmir's former CM, Omar Abdullah refused to use his handset. "This looks like it was a very narrow escape. I won't be using my handset anytime soon, that's for sure", Abdullah tweeted. Lyf smartphones are a product of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio.
