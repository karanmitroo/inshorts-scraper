Subsidiary of Samsung, Cheil advertising agency has developed a "smart vest" to turn stray dogs into street guards in Thailand. The vest has a hidden video camera and sensors transmitting live streaming videos when the dog barks, via a mobile phone. The agency said more tests are required before the vest could be given for trial runs.
