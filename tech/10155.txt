According to data from NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft released on Thursday, the red planet’s erstwhile outer atmosphere layer, believed to be warm and wet, was stripped away by solar winds. This has resulted in Mars losing atmospheric gas to space, rendering itself warm and arid from a potentially habitable planet.
