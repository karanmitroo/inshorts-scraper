University of California researchers have developed a wearable sensor that can detect harmful chemical substances, explosives, and toxic nerve agents. The device consists of an electrochemical sensor and a circuit board which can alert a smartphone on detection of hazardous substances. Researchers highlighted the need for such devices amid "increasing terrorist threats and political instability".
