Australia-based gadget accessories maker Nomad has made a leather wallet that has an in-built iPhone charger. The wallet includes a non-removable 2400 mAh battery integrated with a lightning cable, which claims enough capacity to fully charge an iPhone. While a slimmer version of the wallet sells for $120, a bi-fold version of the wallet costs $150.
