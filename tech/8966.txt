Facebook has launched its ads Canvas feature that allows users to access ads directly from their News Feeds without leaving the app. The immersive technology loads full-screen rich media ads in-app that can be viewed in about a second. The feature lets advertisers put interactive elements like animations, product catalogs, tilt-to-view images and videos in their ads at no additional cost.
