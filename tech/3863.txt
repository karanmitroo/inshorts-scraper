The price of Bitcoin plunged by 25% to hit below the $1,000-mark during Friday, before recovering. The digital currency had touched a new all-time high of around $1,325 on Friday morning. The plunge came after US regulators declined a proposal to create the first exchange-traded fund for Bitcoin, which would have made it easier for ordinary investors to buy Bitcoins.
