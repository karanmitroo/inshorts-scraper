Tech giant Apple went public 36 years ago on December 12, 1980, and the IPO created nearly 300 millionaires. The instant millionaires included 40 of the company's early employees and investors, including Co-founder Steve Jobs, who made $217 million alone as the single largest shareholder. Apple is presently the world's most valuable brand, with a brand value of $154 billion.
