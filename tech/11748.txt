The Hubble Space Telescope, that has been circling in space for over 20 years, has captured the image of a galaxy cluster SDSS J1038+4849 which resembles a smiley. The image has two glowing yellow eyes and curved lines forming a face and a smile. While the glowing eyes are two distant galaxies, the smile is due to "strong gravitational lensing."
