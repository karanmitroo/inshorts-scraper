Disconnect, maker of an Android privacy app banned from the Play store, has filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission (EU) accusing Google of abusing its market position. Google banned the Disconnect app last year, saying it violated its developer distribution agreement. "..They [Google] said we interfered with the ability of third parties to serve ads..," Disconnect CEO said.
