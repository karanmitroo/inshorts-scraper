UK-based startup Blue Maestro has developed a smart pacifier named 'Pacif-i' which can measure and monitor a baby's temperature from a range of 30 feet. Connected through an app, it can also record medication during baby's illness and sends alert on the smartphone about its location. Claimed to be medium-sized, the pacifier can be used by babies of all ages.
