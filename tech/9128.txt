Sony has launched a new universal remote, the Huis remote controller, thatÂ can be used to operate several devices including TVs, lights, audio systems, and air conditioners. The remote features a low-power e-ink screen that allows users to customize the button layout for each device, so they only see the most-used controls. The remote is currently available in Japan for $245.
