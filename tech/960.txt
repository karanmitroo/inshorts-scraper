US-based developer Charles Darius has developed a â‚¹6,440 bracelet called Bolt Charging Bracelet which also works as a phone charger. The device turns into a thin USB to Lightning cable, with a light pull allowing users to charge or sync their devices at convenience. However, the device is only compatible with Apple devices including iPhone, iPad and iPod.
