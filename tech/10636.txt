Space burial service company Elysium Space is about to execute its first burial on the moon. Steve Jenks of Tennessee has booked the service for his motherâ€™s ashes to be landed upon the lunar surface. Elysium also offers for cremated remains to be launched into orbit. The New Horizons spacecraft is already carrying astronomer Clyde Tombaugh's ashes into deep space.
