Amazon was granted a patent for noise-cancelling headphones that listen for specific keywords and respond by automatically turning off the noise-canceling feature for the user to hear surrounding sounds. It can also turn the feature back on again based on other keywords. The headphones can be used in noisy environments where the user needs to pay attention to specific sounds.
