NATO has released a statement claiming that the recent Petya and WannaCry ransomware attacks were done by a state actor, meaning they could potentially be viewed as acts of war. NATO added it will consider responding with "countermeasures". A countermeasure is any state response which would typically be illegal, but can be authorised following internationally wrongful acts by another state.
