Consumer-advocacy organisation Consumer Reports on Monday ranked autonomous carmaker Tesla 25 on a list of 29 automakers, calling it one of the least reliable car brands. Consumer Reports has also listed Tesla's Model X as the sixth least reliable car of 2016, calling it "more showy than practical". The car's "falcon wing" doors are said to be a problem area.
