WhatsApp has been fined over ₹21 crore in Italy for forcing users to share their personal data with the app's owner Facebook. All of the 28 European Union data protection authorities have asked WhatsApp to stop sharing users’ data with Facebook. In 2016, Facebook had changed WhatsApp's privacy policy, allowing transfer of the users’ personal information to Facebook for processing.
