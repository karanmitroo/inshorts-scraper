Facebook has denied censoring a viral video taken on Wednesday night after a police officer fatally shot a man in his car in Minnesota. “We’re very sorry that the video was temporarily inaccessible. It was down due to a technical glitch and restored as soon as we were able to investigate,” said a Facebook spokesperson.
