US-based startup Mode Modern has created a â‚¹19,500 smart pillow that tracks the users' sleep and wakes them up by creating lighting effect similar to the rising Sun. It has built-in speakers that play any selected music from the pillow's dedicated app. The pillow also records voices while the user is asleep so that sleep disruptions can be traced easily.
