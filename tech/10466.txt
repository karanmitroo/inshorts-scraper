The new version of the operating system in Apple's iPhones, iPads and iPods- iOS 9- was made available for download starting from Wednesday. A split-screen multi tasking mode is part of the update for iPads. It is the first version of the platform to support the 3D Touch and has a feature to show the battery consumption of each app.
