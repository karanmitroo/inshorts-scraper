Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp is currently testing a new feature on its iOS app that lets users edit or revoke an already sent message. The feature can be accessed by long-pressing a sent message. However, the new feature will reportedly be available only for the texts which have not been seen by the recipient.
