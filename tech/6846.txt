McDonald's has stopped distributing 'Step It' activity trackers with Happy Meals, less than a week after introducing the wearables in US and Canada following claims that they could cause rashes. "We have taken this swift and voluntary step after receiving limited reports of potential skin irritations that may be associated from wearing the band," said a McDonald's spokesperson.
