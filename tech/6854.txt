American television channel Cable News Network (CNN) has launched a new initiative to use drones to gather news footage. Named CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR), the project will employ two full-time drone operators to collect footage for its platforms. CNN has used drones in recent past to cover stories like the Flint water crisis and the Louisiana floods.
