California-based startup Bagel Labs has created a digital measuring tape that can save measurements, record voice memos and send data to its companion mobile app. It features three different modes of measuring distances â€“ string, wheel and remote. The device can be used to measure distances up to 10 feet using a string that can withstand up to 50 kgs.
