Pokémon Go has become the biggest ever mobile game in the US history by beating Candy Crush with nearly 21 million daily active users. This number is also higher than Twitter's daily active users. Android users in the country are spending more time on Pokémon Go than Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Interestingly, Pokémon Go's app installs surpassed Tinder's last week.
