According to a report by The Washington Post, Facebook's 'trending topics' algorithm promoted five fake and three "grossly" inaccurate news stories between August 31 and September 22. One example cited by the Post includes a story by a website called 'Faking News' which claimed that Tim Cook said the iPhone 8 would have "Siri physically coming out of the phone."
