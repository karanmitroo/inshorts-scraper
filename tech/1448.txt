A UK government-commissioned report has claimed artificial intelligence (AI) could add $837 billion to the UK's economy by 2035. The report added it would come from a combination of improvements in healthcare and adopting machine learning to find ways of using resources more efficiently. It also called for the industry to sponsor 300 masters degree students in AI each year.
