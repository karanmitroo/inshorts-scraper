Twitter-integrated messaging service app, Meerkat, Friday unveiled its beta version for Android, much before rival Twitterâ€™s Periscope app expecting high market gain. With the launch of this app even android users can stream video to their followers on Twitter, watch streams by other users and chat with the broadcaster. The app is already available for iOS users.
