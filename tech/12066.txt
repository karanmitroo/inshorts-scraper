US manufacturer Corning Thursday announced the launch of a tougher version of its Gorilla Glass used by major smartphone makers to maintain dominance in the sector. The new Gorilla Glass 4 is "up to two times tougher than any competitive cover glass design now in the market". It aims to prevent screen breakage from everyday drops, the company said.
