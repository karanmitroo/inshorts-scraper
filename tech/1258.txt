Teenager Lee Cselko has sold his 25th place in a queue for iPhone X in Australia for $500 (over â‚¹30,000). The 16-year-old McDonald's employee wrote about the offer on a white board which he placed on a chair. Asking people to message him on his Instagram handle, he said that anybody who buys the spot will "get the phone 100%".
