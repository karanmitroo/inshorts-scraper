The Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth is using a robot named Aggie to serve as an art guide. The 60cm tall robot is aimed at bringing more "family audiences" to the museum, which has recently seen falling visitor numbers. The robot, programmed by the company Smartbots, plays music during the tour and gives sound effects with different paintings.
