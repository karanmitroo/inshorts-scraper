China launched its first digital "cyber-court" earlier this week to settle internet related disputes in Hangzhou which is known as the capital of Chinese e-commerce. In this setup, defendants and plaintiffs will reportedly appear before the judge not in person, but via video-chat. According to court's website, a lawsuit can be filed in five minutes, saving time and reducing costs.
