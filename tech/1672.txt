Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla is planning to build convenience stores at its charging stations. According to Tesla CTO JB Straubel, Tesla drivers spend 20 to 30 minutes at Superchargers and may want to eat or have a cup of coffee while waiting. Straubel said that Tesla wants to satisfy those needs to improve driver experience and drive revenue.
