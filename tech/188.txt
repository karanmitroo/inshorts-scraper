Amazon on Wednesday surpassed Microsoft for the first time to become the world's third most valuable company. Microsoft, however, took back its position a day later and now stands behind Apple ($860 billion) and Google ($745 billion). Amazon's Jeff Bezos is currently the world's richest person with $120.9 billion net worth, nearly $30 billion more than Microsoft Co-founder Bill Gates.
