Two humanoid robots Han and Sofia discussed future of humanity in a Hong Kong tech conference. As Han mentioned "Humans are not necessarily the most ethical creatures", Sophia countered saying humans have "ability to reflect and self-modify". Sofia also insisted her aim was to work together with people, before Han "joked" that robots' goal was to take over the world.
