California-based security startup Knightscope on Tuesday took to Twitter to respond to the news of its Knightscope K5 robot 'drowning' itself in an office complex's fountain. The robot reportedly took a wrong turn, causing it to fall into the fountain. The K5 robot is meant to detect crime using cameras, thermal imaging sensors, laser range finders, and air quality sensors.
