Apple's new wireless headphones, AirPods, will be reportedly compatible with devices from other companies as well. The $159 AirPods will work like basic Bluetooth headphones when connected to non-Apple gadgets, without features like integration with a virtual assistant like Siri. According to Apple, AirPods "just lose the magic when not used with an Apple device".
