WhatsApp on Monday began rolling out a feature to iOS and Android devices that lets users add coloured backgrounds when uploading text status updates. It allows users to choose a font and background colour, and add links to other websites from within a text status. WhatsApp had started testing its new colourful status feature with select users earlier this month.
