South Korea on Wednesday announced an ambitious $1.5 billion plan to roll out a next-generation 5G wireless service. The service will provide an internet speed of about 1,000 times faster than 4G, quick enough to download full-length films (800MB) in a second. Under the roadmap, a trial service will be available by 2017 and the commercial service by 2020.
