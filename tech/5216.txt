MIT researchers have developed a low-cost system to build artificial muscle from nylon fibre. Their approach relied on shaping and heating the synthetic fibres in a way that mimics the 'bending' motions of natural muscle tissue. Applications of this system could enable manufacturing universal-size clothing that adjusts to the contours of an individual's body.
