Internet search giant Google has decided to restrict public sharing of adult content on its Blogger platform. â€œStarting March 23, 2015, users won't be able to publicly share images and video that are sexually explicit... on Blogger", Google said. However, it will not delete existing blogs that have sexually explicit content but will make the blogs private after March 23.
