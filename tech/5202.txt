South Korean electronics maker LG is reportedly offering a full refund to some users of its Nexus 5X smartphones in the US. Users had complained of the phones restarting repeatedly, rendering them useless. The phone, which was launched and marketed by Google in 2014, is no longer being produced and the parts required to fix the issue are not available.
