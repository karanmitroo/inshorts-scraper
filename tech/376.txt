Technology giant Apple's Co-founder Steve Wozniak has said, "Now I don't believe anything Elon Musk or Tesla says, but I still love the car." Wozniak's comment came in reference to the delays in the implementation of technology that Musk claimed Tesla would bring to its cars. Wozniak further said that Musk is "just a good salesman", like Steve Jobs.
