Microblogging platform Twitter announced that it will replace its Vine app with a simpler version called Vine Camera, which will launch in January. This comes after Twitter revealed in October that it will shut down Vine. Vine Camera will also let users shoot 6-second looping videos, which can be saved to their phone's camera roll or posted directly on Twitter.
