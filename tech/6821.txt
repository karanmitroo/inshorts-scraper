In 1974, Narayana Murthy was put in an 8x8-foot cell without food for three days in Bulgaria by authorities who believed he had been criticising the country's communist government. Murthy, who turned 70 on Saturday, admitted in a speech that incident transformed him from "a confused Leftist into a...compassionate capitalist", and led to the eventual founding of Infosys in 1981.
