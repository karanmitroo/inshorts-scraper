Aiming at improving user experience on its site, Facebook is tweaking its News Feed algorithm based on the time users spend to view a post. Currently, it is based on what users like, comment and share. "Just because someone didn't like, comment or share a story in their News Feed doesn't mean it wasn't meaningful to them," Facebook explained.
