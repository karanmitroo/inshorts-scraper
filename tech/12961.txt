Joining an elite club of countries like US, Russia, Japan, and China, India Sunday launched GSLV-D5 rocket, which is powered by an indigenous cryogenic engine. The rocket successfully placed Indiaâ€™s 23rd geostationary communication satellite, GSAT-14, into orbit. The mission was a major challenge for ISRO after three back-to-back failures previously. The 1,980kg satellite will provide services like tele-education and telemedicine.
