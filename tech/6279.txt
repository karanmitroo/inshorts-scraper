Technology giant Apple has filed a patent application for what appears to be a regular paper bag with handles. The patent application defines the bag as "a retail paper bag, comprising: a bag container formed of white paper with at least 60% post-consumer content.” Apple says the bag will compensate for the reduced strength and increased susceptibility to tearing.
