A new solar and wind-powered street lamp was developed by researchers at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, that can lure mosquitoes to tackle dengue. Head researcher said the smell of carbon dioxide, produced by combining ultraviolet light with titanium dioxide, is irresistible to mosquitoes. He added, the mechanism strongly sucks the decoyed mosquitoes into the lamp's capture net.
