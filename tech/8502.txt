Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp has fully implemented end-to-end encryption on its platform. End-to-end encryption means the content of communications is not stored in plaintext on WhatsApp's servers. Nor is the company able to decrypt usersâ€™ messages to access them since it does not hold the encryption keys. This comes after the recently ended controversy between the FBI and Apple.
