French startup Spinali Design has created a smart pair of shorts for women, which integrates two vibrating sensors on a belt on either of its sides. Connected to a smartphone via an app, the shorts help women navigate their route by vibrating for left or right turns. The shorts also alert women of any incoming message, call or email.
