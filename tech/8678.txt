Researchers from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University have designed and developed a faster, more accurate, low-cost contactless 3D fingerprint biometric identification system using a single fixed camera. The project can prove to be useful for high security, improved hygiene using touchless fingerprint biometric identification and also for automated detection of surgically modified fingerprints.
