A New York-based entrepreneur Mazen Jundi has created 'Tripstir', an app that lets users follow other travellers and get notified of travel overlaps with the people they are following. Users can search travellers, cities or date combinations to see where others are planning to travel. It also allows users to share recommendations, photos and videos from their trips.
