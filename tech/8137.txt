Scientists from a Mexican university have developed a cement that illuminates roads through solar power. The cement, capable of lasting for a hundred years, currently exists in blue and green colours and the light intensity can be regulated. The cement claims to emit light for around 12 hours in the night from the solar energy absorbed during the day.
