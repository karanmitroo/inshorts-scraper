A glow-in-the-dark bicycle path has been unveiled in the Polish town of Olsztyn to prevent accidents. The luminous strip, created using a synthetic material, charges itself using solar energy. The idea behind the cycle path reportedly comes from Netherlands' Starry Night bike lane, which was inspired by the painting by Vincent van Gogh.
