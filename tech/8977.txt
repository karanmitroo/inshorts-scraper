Lenovo will launch the world’s first smartphone with augmented reality (AR) support in July 2016. Developed under Google’s 'Project Tango', the phone will feature advanced 3D motion tracking technology and depth sensors, enabling it to sense its surroundings and navigate through it. Notably, Google and Lenovo also demonstrated the phone’s AR-backed indoor navigation feature at the MWC 2016.
