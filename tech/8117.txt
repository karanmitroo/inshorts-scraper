WhatsApp has updated its app on the web to allow users to share documents through the platform. Until now, WhatsApp Web allowed users to only share photos and videos saved on the system or use the webcam to click a new one. The new document sharing feature is already available on WhatsAppâ€™s Android and iOS versions.
