US-based startup Pixl Toys has created a â‚¹1,700 smartphone case that can turn a smartphone into a 35 mm camera for kids. Once the device is put into the case, photos can be taken and effects can be included with a dedicated app developed by the startup. The drop protective case features dual child-resistant locks and rubber handles.
