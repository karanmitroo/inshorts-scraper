Huawei was recently slammed for a promotional image claimed to be shot by its P9 smartphone, which was revealed to be taken from a $4500 Canon DSLR camera. The image's caption read, "The #HuaweiP9’s dual Leica cameras makes taking photos in low light conditions like this a pleasure.” However, Huawei later removed the image and issued an apology.
