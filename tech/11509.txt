Russia on Wednesday rejected reports indicating their involvement in hacking a non-classified White House computer network. “It has become a kind of sport to blame everything on Russia,” said Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Reports emerged on Tuesday that Russia had gained access to 'sensitive parts of the White house e-mail system' while US claimed no sensitive information had been compromised.
