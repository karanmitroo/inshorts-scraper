CERN's Large Hadron Collider located in Switzerland resumed operations on Wednesday after two years. The collider will operate at energies of 13 tera-electron-volts, almost twice the energy it achieved in its initial run of three years that proved the existence of the Higgs boson particle. Scientists shall now smash protons in a bid to gain insight into 'new physics.'
