A team of researchers from MIT and elsewhere has developed an ingestible robot made of dried up pig intestines. The origami robot can unfold itself from a swallowed capsule to execute tasks like removing batteries from stomachs, patching up wounds and delivering medicines at designated locations. According to MIT, 3,500 swallowed watch batteries are reported in the US every year.
