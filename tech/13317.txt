The founder of VKontakte (Russia's most popular social-network) offered a job to Edward Snowden, after Russia granted him asylum status for one-year, allowing him to formally cross the border. A former contractor for the NSA, Snowden has been in Russia since June 23, when he arrived from Hong Kong but was staying in the airport transit zone since then.
