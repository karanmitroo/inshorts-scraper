Apple I, Apple's first computer, was sold for $666.66 when it was released, as the company's Co-founder Steve Wozniak "liked repeating digits". Additionally, a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price came to be around $666. According to reports, 66 cents were further added to make it an "eye-catcher price" for advertisements and promotions.
