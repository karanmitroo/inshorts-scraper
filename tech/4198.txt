E-commerce major Amazon has been granted a patent to drop packages being delivered by drones using parachutes. The patent claims using parachutes will reduce the time and energy that is usually spent in landing and relaunching the drone from each drop-off location. In December 2016, Amazon had filed a patent for a flying warehouse for drone deliveries.
