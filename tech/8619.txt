Apple is working with American entertainer Will.i.am and producers Ben Silverman and Howard Owens to make an original TV series about app ecosystem and app development. A senior executive said, “We’ve seen some truly inspiring…stories from our developers in what they’ve done, where they come from...and the problems they’ve solved.” Notably, Netflix and Amazon are also creating original TV content.
