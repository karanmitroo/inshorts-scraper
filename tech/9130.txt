University College London scientists have developed a fibre-optic equipment which can transfer data at 1.125 terabits per second, the fastest data transmission ever. This was achieved by sending 15 pulses of different frequency light at once. "The data rate we have achieved would allow the entire HD Game of Thrones series to be downloaded within one second", a scientist said.
