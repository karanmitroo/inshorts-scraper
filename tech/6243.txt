Unlike Google's tradition of naming Android versions after desserts, the first two versions were called Android 1.0 and 1.1. The first version to be named after a dessert was Android 1.5, Cupcake, which was followed by Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, Kitkat, Lollipop, Marshmallow, and Nougat. Android 1.0 was released on September 23, 2008.
