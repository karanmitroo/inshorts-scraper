A video of an interview of Mark Zuckerberg in 2005 gives a glimpse of the Facebook CEO's idea about the social-networking site. Shot at Facebookâ€™s Palo Alto office, the video shows Zuckerberg barefoot, wearing a white t-shirt with gym shorts and holding a cup of beer. "I think Facebook is an online directory for colleges", says Zuckerberg to the interviewer.
