Apple has increased the warranty on its first-generation smartwatches after several users reported of swelling in the watch's battery and displacement of the screen. The warranty, which earlier lasted for a year, has now been extended to two years. While several users reported of swelling of the watch's battery, none claimed that their device exploded or caught fire.
