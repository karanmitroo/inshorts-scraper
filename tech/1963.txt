Germany-based online shopping platform ProfiCare unveiled a helmet-shaped hair dryer called Hair Dryer Hood in Berlin earlier this week. The Hood allows users to keep their hands free while it dries and styles their hair, and comes with overheating protection. The device also has an 'ionizing' function for antistatic effect on users' hair.
