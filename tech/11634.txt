The US defence and aerospace company Lockheed Martin has come up with a laser gun which can disable a running vehicle from a mile (1.6 km) away. During the test,  the 30-kilowatt laser weapon system, known as Advanced Test High Energy Asset (Athena), burnt through the engine of a small truck, after being fired from over a mile away.
