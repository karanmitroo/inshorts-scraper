A sting operation against Apple by Australian consumer watchdog has revealed the staff repeatedly misled iPhone customers over 'error 53' malfunction. The watchdog said the staff wrongly denied consumers free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer. Between 2014 and 2016, 'error 53' malfunction rendered many iPhones and iPads useless.
