A team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Wednesday, reported using a smartphone-run microscope to detect parasites in blood samples. The results, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed that the phone's software looks for the movement in blood to identify parasites. After a successful small pilot-study at Cameroon (Africa), it will be tested on 40,000 people.
