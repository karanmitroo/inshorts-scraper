Scientists at McGill and Concordia university (Canada) have claimed to find molecular reset button of our internal body clock. The clock resets itself when, in the brain, a phosphate combines with Period proteins whose synthesis is stimulated by light. This research may allow new treatments of sleep disorders and cognitive and metabolic abnormalities associated with jet lag and shift work.
