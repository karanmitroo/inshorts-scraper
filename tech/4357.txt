Electronics company LG has confirmed that its newly-released UltraFine 5K monitor was becoming "unstable" and "unusable" when placed near a WiFi router. LG advised keeping the 27-inch screens at least two feet away from a router to prevent the display from flickering, disconnecting, or freezing due to electromagnetic interference. The $1,000 monitors will be retrofitted with enhanced shielding.
