In JD Power's latest tablet satisfaction rankings, Samsung, with 835 on a 1,000-point scale, beat Apple (833), owing to its relatively lower-priced devices. However, Apple scored better than Samsung on performance and ease of operations. The study also found that 41% people buy a tablet online against the 59% going in stores and are more satisfied than offline buyers are.
