The French postal service has announced a drone delivery program to deliver parcels on a 14-kilometre route once a week, becoming the world's first national postal service to use drones regularly. The drones have a range of 19 km and a top speed of 30.5 kmph. They also have parachutes for safe emergency landing and will help reach mountainous regions.
