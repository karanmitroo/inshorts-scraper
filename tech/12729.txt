Apple is likely to release its newest iPhone globally in September with a higher resolution and bigger screens, Japan's leading Nikkei business daily reported Friday. The handset, expected to be called the iPhone 6, is expected to come in two versions with a 4.7- or 5.5-inch screen, up from the current four-inch panel, the report said, without citing sources.
