The India Meteorological Department (IMD) will reportedly get two supercomputers and a suite of new radars by next year for predicting weather more accurately in small geographical areas. The supercomputers will boost the department's data processing capacity over 6 times. The IMD plans to improve the forecasting capacity to a 1-kilometre grid by 2018, IMD's Director General KJ Ramesh said.
