The first long-distance phone call was made on March 27, 1884, between Boston and New York. The call, made between inventor of the telephone Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Watson, lasted for about 90 minutes. The telephone line was built using copper wires instead of the previously used galvanized iron for greater signal strength.
