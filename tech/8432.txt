National Payments Corporation of Indiaâ€™s (NPCI) Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was on Monday launched by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. UPI would allow users to integrate different bank accounts on a unified mobile application and transfer funds using a single identifier, eliminating the exchange of sensitive financial information during transactions. Presently, 19 banks have partnered with NPCI.
