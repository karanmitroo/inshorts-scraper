On July 10, 1962, NASA launched Telstar, the worldâ€™s first communications satellite to relay television and telephone signals through space. It successfully provided the first live transatlantic television feed, relaying footage of US President John F Kennedy talking about the price of the US dollar to Europe, and transmitting a video of French singer Yves Montand back to the US.
