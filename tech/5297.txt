American baked goods brand Sister Schubert's has created an electronic bread basket to keep its contents warm and simultaneously charge phones. The basket can be used to charge up to five devices at a time using USB ports. While pricing for the basket has not been revealed, it will be part of the company's 'Make All Dinners Warm' campaign.
