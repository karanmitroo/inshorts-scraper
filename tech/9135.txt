Google has updated its My Maps app, that allows users to create custom maps, for the first time since 2014. The service now includes a welcome guide for new users, Street View imagery and the ability to view photos from the web. The custom mapping app, launched in April 2007, lets users add points, lines, and shapes on top of Google Maps.
