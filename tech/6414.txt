Facebook Messenger's head David Marcus in a recent interview said, "The introduction of bots to Facebook and other platforms has been overhyped and the bots themselves often aren't very good." Marcus added, "It got really overhyped really, really quickly." He further said that bots suffer from a perception that they're not as useful as advertised by Facebook, Google and Microsoft.
