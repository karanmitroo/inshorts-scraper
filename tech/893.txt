The communications industry could use one-fifth of the world's electricity by 2025, hampering attempts to meet climate change goals as demands for storing digital data increase, a US-based research has estimated. Information and communications technology would create up to 3.5% of global emissions by 2020, surpassing aviation and shipping, and about 14% by 2040, equalling the US, the study noted.
