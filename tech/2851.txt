Terry Gou, Founder and Chairman of iPhone assembler Foxconn, saw his wealth swell to an all-time high of $7 billion (₹45,000 crore). His wealth rose after Foxconn subsidiary Hon Hai experienced a 36% rally this year, and was also boosted by positive expectations for a 10th-anniversary edition of iPhone. Moreover, Japan’s Sharp that Foxconn acquired, also climbed 56% in 2017.
