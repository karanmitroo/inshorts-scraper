Digital currency Bitcoin reached a new all-time high this week, rising to over ₹1.15 lakh from about ₹30,000 in May last year. Bitcoin's price is linked to speculators and the number of people using the system to send money. Recently, Bitcoin use has risen with Japan approving it as a legal method of payment and increased acceptance in China.
