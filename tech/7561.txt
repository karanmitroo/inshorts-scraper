Pilgrims joining this year's Hajj will have to wear an electronic bracelet for their safety. The high-tech bracelets will contain personal and medical information of the pilgrims to help the authorities identify people and provide them with care, if needed. The water-resistant and GPS-enabled bracelets will also provide timings of prayers and a multi-lingual help desk to guide non-Arabic speakers.
