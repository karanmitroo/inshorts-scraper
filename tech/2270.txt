US-based researchers have created a high-performance, bacteria-powered battery by building microbial fuel cells with inactive, freeze-dried cells which generate power within minutes of adding saliva. The paper-based disposable battery can be folded as in "origami" and can light an OLED for 20 minutes. It can be used in extreme conditions where normal batteries don't function, researchers said.
