Pakistan has asked social media giant Facebook to link opening of accounts on the social network with mobile numbers in an attempt to overcome the issue of fake accounts. Pakistan's Ministry of Information Technology said that fake accounts were often used to spread hate material on the platform. Notably, Facebook has over 3 crore users in the country.
