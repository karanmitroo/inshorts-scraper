SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Instagram on Friday to share an animated video of SpaceX's largest rocket Falcon Heavy launch. "FH is twice the thrust of the next largest rocket currently flying and ~2/3 thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket," the post read. The launch is set for November this year.
