A Russia-UK research collaboration has successfully demonstrated that a type of 'magic dust' which combines light and matter can be used to solve complex problems. Conventional computers track entire functions for their lowest points to find solutions, whereas, the entire landscape can be filled with magic dust, which would "shine" only at the deepest level, giving the solution, said researchers.
