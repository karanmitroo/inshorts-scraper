Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp became "obsolete" for many users in India, from the midnight of January 13. The problem was reported mostly by users of Xiaomi smartphones, who claimed they were unable to use or update the app. WhatsApp attributed the problem to the app's distribution, saying it was not under their control but the issue was being fixed.
