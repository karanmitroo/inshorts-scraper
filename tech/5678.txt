Google's Pixel smartphone is harder to repair than rival Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets, according to iFixit, a community known for opening up latest gadgets. Pixel scored six out of ten in terms of repair, against seven scored by iPhone 7. iFixit claims Pixel has “thin, poorly-supported display assembly” which makes it harder to open up the device.
