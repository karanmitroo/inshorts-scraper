As Amazon hosted the 3rd flash sale of Micromax's Yu Yureka on Thursday, all the 10,000 units of the smartphone went out-of-stock within 3 seconds. The last two sales of the smartphone also saw a similar response. Seeing the demand, Micromax is now planning to double-up the availability of units for its next sale to be held on February 5.
