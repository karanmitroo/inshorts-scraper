YouTuber Kris Henriksen has shared a video showing a MacBook Pro modified to run Samsung's DeX software. Henriksen replaced the internal parts of the MacBook that allowed it to run DeX off of a phone. Samsung's DeX allows Galaxy S8, and S8 Plus users plug their phones into a monitor to boot into a desktop environment.
