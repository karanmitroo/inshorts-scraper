A Spanish startup has developed 'Bioo', a plant pot that charges mobile phones and tablets with the power generated from photosynthesis. The pot generates power throughout the day and night and uses a normal phone charging cable to deliver two to three charges per day. It allows users to choose between any kind of plant, soil or irrigation method.
