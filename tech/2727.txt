Facebook's drone 'Aquila', a solar-powered drone to bring the internet to rural places, completed its second successful test flight in the Arizona desert, Facebook announced on Thursday. The drone flew for an hour and 46 minutes, about 10 minutes longer than its original flight. The drone landed perfectly this time, unlike the first attempt where it had a crash landing.
