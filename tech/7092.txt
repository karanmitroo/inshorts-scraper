Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, have developed a disposable tattoo-based device that can accurately measure alcohol levels in sweat and relay the results wirelessly to a phone or smartwatch. When activated, the tattoo releases a drug that passes through the skin and induces sweat. The alcohol-sensitive sensor then measures the alcohol concentration in the sweat.
