A photo gallery shows ISRO's journey from its days when it had once tested India's first experimental communication satellite, APPLE, on a bullock cart in 1981. The space agency has come a long way from then with its successful 'Chandrayaan' mission and the historic 'Mangalyaan' (Mars Orbiter Mission). ISRO on Wednesday set record to launch 104 satellites in one go.
