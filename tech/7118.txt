US-based online used-car dealer Vroom has introduced virtual reality enabled system which lets users examine cars, open doors and inspect specific components before purchasing a car. The first version has been launched on Tuesday which covers 30 car models. Vroom is also set to open popups at malls for users who don't have access to equipment to experience its virtual showrooms.
