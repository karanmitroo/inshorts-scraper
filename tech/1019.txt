While talking about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), Hillary Clinton has said, "Artificial intelligence is not our friend." In a recent interview, she also said, "A lot of really smart people, you know, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking... are sounding an alarm that we're not hearing." She added that AI would affect "how we relate to each other."
