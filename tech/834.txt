French privacy watchdog CNIL has issued a notice to WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with the parent company Facebook within a month. This comes after WhatsApp refused to provide a sample of French users' data transferred to Facebook to the French regulator. The watchdog also said that WhatsApp had not obtained users' consent to share their data with Facebook.
