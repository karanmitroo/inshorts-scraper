Apple has agreed to provide "limited" help to Indian government in developing an anti-spam mobile application for iOS, its spokesperson said. This comes after Apple refused a request for an iOS version of TRAI's DND app that allows users to block unsolicited calls and messages. Apple stated the app with access to call logs could compromise users' privacy.
