The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved AT&T's Flying Cow (Cell on Wings) drones to restore the cell network over hurricane-hit Puerto Rico. The drones will be used as an interim method while repairs take place, FAA said. "The Flying Cow is an exciting next step...to bring strong wireless connectivity to those who need it most," AT&T said.
