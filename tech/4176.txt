IMAX has opened its first ever virtual reality theatre in Los Angeles, which houses 14 pods with a different VR experience in each. The pods contain a motorised cinema chair, a vibration-emitting Subpac vest and a variety of physical controllers in addition to the VR headsets. Visitors can watch movies or play games at the location.
