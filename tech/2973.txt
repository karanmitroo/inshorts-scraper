Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that all the company's superchargers, that are used to charge electric vehicles, will be converted to solar or battery power instead of coal-powered electric grid. The move comes after the company's announcement earlier this year that it would double the number of its superchargers to 10,000 by end of 2017.
