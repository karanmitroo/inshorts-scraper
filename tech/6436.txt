The gaming character Mario, developed by Nintendo, was initially called ‘Jumpman’ but its name was changed before its American release. While the developers were thinking of a new name, they were interrupted by Mario Segale, who reportedly bore similarities to the character, thus, generating the character's name 'Mario'. Mario Segale was Nintendo's US warehouse landlord.
