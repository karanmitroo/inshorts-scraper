Europe-based product designer Klemens Schillinger has developed a smartphone-like device called Substitute Phone which allows users to swipe, scroll or zoom on its surface. The device, which has no digital functions, allows these movements to be felt using the beads integrated into the case. Schillinger aims to help frequent smartphone users cope with withdrawal symptoms through the device.
