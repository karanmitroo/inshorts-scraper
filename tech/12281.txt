In a major breakthrough, Ohio State (US) University reserachers have developed the world's first solar battery by combining a solar cell and a battery into one hybrid device, which recharges itself using air and light. "We've integrated both functions into one device. Any time you can do that, you reduce cost," said Yiying Wu, a professor at Ohio State.
