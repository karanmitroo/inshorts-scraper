To study the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, NASA is willing to pay $5000/month for spending 70-days in bed. The 'Bed Rest Study' requires participants to remain horizontal for a period of 70-days. The research is aimed to improve conditions for astronauts working in a weightless environment. However, the research participant must be a US citizen or permanent resident.
