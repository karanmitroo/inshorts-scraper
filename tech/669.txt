French footwear manufacturer Zhor Tech has unveiled smart insoles at CES 2018, which can track a user's fatigue levels via an app. Priced at $149, the insoles feature sensors that also count users' steps, analyse posture and detect surrounding vibrations. Users can view detailed, real-time information using a connected app and share it with other users.
