The micro-blogging site Twitter Tuesday announced its two new features- 30 second video uploads and private group direct messages (DMs). The group messaging feature lets users set up conversations with up to 20 people. Before the launch of 30-second video uploads feature, Twitter users could only upload videos through the 6-second video app Vine.
