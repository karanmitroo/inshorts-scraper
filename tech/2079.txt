Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange took to Twitter on Tuesday to slam reports claiming that he is currently living in a 'basement' or a 'cupboard' at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Some reports also described his bedroom as "ladies toilet". Assange shifted to the embassy in 2012 to avoid Swedish government attempts to extradite him on charges of rape.
