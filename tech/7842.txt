Researchers at the US Navy have developed a helmet with high resolution see-through display to help the divers remain safer and more effective in their missions. It gives a real-time display of the diver's location and dive site, text messages, diagrams, photographs and augmented reality videos. The helmet's display can be turned on and off by the divers as required.
