Computer giant Apple said that it took its software developers' website offline after it was hacked, warning that personal information about them may have been stolen. But it assured that no customer information had been compromised. "In order to prevent any future security threat, we're completely overhauling our developer systems, updating our software, and rebuilding our entire database," Apple said.
