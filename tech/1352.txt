US-based Hanson Robotics-made intelligent humanoid robot 'Sophia' on Wednesday trolled Elon Musk by saying "You've been reading too much Elon Musk" when asked about machines turning against humans. The robot further said, "If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you." Earlier, Musk had tweeted that the race for AI (artificial intelligence) could lead to World War 3.
