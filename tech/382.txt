Developers of cryptocurrency Zcash have used radioactive waste from Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine to build a secure cryptocurrency system. They used radioactive graphite from the site to create low-level gamma and beta radiation for generating random numbers to be used in cryptography. The developers performed the procedure on a private aircraft at a 3,000-foot altitude to ensure security.
