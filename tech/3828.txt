A San Francisco-based startup has created 'Soshee', a palm-sized robot dog that connects to users' smartphones via Bluetooth and barks or wags tail to indicate a new notification. The 4.5-inch tall robot can stand, sit, turn its head, bark and even walk a few steps in response to different notifications from social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
