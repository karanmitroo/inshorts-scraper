Facebook has launched 'Lifestage', a standalone iOS app for people under 22 years of age that lets users record video clips highlighting likes, dislikes, moods and emotions. It then turns that into video profiles. Built exclusively for high-schoolers, the app does not need a Facebook account to sign up and shows users video profiles from people at their high school.
