Google rolled out a new update of its Google wallet app on Thursday for Android and iOS platforms which would enable the users to transfer money to any phone number. The receiving phone number wouldn't need to have the Google Wallet app. The new feature will provide a secure link to the recipient which would guide through the entire process.
