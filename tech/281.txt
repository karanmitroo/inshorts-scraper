Photo-sharing app Instagram has confirmed that it is testing a feature that allows users to reshare other users' public posts as their Story. The feature, which is being tested on a small percentage of users, also reportedly allows users to resize and rotate the post. Users can also disallow others from sharing their posts as a Story, through Settings.
