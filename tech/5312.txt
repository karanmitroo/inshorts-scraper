The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to respond to reports by iPhone 6 and 6s users that the smartphones have been automatically shutting off within ten days. The iPhones reportedly turn off with 50-60% battery remaining and only switch on when charged. Previously, the CCA pressed Samsung to extend the recall of Galaxy Note 7 to China.
