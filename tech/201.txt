The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has given consent to launch WhatsApp BHIM UPI beta with limited user base of 1 million and low per transaction limit, the regulator said. This comes after Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma accused NPCI of favouring WhatsApp. Sharma said while Indian players require three-factor authentication, WhatsApp was allowed to dodge the rule.
