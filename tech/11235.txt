Payments giant MasterCard has launched a new service called Send, which allows customers to quickly and securely transfer funds digitally. Through a single connection to the MasterCard Send platform, senders can send money to consumers whether they are banked or unbanked, and located domestically or abroad. Aimed at replacing cash or check payments, the service is live in the US.
