California-based tech company Cornerstone OnDemand celebrated 'bring your parents to work day', welcoming the parents of each of their employees to their office. The event was aimed at giving the parents an insight into the professional lives of their children. Several tech giants, including Google, LinkedIn, and Amazon, have organised similar events in the past.
