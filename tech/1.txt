Mercedes' parent company Daimler has introduced car lights that warn the driver about dangers and project warning symbols on the road. For instance, if a pedestrian is detected in the danger zone near the road, an arrow pointing towards them appears on the road surface. Called Digital Light, it can also be controlled to distribute light in a particular way.
