A lawsuit filed by a former Yahoo employee has claimed that CEO Marissa Mayer implemented a job review process which was used to cut male employees from executive ranks and lay them off. The internet giant, however, said that the accusations had no merit and described the review process as 'fair'. Notably, the plaintiff was fired from Yahoo last year.
