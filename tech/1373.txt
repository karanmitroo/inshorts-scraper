Technology giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook has said, "We'll see what happens" on iPhone X shortages, in a recent interview. He also said, "We'll be working as hard as possible to make as many as possible." Earlier reports suggested that Apple was facing production delay in iPhone X due to problems in the Face ID manufacturing process.
