Business networking service LinkedIn on Thursday started rolling out a feature to pair mentors with those looking for professional guidance. LinkedIn has compiled a list of potential mentors but, over time the option of becoming a mentor will be open to everyone. The mentees can narrow down their search according to parameters like location or alma mater of the mentor.
