Elon Musk-led aerospace manufacturer SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket exploded during a test on a launch pad in Florida, US, on Thursday. The blast, which destroyed the unmanned vehicle and its payload, was reported to be caused by an anomaly. The rocket was set to launch on Saturday with Facebook's first satellite, aimed at providing spot-beam broadband for its Internet.org initiative.
