A clean-up mission using a remotely operated robot at 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor leak site in Japan had to be aborted within two hours, as high radiation levels damaged the machine's cameras. Analysing the robot's time spent in the reactor along with its withstanding capacity, scientists could predict the extent of current radiation levels, which are being described as "unimaginable".
