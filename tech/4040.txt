Sketch comedy group Cannibal Milkshake has created a parody of the Oscar-nominated movie "La La Land" which mocks the finance and technology industries in New York. Titled "NY NY Land," the video shows the female creator of an app called 'Pizzagram' fall in love with a Donald Trump supporter who aspires to open his own hedge fund.
