Google's CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday said there's a joke in his circle that he got selected only because Co-founder Larry Page had stopped interviewing people. Pichai made the statement during a visit to his college, IIT Kharagpur. "You need to take risks, try different things and eventually follow your passion," added Pichai during his interaction with the college students.
