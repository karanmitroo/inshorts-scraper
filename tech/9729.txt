Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday made a personal appeal asking users in India to support the company’s Free Basics initiative. He said, “This isn’t about Facebook’s commercial interests—there aren’t even any ads in the version of Facebook in Free Basics”. The initiative is currently being criticised for allegedly favouring certain partners and violating net neutrality.
