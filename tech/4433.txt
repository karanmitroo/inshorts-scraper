Nokia on Saturday launched its first voice assistant for engineers and telecom operators called MIKA or 'Multi-purpose Intuitive Knowledge Assistant.' It will provide technicians with information to fix issues like network faults based on data drawn from other networks globally. Nokia also launched 'Predictive Repair', a service that forecasts potential hardware failures up to 14 days in advance.
