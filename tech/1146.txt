US-based developer MicroNovelty has developed a smart bulb called Heelight which changes colour or brightness in response to sound. Priced at $39, the bulb has an in-built sound chip and does not require Bluetooth or WiFi connection. It can be connected to the phone by scanning the QR code on the packing box or by using the 'Heelight' app.
