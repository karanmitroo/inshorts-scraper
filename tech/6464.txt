Apple has updated its AppleCare+ warranty plan, reducing the cost of repairing cracked iPhone screens from $99 to $29. The plan, which costs $129 for iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s users, includes only two repairs from accidental damage. However, the cost of repairing screens without warranty will cost $149.
