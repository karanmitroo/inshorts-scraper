The Quora account of Google CEO Sundar Pichai was briefly hacked on Monday by a group of hackers called OurMine. The group posted messages on Pichai's Quora account, that also appeared on his connected Twitter handle. Earlier this month, OurMine had claimed responsibility for hacking Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Twitter and Pinterest accounts.
