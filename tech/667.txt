Nokia has unveiled a sleep tracking system called Nokia Sleep at CES 2018 which can monitor a user's snoring. The device, built into a mattress pad, has movement sensors and software algorithms to record user's sleep patterns while synced to Nokia's Health Mate app. It can also regulate the room temperature and turn off lights when a user falls asleep.
