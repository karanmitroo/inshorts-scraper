The EU's decision that Apple pay a record $14.5 billion tax bill to Ireland was based on facts and existing rules and was not aimed against the US, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday. The investigations on taxation mainly targeted European companies, Juncker added. Earlier, the tech giant's CEO Tim Cook described the decision as "total political crap".
