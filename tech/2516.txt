A US court on Monday upheld rules allowing FBI to secretly issue surveillance orders for customer data to communications and technology companies. The US government was sued by phone network operator CREDO Mobile and content distributor Cloudflare over their right to notify customers of such orders by FBI. Major technology firms like Microsoft and Twitter have also challenged similar orders.
