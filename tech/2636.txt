Founder of McAfee anti-virus software John McAfee has settled a lawsuit against Intel, agreeing to not use his own name for new cybersecurity and security-related products. He also agreed not to trademark "John McAfee Privacy Phone". McAfee had sued the American technology major over rights to his name six years after selling his company to Intel for $7.7 billion.
