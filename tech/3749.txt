Britain's police watchdog is investigating claims that Scotland Yard spied on journalists' private emails for years with help of Indian police, who in turn used hackers. The allegations were made in an anonymous letter that listed login details of 10 individuals. On contacting six individuals on the list, five passwords were found to be correct, while one was almost same.
