Aiming to provide better information about Russia than is available on Wikipedia, the country is planning an alternative version of the Wikipedia. Some 50,000 books and documents had been collected to portray Russia "objectively and accurately", the country's presidential library has said. The Russian edition of Wikipedia has more than one million entries.
