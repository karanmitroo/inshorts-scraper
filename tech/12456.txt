After just 39 minutes of going on sale, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's Mi 3 smartphone went out of stock Tuesday on e-commerce retailer Flipkart, which claimed to have received 100,000 registrations before sale. A large number of registered users were not able to order the phone, as the site faced technical difficulties due to heavy traffic.
