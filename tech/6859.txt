Google's third-party vendor Appen is reportedly asking Redditors to submit three-to-five second common voice command samples like 'Indy now' and 'Google what's the time' to train its speech recognition technology. Adults are paid $35 to record 2,000 phrases, while under-17s are paid $26 for 500 phrases. The move attempts at tackling problems of digital assistants not recognising different accents.
