UK-based disability charity Scope celebrated the World Emoji Day by releasing 18 emojis featuring disabled people and Paralympic sports. According to Scope, there is just one emoji, a wheelchair-user sign, representing disability. With the release, the charity hopes to 'inspire' Unicode to "represent the disabled in a positive way", it said in a blog post.
