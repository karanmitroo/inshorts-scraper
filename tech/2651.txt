Amazon's voice platform Alexa, the technology that runs on devices like the Echo speaker, Echo Dot, newer Echo Show and others, has now passed 15,000 skills. The figure is up from the 10,000 skills Amazon officially announced back in February. Amazon is currently the leader in the voice-powered devices, where itâ€™s expected to control 70% of the market this year.
