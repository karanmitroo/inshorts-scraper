Researchers at Peru's Universidad de Ingeniería y Tecnología have developed an LED lamp powered by a houseplant as an alternative to kerosene lamps. Electricity is generated by harnessing electrons from microorganisms and can power a lamp for two hours at a time. This technology is not ready for mass production, but UTEC is reportedly field-testing 10 prototypes of these lamps.
