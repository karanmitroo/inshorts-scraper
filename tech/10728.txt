NASA has launched its official account on Tumblr that will give users a "regular dose of space" in a blog-like format through text, photos, and videos. The inaugural post showcases the image of the dark side of the Moon with Earth in the background. One page on the website will be dedicated for Mars Curiosity rover's updates.
