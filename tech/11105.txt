Apple has announced an upgrade to the operating system for its watch, which will allow developers to make native apps for the watch and help in untethering it from the iPhone. The company also announced that its newly-launched Apple pay service is supported by 2,500 banks, and is expected to announce the details of a paid music-streaming service later.
