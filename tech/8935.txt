Scientists from the University of Surrey in UK have developed a smart wallpaper which absorbs light and heat to electrify homes. The wallpapers are made of ultra-thin graphene sheets using 'nanotexturing' technique that increases the absorbing capacity by 90%. This generates enough electricity to run smart applications at home and produce dim light when coated to a solar cell.
