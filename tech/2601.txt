The Chinese government has ordered telecommunications firms to completely block access to virtual private networks (VPNs) by February 2018, in a crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent over the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party. Notably, China operates the world's largest Internet censorship regime and has banned several social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
