An intelligent undershirt, which can track its wearer's health by providing data to a smartphone app, has been developed by Japanese firms NEC Corporation and Gunze Group. Fitted with an ultra-fine and flexible sensor, the shirt reportedly monitors posture, heart rate and tracks the calories consumed and burned. Yet to get a commercial name, the shirt will launch this year.
