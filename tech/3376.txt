Twitter COO Anthony Noto in an interview with Bloomberg said, "We'd love it if every world leader used Twitter as their primary mechanism to talk to their constituencies". He added, "The more that happens, the better we're going to be at showing what's going on in the world". Notably, Twitter added 90 lakh new users in the first quarter.
