US-based startup Zungle has developed sunglasses priced at â‚¹9,700 that allow users to listen to music without using a headset. The sunglasses feature built-in bone conduction speakers that transfer sound to users' ears by transmitting sound waves through the bones in the skull. The bluetooth-connected glasses also have a touchpad on the right side to let users control their playlists.
