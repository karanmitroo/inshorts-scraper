A group of Florida fishermen has claimed Apple's voice assistant Siri helped in saving their lives after their boat hit the rough sea. With wet fingers, the men were unable to use their phone's touchscreen, after which one of the fishermen used Siri on his iPhone 7 to call 911. The fishermen were then rescued by the coast guard.
