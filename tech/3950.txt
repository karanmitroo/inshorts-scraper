US-based startup 'AImotive' is working on a project to convert regular cars into self-driving at a cost of only ₹4 lakh. Unlike Uber and Google's self-driving car projects using radar-like technology that cost up to ₹66 lakh, AImotive uses regular cameras combined with artificial intelligence. Its car features four fish-eye cameras, dual stereo cameras and a computer in the trunk.
