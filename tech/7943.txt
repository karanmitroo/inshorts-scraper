The Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has launched an Android app called the BMTC Easy Travel Information Planner, which enables commuters to keep a track of real-time bus movements. It gives commuters suggestions regarding bus routes, and records whether buses skip stops, over speed or are delayed. It is reportedly the first such system in India.
