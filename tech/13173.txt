Facebook has removed restriction for users under 18, allowing teenagers to manually alter the setting and share information with public. Until now, Facebook settings restricted viewability of a teenager's postings only to their friends, and to the friends of their friends. A special notice would appear the first couple of times they attempt to post information to the public.
