Martin Sorrell, CEO of the world's largest advertising and public relations company WPP, on Friday asked Google to "step up and take responsibility" for the content posted to its platforms. He said this while on a panel with Google's UK Managing Director Ronan Harris. "You have the resources, your margins are enormous, you have control of the algorithms," Sorrell added.
