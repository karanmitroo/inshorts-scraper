Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said, "Freedom means you don't have to ask for permission first" in a post on the social media platform. If anybody breaks community standards, they will "face consequences afterwards", he added. This comes after Facebook revealed that fake advertisements were bought during the last US presidential elections by accounts "likely operated out of Russia".
