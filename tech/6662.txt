According to reports, HDFC Bank has launched 'Project AI' where robots will be introduced at its branches to act primarily as receptionists. The robot will assist customers with tasks like withdrawing or transferring money or finding relevant departments for specific tasks. The pilot program will reportedly begin from a Mumbai branch, and may be scaled up later.
