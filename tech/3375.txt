According to leaked internal documents, social media platform Facebook uses algorithms to identify children as young as 14 years old who feel "insecure" and "worthless." The collected data allegedly allows advertisers on Facebook to target specific ads towards the children. A Facebook spokesperson issued an apology and said that the company had initiated a probe into the matter.
