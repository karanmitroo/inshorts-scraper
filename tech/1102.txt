Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday took to Twitter to congratulate Australia on voting in favour of legalising same-sex marriage using the emoji of New Zealand's flag. However, the tweet was deleted and Cook posted another message with the correct flag. While both countries' flags have Union Jacks, Australia's flag features six stars and New Zealand's flag features four.
