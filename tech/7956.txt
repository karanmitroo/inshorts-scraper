Lenovo on Thursday admitted that it has failed to build on its acquisition of Motorola, which it purchased from Google for $2.91 billion in 2014. Lenovo sold 10.9 million devices in the final quarter this year, with Motorola contributing just five million devices to it. In January, Lenovo announced to unify the two phone businesses and rename Motorola to 'Moto'.
