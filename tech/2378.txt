India-born MIT scientist Manisha Mohan has developed a sticker-like sensor to detect sexual assault. The Bluetooth-enabled sensor triggers a loud noise to alert nearby people and connects to a smartphone app to send texts to the victim's saved contacts. It can also be trained to learn the difference between when a user is undressing and when they're being forcefully disrobed.
