Augmented reality application 'FaceApp' has been slammed by people for a 'racist' filter that lightens peoples' skin tones. The filter, which is labelled as 'hot', also alters their facial features. "The hot feature makes black people white. That is extremely racist," commented a user. The app's founder later apologised and said his team is "working on the complete fix".
