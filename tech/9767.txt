Australian surfers Andrew Turton and Pete Ceglinksi have designed a prototype ‘Seabin’ that can collect up to 1.5 kg garbage from the sea per day. The duo’s device sucks water along with rubbish of varying size and pumps out clean water. The idea was reportedly triggered by their frustration with unclean sea water while surfing.
