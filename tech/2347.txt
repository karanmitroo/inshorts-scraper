A US district judge has ruled that iPhone users can take action against Apple for allegedly disabling FaceTime on iPhone 4 and 4S on purpose. Apple was accused of trying to save money that it would have had to pay to third-party servers. The technology major earlier claimed that users did not suffer an economic loss since FaceTime is free.
