Flipkart has reportedly been directed by a consumer forum to pay a Hyderabad resident ₹15,000 for selling him a faulty mobile charger worth ₹259 that damaged his phone. The man claims the charger burnt the wires of his phone within 10 minutes of charging. Flipkart contended that it's a mediator between users and sellers, and not responsible for product quality.
