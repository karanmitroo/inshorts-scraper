Japanese car maker Toyota announced on Friday that it will financially lead a $50-million, robotics and artificial intelligence research project aimed at building intelligent cars. The company, in collaboration with Stanford University and MIT, wants to manufacture automobiles that are safe and render humans as better drivers rather than developing completely autonomous, self-driving cars.
