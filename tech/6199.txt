Israel-based camera accessory startup Miggo has made the Pictar, a camera mod for iPhones. The device has a grip that allows the iPhone to be handled like a typical SLR camera, with features including a dedicated shutter button, an exposure control wheel and a zoom dial-cum-selfie-button. The $90 device is compatible with all iPhone models up to the 6S Plus.
