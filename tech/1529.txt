Billionaire Elon Musk has offered to build Puerto Rico's electricity system using independent batteries and solar power. "The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too," Musk tweeted. Puerto Rico's power grid was demolished due to hurricane Maria earlier in September.
