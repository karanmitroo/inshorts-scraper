North Korea's 31 Olympic athletes have not been given Samsung Galaxy S7 Olympics edition phones distributed to every athlete at the opening parade. A North Korean team manager reportedly collected the handsets but never gave them to the team, and later declined to give a reason for the move. Samsung is a South Korean multinational, a country North Korea is at war with.
