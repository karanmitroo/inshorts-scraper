A US-based startup has developed a â‚¹3,400 home kit called 'YO sperm' that lets men test their fertility through their smartphone. The kit includes a sample collection cup, a testing slide, a plastic pipette, a special liquefying powder and a mini microscope. The mini microscope attaches to the smartphone's camera to measure the sperm mobility.
