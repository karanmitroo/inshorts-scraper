Mahmud and Massoud Hassani, two brothers from Afghanistan, have developed the 'Mine Kafon Drone' to locate, detect and detonate landmines. Fitted with a 3D mapping system, the drone locates landmines with a metal detector and uses a detonator to set them off remotely. Hassani brothers claim the drone is nearly 120 times cheaper and 20 times faster than traditional techniques.
