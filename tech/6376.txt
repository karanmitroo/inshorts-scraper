Tech major Apple's shares hit their highest level of 2016 on Wednesday, with the company's valuation surpassing the $600 billion-mark for the first time since April. This comes amid strong demand for its new model iPhone 7 and Samsung Electronics' recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. Earlier, the world's most valuable company had sunk to a two-year low in July.
