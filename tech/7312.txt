Estonian startup Cleveron has launched its smart locker 'PackRobot'. Packages submitted by the delivery persons are stored by the locker and a unique QR code is sent to the package receiver on their smartphones. Owners can receive their packages by presenting the code to the locker. With a capacity to store over 500 packages, PackRobot comes with climate control adjustments.
