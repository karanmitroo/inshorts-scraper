The 'Petya' ransomware attack, which was first reported in Ukraine, has now spread to the US, targetting pharmaceutical giant Merck. "We confirm our company's computer network was compromised today as part of global hack," the company said. The attack, which was earlier blamed for disrupting systems in 2016, has hit several companies in countries including Germany, Netherlands, and the UK.
