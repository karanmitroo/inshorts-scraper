Pennsylvania-based Jalil Aziz on Monday pleaded guilty to using at least 71 Twitter accounts to spread Islamic State propaganda. Aziz posted the names, addresses, and photographs of about 100 US military members online and encouraged his Twitter followers to kill them. He reportedly told his followers to "kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes."
