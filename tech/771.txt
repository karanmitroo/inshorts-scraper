A Spanish court has ruled that parents can read their children's WhatsApp messages, saying it is required to preserve the "indemnity of minors". The ruling came after a mother sued her former husband for reading their children's WhatsApp conversations, claiming he breached their privacy. The court upheld the father's action, saying the use of social networks by minors requires attention.
