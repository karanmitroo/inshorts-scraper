Teen writer and Holocaust victim Anne Frank's story will be made into a virtual reality film. Producer Jonah Hirsch and filmmaker Danny Abrahms wanted to "create a VR experience that connected viewers with arguably the most significant event in human history" using Frank's story. Notably, Frank recorded her experience of Nazi persecution during the World War II in a diary.
