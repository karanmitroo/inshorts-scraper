Police personnel at a railway station in China's Henan province have been equipped with facial-recognition glasses that can spot suspects in a crowd. The glasses are connected to a police database that can match passengers with criminal suspects. So far, the technology has helped the police identify seven people suspected of crimes including human trafficking.
