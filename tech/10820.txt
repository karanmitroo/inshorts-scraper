China has started assembling the world's largest single-aperture radio telescope, which will allegedly have a dish the size of 30 football pitches. Named Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), it will overtake the Arecibo Observatory in the US, which is 305 metres in diameter. FAST nestles in a valley between the hills of Guizhou, a south-western province in China.
