The Glasgow airport in Scotland has unveiled a robot named GLAdys that can sing Christmas carols, dance, and tell Christmas stories to travellers. Dressed in a Santa outfit, it also features a mounted camera where travellers can take photos with the robot. Travellers can send the selfies to themselves by email.
