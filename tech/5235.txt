A link to a three-second video, when watched, is making the iPhones slow down and eventually freeze. While the video plays normally in iPhone's video player, it starts making the device slow and unresponsive, which can be fixed only by restarting the handset. The prank is said to affect devices from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 7.
