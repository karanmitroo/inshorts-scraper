US Postal Service has launched a Christmas tree ornament that changes colour to show status of gifts sent by post. Users can connect the ornament to parcels using cellular technology. It glows blue when the package is out for delivery, red when it has been dropped and turns green when sensors on the box indicate the gift has been opened.
