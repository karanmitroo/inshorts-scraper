Israeli army is planning to use augmented reality technologies in live battlefield situations. The army's C2 Systems Department purchased two HoloLens glasses from Microsoft to develop its technology to improve battlefield strategy and train field personnel, intending to use it on active duty within months. The army is also finding ways for HoloLens-wearing medics to operate on wounded soldiers.
