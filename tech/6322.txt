A 28-year-old Florida-based man on Friday sued Samsung after the company's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone exploded in the front pocket of his pants. The man suffered severe burns on his right leg and burnt his left thumb while trying to remove the phone from his pants. A day earlier, Samsung had recalled the smartphone in the US following batteries' overheating.
