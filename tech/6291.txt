Scotland-based researchers have developed a software which enables computers to identify deadly bacteria like E.coli. It 'learns' DNA signatures linked with bacterial samples which have caused infectious outbreaks, and compares these signatures to identify animal strains likely to cause similar human infections. Scientists claim the research could be adapted for several other bacteria types.
