Indian internet service providers have blocked access to Internet Archive website due to an order by Madras High Court following a petition by the makers of 'Lipstick under my Burkha' and 'Jab Harry met Sejal'. The website is one of 2,650 that were allegedly hosting pirated copies of the films. Internet Archive lets users see older versions of several websites.
