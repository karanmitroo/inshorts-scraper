A US-based startup has created 'FoldiMate', a robot that folds apparels by sensing the size and thickness of the fabric. Users need to hang the clothes on a rack attached to the robot and select the type of clothing through the provided buttons. FoldiMate folds, perfumes and de-wrinkles the apparels. It costs around $700-$850 and can be pre-ordered in 2017.
