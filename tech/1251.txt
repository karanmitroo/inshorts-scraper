Social media platform Twitter has blocked photos, videos and news tagged with 'bisexual' hashtag to appear in the search results, according to users. The block includes words like 'butt' and 'boobs' but searches for photos under the 'lesbian' and 'gay' hashtags still yield results. Twitter has apologised and said the removal of search results for certain terms was "an error".
