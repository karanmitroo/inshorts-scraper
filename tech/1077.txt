Technology giant Apple is reportedly working with chipmaker Intel to design a 5G modem chip for future iPhone models. The reports also suggested that Intel could supply a 5G modem for an iPhone debuting in 2019 or 2020. The 5G network is expected to deliver 10 to 100 times faster speed than the average 4G network.
