A cockroach-inspired robot, which can aid search-and-rescue operations during disasters, including earthquakes and explosions, is being developed by scientists at the UC Berkeley, USA. Just like real cockroaches, CRAM (Compressible Robot with Articulated Mechanisms) can squeeze into and run through gaps half its height, enabling it to locate survivors and safe entry points from under the rubble.
