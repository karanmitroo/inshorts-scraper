Navigation service provider MapmyIndia unveiled two self-driving technologies called RealView and Advanced Maps at the ongoing Auto Expo 2016. RealView senses the surrounding ground, captures high-resolution 360-degree images and saves that data to create a virtual representation of the driving conditions. While, Advanced Maps provides information on the routes and possible obstacles.
