Apple has changed the name of its retail outlets from 'Apple Store' to simply 'Apple'. In addition to the company naming its latest outlet 'Apple World Trade Center', the change in branding has also been implemented on its website. Through this rebranding, Apple reportedly aims to position its stores as a gathering place for communities, rather than just regular shops.
