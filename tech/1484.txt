Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed an ingestible sensor that sticks to the stomach's lining to monitor contractions of the digestive tract and meal ingestion. The 2 by 2.5 centimetre-sensor can be placed in a capsule that dissolves after being swallowed. It is powered by mechanical energy and can stretch along with the skin owing to its flexibility.
