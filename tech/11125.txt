Amazon on Wednesday announced a new service that offers free shipping on small, lightweight items for every customer and not just its prime members. The items just need to weigh less than 8 ounces and cost less than $10 to qualify. Amazon had started the trial run 13 weeks ago but introduced it formally this week.
