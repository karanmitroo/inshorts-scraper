The US National Security Agency collected over 15 crore phone records of Americans last year even after Congress limited its ability to collect such records, according to a top US intelligence officer. The NSA had warrants to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects and a handful of other people. The NSA has been gathering records of callers since 9/11 attacks.
