Snapchat's parent company Snap on Friday said it has laid off 18 employees in its recruiting division. In an email sent to employees last month, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said the company will be hiring employees at a "slower rate" in 2018. Last month, Snap reportedly laid off about a dozen employees in its hardware marketing division.
