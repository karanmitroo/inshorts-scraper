Dropbox granted stock worth about $190 million to three executives last year as the file-sharing company prepared for an IPO. CEO Drew Houston, Co-founder Arash Ferdowsi and Senior VP of engineering, product and design, Quentin Clark, who earn base salaries of $400,000 each, received the rewards. Houston and Ferdowsi haven't received equity awards since they founded Dropbox, the filing said.
