Technology firm Yahoo on Friday said it will not hold an earnings call or webcast with analysts for its quarterly results due to its pending deal to be acquired by telecom firm Verizon. Verizon is reportedly looking to renegotiate the $4.83 billion deal or back out of it altogether, after Yahoo confirmed a data breach of around 50 crore accounts.
