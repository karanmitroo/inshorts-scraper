Europe's largest floating solar farm has been built in London on the Thames river, featuring 23,046 solar panels and measuring 57,500 square metres or the size of eight football pitches. Built at a cost of over $8 million, it will generate enough power to light 1,800 houses. Around 61,000 floats and 177 anchors are used to keep the panels afloat.
