WhatsApp's latest update on Android and iOS apps allows users to add up to 256 contacts in a group chat. Earlier, the number of contacts that could be added to a group chat was limited to 100. This is the third straight increase in the limit since November 2014, when the number of contacts that could be added was 50.
