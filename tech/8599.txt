A special committee formed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has recommended aÂ 6-8% tax on 13 B2B online activities as an e-commerce levy. These activities include sending and receiving emails, downloading content, blogging, digital advertising and designing websites. If approved, the move will directly affect companies like Google and Facebook that rely on digital advertising.
