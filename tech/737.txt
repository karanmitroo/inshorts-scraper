YouTuber Logan Paul has apologised for posting a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan's Aokigahara forest. Adding the mistake won't happen again, Logan said he intended to spread awareness about suicide prevention. Titled 'We found a dead body in the Japanese Suicide Forest', the video blurred victim's face and was removed within 24 hours.
