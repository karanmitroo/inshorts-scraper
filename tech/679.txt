Technology giant Samsung's recently filed patent has revealed a pressure sensitive display similar to the 3D Touch feature released by Apple. The pressure-sensitive technology has already been implemented around the virtual home button in Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+. However, there is no confirmation if this technology would feature on the company's foldable smartphone reportedly called 'Galaxy X'.
