Online platform Tor Hidden Service offers access to telecom's private SS7 network for $500 a month. The access could be used to intercept texts, track the location of an individual phone, or cut off cellular service entirely. Some customers, however, claimed to have paid the site's fee only to be ignored by the site's manager.
