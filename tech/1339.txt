Technology giant Google has extended the warranty of its Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones to two years, its VP of Product Management Mario Queiroz announced. This comes after users reported Pixel 2 XL's screens turning grey, suggesting burn-in. Google will also add a mode for saturated colours via a software update on both devices to tackle the issue.
