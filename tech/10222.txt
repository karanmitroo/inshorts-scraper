Nike on Thursday announced that it is working on first of its kind smart shoes, those which featured in 'Back to the Future'. Just like in the film, the 2015 Nike Mag will feature “power laces" and will be powered by a technology "that senses the wearer’s motion". A limited edition release, the shoes will only be available via auction.
