Video messaging application Snapchat has been targeted in a phishing attack by a scammer impersonating Co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel. The company received an e-mail requesting the payroll data of its employees and divulged the same, overlooking the scam. However, this has not affected Snapchatâ€™s internal systems and the breach has been reported to the FBI.
