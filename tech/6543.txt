Denmark-based electronics company Libratone has made a pair of noise-cancelling earphones which have a lightning port at one of its ends. The earphones claim to automatically adjust the noise cancellation level based on the user's environment. Notably, Apple's next iPhone is rumoured to not have a headphone jack.
