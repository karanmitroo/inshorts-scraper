Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has said that the company will learn from the mistake it made by deleting historic Vietnam War photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack. The photo was deleted from several accounts on Friday for violating Facebook's restrictions on nudity. However, the picture was later reinstated by Facebook.
