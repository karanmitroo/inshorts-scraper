State-run telecommunications company Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is planning to install 50 'zero base' mobile towers in India. A zero base tower can function as a wi-fi hotspot, street light and camera and has better aesthetics with radio units concealed inside its pole or underneath. BSNL is expected to develop a concept for the same in six months.
