World's largest search engine Google's homepage looks simple and minimal because its founders had limited knowledge of HTML. Google Co-founder Sergey Brin was once quoted saying, "We didn't have a webmaster and I don't do HTML." Google still maintains the minimalistic look nineteen years after its incorporation on September 4, 1998.
