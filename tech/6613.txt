Microsoft plans to open a cybersecurity centre at Connaught Place, New Delhi to assist the government and private agencies with all-round intelligence to counter cyber attacks in the country. Microsoft has seven such centres globally, including a small office in Gurgaon that opened in June. The new centre will be modelled on Microsoft's biggest cybersecurity setup at its Washington headquarters.
