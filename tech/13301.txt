NASA scientists on Tuesday announced that the sun is gearing up for a major solar flip, an event that occurs every 11 years, in which the magnetic field of the sun will do a 180 degree flip. Solar physicist Todd Hoeksema of Stanford University mentioned that this change imminent in 3-4 months will have ripple effects throughout the solar system.
