According to some users, the Apple Watch won't work properly for those with tattoos. The watch doesn't detect the inked arm as skin, posts on Reddit claimed. If the watch can’t see it's wearer's skin, it will think it’s been taken off and lock itself. The wrist detection can be turned off. However, it makes the Watch less secure.
