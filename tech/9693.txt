BlackBerry, who earlier announced to pull out its operations in Pakistan decided on Friday to continue its services in the country. The decision comes in the wake of the Pakistan government taking back its request from BlackBerry to access its users' data. Pakistan in July 2015 had put the request, which the company refused to accept and announced its exit.
