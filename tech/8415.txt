A team led by an Indian-origin researcher from Columbia University have created a flexible sheet camera which, upon bending or wrapping around objects, can change its field of view. The team designed a flexible lens array made of silicone rubber that changes its focal length when the sheet is bent, enabling the camera to capture high-quality images.
