Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has apologised for his "attempt to troll the trolls" last week when he edited insulting comments against him written by Donald Trump supporters. "The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself," he said adding that Reddit will start issuing warnings and permanent bans to its most "toxic" trolls.
