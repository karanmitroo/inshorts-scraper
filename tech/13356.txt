A website assessment carried out by NIC found that only two of Government's over 200 websites are user-friendly for disabled people while others are non-compliant to Guidelines for Indian Government Websites (GIGW), which is essential for making websites accessible to the disabled. In a memorandum dated July-5, the ministry of personnel asked all ministries to make their websites GIGW compliant.
