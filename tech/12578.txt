Apple on Monday announced an all-new iOS 8 for iPads and iPhones, and OS X Yosemite, the next version of its desktop operating system for Mac range of computers. However, it didnâ€™t announce any new hardware as was being expected. The announcements were made at the WWDC 2014 (Worldwide Developers Conference), Apple's ongoing annual developer conference.
