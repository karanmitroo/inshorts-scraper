According to The Guardian, Facebook accidentally exposed identities of over 1,000 workers across 22 departments to suspected terrorists. A bug in Facebook's software exposed personal details of employees who review content like sexual material and terrorist propaganda. One of the affected moderators quit Facebook and went into hiding fearing retaliation from potential terrorists he had banned.
