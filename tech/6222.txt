Elon Musk co-founded aerospace manufacturer SpaceX said that its Falcon 9 rocket may have exploded due to a large breach in its helium system. The rocket exploded while launching in September, destroying Facebook's satellite that would've provided free internet across 14 African countries. The satellite's maker Spacecom is asking SpaceX for either $50 million in compensation or a free flight.
