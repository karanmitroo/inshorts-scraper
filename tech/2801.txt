Google Co-founder Larry Page, Uber Co-founder Travis Kalanick and a group of other executives were on Friday ordered to testify in a technology theft case involving the two companies. Google's self-driving car unit Waymo in February sued Uber alleging it intentionally hired its former engineer Anthony Levandowski. He is accused of stealing 14,000 documents of Waymo's self-driving car technology.
