A Canada-based startup has made a quilt called the 'Smartduvet Breeze' that lets users set different temperatures for both sides of the bed through a connected smartphone application. The quilt is an upgrade to the startup's original Smartduvet that automatically makes the bed. The Smartduvet Breeze has been priced at about â‚¹13,000.
