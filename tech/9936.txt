After two appeals, Samsung agreed on Friday to pay Apple over $548 million in the patent infringement case. In May, a US appeals court reduced the 2012 judgment that had directed Samsung to pay $930 million for copying the look of Apple's iPhone. However, Samsung reserved the right to get reimbursed if Apple's touchscreen gesture patent is struckdown later.
