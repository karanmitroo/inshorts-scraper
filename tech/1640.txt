Microsoft's India-born CEO Satya Nadella in his book 'Hit Refresh' has revealed that he gave up his green card in 1994 to be with his wife. Nadella revealed he applied for a H1-B visa instead, which allowed his wife Anu to live with him in the US. "Anu was my priority...that made my decision a simple one," Nadella wrote.
