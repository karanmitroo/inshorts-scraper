French startup Moona has created a temperature-regulating device priced at â‚¹10,000 that cools a user's pillow while they sleep. A motion sensor monitors the user's head movements and circulates cool water in the pillow to encourage sleepiness. The device also acts as an alarm by sending warm water through the pillow to wake the user up at pre-set time.
