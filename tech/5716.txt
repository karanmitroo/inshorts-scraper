Electronics major Nintendo's shares plunged 6.5% on Friday, wiping out $2.4 billion from its market value following a trailer of its new 'Switch' console. The device's content does not look so different and could be a "disappointment" to users, analysts said. Notably, the plunge was worse than the reaction to Wii U console, which saw Nintendo shares fall by 5%.
