Search giant Google on Thursday announced that its Q&A feature has been added to Google Maps and Search on Android. For instance, if the user is looking for a business listing in Maps or Search, there'll be a Q&A section for queries about the location. The users can further upvote helpful questions, which will appear further up the page.
