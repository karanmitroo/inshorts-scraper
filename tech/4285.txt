MIT researchers have designed and demonstrated a small ingestible battery that is powered by the acidic fluids in the stomach. The 4-cm-long cylindrical cell can generate enough energy to power drug delivery devices and ingestible sensors for temperature, heart and breathing rate. During tests, the device was able to power a temperature sensor and transmit data wirelessly every 12 seconds.
