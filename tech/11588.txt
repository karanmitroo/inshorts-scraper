The Delhi Government on Tuesday warned cab-hailing services Uber and Ola to cease operations immediately, failing which their radio-taxi license applications would not be processed. All web-based taxi services in Delhi had been directed to stop after reports of a rape in a cab contracted to Uber in December, but Uber resumed services in January and Ola continued its operations.
