Twitter Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has admitted that he feels "complicated" about the way US President-elect Donald Trump uses the platform. "Having the President-elect on our service, using it as a direct line of communication, allows everyone to see what's on his mind at the moment. I think that's interesting, I think it's fascinating," he added.
