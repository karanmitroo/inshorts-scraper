US-based startup Coros Wearables has developed 'Linx', a smart cycling helmet that lets cyclists listen to music, take calls, and get route directions. The water-resistant helmet makes use of bone conduction technology to transmit sounds wirelessly. Linx lasts for 10 hours on a single charge and can be connected to an app to track data like ride distance and speed.
