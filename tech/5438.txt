High-speed transportation startup Hyperloop One has released a teaser of its launch in Dubai, where it claims that its tubes will cover the 125 km distance between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in 12 minutes at 1,041 kmph. A car currently takes about two hours to cover the same distance. On November 8, Hyperloop is set to make a major announcement.
