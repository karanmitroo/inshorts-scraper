Scientists at a Dutch University have conducted an experiment that proves one of the most radical claims of quantum theory called "entanglement", which Einstein famously rejected. This is a property in which objects separated by great distance can interact and instantaneously affect each otherâ€™s behavior. The experiment also proves subatomic particles do not take form until they are observed.
