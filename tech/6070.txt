UCLA researchers along with Alphabet's Verily division have developed a wearable microscope that can detect and monitor fluorescent biomarkers inside the skin. The glow-in-the-dark biomarkers are a vital tool for cancer detection and monitoring drug delivery. The device can be worn around the biceps and work by capturing fluorescent images obtained by hitting an angled laser at the skin.
