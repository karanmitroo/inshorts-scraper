Unlike earlier reported, Google Glass isnâ€™t available for sale to anybody in US. The store is only functional to allow those who participated in its Apr-15 sale to finish their purchases, a Google spokesperson said. However, some people might have placed their order while the store seemed open; and Google is yet to announce what will happen to those orders.
