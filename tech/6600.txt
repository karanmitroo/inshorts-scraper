North America-based hotel chain, Aloft Hotels, recently unveiled the world's first voice-activated rooms at their branches at Boston Seaport and Santa Clara. The new service under 'Project Jetson' allows guests to communicate their requests to Appleâ€™s voice-powered assistant, Siri, via an in-room iPad. The system can be used by guests to control settings such as the room temperature and lights.
