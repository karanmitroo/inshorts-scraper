Italian scientist Sergio Canavero, member of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, claimed that soon human head transplants would be possible, noting that American neurosurgeon Robert White conducted a successful head transplant in monkeys in 1970s.  Canavero describes a way to sever donor and recipient spinal-cords with an ultra-sharp knife, and then rapidly fusing them together mechanically using advanced polymer "glue".
