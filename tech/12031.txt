Apple is expected to stop the production of the iPhone 5c in the middle of 2015, as the company suppliers look to wind down production of the smartphone by mid-2015, reports said. However, the reports didn't give any specific reason for the halt in the production. Notably, Apple phases out older devices after it ushers in new models.
