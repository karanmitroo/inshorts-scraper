Former US President Barack Obama had reportedly warned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2016 over fake news and political disinformation on the social media platform. Reports suggest that the incident happened two months before Trump's inauguration in a meeting of world leaders held in Peru. Reports said, Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem but told Obama that there was no easy remedy.
