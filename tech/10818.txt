According to US researchers, a robot has for the first time displayed the human trait of self-awareness while solving a classic logic puzzle, The King's Wise Men. Belonging to French robotics company Aldebaran and competing with two others, it not only understood the rules of the puzzle, but also recognised its own voice and that it is a distinct individual.
