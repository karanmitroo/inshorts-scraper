E-retailer Amazon is planning to release a new ad-supported video streaming service by next year, sources said. The service will be separate from the company's $99-a-year Prime membership. The new service will compete directly with Hulu and Netflix. It is not yet known if the service will be free or chargeable as Amazon was not available for comment.
