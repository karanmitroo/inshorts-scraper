Several people, including the employees of Chinese electronics manufacturer Oppo, protested outside the company's office in Noida after a Chinese employee allegedly tore an Indian flag and threw it in a dustbin. The police have registered a case against the Chinese national after a complaint filed by three employees and asked Oppo to submit CCTV footage to verify the incident.
