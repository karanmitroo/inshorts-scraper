The Twitter account of Wikipedia Co-founder Jimmy Wales was hacked on Saturday. The account tweeted, "RIP Jimmy Wales, 1966 â€“ 2016" and "I confirm that Wikipedia is all lies OurMine team is the true." The responsibility for the hacking was claimed by hacker group OurMine, which previously claimed hacking accounts of Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.
