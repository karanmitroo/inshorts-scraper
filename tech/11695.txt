Israeli company 'Sesame Enable' claims to have developed the first completely hands-free smartphone that can allow disabled users to control the device with head movement. The phone uses a vision algorithm and a front-facing camera to track head movements and allow users to control a cursor on screen. The $1,000-phone recently won the $1 Million Verizon Powerful Answers Award.
