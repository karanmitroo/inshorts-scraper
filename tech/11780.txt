NASA Saturday launched its first Earth satellite - Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory - which aims to collect global observations of the vital soil moisture. SMAP, which begins a three-year mission, will help improve climate and weather forecasts and allow scientists to monitor droughts. Furthermore, it will help predict flooding caused by severe rainfall or snowmelt.
