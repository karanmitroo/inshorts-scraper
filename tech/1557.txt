A new law targetting hate speech on social media platforms has come into effect in Germany. The law requires social media platforms to remove hate speech and offensive content within 24 hours, or within seven days if the content is difficult to evaluate. Those failing to comply could face fines of up to €50 million (over ₹385 crore).
