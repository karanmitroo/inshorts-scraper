Hewlett-Packard Company's historical archives were destroyed in wildfires which burned across Northern California, earlier in October. Over 100 boxes of William Hewlett and David Packard's writings, correspondence, and speeches were contained in the modular buildings that were destroyed in the fire. They were under Keysight Technologies with HP origins which took ownership of the archives in 2014.
