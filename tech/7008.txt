Scientists are developing a technology for clothes that would contact charities or auction websites when not worn regularly. The ‘connected wardrobe’, which will text owners to remind them their clothes aren't being used, will contact charities if ignored for a long time. The project has been shortlisted for the Network for Innovations in Culture and Creativity in Europe (N.I.C.E) Award.
