Social media giant Facebook temporarily shuts down all the advertisements on its platform in Thailand, to mourn the death of the country's King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday. This is the first time when Facebook has blocked advertisements across an entire country. Thailand has already entered a year-long period of mourning that will involve citizens and servants wearing black attire.
