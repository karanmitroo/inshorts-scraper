Facebook has warned users against posts that claim it will infringe users' privacy if they don't subscribe to a monthly plan or repost a supposed 'legal notice', after numerous instances of sharing such posts were noted on the website. A statement on Monday said, "Facebook is free... the thing about copying and pasting a legal notice is just a hoax."
