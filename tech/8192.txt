A developer working on automobile manufacturer Nissan's 'NissanConnect EV' mobile application was recently busted for copying code from a question-and-answer site called Stack Overflow. One of the copied lines of the code showed up in the most recent app update under the section for granting location services privilege, stating, "The spirit of stack overflow is coders helping coders".
