In a first of its kind trial on a public road, driverless shuttle bus WePod transported six passengers along a 200-meter stretch of road in Netherlands. At a speed of 8 kmph, the shuttle did not set a speed record, the project's technical director said. The electric, driverless bus project will expand along a 6 km route in Netherlands' Wageningen.
