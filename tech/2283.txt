According to reports, Samsung may introduce in-display fingerprint sensors for Galaxy Note 9. The switch to the in-display sensor will reportedly increase the price of the device 4-5 times as the technology will increase the cost of production. Earlier reports suggested that Apple also planned to include in-display sensor for iPhones. Galaxy Note 9 is estimated to release in 2018.
