US-based researchers have developed a 3-D printing technology that can make personalised biomedical equipment. This will enable devices like catheters to custom-fit premature babies. Such apparatus will reportedly be both stronger and lighter than their present versions. A researcher said, “If you can print a catheter whose geometry is specific to the patient, you can avoid puncturing veins”.
