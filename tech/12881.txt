Developer of hit game Flappy bird, Dong Nguyen, has withdrawn his game form both Android and iOS. In what look like a classic case of the artist growing to hate his creation, he tweeted Saturday, “I cannot take this anymore,” and refused to sell the game on to any other publisher. However, there are plenty of Flappy Bird clones available.
