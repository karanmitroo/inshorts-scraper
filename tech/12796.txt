Following the WhatsApp buyout announcement, Facebook is said to be in acquisition talks with Titan Aerospace. The social-networking giant is looking forward to make use of drones that are produced by Titan to reach out to parts of the world that have little or no access to Internet. Earlier, Google announced Project Loon, which is working on a similar idea.
