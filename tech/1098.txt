Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, a professor in the Banaras Hindu University, has developed a desktop app which plays devotional music when users try to access "inappropriate websites" containing pornography, violence or other vulgar content. The app, which is named 'Har Har Mahadev', was launched on Monday for laptops and desktops. It will soon be available for Android devices as well.
