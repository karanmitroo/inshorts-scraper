Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 1 will launch the digital locker facility that will enable citizens to digitally store their important documents like PAN card, passport, mark sheets and degree certificates. Digital Locker provides a personal storage space in the cloud linked to citizen's Aadhaar number and will enable sharing of verified electronic documents across government agencies.
