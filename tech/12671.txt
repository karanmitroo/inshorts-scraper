Researchers believe that graphene, which has been called the wonder material, will be used in next-generation devices and it could completely change the electronics industry. Graphene is the strongest, thinnest material known to exist and can conduct electricity better than anything else. It is so thin that a single ounce of it could reportedly cover 28 football fields.
