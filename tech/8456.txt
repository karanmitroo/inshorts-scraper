The first certified 18-rotor electric helicopter, called theÂ Volocopter VC200, has completed its first manned test flight. Developed by Germany-based E-Volo, the multicopter is a fuel-free drone-like vehicle that does not need constant monitoring to be airborne. The helicopter hits top speed at 60 mph and aims at becoming a semi-affordable personal transport.
