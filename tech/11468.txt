As per researchers, NASA's Curiosity Rover has revealed the possibility of presence of liquid water close to the surface of Mars. "We have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and, under the right conditions, it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere," a researcher said. Calcium perchlorate lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice.
