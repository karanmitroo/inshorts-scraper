After being forced to issue a global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 devices because of overheating and exploding batteries, Samsung is reportedly planning to use LG batteries in its future phones. The current source for Samsung's smartphone batteries is its subsidiary Samsung SDI and China's Amperex Technology. The South Korean company is expected to launch Galaxy S8 in 2017.
