US-based startup Noria Home has developed 'Noria', a $400 portable smart window air conditioner (AC) that can be controlled through a dedicated mobile app. While Noria includes a knob on the front to control the temperature, the AC's app uses bluetooth to set energy saving schedules. It can cool an area up to 160 square feet and weighs 13 kg.
