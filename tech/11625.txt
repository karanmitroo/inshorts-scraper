Apple founder Steve Jobs rejected an offer of a partial liver transplant from current CEO Tim Cook, a book 'Becoming Steve Jobs' revealed. Jobs declined the offer while waiting for a liver transplant in the final stages of his pancreatic cancer. He received a transplant later from another donor in March'09 and breathed his last in Oct'14 aged 56.
