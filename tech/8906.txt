Video streaming app PressPlay TV has launched its free video-on-demand service in select trains in India. It has partnered with Northwestern Railways to offer the service on Delhi-Bikaner bound Bikaner Intercity and Delhi-Udaipur bound Chetak Express trains. The content is locally hosted at the PressPlay TV hotspot, so users donâ€™t need to connect to the internet to use the service.
