Two American artists, Justin Crowe and Eric Snee, have designed a unique selfie stick that looks like an arm. Called the 'Selfie Arm', it is a work in progress prototype, the designers said. "Nobody wants to look alone while they mindlessly snap pictures of themselves â€” the product conveniently provides you a welcoming arm," they said on their website.
