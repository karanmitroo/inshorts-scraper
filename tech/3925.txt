Phillip Rather, the Head of Local Partnerships at Facebook, has stated that the social media giant looks at ride-hailing startup Uber as a threat. "I think Uber is the most underestimated company to affect local businesses," said Phillip. Acknowledging that Uber did not have a good couple of weeks, he said that Uber still has a good integration with Facebook.
