Genesys International, a small Mumbai-based mapping company, has launched an electronic street view service called Wonobo (similar to Google Street View) for top 54 Indian cities . Founded by brothers Sol Malik and Sajid Malik, it has captured numerous images of almost every street in these cities and stitched the images together to create 360-degree panoramic views of the streets.
