London has become the first city after New York to launch free WiFi kiosks called 'InLinks', which have a touchscreen tablet to offer free phone calls, USB charging, maps, and other local information like weather forecasts. The service will replace hundreds of telecom company BT's existing payphones. The stalls are funded by revenues from advertising on their digital displays.
