US-based startup Kombos has developed a portable modular keyboard instrument that can fit inside any medium-sized backpack. The 61-note keyboard can be broken into five detachable modules, allowing functionality with two to four modules as well. The device, which has been launched on Kickstarter, comes with Bluetooth connectivity and is compatible with any Android or iOS device that supports MIDI.
