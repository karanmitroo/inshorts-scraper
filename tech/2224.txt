The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) this week charged a 26-year-old man from California for extorting sexual images from children as young as 12. The FBI used a fake video containing a code to hack into the account of the alleged 'sextortionist'. When the video was viewed, the code inside contacted an FBI server with its real IP address.
