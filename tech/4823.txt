Researchers from the Imagineering Lab at City University London have developed a smartphone accessory called 'Kissenger', which simulates kissing for people living away from each other. Using pressure sensors, actuators and silicon on the lip part, the gadget claims to mimic a real kiss. The gadget comes with its own app that allows users to send kisses.
