Supersonic car, Bloodhound SSC, which reportedly has the power of 180 Formula One cars, would be unveiled in London on Friday. The car, that has three braking systems, seven fire extinguishers and 500 sensors (twice as many as an F1 car), is expected to break the current world land-speed record of 763 miles per hour (mph) by hitting 1000 mph.
