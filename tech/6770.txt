Google on Tuesday announced that it will start penalising mobile sites that show intrusive ads when a user first opens a webpage by ranking them lower in its search results. As 85% of all webpages are now mobile friendly, it will also declutter its search results by removing the 'mobile-friendly' label which highlights easy-to-read pages on mobile devices.
