Boston Dynamics, a US robotics company, has developed robots that can enhance human effectiveness in military and other defense missions. A high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate rough terrain, 'Atlas' can maintain its balance on one leg even when hit from the side. Another machine called 'WildCat' is a four-legged robot that can run up to 16mph.
