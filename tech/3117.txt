Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday denied the rumours of him running for the post of the US President. The rumours began after he announced to visit all the US states he hasn't visited before, by the end of this year. "I'm doing it to get a broader perspective to make sure we're best serving our community," said Zuckerberg.
