Google on Thursday launched Android Studio 2.0, the latest version of its Integrated Development Environment. The new features include 'Instant Run' – which quickly reflects the code changes on the running app, 'Cloud Test Lab' – which allows app testing across multiple devices, and 'App Indexing' – which helps in promoting app's visibility in Google Search by adding auto-generated URLs.
