The Syrian Electronic Army claimed to have hacked Truecaller, the collaborative phone directory with over 20 million users worldwide and a million from India. The hackers also claim to have data of over a million users with their Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Gmail accounts. Truecaller confirmed the attack but denied that the user's Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media passwords were leaked.
