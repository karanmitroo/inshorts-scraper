A team of Columbia Engineering researchers led by an Indo-American scientist Latha Venkataraman has created a single-molecule electronic device. A single-molecule diode created by the researchers, performs 50 times better than all prior designs and has potential of real-world technological applications for nanoscale devices. The report was published on May 25 in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.
