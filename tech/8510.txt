MIT researchers have created a technique for 3D printing robots that involves printing solid and liquid materials simultaneously. In the process, an inkjet printer deposits layers of drops of different materials, less than half the width of a human hair, from the bottom up. To demonstrate, researchers printed a 6-inch hexapod robot and a silicone-rubber robotic hand with fluid-actuated fingers.
