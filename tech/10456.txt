Jaguar Land Rover launched its first car in the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) segment, the F-Pace at the Frankfurt Motor Show. A Guinness World Record was broken when a stuntman performed a loop-the-loop on a 19.1m high construct with this car at the unveiling. The starting price for the car is $40,990 (approximately Rs 27 lakh) in the United States.
