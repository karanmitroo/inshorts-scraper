Salil Mehta, an Indian-origin Statistics professor at Columbia University on Friday claimed that search giant Google blocked his Gmail account and took down his blog without "reason or warning". Mehta took to Twitter to complain about the block and also tweeted at Google's CEO Sundar Pichai. His accounts were restored later but the reason behind the block was not disclosed.
