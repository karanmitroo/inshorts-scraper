YouTube has launched a new program where users termed as 'Heroes' will help the video-sharing platform to report and flag inappropriate comments and videos. YouTube Heroes will be provided with a separate dashboard where they can see the status of reported items and track their contributions. The more content a person reports, the more features get unlocked on the dashboard.
