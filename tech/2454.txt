Netflix Co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings' net worth has risen nearly $400 million in the last two weeks to touch $2.2 billion after Netflix posted strong second-quarter earnings report. His roughly 3% stake in the business is now worth well above $1 billion. Hastings cofounded Netflix in 1997 with Marc Randolph, who resigned from the board in 2004.
