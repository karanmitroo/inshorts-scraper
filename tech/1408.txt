Researchers at the Stanford University have developed technology that detects earthquakes using fiber optic lines. In case of seismic activity, laser interrogators detect disturbances in the fibers and send information about the magnitude and direction of earthquake tremors. Researchers have detected around 800 seismic events so far using a 3-mile fiber loop on the Stanford campus.
