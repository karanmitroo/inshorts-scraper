American company Apira Science has created an 'iGrow' helmet with built-in headphones that claims to promote hair growth. It uses lasers and LEDs to stimulate activity within the scalp's cell walls, making the hair follicles function normally. Apira Science claims that users will see positive results after using the iGrow helmet for 16 weeks.
