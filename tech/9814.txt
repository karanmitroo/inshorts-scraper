Facebook on Wednesday launched a transportation feature in its standalone Messenger app in select US cities. Under this, users can request Uber rides, Facebook’s first taxi partner for the feature, from within the app. The company said, “With the ability to request, track and pay for a ride in Messenger, we’re making transportation as simple as sending a message”.
