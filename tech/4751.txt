Faucets making company Moen has developed an app-connected smart shower system that allows users to remotely pre-heat the water from their smartphone. Up to 12 settings including cold shower, warm shower and specific temperature are available on the app. A notification flashes on the smartphone once the water has reached the selected temperature.
