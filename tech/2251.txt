According to a court testimony, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg texted, "Everything is going really badly" to wife Priscilla Chan before the company's 2012 IPO. Zuckerberg believed a low revenue projection could push Facebook's valuation to under $50 billion and considered scrapping the IPO. However, Facebook eventually had one of the biggest tech IPOs with a valuation of about $100 billion.
