In a bid to make high-end hardware more accessible to the public, Samsung is reportedly planning to start leasing its Galaxy smartphones in the US. The exact pricing scheme for its leasing programme hasnâ€™t been decided yet. Earlier, Apple started a similar programme called the iPhone Upgrade Program, allowing users to lease new iPhones every year for $32 a month.
