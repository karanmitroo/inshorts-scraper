Belgian watch manufacturer Ressence has developed a mechanical watch Type 2 e-Crown Concept that can be paired with a user's smartphone. The watch, which requires the conventional setup initially, can be set up to one of two time zones using its 'e-Crown' app. It uses both kinetic and solar power to function and automatically exposes solar cells below 50% battery.
