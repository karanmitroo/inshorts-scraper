McDonald's Canada has created 'Boombox', a disposable cup holder that turns into a speaker for users' smartphone. While there are no electronic bits inside the cup, it works as an amplifier to increase the sound of inserted phone's speakers. The limited edition 'Boombox' has been created to celebrate 22 years of McDonald's dessert 'McFlurry' which was invented in Canada.
