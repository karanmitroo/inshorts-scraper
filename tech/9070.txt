Google has been granted a patentÂ for social voting-based campaigns that will reportedly allow the company to embed elections within its search results. The system is intended to understand with which election campaign a search is related and serve relevant polls accordingly. This is expected to offer users secure content sharing and public polling opportunities around elections on a wide scale.
