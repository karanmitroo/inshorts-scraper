NASA has launched a newly-enhanced collision-avoidance system as five active spacecrafts currently orbit Mars, including one from India. The system accurately warns if two orbiters approach each other too closely, ensuring that they do not collide. NASA’s MAVEN and India’s Mangalyaan have recently joined three other orbiters around Mars, one from the European Space Agency and two from NASA.
