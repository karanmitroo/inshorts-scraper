After years of setbacks, Google has finally got the Govt's approval for Streetview in India. In 2011, Streetview cameras had been banned after recording began in Bangalore, due to security concerns. The 360-degree street-level images will be available only for 100 monuments belonging to the ASI and the Ministry of Culture for now, with the launch scheduled for October-3.
