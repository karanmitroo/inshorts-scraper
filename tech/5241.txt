South Korean smartphone maker Samsung may reportedly launch a new glossy black colour variant of its Galaxy S7 handset early next month. The move aims to take on Jet Black and Matte Black colour variants of Apple's iPhone 7 series. While Galaxy S7 already has a black colour option, the new variant is said to be more glossy.
