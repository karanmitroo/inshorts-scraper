Apple's CEO Tim Cook on Saturday said he considers Augmented Reality (AR) as big as the idea of a smartphone. He said, "I view AR like I view the silicon in iPhone, it’s not a product, it’s a core technology". He added, "I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives".
