The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is gearing up to launch its unmanned crew module - GSLV Mk111 - in December. The experimental flight will go up to 100-120 km above earth to test its heat shield survive very high temperatures (about 1, 500 degrees Celsius) during the re-entry into the atmosphere.
