To search for life outside Earth, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing a ‘chemical laptop’ — the first portable, miniaturised laboratory built to detect both amino acids and fatty acids, which indicate the presence of life. Roughly the size of a regular computing laptop, the laptop is thick enough for chemical components inside and can be reprogrammed for different functions.
