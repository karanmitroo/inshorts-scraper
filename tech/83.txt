Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak has revealed that 7 Bitcoins were stolen from him through fraud. "Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy!" he said. Wozniak further claimed that he bought the cryptocurrency so that he could "someday travel and not use credit cards, wallets or cash."
