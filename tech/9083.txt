A US-based startup has developed an electric bike 'Gi FlyBike' priced at $2290, that folds itself within a second. The bike can ride 60 kilometres on a single charge and comes with two full-size 26-inch anti-puncture tyres, USB phone charger, automatic lock and rear lights. Also, all features of the bike can be controlled through a dedicated app.
