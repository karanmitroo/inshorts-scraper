A Canadian startup has created an inflatable sheet and a connected air pump that makes beds automatically. The inflatable sheet fits between the bedsheets and the quilt and is connected to a smartphone-controlled air pump. When the pump is activated, it inflates the sheet's air chamber placing the quilt and sheets back in position, making the bed look tidy.
