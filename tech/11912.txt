A team of Northwestern University scientists have developed an MRI probe that pairs a magnetic nanostructure with an antibody that seeks out the amyloid beta brain toxins responsible for the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This new non-invasive MRI method will be able to detect Alzheimer's in a patient before the symptoms begin to appear.
