An Irish woman's application for an Australian visa has been rejected after she failed an oral fluency test because the voice recognition software couldn't understand her accent. The woman holds two university degrees, both obtained in English. However, the Institute which conducts the test claimed there is nothing wrong with its systems, noting that Australia has high immigration requirements.
