Google has filed a patent for a device called 'Intra-ocular device', which can be injected into a human eye to correct poor vision. The device, which is meant to replace the human eye's natural lens, will contain its own storage, an electronic lens, sensors, a battery and radio components meant for communicating with separate, external devices.
