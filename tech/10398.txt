Facebook has clarified that its tricolour profile picture tool, which is meant to show support for 'Digital India', is not linked to Internet.org. It is a shorthand name mistakenly used by an engineer for part of the code, Facebook said. Earlier, several reports claimed that the profile picture tool secretly registers support for Internet.org which allegedly violates net neutrality.
