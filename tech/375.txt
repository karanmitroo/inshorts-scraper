Elon Musk-led SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, which was launched carrying a government satellite, has survived the descent despite making no landing attempt. "This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn't hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived," Musk tweeted. The rocket landed in the Atlantic and will be towed back to shore.
