Washington has lodged a $100 million consumer-protection lawsuit against cable-television company Comcast for deceiving consumers with a "near-worthless" protection plan. The suit accuses Comcast of more than 1.8 million violations of the state’s Consumer Protection Act, including duping residents into paying at least $73 million in subscription fees without disclosing the plan’s limitations.
