French startup Pragma Industries has become world's first company to start factory production of hydrogen-powered bicycles for use in corporate or municipal fleets. Priced at $9,100, the firm's Alpha bike runs for about 100 km on a two-litre tank of hydrogen. It also takes only 2 minutes to refill the bike with hydrogen using the filling station.
