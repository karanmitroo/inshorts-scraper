Google today announced plans to shut down Orkut, its first attempt at building a social network. The platform, which grew out of Google’s “20% initiative”, will be formally closed on Sept-30. Orkut, which was founded in 2004, has been supplanted by Google+, a more ambitious service that ties into many of Google’s other products.
