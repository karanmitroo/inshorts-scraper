Amazon has opened its first physical retail bookstore called Amazon Books in Seattle, 20 years after it started selling books online. The store, however, houses only around 5,000 top-sellers, selected on the basis of customer reviews and sales on Amazon.com. Interestingly, books are kept face-out instead of spine-out with Amazonâ€™s rating and an actual customer review placed under each book.
