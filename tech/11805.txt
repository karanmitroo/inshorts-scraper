NASA has teamed up with Microsoft to develop a new software that will enable scientists to work on Mars virtually. The software, called OnSight, will help researchers  conduct science operations on Mars, using a wearable technology called Microsoft HoloLens. "OnSight gives our rover scientists the ability to walk around and explore Mars right from their offices," a NASA scientist said.
