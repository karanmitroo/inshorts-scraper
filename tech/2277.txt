Software engineer James Damore who was fired from Google this week has filed a complaint against the technology giant with National Labor Relations Board in the US. He was fired for penning a 10-page memo that asserted that there are biological causes behind gender inequality in the tech industry. Damore claims Google shamed him to silence his complaints.
