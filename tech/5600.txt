An 18-year-old iPhone app developer was arrested in US on charges of computer tampering after he published a web link on Twitter that caused iPhones to repeatedly dial emergency service number 911. Police said that a 911 centre had received over 100 calls "within a matter of minutes." The bug can reportedly also be used to flood iPhones with pop-ups.
