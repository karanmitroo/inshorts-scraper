According to NASA, Jupiter's largest moon Ganymede has an underground ocean, which  holds more water than is found on Earth's surface. The discovery broadens the hunt for places in the solar system where life might be able to exist, NASA said. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and is even bigger than the planet Mercury.
