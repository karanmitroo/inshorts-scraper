US-based e-bicycle startup Karmic Bikes has launched their newest model, a 'pedelec' (pedal-electric bicycle) designed for women. The bicycle features 11 speed components, hydraulic disc brakes, and is powered by 500 Wh battery, giving riders 80 km range in 'normal' mode, and even more in 'eco' mode. The company is offering the Kyoto at $1799 via a Kickstarter campaign.
