Researchers have created a television remote control that lets dogs switch between different channels. It has extra-large controls, a multi-coloured design for better visibility, and thick plastic so that the dogs cannot chew through the wires. Currently being tested by 20 dogs and their owners, researchers plan to launch the remote in the market at $66 next year.
