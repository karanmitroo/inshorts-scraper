The first images of 'Google Glass: Enterprise Edition', which is the second generation of Google's eye wearable, have been revealed. Designed for the workplace, the wearable has a hinge that allows it to fold like standard glasses. Further, the device will reportedly be waterproof and will support a 5GHz Wi-Fi band for video-streaming. Notably, foldability was Google Glass' most-requested feature.
