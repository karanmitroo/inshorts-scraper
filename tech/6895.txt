The official website of Goa Institute of Management was hacked on Sunday by hackers who identified themselves as 'Pak cyber attackers'. The homepage displayed Pakistan's national flag and read, "Pakistan Zindabad Happy August 14, 2016 - Team Pak Cyber Attackers - Stop Killing of Muslims in Kashmir and in India." However, the hacked website was later restored.
