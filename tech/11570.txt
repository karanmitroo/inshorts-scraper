A new study conducted by New York-based research firm L2 claims that an increasing number of popular brands are posting more on Instagram than on Facebook. Top brands' Instagram posts generate a per-follower engagement rate 58 times higher than their Facebook posts, the study reveals. Facebook bought Instagram in April, 2012 for a billion dollars.
