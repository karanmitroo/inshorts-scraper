Facebook has rebranded and relaunched its 'Events' app in the United States as Facebook Local, which is available on both Android and iOS operating systems. Facebook Local will allow users to locate nearby restaurants and also show nearby events under Trending Events feed. The platform will not feature advertisements from businesses, Facebook Local's Product Manager Aditya Koolwal said.
