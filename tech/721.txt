Technology giant Apple launched its own clothing line in 1986 called 'The Apple Collection' which was later discontinued. The line featured sweatshirts, shirts, t-shirts, tracksuits, trucker hats and accessories including belts for men, women as well as kids. Notably, the move came a year after Steve Jobs was fired by the then Apple CEO, John Sculley.
