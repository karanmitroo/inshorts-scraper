Flying car startup Kitty Hawk's CEO Sebastian Thrun in a recent interview said, "The air is so free of stuff and is so unused." He also said, "I envision a future where you hop in a thing, go in the air, and fly in a straight line." Thrun further added that flying cars may disrupt the self-driving car market.
