Two UK researchers are sending dozens of family photographs to be 'clicked' on the edge of space; they call it the "ultimate space selfie". The former PhD students, Alex Baker and Chris Rose, have been sending up "payloads" to the space via customised balloons. They now offer a Do-It-Yourself kit for customers to launch their own space-balloons for Rs 50,000.
