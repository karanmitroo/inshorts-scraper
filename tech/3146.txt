In an interview with The New York Times on Saturday, Twitter Co-founder Evan Williams said, "If it's true that Donald Trump wouldn't be President if it weren't for Twitter, then yeah, I'm sorry." He added, "It's a very bad thing, Twitter's role in that." In March, Trump had said that he wouldn't be the President if it wasn't for Twitter.
