The bumps on 'F' and 'J' keys on most keyboards help to ensure an optimal placement of hands on the keyboard. Placing the left index finger on F key and the other on J key makes typing efficient by allowing access to all keys with minimal movement. The bumps help to identify the keys without looking down on the keyboard.
