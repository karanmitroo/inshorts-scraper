NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been exploring Mars since August 2012, has snapped its first view of Earth - with the Moon shining nearby - from the surface of the red planet. "A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright 'evening stars'," said NASA officials.
