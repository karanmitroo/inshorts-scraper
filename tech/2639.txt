US-based researchers claim to have developed world's first battery-free mobile phone that harvests power from nearby radio signals or light. It encodes the signals using sound vibrations from microphone and speaker, thus eliminating a power-hungry step of converting signals into data, currently used by modern-day phones. The prototype successfully made calls powered by a base station 31 feet away.
