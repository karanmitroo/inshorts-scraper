A town of Ohio state in the US has been ordered to pay back â‚¹20 crore collected in automated traffic camera fines from motorists driving faster than 80 kmph. The court called the collection of the fines 'unconstitutional' because it denied the accused drivers due process. The town had fined nearly 45,000 people in 15 months.
