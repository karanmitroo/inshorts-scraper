Apple is reportedly tipped to release two new iPhone models, '5S' and 'Lite' in the first week of September.  The iPhone 5s  will feature a dual 12MP camera and may also have a fingerprint sensor. The iPhone Lite, a cheaper iPhone expected to enter the developing mobile markets, will come in multiple colours and may not have the retina display.
