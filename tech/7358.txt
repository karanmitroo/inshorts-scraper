US-based startup Arable has developed Pulsepod, a solar powered crop and weather sensor to reduce agricultural risks. The device measures rainfall, crop water demand, light and heat levels, and even the colour of berries to determine harvest-readiness of the crops. Farmers are reportedly already using Arableâ€™s hardware and cloud-based software to calculate harvest timing and potential yield.
