German watchmaker Sinn has launched a 'Dual Strap System' that holds an Apple Watch and a Sinn-brand analog watch on opposite ends to let users wear both at the same time. The system uses two shortened strap halves to fasten the watches together. The band is priced at $120 when purchased with a Sinn watch, and $210 when sold separately.
