German multinational automotive giant Daimler AG, which owns Mercedes-Benz, on Friday trialled a self-driving truck under real traffic conditions for the first time. The truck, a standard Mercedes-Benz Actros fitted with an intelligent ‘Highway Pilot’ system, covered 14 kilometres on a German motorway with a driver sitting in the cabin but having his hands off the steering wheel.
