Following a long wait, WhatsApp is finally available on desktop, but only for Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry users. WhatsApp founder Jan Koum said that due to “Apple platform limitations”, there’s no iOS version on the way for now. To avail the new service, users have to use Chrome browser on their desktop.
