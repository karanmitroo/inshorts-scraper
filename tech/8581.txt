Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday flagged off India's first indigenously built composites sonar dome, a ship's underwater eyes and ears. It has been designed and produced by a DRDO lab in Pune and manufactured by Goa-based Kineco. The sonar dome is fitted over the sonar array so that its electronics and sensors are not exposed to surrounding hostile environment.
