Irish startup Be.Energy has developed a spherical power bank called 'HandEnergy' that generates electricity when the user rotates it with the wrist. The mechanical power is turned into an electric current, charging the built-in batteries. It takes 40-60 minutes of spinning to charge the HandEnergy, which can in turn charge smartphones, flashlights, and cameras among other electronics.
