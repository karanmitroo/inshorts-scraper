UK-based alcoholic beverage company Diageo has released a 360-degree video simulating a possible fatal outcome of drunk driving. The video follows three cars: a career woman, a pair of new parents, and three friends on their way to a party. Each of their experiences ends abruptly, owing to a poor decision by one of them.
