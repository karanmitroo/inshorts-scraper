Israel-based genealogy service MyHeritage has introduced a gene kit that it claims is capable of identifying the ethnic and geographic history of one's family. The online platform's $79 'MyHeritage DNA' kit offers test results in 3-4 weeks and even shows DNA matches with distant relatives. MyHeritage is giving 5,000 free testing kits to existing members to jumpstart its DNA library.
