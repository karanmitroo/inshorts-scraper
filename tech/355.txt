SpaceX has confirmed it'll try landing all three boosters of its most powerful rocket Falcon Heavy, after its launch on February 6. Two side boosters are expected to land on the ground while the central booster would land on a drone ship off the coast. SpaceX has warned that surrounding people may experience multiple sonic booms due to the landing.
