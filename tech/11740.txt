According to the ministry of defense, state-run Hindustan Aeronautics has won a $177 million (Rs 1090 crore) deal to supply the Indian Air Force with 14 new turboprop Do-228 aircraft. This is a move by the Modi government to modernise armed forces by replacing ageing equipment with home-made hardware built by local and foreign companies.
