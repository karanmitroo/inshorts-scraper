Netherlands-based firm Mars One, which aims to establish a permanent human settlement on the Red Planet by 2026, has unveiled its first concept of a space suit for humans. The pressurised suit will include a see-through bubble and an impact-resistant helmet to protect Mars explorers "under the most difficult conditions" and will be equipped for warding off life-threatening radiation.
