Infosys Co-founder and newly appointed non-executive board Chairman Nandan Nilekani on Friday said "Mr Murthy is the father of corporate governance in India". His statement comes after Infosys' board in a six-page note blamed Co-founder Narayana Murthy for ex-CEO Vishal Sikka's decision to quit. Nilekani added, "I will ensure Murthy has healthy relationship with the company."
