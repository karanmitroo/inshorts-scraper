Google on Wednesday launched a feature for Maps app to let users share their real-time location. The 'Share location' feature is similar to 'Google Latitude' which was introduced as part of Google Maps in 2009 and discontinued in 2013. Privacy International, a European watchdog group, had slammed Latitude for the privacy risk involved in allowing whereabouts to be tracked.
