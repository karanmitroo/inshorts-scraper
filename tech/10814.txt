Taking a cue from LinkedIn, Facebook is reportedly in the process of testing a new feature called Profile Tags. With this, users will be able to add tags to their profile or let friends add tags for you, which will basically be highlighting things that describe you. This feature is currently only being tested in New Zealand.
