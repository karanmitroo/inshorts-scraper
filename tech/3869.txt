French luxury label Louis Vuitton has launched an iPhone 7 Plus case made of golden crocodile leather costing over ₹3 lakh, five times more than the phone itself. The case, called the Eye-Trunk, is designed to pay tribute to the fashion house's origins as a luggage designer. Cases for the smaller model iPhone 7 start from ₹78,000.
