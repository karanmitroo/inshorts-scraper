German carmaker BMW has developed an autonomous i3 electric car that riders can summon with their smartphones. The car's entertainment system allows users to control some vehicle functions like flashing the headlight, door locking and unlocking, and also the horn. Once the rider reaches the destination, the car heads off to find a parking spot for itself.
