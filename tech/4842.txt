Technology major IBM is developing a robot based on SoftBank's Pepper to assist the elderly and their caregivers. The robot will study ways of measuring heart and respiratory rate, answer basic health-related questions and determine if an individual has fallen by using an accelerometer. Using 'CameraVitals' technology, it can calculate vital signs by recording video of a person's face.
