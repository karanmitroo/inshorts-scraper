LG has built the world's largest OLED tunnel at an industry meet in Berlin to mark the 50th anniversary of the first TV it produced. The record-breaking structure, which is 5m tall, 7.4m wide and 15m long, is made up of 216 separate 55-inch curved OLED displays. The 450-million pixel display showcases Aurora Borealis, underwater ecosystems and deep space footage.
