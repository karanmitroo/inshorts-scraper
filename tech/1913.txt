Researchers at the Harvard Medical School have developed a keychain-sized device called the Integrated Exogenous Antigen Testing (iEAT) system which alerts users of allergens in food. The â‚¹2,500 device analyses the food sample on a slide containing electronic sensors and provides the result in 10 minutes. According to the researchers, iEAT detects even smaller amounts of allergens than lab tests.
