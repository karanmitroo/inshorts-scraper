A Shanghai court has frozen nearly ₹1,200 crore in assets owned by technology company LeEco's Co-founder Jia Yueting, his wife Gan Wei, and three subsidiaries. The order was carried out on behalf of the China Merchants Bank because LeEco missed interest payments. The company's financial woes surfaced after Yueting slashed his pay to ₹10 (15 cents) in November 2016.
