IIT-Madras has been accepted as a full member of a collaboration with Large Hadron Collider at CERN, as part of its Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which will start collecting data around March 2015. This collaboration will enable IIT-M students to work in the collider, do short summer projects at CMS and "get a taste of fundamental research".
