Huawei has unveiled its Honor Magic smartphone with a 'FaceCode' feature that shows notifications on locked screens only if it recognises who is holding the phone. The 4 GB RAM phone, which has a 12-megapixel dual lens primary camera, runs on a customised version of Android Marshmallow that learns users' daily habits to create app shortcuts at specific times.
