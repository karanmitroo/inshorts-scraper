Anti-virus provider Kaspersky Lab has discovered an Android spyware called Skygofree which can steal WhatsApp messages and record audio via microphone when an infected device is in a specified location. It can also connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. The spyware was discovered in October last year but its initial versions were created in 2014.
