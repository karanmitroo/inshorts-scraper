Google Maps is showing a giant Android bot peeing on an Apple logo at a spot near Pakistan's Rawalpindi city. The image is only visible in the map view and disappears when switched to Earth view (satellite view). Google claimed that the image was submitted by someone using Map Maker tool and they are working on getting it removed.
