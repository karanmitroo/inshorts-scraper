French aerospace giant Airbus recently shared its plan to build a flying taxi called 'Vahana', a single-seater autonomous aircraft that can take off and land vertically. The aircraft has eight rotors on two sets of wings. Airbus is aiming to fly a full-size prototype of the flying taxi before the end of 2017.
