In response to a user's tweet, Twitter Co-founder Biz Stone has said the US President Donald Trump is not in the group of people with whom Twitter is testing the 280-character limit. Twitter this week announced it's testing a 280-character limit for tweets, instead of 140. It's also the first time in 11 years that Twitter changed its character limit.
