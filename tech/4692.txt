The price of Bitcoin plunged as much as 22% on Thursday, with the digital currency losing more than $3 billion (over â‚¹20,000 crore) in market value in just 40 minutes at one point. The slide came after Bitcoin breached the $1,000-mark to hit a three-year high earlier this week. Notably, Bitcoin was 2016's top performing currency with a 125% climb.
