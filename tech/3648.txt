A US woman has been ordered by a judge to pay â‚¹3.2 crore for a Facebook post that falsely accused an acquaintance of killing her own son. The complainant said that social media makes it "easy" for people to defame others. "There are no filters to say whatever you think behind the safety of your screen," she said.
