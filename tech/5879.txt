Japanese electronics maker Panasonic has created a prototype of a television that looks like a glass panel. The prototype generates bright and clear images like normal televisions. Embedded into a glass sliding door, the television can be switched between two modes - 'transparent mode' to see the items behind glass, and 'screen mode' to watch the television.
