E-commerce company Amazon has contested a warrant by the US police to access recordings from a voice-controlled Echo speaker to solve a murder case. Amazon's legal team cited the "right to browse and purchase expressive materials anonymously, without fear of government discovery." The victim in the case was found strangled and drowned in the suspect's bathtub in 2015.
