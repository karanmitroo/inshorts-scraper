NASA's Cassini spacecraft has detected a "massive ice cloud system" at the South pole of Saturn's largest moon Titan in the lower-to-mid stratosphere. The cloud which was first detected in 2012 turned out to be bigger, peaking at an altitude of 200 km, Nasa said. Cassini reached Saturn in 2004 and the mission will continue till 2017.
