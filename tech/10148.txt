YouTube on Thursday announced it had integrated the Virtual Reality (VR) video format on its Android app. Video makers can now upload their videos directly on YouTube and the users can easily switch to the VR  mode and view them on Alphabet Inc’s “Cardboard” device. The company said the video experience will be similar to that in an IMAX theatre.
