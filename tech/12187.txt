One of the few remaining examples of Apple Inc's first computer, Apple-1, sold for $905,000 (approximately Rs. 5.53 crores) at an auction in New York on Wednesday, far outstripping expectations. The buyer was The Henry Ford organization, which plans to display the computer in its museum in Michigan. Previously, a working Apple-I was sold in 2012 for $374,500.
