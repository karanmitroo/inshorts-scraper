In its attempt to get back all the Galaxy Note 7 devices, tech giant Samsung has announced a software update that will stop the smartphone from charging altogether. The return rate of the device in the US increased from 85% to 93% after an update, designed to "limit the phone's ability to charge beyond 60 percent," was released last month.
