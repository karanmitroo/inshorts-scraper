Russia has passed a new cyberspace law that requires internet service providers to store Russian internet traffic for 6 months, which will reportedly cost companies around $39 billion. The law also requires services like WhatsApp to turn over their encryption keys to the government. The Russian government claimed that this is aimed at protecting the nation from terrorism.
