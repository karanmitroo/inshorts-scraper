Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have revealed that smartphones and laptops are vulnerable to hacking even when the internet is off. Hackers do this by analysing the low-power electronic signals the devices emit even when disconnected from the Internet. Researchers are investigating where these information "leaks" originate so they can help develop strategies to plug them.
