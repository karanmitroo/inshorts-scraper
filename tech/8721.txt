A new web service called BlankStamp allows users to send incognito e-mails via regular e-mail accounts. If one wants to send an e-mail toÂ 'steve@apple.com', one has to merely replace the address with 'steve_at007_apple.com@blankstamp.io' to make it incognito. BlankStamp is currently limiting the number of emails sent to five per week. Notably, users cannot add files to these e-mails yet.
