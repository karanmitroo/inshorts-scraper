US-based startup Garadget recently blocked a customer from using its internet-connected device to open his garage after he left negative reviews online. Replying to the review, Garadget Founder Denis Grisak said, "The abusive language... demonstrates your poor impulse control... I'm not going to tolerate any tantrums." However, Garadget unblocked the device after being slammed by other users.
