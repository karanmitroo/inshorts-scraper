In a patent dispute between Microsoft and wireless technology developer InterDigital, the US International Trade Commission on Friday decided against blocking the import of Microsoftâ€™s mobile devices. Microsoft had allegedly infringed two wireless patents of the company, for which an import ban was recommended in April. Microsoft has reportedly captured just 3% of the smartphone market currently.
