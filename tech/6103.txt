Game streaming site Twitch, owned by Amazon Game Studios, will start offering its own virtual currency called 'Stream+'. The service will be a loyalty points system where users perform tasks to earn points that can be used to purchase in-game services. Amazon's upcoming multiplayer battle mobile game 'Breakaway' will be the first to use the virtual currency.
