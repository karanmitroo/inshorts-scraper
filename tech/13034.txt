Physicists at the Center for Free Electron Laser Science in Hamburg have shown, at least in theory, that it is possible to boil water (to 600 degrees Celsius) in just half pico-second (one trillionth of a second). The water could be boiled such fast using terahertz radiation. However, terahertz radiation generation technology is still in a stage of infancy.
