Michal Kosinski, the Stanford professor who developed a photo-based AI that could guess people's sexual orientation, has said a face-reading AI would be able to identify people's political views and IQ. It could also know about someone's personality traits and criminal behaviour. Kosinski warned about the erosion of privacy in future where AI could be used to target vulnerable people.
