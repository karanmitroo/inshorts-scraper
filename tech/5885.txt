NASA scientists are researching on the prospects of using virtual and augmented reality experiences to help astronauts fight the "sensory and social monotony" of a Mars mission. Scientists hope to create a library comprising of inspirational messages, which would remind the astronauts of their mission on the Red Planet and help them feel connected with their families on Earth.
