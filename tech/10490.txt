A Spanish cancer patient has successfully received a 3D printed titanium sternum and rib cage (designed in Australia) implant. The 54-year-old patient was suffering from a chest wall sarcoma (a cancerous tumor that can form in bones, soft tissues, and cartilage). The patient's surgical team said that this part was tricky to recreate with prosthetics, due to the complex geometry.
