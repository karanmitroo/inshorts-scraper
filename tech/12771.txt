The microblogging service, Twitter, Thursday announced a new policy that prohibits sexually explicit content from being posted on its video-sharing app, Vine. However, depictions of nudity or partial nudity posted for documentary, educational, or artistic purposes will still be allowed. Concern over sexually explicit content on the service intensified after a pornographic video briefly made Vine's "Editor's Pick" list.
