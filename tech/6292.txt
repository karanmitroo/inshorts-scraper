The man accused of bombing NYC and New Jersey over the weekend, Ahmad Rahami, purchased components for the explosives from online seller eBay, according to federal prosecutors. Rahami used eBay to purchase electric igniters, ball bearings and citric acid, a chemical used in explosives. In response, eBay said that the items "are legal to buy and sell in the US".
