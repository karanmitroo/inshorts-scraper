Facebook has launched an update to its Safety Check that will let users offer food, transportation, and shelter to disaster victims in India, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia. The feature, called 'Community Help', will initially be available for natural and accidental incidents. The new feature lets victims search and connect with help providers over Facebook Messenger.
