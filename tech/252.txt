Facebook has announced a $10 million Community Leadership Program to award users for building 'interactive' groups on the platform. About $1 million each will be awarded to five community leaders and $50,000 each to 100 more, for specific community initiatives. It comes after Facebook faced criticism for allowing groups to use the platform to propagate hate speech and harmful content.
