US-based Gawker Media, which is fighting a legal battle against wrestler Hulk Hogan, filed for bankruptcy on Friday. Hogan, backed by PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel, sued Gawker after it published a clip of his sex tape and a blog post analysing it. A jury ordered Gawker to pay $140 million in damages to Hogan, which the company is currently appealing.
