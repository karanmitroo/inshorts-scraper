Social media platform Instagram has rolled out an update that notifies users when someone screenshots a 'disappearing' image or video sent through a direct message. Instagram recently introduced the Snapchat-like disappearing photos feature in private messages that automatically deletes the image once it has been viewed. It also recently launched temporary stories that disappear after 24 hours.
