Nike-backed robotics startup Grabit has developed robots that can make shoes 20 times faster than humans. The robots use static electricity and assemble every single part of a shoe with relative ease. Founded in 2013, the startup raised $25 million earlier this year from investors including electronics maker Flex, garments manufacturer Esquel and Samsung.
