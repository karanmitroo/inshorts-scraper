Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US have developed a 10-minute test for Ebola using a paper strip that changes colour when it comes in contact with Ebola-infected blood. This will help in immediately quarantining those individuals who test positive for the disease. Moreover, the test can also diagnose yellow and dengue fevers.
