Gaming equipment maker Razer's CEO Min-Liang Tan has said two of the company's gadget prototypes were stolen from its booth at the world's largest consumer electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas. "We play hard and we play fair. It's cheating, and cheating doesnâ€™t sit well with us," said Tan. Razer unveiled the world's first laptop with three screens at CES.
