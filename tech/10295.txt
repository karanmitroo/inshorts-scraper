Facebook is testing a feature called Reactions that provides users with six alternatives to the Like button. One can express emotions like “Love," "Haha," "Yay," "Wow," "Sad" and “Angry” by hovering over or long-pressing the Like button. The feature is the company’s response to the widely-requested Dislike button and has currently been rolled out in Ireland and Spain.
