Under new nudity policy announced on Friday, Google is planning to censor unauthorized nude photos from its Internet search engine. The policy aims at cracking down on a practice known as "Revenge porn", which is a phenomenon that entails the distribution of sexually-explicit images without a personâ€™s consent. A form for submitting the censorship requests will be made available soon.
