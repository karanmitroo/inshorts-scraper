The Delhi Integrated Multi-Model Transit System (DIMTS) has sanctioned the development of the smartphone application - PoochO - which lets users find GPS-fitted autos passing nearby. Launched by Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung, the app allows people to access the DIMTS database of registered driversâ€™ mobile numbers and then call them up to book a ride.
