Former Central Intelligence Agency employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden on Wednesday warned against using Google Allo, the technology giant's smart messaging app over privacy concerns. He tweeted, "Free for download today: Google Mail...and Google Surveillance. That's Allo. Don't use Allo." Snowden noted that Allo "records every message you ever send and makes it available to police".
