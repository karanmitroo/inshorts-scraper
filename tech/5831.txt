Google's AI platform 'DeepMind' has become capable of teaching itself based on information it already possesses, without additional human input, Deepmind researchers claimed. It has a new hybrid system, Differential Neural Computer, which combines a neural network with existing data storage capacity of conventional computers. Over time, the AI will use its acquired data to get more efficient.
