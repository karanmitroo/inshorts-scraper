Speaking about the development in the low-cost Aakash tablet Project, telecom minister Kapil Sibal said - "Aakash was my dream but it was not fulfilled, I tried hard... some departments of my government did not support me... despite that I continued to strive and then I brought the project in my ministry and now specifications for Aakash-4 have been completed."
