Computer memory marketplace Filecoin on Friday suspended its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) after raising â‚¹1,200 crore in one hour as the platform on which it was conducting the ICO crashed. It claimed the platform crashed due to "massive load in terms of pageviews, users watching live, and transaction volume." Last week, Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz invested in the startup.
