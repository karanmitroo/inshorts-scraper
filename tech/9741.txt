Fujitsu on Thursday announced that it is spinning off its PC and mobile divisions into two new companies, namely Fujitsu Client Computing and Fujitsu Connected Technologies, respectively. The move is aimed at achieving differentiation and competing with "emerging global vendors". Fujitsu, that will reportedly continue to own both companies, is expected to complete the spin-offs by February 1.
