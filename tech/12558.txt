ISRO is planning to launch its next rocket PSLV C23 carrying a French remote sensing satellite SPOT 7, along with four others from Sriharikota spaceport on Jun-26, a senior official said Friday. However, the date and time of launch is not fixed as it also depends on the availability of VIPs, if any, witnessing the launch, the official added.
