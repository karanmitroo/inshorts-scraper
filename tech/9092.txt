The Wikimedia Foundation, the organization behind Wikipedia, has received a grant of $250,000 by the Knight Foundation to develop an open-source search engine called the ‘Knowledge Engine’. Wikimedia said, “We are not building Google… vision is to make the sum of all human knowledge freely available to everyone”. The open data engine will reportedly be free of commercial interests.
