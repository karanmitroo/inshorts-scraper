Australia-based researchers have teamed up with IBM to develop an implantable computer chip capable of monitoring a patient's brain activity. Researchers hope to predict epileptic seizures in patients using this technology. A recent test run, where the chip was tasked with analyzing brain waves to guess with which hand did the patient squeeze a ball, tallied a 76% accuracy rating.
