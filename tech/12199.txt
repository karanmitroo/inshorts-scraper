Facebook Thursday launched an application called 'Rooms' that lets people create virtual "rooms" to chat about whatever they wish using any name they would like. Entirely separate from Facebook, the app doesn't require any revealing details like name and location. According to Facebook, chat rooms are invite-only and require a special code that can be scanned with your phoneâ€™s camera.
