Microsoft on Monday launched a new feature for its video-calling service Skype, that allows desktop users to make and receive calls without signing up or making an account. A 'Start a Conversation' option on Skype's website generates a link that allows users to make calls and share pictures. Conversations last for 24 hours, after which they get deleted automatically.
