Searching for Trump Tower, the New York home of US President-elect Donald Trump, on Google Maps temporarily showed results marked as 'Dump Tower' on Saturday. While it is not known who made the change, Google guidelines say that edits to the map database are reviewed by Google employees manually. The label was reverted to Trump Tower a few hours later.
