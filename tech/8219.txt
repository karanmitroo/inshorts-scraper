Apple’s marketing chief Philip Schiller on Friday took to Twitter to explain how one should correctly refer to multiple Apple devices. He said, “One need never pluralise Apple product names. It would be proper to say "I have 3 Macintosh" or "I have 3 Macintosh computers"." This came after Benedict Evans referred to two iPad Pro tablets as “iPads Pro”.
