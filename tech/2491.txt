Chipmaker Qualcomm on Wednesday reported a 40% slump in Q3 2017 profit amid an ongoing patent battle with Apple. The company said its results took a hit as Apple's contract manufacturers didn't pay royalties due on sales of Apple products. The two companies have filed a series of lawsuits against each other over use of Qualcomm's chips in Apple products.
