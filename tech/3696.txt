Three Microsoft users in the US have filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that its Windows 10 update damaged their computers and caused them to lose data. Calling Windows 10 a "defective product", the lawsuit claims that the operating system installed itself onto one of the complainant's computer without consent. Another complainant says Windows 10 left his computer non-functional.
