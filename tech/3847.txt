At least 25 verified Twitter accounts were hacked on Wednesday to tweet out swastika symbols and post hashtags in Turkish reading 'NaziGermany' and 'NaziHolland'. The hacked accounts include Forbes magazine, BBC North America, Reuters Japan and Justin Bieber Japan. The hackers posted content in support of an upcoming referendum which will possibly give Turkish President Recep Erdogan more power.
