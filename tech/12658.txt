Samsung on Monday said that the number of its flagship Galaxy S5 smartphones shipped with non-working cameras was "very limited". It also announced that measures have been taken to ensure the issue does not recur in new shipments. The problem in the flagship smartphone, which was launched less than a month ago, had surfaced last week.
