Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has accused Apple of engaging in "data colonisation" and being "anti-consumer" by not allowing its Do-Not-Disturb app to appear on the App Store. TRAI had launched the DND app in 2016 to block unsolicited calls and messages. Apple has reportedly taken more than a year to reconsider requests to approve the app.
