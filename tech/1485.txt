Chipmaker Qualcomm has filed a lawsuit against Apple in China requesting a ban on the production and sale of iPhones in the country. The lawsuit claims that Apple is in violation of three patents covering power management and iPhone's Force Touch feature. Qualcomm filed a similar claim against Apple in the US for patent infringement, earlier in July.
