A Los Angeles-based startup has developed 'Lumenus', a $250 smart apparel that gives users directions through LEDs on entering their destination on a dedicated app. The apparel also integrates washable colour-changing LEDs which provides safety to the cyclists by increasing their visibility to other riders on the road. The LEDs claim to last up to 24 hours in single charge.
