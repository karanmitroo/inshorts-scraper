In a move to endorse green fuel, Indian Railways has started its first train that runs on the dual fuel system - diesel and CNG - on the Rewari-Rohtak section of northern zone. The introduction of CNG trains will cut the transporter's fuel bill by reducing consumption of diesel, an official said, adding that more such trains are being planned.
