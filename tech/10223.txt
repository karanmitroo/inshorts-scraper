Apple has released iOS 9.1, the first major update to iOS 9 which it launched in September. The update supports more than 150 emojis including a unicorn and a middle finger. It also has a ‘Live Photos’ feature which recognises when the phone is raised or lowered while clicking pictures to focus on subjects better.
