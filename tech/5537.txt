Electric-skateboards maker Boosted has warned its users to stop riding and charging its second-generation devices while the company investigates an issue with its batteries. The batteries were reported to have 'vented' in two separate instances, showing signs of smoke and unusually high heat. Users who have pre-ordered the Boosted Board 2 have also been alerted that the shipments are halted.
