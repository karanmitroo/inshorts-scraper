Facebook Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has shared a set of pictures of his visit to a US family's farm, where he drove a 70-year-old tractor. "Today was a bunch of firsts for me: first time feeding a calf and first time trying unpasteurized milk straight from a cow," wrote Zuckerberg in his Instagram post.
