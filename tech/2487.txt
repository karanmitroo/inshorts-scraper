Co-founder of cryptocurrency platform Ethereum Gavin Wood's digital currency wallet startup Parity on Tuesday lost Ether worth ₹206 crore in a breach. Hackers used a vulnerability in Parity's wallets which required more than one 'signature' to operate. However, a white hat hacker group saved Ether worth ₹483 crore that remained in vulnerable wallets and moved the currency to secure wallets.
