Google-owned video sharing platform YouTube on Friday shut down two North Korean propaganda channels for violating YouTube's community guidelines. According to reports, the channels were shut down because North Korea could have made money from the videos through YouTube's built-in advertising system. The two channels Stimmekoreas and Uriminzokkiri together had more than 38,000 subscribers.
