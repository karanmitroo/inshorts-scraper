Japan-based Funai Electric, the last-known videocassette recorders (VCR) manufacturer, recently announced that it will cease VCR production in July, Nikkei Asian Review reported. The company once peaked at 15 million units annually, but sold only 750,000 last year. VCRs were first introduced in 1950s and became widely popular in 1970s when tech giants like Sony and Philips entered the domain.
