Electronics company LG has been sued by four G4 and V10 smartphone owners over a boot loop issue that rendered the devices non-functional. The lawsuit alleges that the company "was aware, or reasonably should have been aware" of the hardware flaw that caused the two smartphone models to reboot continuously and in effect brick the devices.
