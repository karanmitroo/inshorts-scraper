Facebook has blamed a technical glitch after several Catholicism-focused pages were shut down for a day this week. The personal accounts of administrators of some Catholic pages were also suspended over "suspicious activities". Apologising for the disruption, a Facebook spokesperson said that the incident "was triggered accidentally by a spam detection tool".
