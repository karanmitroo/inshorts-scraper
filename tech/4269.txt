Online collaborative encyclopaedia Wikipedia's editors have voted to ban the Daily Mail as a source after deeming it to be "generally unreliable". The editors said the ban is based on "the Daily Mail's reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication." Existing links to the Daily Mail will be removed and replaced with links to more "reputable" sources.
