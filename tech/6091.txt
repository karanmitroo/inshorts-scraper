Solar road tiles were put on a public test for the first time by US-based renewable energy startup Solar Roadways on Sunday. Fitted with multi-coloured lights, the 30 tiles generate enough power for the fountain and restrooms in a public square. The startup is also live streaming the tiles on its website.
