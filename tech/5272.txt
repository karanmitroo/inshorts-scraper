Facebook is currently testing a new feature with select users on its app that helps them to find Wi-Fi hotspots near their location. The option is available under the hamburger menu, which includes Pages, Nearby Friends, Nearby Places and other options. Previously, Facebook had asked business Pages to list Wi-Fi locations at their physical addresses.
