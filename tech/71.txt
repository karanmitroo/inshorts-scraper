In order to provide access to information on commonly-searched symptoms, Google has rolled out a new feature called 'Symptom Search' in India. For example, if a user searches for symptoms like 'cough and pain', the Search app will show a list of related conditions. For individual symptoms like 'headache', it will show users an overview description along with self-treatment options.
