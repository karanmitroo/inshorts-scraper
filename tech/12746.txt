Members of the European Parliament voted unanimously for the changing of the laws calling for a single charger to be developed for all mobile phones sold in the EU to reduce waste, costs and hassle for users. Member states will have two years to transpose the rules into their national laws and manufacturers will have an additional year to comply.
