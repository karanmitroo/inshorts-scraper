SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket crash landed on a floating drone ship in the sea on Saturday. It was returning after successfully launching the SES-9 telecommunications satellite into space. CEO Elon Musk said, “Rocket landed hard on the drone ship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry).” This was SpaceX's fourth attempt to re-land the Falcon 9 at sea.
