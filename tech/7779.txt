US President Barack Obama recently appeared on 'The Tonight Show', where he said his new phone cannot text, take pictures, play music or even make calls due to security reasons. Obama added, "It's like...one of those play phones three year olds have." He recently got an upgrade from his old BlackBerry phone but didn't reveal the phone he currently uses.
