Social media giant Facebook on Friday faced criticism for posting videos of migrants being tortured by traffickers and slave traders for ransom. UN migration agency criticised Facebook for letting smugglers use its site to "entice vulnerable people on the move and then exploit them and their families." According to reports, footage showing tortured migrants had remained on Facebook for months.
