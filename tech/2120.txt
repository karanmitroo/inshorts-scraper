Microsoft this week edited a wallpaper on its Bing homepage after it was noticed that there was a penis shape carved out in sand. The wallpaper on Bing search engine's homepage, which changes everyday, was of a beach on Brač Island in Croatia. Microsoft edited out the sand drawing from the wallpaper nearly fours hours after users noticed it.
