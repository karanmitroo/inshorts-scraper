Israel-based woman Dafna Ariely has developed a â‚¹2,600 device called 'Look' which allows users to track their glasses using an app. The rectangular wireless device can be attached to either side of the glasses and activates after connecting to the app. It uses Bluetooth technology to send signals directly to the app for locating the glasses.
