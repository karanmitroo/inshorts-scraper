A Chinese startup has developed a $7 home guarding smart robot 'AiJia Pro', that is capable of real-time 360Â° monitoring of home. The app-controlled 26-inch robot that walks and rotates head, comes with colourful facial expressions, voice recognition, camera, telemonitoring and infrared sensors. On detecting unusual activity at home, the robot raises an alarm and sends alert to the owner.
