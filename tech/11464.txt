Dutch startup, Nerdalise, has teamed with energy providers Eneco to launch its new e-radiator prototype. This is a computer server that crunches numbers for Belgian firms and uses the heat released from these computer systems to provide home heating. The founders got the idea when the home thermostat broke and they crowded around a laptop to keep themselves warm.
