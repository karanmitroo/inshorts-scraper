A New York-based man has sued gay dating app Grindr after a former partner created fake accounts in his name, sending over 1,100 strangers to visit him for sex. The lawsuit, which was originally filed earlier this year, has now been amended to accuse Grindr of fraud and deceptive business practices after it failed to take down the fake accounts.
