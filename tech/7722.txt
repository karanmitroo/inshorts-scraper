SpaceX founder Elon Musk has posted a video of the Falcon 9 rocket booster's failed sea-landing attempt on a drone ship on Thursday. The attempt was SpaceX's first unsuccessful landing after three consecutive successfulâ€‹ attempts. Musk claims that a possible early liquid oxygen depletion may have caused the engine shutdown just before landing.
