NASA on Monday made 56 of its formerly-patented technologies including advanced manufacturing processes, sensors, propulsion methods, rocket nozzles, aircraft wing designs and improved rocket safety, freely available for commercial use. It also released a searchable database of its expired patents. NASA said it is encouraging entrepreneurs to explore new ways to commercialise these technologies.
