South Korean startup Innomdle Lab has created 'Sgnl', a watchband that lets users make phone calls by touching their fingers to their ear. The strap, which has a built-in mic, connects to phones via Bluetooth and directs audio into the user's ear through vibrations. Priced at about $139, the strap can be attached to any watch including the Apple Watch.
