China is reportedly planning to make a prototype of the world's first exascale computer or 'super-supercomputer' by the end of 2017. An exascale machine is one that is capable of making a billion billion, or a quintillion, calculations per second. China's Sunway TaihuLight, which is currently the world's fastest supercomputer, can make 93 thousand trillion calculations per second or 'petaflops'.
