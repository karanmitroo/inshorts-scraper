Self-driving robots made by UK-based startup Starship Technologies will start delivering orders of European food giant Just Eat in London in the next few months. Starship was founded by two Skype Co-founders. The six-wheeled robots come with theft-prevention and nearest inch tracking features. To receive their meals, people will need to provide a secure access code to the robots.
