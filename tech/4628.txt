A US court has revived a lawsuit against Apple for monopolising the iPhone app market. Originally filed in 2011, the complaint alleges that by not allowing users to purchase apps outside the App Store, Apple was able to increase the prices. Apple argued that users purchased apps directly from developers on the App Store and not Apple.
