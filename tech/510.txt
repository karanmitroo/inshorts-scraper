NASA has successfully applied a new technology that allows aircraft to fold their wings between zero and 70 degrees while inflight. Built from a shape memory alloy, the system operates without a hydraulic system, reducing the wing weight by up to 80%. The technology's potential aerodynamic benefit includes increased controllability, which may result in a more fuel-efficient aircraft, said NASA.
