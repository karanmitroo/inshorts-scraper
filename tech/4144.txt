An Apple Store in England recently revived a man's 30-year-old Mac SE prototype. The computer, which shipped in 1987, is one of five prototypes made by Apple in California for development purposes. As many as five technicians worked to fix the system, which was booted with OS 3.3 from old floppy disks. However, the computer's mouse could not be repaired.
