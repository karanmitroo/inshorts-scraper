Within 1-month of its launch, some of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge owners are complaining that they were facing some issues with the screen auto-rotation feature of the smartphone. On several online forums, complainants claimed the device refuses to respond while switching it from portrait to landscape and vice versa. Furthermore, reboot and factory resets also didn't help, they added.
