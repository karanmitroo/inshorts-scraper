US Air Force developed a supercomputer in 2010 with a core made of 1,760 Sony PlayStation 3 consoles and was the fastest interactive computer in the US Defense Department at that time. The supercomputer was capable of analyzing ultra-high-resolution images at billions of pixels per minute. The project cost $2 million, about 5-10% cost of a similar conventional system.
