Apple claims to have sold more than 13 million devices of iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in the first weekend of their launch last Friday. It beat its own first-weekend performance record of selling more than 10 million iPhone units last year. This time, Apple had allowed two weeks of pre-sales and included China among its initial launch markets.
