The Bombay High Court has directed the state to submit old and current Google Maps images of wetlands and mangroves to assess the extent of the damage. The court was hearing public litigations against real estate projects, which are allegedly encroaching upon the wetlands around the city. Notably, Google Maps' satellite data is typically said to be 1-3 years old.
