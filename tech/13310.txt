The new version of the Nexus 7 tablet, powered by Android 4.3, was launched by Google and Asus on Wednesday. Sporting a Full HD resolution (1920X1200 pixels) along with a 7 inch screen, the new tablet is better than its predecessor in many aspects. The basic model will cost $ 229 in the US but is still not available in India.
