Microsoft took its new chatbot Tay offline within 24 hours of its launch after it started tweeting offensive and racist statements. Notably, the artificial intelligence-powered robot learns natural conversation from its interactions with humans. Microsoft said it was "aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay’s commenting skills" and that it was “making adjustments” to the chatbot.
