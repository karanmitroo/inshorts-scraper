Photo editing app FaceApp on Wednesday removed its 'ethnicity change filters' within a day of launch after being slammed by social media users for being 'racist'.  The feature let users alter their race in the pictures through its 'Asian', 'Black', 'Indian', and 'Caucasian' filters. However, FaceApp's CEO claimed the filters "don't have any positive or negative connotations associated with them."
