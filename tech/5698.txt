Researchers at China's Northeastern University have proposed an algorithm to construct an energy grid that distributes power similar to data flow on the internet. The proposed 'energy internet' would use a main power grid combined with decentralised generators, including fuel, wind turbines and solar power, to distribute energy to multiple microgrids within each designated network.
