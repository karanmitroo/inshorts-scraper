Seven women from the Spanish island of Majorca have complained against men who allegedly used a drone to 'spy' on them while they were sunbathing nude. The men were reportedly operating the drone from a luxury yacht. Authorities said theyâ€™ve passed the decision to charge the men with a crime to the courts as this type of voyeurism is 'new'.
