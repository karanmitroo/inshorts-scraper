Germany-based Peter Buczkowski has developed an AI-enabled device that forces a user with electrical impulses to take a picture. Called 'Prosthetic Photographer', it distinguishes between high and low quality photos and analyses the images in front of it. When satisfied with image, it sends out an electric shock, forcing the user to unwillingly press a button to click the picture.
