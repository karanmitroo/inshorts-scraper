In its first flowering crop experiment at the International Space Station, NASA on Monday activated a Veggie growth plant system that contains Zinnia flower. Flowers expected to bloom by the New year will help NASA gather preliminary information on other flowering plants that can be grown in space. For 2017, NASA plans to grow tomato plants in space.
