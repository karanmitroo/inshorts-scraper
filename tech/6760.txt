The Visa-enabled 'NFC Ring', which was tested out by select athletes during Rio Olympics, is available for pre-order at $53. The water-resistant ring is made from ceramic and allows users to unlock their phones, share data and make payments through gestures. The ring replaces users' account numbers with a unique digital identifier to process payments without exposing actual account details.
