A bunch of London scientists have developed a touch-sensitive body sticker that can be worn anywhere on the body and be used to control devices like smartphones and music players. Different actions like answering a call or adjusting the volume of the music player can be executed by applying pressure on different stickers. A keyboard sticker can type text messages.
