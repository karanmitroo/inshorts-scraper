Bangladesh's central bank said it will not sue Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Fed) and SWIFT money transfer network, over $81 million stolen by cyber-criminals in February. This comes after reports suggested the Bangladeshi bank will seek compensation from them over the errors. The Fed had mistakenly accepted payment requests from hackers releasing the Bangladeshi bank's money.
