South Korean electronics major Samsung did not properly diagnose the Galaxy Note 7's exploding battery issue and rushed to provide handset replacements, according to Wall Street Journal. Before issuing replacements, Samsung executives didnâ€™t have a final answer on what caused the phones to explode. Samsung's lab scans reportedly showed a bulge in the battery of faulty devices.
