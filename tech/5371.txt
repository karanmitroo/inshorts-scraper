Internet search giant Google has announced that its advertising tools will soon be closed to websites that promote fake news. The policy is aimed at cutting off revenues for publications that promote hoaxes on platforms like Facebook. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that are a part of its AdSense advertising network.
