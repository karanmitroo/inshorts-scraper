According to a study by US-based researchers, wearable devices can determine user's ATM pin numbers and passwords by using reverse-engineering motion sensor data. The study revealed that the wearables can guess passwords with about 80% accuracy on the first attempt. To solve this problem, the team suggested that developers should blur sensitive data by introducing some sort of "noise data".
