Indrajeet Bhuyan, a 17-year-old Indian, has discovered that financial details can be easily leaked from self-operated passbook printers, Swayam, that major Indian banks launched last year. Bhuyan claims to have hacked his father's account (with his consent) as the automated machine updates a passbook simply by reading its barcode, which can be spoofed in the absence of any other authentication.
