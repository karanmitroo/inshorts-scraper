'Hotel Wikipedia' has been co-opted as the theme song for the online crowd-sourced encyclopedia Wikipedia. The song, which was released as a single in 2004, is based on rock band Eagles' 1976 song 'Hotel California'. Notably, the encyclopedia was launched on January 15, 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.
