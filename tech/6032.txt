Facebook on Wednesday apologised to users after several reports pointed out that items like baby hedgehogs, snakes, drugs and even guns were listed for sale on the company's 'Marketplace' section. Launched on Monday, the Marketplace section allows users to list and search for items on sale in their area. Citing technical issues, Facebook said it's looking into the matter.
