Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer on Tuesday defended ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick following allegations that he encouraged a 'toxic' work culture at the ride-hailing startup. "I just don't think he knew... When your company scales that quickly, it's hard," she was quoted as saying. Mayer added, "I think he's a phenomenal leader, Uber is ridiculously interesting."
