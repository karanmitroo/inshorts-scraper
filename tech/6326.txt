The Los Angeles police successfully used a remote-controlled bomb squad robot to disarm a gunman suspected of attempted murder, assault, and robbery. The standoff between the suspect and the police, which lasted for over six hours, ended without a single shot fired. "We didn't have to risk a deputy's life to disarm a very violent man," said an official.
