NASA's Curiosity rover has reached its long term prime destination, the Mount Sharp (center of the vast Gale Crater), after more than two years of reaching Mars. Curiosity's trek up the mountain will begin with an examination of the mountain's lower slopes. The rover's route was altered to a milder terrain in 2013, owing to excessive wheel wear.
