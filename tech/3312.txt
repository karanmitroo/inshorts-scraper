Family members of three victims of December 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google, and Twitter. The lawsuit claims that the companies knowingly allowed terrorist activity to take place on their respective platforms. A similar lawsuit was filed against the companies in 2016, but US law gives internet firms broad immunity from liability for user-generated content.
