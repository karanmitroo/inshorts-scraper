A US-based startup has made a smart pen called 'Cronzy Pen' that collects colour from its surroundings and allows writing in over 16 million colours. Connected to a dedicated app, the pen scans colours from the objects and saves it to the user's smartphone. It takes a minute before the pen is ready for writing with the scanned colour.
