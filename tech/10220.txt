Siri, the intelligent personal assistant on Apple's operating systems, wished 'Eid Mubarak' to Indians on Thursday instead of 'Vijaydashmi' or 'Dussehra'. When asked 'is it a holiday today?', Siri replied, "It's Dussehra. Eid Mubarak!". The text was also followed by a Wikipedia link which had no mention of Eid. Notably, Eid al-Adha was on 22nd and 23rd of last month.
