Lenovo has unveiled its 'Smart Shoes' that track the users' fitness, count the steps taken and record their walking gestures. The app-connected shoes come with a 3D-scanner to customise the insole. While its smart LED lighting syncs with the foot movements and the music played, users can also play interactive games and participate in fitness competitions through the shoes' app.
