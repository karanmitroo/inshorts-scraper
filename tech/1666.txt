Furniture retailer company Ikea has launched an Apple-inspired advertisement campaign for its wireless charging furniture launched in 2015. The advertisement campaign has rephrased various catchphrases of the technology giant like 'This changes everything' to 'This charges everything.' Ikea's wireless charging furniture includes floor lamps and table lamps which come with embedded charging pads.
