Just two weeks after Apple's iPhone 7's launch, teenage hacker Luca Todesco has claimed jailbreaking the device running iOS 10 in less than 24 hours. Todesco shared the achievement on Twitter and YouTube, but did not reveal the details of how it was achieved. "The iPhone 7 is not 100 percent secure â€“ like nothing else is," said Todesco.
