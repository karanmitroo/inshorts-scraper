Dutch ad agency INDG has built a virtual reality app to simulate a trip from Amsterdam to Paris in 30 minutes in a Hyperloop pod. The app, which includes an exploded-view diagram to explain basic Hyperloop mechanics, supports the work of the Netherlands' Delft University of Technology, which had entered its pod into SpaceX's Hyperloop design competition earlier this year.
