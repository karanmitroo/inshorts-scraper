Social media platform Reddit has revealed that over one million Reddit users painted more than 16 million tiles on a plain digital canvas over 72 hours for its 'Place' experiment. Place allowed users to draw only one pixel at a time every five minutes. Images drawn across the canvas include India's flag, portrait of Mona Lisa and David Bowie.
