Following Twitter's announcement that it was shutting down Vine, the video-sharing platform's Co-founder Rus Yusupov tweeted, "Don't sell your company!" Twitter had acquired Vine in 2012 for a reported $30 million. Yusupov was laid off by Twitter last year after Vine's other two Co-founders quit in 2014.
