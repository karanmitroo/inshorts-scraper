Samsung is setting up Galaxy Note 7 exchange booths in airports around the world to allow Note 7 owners to exchange their phones for other devices. Such 'customer service points' have been established in South Korea, Australia and US so far. Samsung employees at the booths are also helping customers transfer data onto the exchanged phones before boarding their planes.
