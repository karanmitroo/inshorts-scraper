In a survey, Facebook asked users if men should be allowed to ask 14-year-old girls for sexual pictures on the platform. Asking users how would they handle the situation, one answer in the survey read, "This content should be allowed on Facebook, and I wouldn't mind seeing it." Facebook later apologised saying it shouldn't have been part of the survey.
