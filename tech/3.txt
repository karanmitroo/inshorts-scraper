BlackBerry has filed a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging the company and its subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, infringe on its messaging service, BlackBerry Messenger. "Defendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry's innovations," BlackBerry said. In response, Facebook said that after abandoning efforts to innovate, BlackBerry is looking to tax others' innovation.
