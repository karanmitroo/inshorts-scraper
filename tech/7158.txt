New York-based startup Vixole has created a pair of smart sneakers called 'Matrix' that helps Pokémon Go mobile game players to catch Pokémon. The sneakers sync with the game's app and sends notifications to the users of nearby Pokémon. The sneakers are also embedded with LEDs to display various Pokémon figures.
