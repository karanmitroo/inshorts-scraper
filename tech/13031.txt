Microsoft is working with Indian phone makers like Lava to launch Windows Phone (WP) devices that will take on the mainstream and low-cost Android phones. The WP devices sold by the local companies are likely to be available in market in the first half of 2014. They will be powered by Windows Phone 8.1, the next version of Windows Phone.
