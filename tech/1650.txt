Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that he regrets calling the idea that misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of last US election, 'crazy'. Zuckerberg admitted while his comment on the issue was "dismissive," the data shows Facebook has played a "bigger role" in the elections. This month, Facebook admitted Russia bought fake advertisements during the last US presidential elections.
