A Swedish court on Thursday sentenced a man to 10 years in prison, after finding him guilty of 'online rape'. The 41-year-old man coerced 27 teenagers in the US, Canada, and Britain between 2015 and 2017 to perform sexual acts in front of webcams. This is the first time Sweden has convicted someone of rape over the internet.
