Japanese man Yuta Sugiura has created a machine called 'Grassffiti' that can print any design including large scale ones on grassy surfaces or lawns. The roller type device, with a touchscreen panel to input design, can control the angle of the grass to display the designs. The designs can be erased by just using a roller on the grass.
