Technology giant Google has announced to introduce a feature to display waiting time for around a million restaurants in Search and Maps. Users will be able to check the estimated wait time under the 'Popular Times' section of a restaurant. It will also highlight the busiest time slots during the day and the approximate time people spent waiting in queue.
