E-commerce major Amazon on Wednesday successfully made its first-ever fully autonomous drone delivery without any human pilot. The delivery was made to an England customer's farmhouse, who ordered a digital media console and a popcorn packet. It took the drone only 13 minutes to make the delivery. Amazon is testing under 30-minute deliveries via drones that fly below 400 feet.
