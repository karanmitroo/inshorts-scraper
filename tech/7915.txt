National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has slammed the Australia's metadata laws, claiming that they violate the privacy of all the Australians. Snowden accused the government for using the laws to identify the sources of journalists. The metadata laws passed in March 2015 allowed the Australian government to access two years worth of its citizens' metadata without a warrant.
