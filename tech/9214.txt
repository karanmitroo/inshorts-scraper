Google's AlphaGo artificial intelligence (AI) is set to play the Chinese board game 'Go' against the world number one Lee Se-dol from South Korea. The $1 million contest, consisting of five matches, will be played in March and will be broadcasted live on YouTube. Notably, the AI had defeated the European champion 5-0 in the board game last month.
