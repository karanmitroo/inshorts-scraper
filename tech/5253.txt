A robot named 'Fatty' smashed glass and injured a bystander after a visitor pressed a wrong button at a technology fair in China's Shenzhen. While the visitor intended to make the robot move backwards, the wrong press of the button made the robot move forward and smash the glass of a neighbouring booth.
