In a first, UK-based researchers have developed a prosthetic hand, fitted with a camera that can 'see' an object and 'grip' it after analysing its shape and size. The 'intuitive' bionic hand responds automatically when pointed in the right direction without requiring the user to think. The aim is to develop prosthetics allowing two-way communications with the brain, researchers said.
