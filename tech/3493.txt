Google has reached a â‚¹50 crore settlement with Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service agency in a case that revolved around how Google requires handset makers to pre-load their devices with Android apps. Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines, the regulator said.
