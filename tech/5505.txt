Samsung has said about 85% of recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in the US have been replaced. It is also launching a software patch in the US, which limits Note 7's charging to 60%, and frequently notifies users of the recall. The Note 7 users can either exchange their device for another Samsung phone or get a refund.
