In the ever-expanding world of wearable tech, RHL Vision has developed the latest addition: a smart ring which turns a user's hand into an interface allowing them to remotely control their TV, smartphone or another wearable device. The 'Fin Bluetooth Ring' detects gesture like swipes and taps across the wearer's hand which sends the command off to the connected devices.
