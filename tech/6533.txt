Sony has unveiled the FDR-X3000R, an action camera capable of shooting time-lapse videos in 4K. The device features Sony's Balance Optical SteadyShot technology to capture stabilised recordings even in jerky videos, reportedly the first for an action cam. The camera, which is based on an 8.2-megapixel sensor, can also be controlled through the free PlayMemories mobile app.
