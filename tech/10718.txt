Researchers from Australia are using nanotechnology to treat heart attack and stroke victims. A nanocapsule, that reportedly contains a "clot-busting" drug, is given to the patient. The capsule is coated with an antibody that seeks out and targets life-threatening, causal blood clots. Once the nanocapsule arrives at the clot, it bursts open, releasing the medicine exactly where it's needed.
