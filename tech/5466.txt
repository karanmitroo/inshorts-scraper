Following Samsung's recall of Note 7 over exploding batteries, a man on Sunday claimed that his Reliance Lyf phone, sold by Reliance Industriesâ€™ retail arm Reliance Retail, exploded and caught fire. He also posted a picture of the phone and warned people from using Lyf smartphones. The Reliance team is in touch with the man and is investigating the matter.
