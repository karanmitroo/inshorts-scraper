Apple has filed a renewed patent for a fuel cell battery that could power the Apple products such as iPhones, MacBooks etc "for days or even weeks". Fuel cells work by mixing a fuel, such as borohydride, sodium silicate, lithium hydride with an oxidising agent, such as water or oxygen, and can last for weeks after refuelling.
