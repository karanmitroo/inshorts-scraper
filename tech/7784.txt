Solar Impulse 2, the solar-powered plane on a record-breaking trip around the world without consuming fuel, completed its flight across the US on Saturday. It flew over the Statue of Liberty and landed in New York. The plane's next leg is across the Atlantic, with plans to land somewhere between Ireland and Morocco.
