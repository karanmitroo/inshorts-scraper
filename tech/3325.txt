Technology major Apple has filed a patent that details a way to prevent water from damaging an iPhone's earpiece or speaker by ejecting it using sound. The patent explains how the speaker can generate a "tone or acoustic signal" to detect the liquid and then blast it out. The Apple Watch Series 2 also has a similar feature.
