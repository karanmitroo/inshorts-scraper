Facebook has pulled its news reading app Paper from Apple's App Store and will discontinue support for the app's existing downloads on July 29 this year. However, a part of the app will live on as design elements and features in Facebookâ€™s Instant Articles. Launched in 2014, the app served as a phone-based equivalent of a newspaper or magazine.
