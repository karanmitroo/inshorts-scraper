Facebook is updating its News Feed to prioritize stories based on what users actually want to see. For this, the company held a survey, where users gave each Feed story one to five stars. Until now, Facebook ranked stories based on how many Likes, comments and shares they garner. Notably, the new algorithm can reduce the visibility of clickbait and sensational stories.
