A little after midnight India's largest nuclear reactor at Kudankulam started generating electricity on a commercial basis. The 1000 MW reactor made with Russian assistance had been generating electricity only on an experimental basis after its turbine suffered a damage a few months ago. After repairs today it is generating full 1000 MW of power.
