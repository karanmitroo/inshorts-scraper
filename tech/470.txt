Instagram is internally testing a feature that will notify a user if someone takes a screenshot or screen recording of their Story, according to reports. The Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform will display an icon next to a person's name if they take a screenshot or record the Story. Earlier, Instagram tested a feature which allowed users to follow hashtags.
