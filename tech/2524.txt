Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp is reportedly testing a feature that will allow iOS users to play YouTube videos within the chat screen. The video will appear as a floating window that can be resized using pinch-to-zoom gesture. However, reports suggest users will not be able to continue watching the video if they quit WhatsApp.
