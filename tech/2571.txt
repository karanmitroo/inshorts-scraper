Beijing artist Ge Yulu reportedly fooled Google and Apple Maps into naming a Chinese road after him four years ago. He put up official-looking signs with his name on an unnamed road, which was picked up by various mapping services in 2014. Officials have now said the unauthorised signs will be taken down as only the government can name roads.
