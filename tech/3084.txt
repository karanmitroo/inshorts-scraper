A British shopping centre was reportedly defaced by a group of anonymous hackers on Monday. The centre closed down the screen immediately after being notified of the hack and claimed that only one of its 18 screens had been compromised. "The incident appears to have been good-natured and not intended to cause offence," said the company operating the screen.
