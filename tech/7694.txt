Researchers at the University of California have developed the 'KiloCore', a microchip with 1,000 independent programmable processors. The chip contains 621 million transistors and has a maximum computation rate of 1.78 trillion instructions per second. Each core runs a program independently, making the chip over 100 times more energy efficient in executing instructions than a laptop processor.
