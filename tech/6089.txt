Google's yet to be unveiled Pixel smartphones were reportedly leaked online due to an error by UK-based phone retailer Carphone Warehouse. The leak reveals that while Pixel will come with 5-inch screen, Pixel XL will have a 5.5-inch display. Both the phones will have USB-C port for quick charging to provide 7 hours of battery after 15 minutes of charging.
