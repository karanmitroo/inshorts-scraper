Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in an interview said, "There’ve been claims that fake news swayed the US election, and we don’t think it swayed the election." She added, "But, we take that responsibility really seriously.” Sandberg's statement comes a few days after CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the idea of fake news on Facebook affecting the elections "pretty crazy".
