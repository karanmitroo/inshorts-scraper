US-based high-speed transportation startup Hyperloop One has shared the first images and video of its under construction full-scale test track named 'DevLoop' in Nevada. The startup is aiming for the first full-scale test in the first half of 2017 using the 500 metre-long DevLoop. The proof of this concept will be used to connect Dubai and Abu Dhabi via Hyperloop.
