Facebook today globally launched 'Reactions', an expansion of its existing 'Like' button. The feature adds five new reaction images to the Like button, including Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. These reactions can be used on both desktop and mobile versions of Facebook by hovering over the Like button and tapping the desired reaction.
