A Bangalore Startup - FreeKall - has launched a free voice calling service for any part of the world even without Internet access. The service, which is still in testing phase, was launched last Saturday and nearly four lakh FreeKalls have been made so far. FreeKall makes money by making people listen to advertisements in the middle of the conversations.
