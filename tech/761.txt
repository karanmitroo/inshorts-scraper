Apple has reduced the replacement cost of out-of-warranty batteries in India by a reported price of over ₹4,000 for iPhone 6 models and beyond. Initially, the price for the same was ₹6,000 plus taxes and has now been reduced to ₹2,000 plus taxes. This comes after Apple faced criticism for slowing down older iPhones with new and updated iOS software.
