US-based startup Analog Watch Co lets users send hair from their pets to make customised watches from them priced at about â‚¹13,000. Users are required to send about 100 grams of fur from their dogs or cats. The startup turns the fur into a felted wool, which is heated to coat the leather band and metal body of a watch.
