A US-based startup has created a dating app that matches people based on their intelligence, called 'Sapio'. The app requires users to answer 300 open-ended questions like, "If you were the supreme ruler of the world what laws would you pass?" Sapio then matches the users based on similar interests, intellect, and personality types.
