Almost after three months of launch, iPhone hacking group 'evasi0n' announced Sunday that it has completed an untethered jailbreak for iOS 7. It is now available for installation on any iOS device that's capable of running iOS 7.0. Remarkably, the jailbreak took much more time compared to the previous jailbreaks, which only took a few weeks to appear.
