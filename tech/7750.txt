Facebook partnered with Deepika Padukone's The Live Love Laugh Foundation and NGO Aasra to launch its suicide prevention tool on Tuesday in India. The tool lets users flag their friendsâ€™ posts that seem suicidal. The posts will be reviewed by a Facebook team to provide various suicide prevention resources including a helpline and support to the people suffering from depression.
