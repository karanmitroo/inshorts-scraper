Florida-based movie app maker CustomPlay has filed a lawsuit against Apple over its digital assistant Siri's 'What did he say?' feature for Apple TV set-top box. The feature lets users say "what did he say?" to make Apple TV's software rewind the show they're watching by 15 seconds and switch on subtitles. CustomPlay claims the feature violates its automatic-rewind patent.
