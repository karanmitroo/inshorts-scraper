The servers of the digital mobile wallet Paytm went down for several hours on Wednesday, displaying the message, "We are facing some technical issues. We will have it resolved shortly so please try again after some time." Paytm has claimed that the sudden increase in the number of users and the associated traffic is the main cause of the issue.
