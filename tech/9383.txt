Sanmay Ved, an ex-Googler who owned Google.com for a single minute in October last year, was paid $6,006.13, which spells Google in numeric form. Ved donated the amount to the Art of Living Foundation, after which Google doubled the reward to $12,012.26. Ved had bought the Google.com domain for $12 on Google Domains, which the company later cancelled.
