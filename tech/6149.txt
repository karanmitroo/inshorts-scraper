WhatsApp has said it will share information with its parent company Facebook as planned, despite a directive by Delhi High Court ordering it to delete data it had collected from users who deleted the app before September 25. "The ruling has no impact on the planned policy and terms of service updates," said a WhatsApp spokesperson in a statement.
