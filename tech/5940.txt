British data specialist Mark Rittman on Tuesday live-tweeted his 11-hour-long attempt at boiling water for tea using his WiFi-enabled kettle. "Boiling water in saucepan now," tweeted Rittman at around 9 AM, indicating that the base station of the kettle was unable to communicate with the kettle itself. When the kettle finally responded at night, Rittman tweeted, "My work is done."
