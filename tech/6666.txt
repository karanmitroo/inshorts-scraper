Poland-based 'In Utero 3D' prints 3D models of babies in the womb so blind mothers can feel their children before they're born. At 1 Euro, mothers can get a life-size model 3D-printed in a non-toxic bio-plastic material. The project, titled 'Waiting Without Barriers', prints the models using 3D ultrasound information, usually conducted between the 18th-30th week of pregnancy.
