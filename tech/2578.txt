A UK girls' school is banning Fitbit activity trackers and smartwatches over concerns that students are skipping lunch on failing to meet their calorie and exercise targets. "We don't need our girls to be...obsessed with steps or calories," said the school's head teacher. The school is also putting restrictions on smartphones to tackle social media's impact on students' mental health.
