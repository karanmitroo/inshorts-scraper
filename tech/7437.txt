Australia's Tasmania state will use an autonomous underwater vehicle to explore new parts of the Antarctic environment. Named "Explorer", the vehicle is reportedly capable of diving to depths of 5,000 metres and travelling over 100 km under thick ice. It is funded by the Antarctic Gateway Partnership, an initiative that aims to understand Antarctica's role in the global climate system.
