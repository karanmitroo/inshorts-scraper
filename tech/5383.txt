A 21-year-old student, Cosmo Scharf, has rejected a $100,000 grant awarded by billionaire Peter Thiel after Donald Trump was elected as the US President. Thiel is PayPal's Co-founder and a Facebook board member who openly supports Trump. "I can't be associated with a person who helped a psychopathic, sexist, racist, xenophobic, poisonous demagogue rise to power", the student said.
