A British company has developed a concept headset called 'Viewi' to diagnose and monitor glaucoma at home using smartphones. A connected mobile app will test the sensitivity of the users' eyes by flashing lights at varying points of the visual field. The headset, priced at around $26, will enable cheap diagnosis of one of the leading causes of blindness.
