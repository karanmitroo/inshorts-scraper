A US hospital will soon use Google Glass to enable mothers to stay in contact with their newborns if their infants are shifted to the ICU. As per the experiment, to be conducted next week, a participant visiting the ICU will wear Google Glass and the images they see will stream live to a tablet computer in the mother's hands.
