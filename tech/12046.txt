NASA is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its first Mars Mission. The Mariner 4 mission, NASA's first successful journey outside Earth, was launched 50 years ago, on November 28, 1964. Mariner 4 flew past Mars on July 15, 1965, and sent back 21 iconic images of the Red planet, from a distance of barely 6,000 miles from it.
