Yahoo on Thursday confirmed at least 500 million accounts were hacked in 2014 by what it believes was a "state-sponsored actor". The data may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and in some cases, encrypted security questions and answers, the company said. Yahoo added that it is notifying potentially affected users and has taken steps to secure their accounts.
