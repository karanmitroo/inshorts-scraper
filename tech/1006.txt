After choosing India to pioneer its blood donation feature, Facebook has said that over 40 lakh Indians have signed up as blood donors on the site. The feature, which connects the needy with the nearby blood donors, will be launched in Bangladesh next year. The feature also allows organisations to create voluntary blood donation events and notify nearby donors.
