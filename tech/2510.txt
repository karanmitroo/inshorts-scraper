Customs officials in Shenzhen, China arrested a woman last week for allegedly strapping 102 iPhones and Tissot watches to her body and trying to smuggle them into the country from Hong Kong. According to reports, the officials suspected the woman might be smuggling something as she was wearing a cardigan despite the heat and her upper body looked too 'bulky'.
