Tech giant Apple on Wednesday unveiled the AirPods, wireless earphones with a built-in W1 chip for audio processing and pairing. Priced at $159, the AirPods use Bluetooth to transmit audio from devices, and they are equipped with sensors to detect when they are plugged in. The charging lasts up to 5 hours, and the pods' casing doubles up as battery.
