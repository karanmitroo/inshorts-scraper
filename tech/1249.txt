A US judge has stopped all sales by home security startup Ring as part of a lawsuit filed by rival electronic security provider ADT. According to the lawsuit, Ring allegedly gained security trade secrets using "theft and felony" and used them for their own products. Ring, which is known for video doorbells, launched its 'Protect' home security system last month.
