Fast food chain KFC is selling an internet blocking tent called 'Internet Escape Pod', made of steel and stainless steel mesh for $10,000 in the US. It features KFC Founder Colonel Sanders' model made of architectural foam and can accommodate four people. KFC said the tent will have to be tested before it can claim total signal impenetrability.
