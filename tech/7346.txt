A Bengaluru-based startup IoTranic has made a smart watch for pregnant women called 'SaveMom'. It tracks the heart rate and sleep patterns of pregnant women, works without networks or bluetooth connectivity, has zero radiation and comes with a battery life of nine months. The watch stores all its data on a memory card, which can be shared with the doctor.
