'EcoHelmet', a foldable paper bike helmet, created by New York-based Isis Shiffer, has won the £30,000 (around ₹25.3 lakhs) James Dyson design award 2016. Shiffer came up with the idea when she started using bike-hire schemes and realised it required people to bring their own helmets which were expensive. The recyclable 'EcoHelmet' is expected to cost around $5 (approximately ₹340).
