Abu Dhabi-based cyber security firm DarkMatter has unveiled the Katim smartphone which comes with a 'self-destruct' feature to auto-delete data if it detects tampering. DarkMatter CEO Faisal Al Bannai says that the phone, which claims to have the most secure communications suite in the world, has been made for state heads and government entities and not for "the average consumer."
