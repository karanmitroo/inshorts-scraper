Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said that the company will definitely make more phones, but "they may not look like phones that are there today." He added, "No one before us thought of 2-in-1s (laptops)...we created that category and made it a successful category to the point where there are more 2-in-1s coming. And thatâ€™s what we want to do."
