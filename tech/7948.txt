The world's first functional 3D-printed office, a single storey building spread across 2,700 square foot, opened in Dubai this week. The arc-shaped office building used a 20-foot tall 3D printer and a special mixture of cement to be built. Located near the Dubai International Financial Center, the building was completed in 17 days at a cost of about $140,000.
