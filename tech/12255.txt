A month after its global unveiling, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 was Tuesday launched in India at Rs 58,300. Having a 5.7-inch display, the phablet features fast-charging technology, so the battery can go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. Becoming a part of the selfie brigade, it has a 3.7MP front camera that allows users to take wide-angle selfies.
