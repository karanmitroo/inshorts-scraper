Microsoft's Windows 10 will be the first operating system to include a swearing middle finger emoji in its collection. The operating system will also feature five new skin tones- pale, cream white, moderate brown, dark brown and black- with grey being the default tone. The swearing character was approved in 2014 by Unicode, which decides the standards for emoji.
