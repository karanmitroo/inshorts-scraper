Iran has unveiled a drone for "suicide" missions against land and sea-based targets for the second time this month, according to media reports. The reports added that the unmanned aerial vehicle, designed primarily for maritime surveillance, can carry "heavy payloads of explosives for combat missions". Reportedly, the stealth drone is also capable of flying at low heights to avoid detection.
