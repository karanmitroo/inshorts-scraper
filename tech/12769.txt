Boston-based Spike Aerospace recently announced plans for a new supersonic jet, which will transport passengers from Los Angeles to Tokyo in just five-hours and wonâ€™t have any windows, but instead full-length digital screens that turn every seat into a window seat. The live video feed of outside world will be relayed from an array of cameras on the jet's exterior.
