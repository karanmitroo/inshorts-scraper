The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will reportedly launch six satellites from Singapore in December. While five of them are from different universities, one 500-kilogram satellite is from a company called Singapore Technologies Electronics, making it the countryâ€™s first commercial satellite. They will be launched into an equatorial orbit via the polar satellite launch vehicle.
