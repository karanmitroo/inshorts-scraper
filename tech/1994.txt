Google's parent company Alphabet is set to form a new company called XXVI Holdings. The new entity will own the equity of each Alphabet company, including Google and encompass projects like Google's self-driving car spinoff company Waymo. The move is a part of corporate reorganisation which will allow Alphabet and Google to operate in an efficient manner, the company said.
