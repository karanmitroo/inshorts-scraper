An Apple store in Australia fired four male employees for reportedly stealing pictures from customers' phones sent in for repair. The employees have also been accused of taking 'creepshots' of their female co-workers and rating the women's body parts out of 10 on a group chat. Apple confirmed the employees had been sacked for violation of its "business conduct policy".
