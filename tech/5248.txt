The Catholic Church has launched an interactive GPS-powered 'confession finder' application in Scotland. The app, dubbed 'Sindr' by some users, makes use of technology similar to dating app 'Tinder' to find the nearest church offering confession or celebrating mass. "The idea was inspired by the Holy Father himself," said Edinburgh's Archbishop Leo Cushley.
