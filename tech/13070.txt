A rapidly growing messaging service, Snapchat has reportedly turned down an all cash, $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook. At that price, it would have been Facebook's largest acquisition till date. Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's 23-year-old co-founder and CEO, will not likely consider an acquisition at least until early next year, people familiar with the matter said.
