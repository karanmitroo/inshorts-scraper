India's first Mars Orbiter spacecraft successfully underwent the second orbit-raising exercise raising the apogee (farthest point from Earth) from 28,814km to 40,186km. Orbit-raising is performed to increase the apogee and give the spacecraft enough velocity to escape Earth's orbit without consuming too much fuel. The spacecraft, expected to reach Mars's orbit on Sept-24, 2014, will undergo three more orbit-raising operations.
