Facebook on Monday announced 'shared photo albums' feature that allows multiple-users to upload images to same album. The album creator can share access to as many as 50 "contributors," who can each in turn share up to 200-photos. Album creators can choose a setting that allows contributors to invite others to the album, or retain total control over album invitations.
