Samsung has confirmed that it will "safely dispose of" the recalled Galaxy Note 7 devices instead of repairing, refurbishing, or reselling them. Samsung had manufactured about 2.5 million Note 7 devices, all of which are being recalled over battery explosions. According to environmentally conscious organizations, recycling smartphones leads to wastage of rare elements used in their manufacturing.
