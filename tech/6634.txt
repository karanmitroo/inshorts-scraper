Apple has sent out invitations for an event on September 7, 2016, when the company will most likely unveil iPhone 7. Unlike previous events, this invitation does not give any hints about the unveiling and just says, "See you on the 7th". Apple will take pre-orders after the unveiling and the next iPhone will reportedly be released after a week.
