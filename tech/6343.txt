An Armenian startup, Bazillion Beings is making a platform for bots called 'independent online life forms' or 'lifos' that live, learn and evolve online. The 'lifos' interact with humans and other bots, offering various services like curated content, app recommendations, multiplayer gaming and chat. They use machine learning to create variations of themselves, similar to a real-world ecosystem.
