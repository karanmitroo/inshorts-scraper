The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has decided to bring in a regulation for over-the-top (OTT) companies, under which they will have to pay connectivity charges to telecom companies and also share revenue with the government. According to telecom industry estimates, telecom companies currently lose around Rs 5k crore annually due to free apps like WhatsApp and Viber.
