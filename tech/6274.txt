Georgia Tech University student Ryan Pickren has been rewarded 15 million free miles worth $300,000 for exposing security flaws after participating in the United Airlines' Bug Bounty Program. Pickren donated five million miles to Georgia Tech, which did not press charges against him for hacking their master calendar last year.
