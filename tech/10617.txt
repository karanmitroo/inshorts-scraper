Digital health startup SkinVision has received what it calls a late Series A/early Series B funding of $3.4 million led by European pharmaceutical firm LEO Pharma, that strongly focuses on dermatology. SkinVision uses smartphone tech and vision algorithms to allow consumers to track changes to the moles in their skin. This is aimed at identifying cancer growths such as melanoma.
