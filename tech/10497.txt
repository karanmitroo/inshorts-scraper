Car maker Honda has been permitted by the government of California to drive its autonomous cars on public streets. The company is reportedly deploying advanced driver-assistance systems across its Honda and Acura models. Other companies to have such permits in California— one of the few states to allow on-road testing of self-driving vehicles— include Mercedes-Benz, Tesla, Nissan, and BMW.
