Ukrainian firm Limpid Armor has developed HoloLens-equipped military helmets for tank commanders to monitor surroundings by 'turning their heads'. Dubbed the Circular Review System (CRS), the helmet sports a HoloLens headset set onto the front of its frame. Video feeds from the tank's exterior cameras are stitched together and displayed through the headset as "mixed reality" view to the wearer.
