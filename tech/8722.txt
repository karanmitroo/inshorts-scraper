Sony has announced to globally launch its PlayStation VR headset in October at $399. The headset features a 5.7-inch screen, 360° head tracking sensors and 100° field of view. The headset requires the PlayStation Move camera that does not come along with the PlayStation VR and costs extra. The device is compatible with DualShock 4 and PS Move controllers.
