Sony on Friday urged customers to stop using a model (Vaio Fit 11A) of its Vaio computers launched in February, saying there was a risk that the battery would catch fire. The warning from the company came after three PCs of the same model had caught on fire around the battery pack, which was manufactured by Panasonic.
