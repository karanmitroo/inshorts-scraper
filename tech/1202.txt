Twitter has increased the character limit from 140 to 280 for tweets in all languages where "cramming was an issue". Japanese, Chinese, and Korean languages will not receive the update as they can convey the same amount of information in lesser characters, Twitter said. This is the first time Twitter changed its character limit since it was launched in 2006.
