According to media reports, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer accidentally fired at least 30 employees after they were mistakenly listed on the layoff list. The said employees “were lower on the performance scale but…weren't meant to get fired”. However, a company spokesperson said that "there is zero truth to this rumour".
