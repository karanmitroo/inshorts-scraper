A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center has found that Facebook remains the most popular social network site owing to its large "very active" user base. About 70% of Facebook users engage with the site daily, 45% several times a day. Daily engagement on other sites was quite low- Instagram (49%), Twitter (36%) and Pinterest (17%).
