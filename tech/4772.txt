Nokia-owned startup Withings and L'Oreal have created a â‚¹13,000 smart hairbrush called 'Hair Coach', that comes with an inbuilt microphone to listen to the hair brushing patterns for tracking damage. It has a gyroscope to analyse brushing force and speed and a vibrating handle that suggests better brushing techniques. A dedicated mobile app shows users their hair brushing analysis.
