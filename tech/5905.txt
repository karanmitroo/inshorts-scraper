Officers from United States' largest police force, the New York Police Department (NYPD), use Lumia 830 and Lumia 640 XL devices as their official department-issued smartphones.
The NYPD and Microsoft have collaborated on apps like a police records search and a case management system among others. The department is planning on updating to the Windows 10 operating system next year.
