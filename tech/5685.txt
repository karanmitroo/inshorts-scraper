A three-minute video shows a robot, built around Microsoft's Emotion API algorithm, analysing all the three US presidential debates and determining that US presidential nominee Donald Trump is "really sad". The robot is modelled using deep learning and uses thousand of low-resolution pictures showing various human emotions as a reference. However, robotic emotion recognition is not perfect yet.
