The world's lightest mechanical watch weighing 40 grams was unveiled on Monday by the University of Manchester along with McLaren F1 and watchmaker Richard Mille. The watch's case is made with graphene composite Graph TPT, which is lighter than any other watchmaking material. Graphene, discovered at the University of Manchester in 2004, is the world's first one-atom-thick 2D material.
