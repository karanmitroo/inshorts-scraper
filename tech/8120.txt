Google has announced to pay $20/hour to drivers in Arizona for testing its self-driving cars and providing a written and oral feedback to the engineering team. Drivers will need to work under 12-24 month contracts and drive the vehicles from six to eight hours per day. Notably, Google in April had announced to expand its self-driving car program to Arizona.
