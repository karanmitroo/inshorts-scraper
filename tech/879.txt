Technology giant Google has updated its guidelines to hide news from sites that "misrepresent or conceal their country of origin". The move is to ensure that users can "understand and see where their news online is coming from", according to a Google spokesperson. Google will also allow users to file a spam report if they find publishers violating these guidelines.
