Self-driving single occupancy drone taxis will be flying passengers across Dubai from July, the city's Roads and Transport Authority said. Dubai will use Chinese firm Ehang's drones which take off vertically and can remain in flight for up to 30 minutes on a single charge. The passengers can choose from predetermined destinations available on a tablet fitted inside the drone.
