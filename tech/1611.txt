A picture from a 1972 Playboy magazine accidentally helped in creation of image processing standards like JPEG, according to a US-based institute. In 1973, a professor tore the picture to fit it in a scanner and scanned 5.12 inches of it. The three sets of 512 coloured lines that composed the image then became standard format for digital image processing.
