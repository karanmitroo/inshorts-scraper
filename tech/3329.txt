Russia has blocked access to Chinese social media app WeChat for failing to give its contact details to country's communications watchdog. Access to China's most popular social media platform has reportedly been restricted since Thursday. Last year, Russia blocked US social networking site LinkedIn for violating a law that requires data of Russian citizens to be stored on Russian servers.
