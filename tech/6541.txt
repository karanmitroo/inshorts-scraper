Samsung's worldwide recall of its latest Galaxy Note 7 smartphone over battery explosion cases will cost the company around $1 billion or less, according to analysts. The amount is expected to be spent by Samsung to replace 2.5 million handsets shipped by the company. The amount represents less than 5% of Samsungâ€™s projected net income of $20.6 billion this year.
