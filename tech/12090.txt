Rosetta comet mission is in trouble as its Philae lander sitting on a Comet has run out of power. This happened after Lander successfully rotated itself into slightly sunnier position but apparently too late to charge batteries and keep systems running. However, Philae may reboot and power up after getting sunlight, as the comet is approaching towards the sun.
