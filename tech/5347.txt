Twitter on Tuesday introduced tools to let users mute keywords, phrases, and entire conversations they don't want to see notifications about. The move is aimed at curbing online bullying and harassment on the platform. Twitter has reportedly also banned the accounts of a number of 'alt-right' users including Richard Spencer, head of 'nationalist' think tank National Policy Institute.
