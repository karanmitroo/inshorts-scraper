Chinese smartphone maker Lenovo has released an advertisement with the tagline 'Skip the Sevens' to troll Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Apple iPhone 7. In the advertisement, Lenovo calls a set of iPhone loyalists and demonstrates snap-on cases called 'Moto Mods' for Moto Z. The cases can add a projector, a speaker or an extra battery to the smartphone.
