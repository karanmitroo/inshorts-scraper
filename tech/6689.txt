Beijing-based PowerVision has launched what it claims to be the world's first foldable egg-shaped drone, called the PowerEgg, at $1,288. The drone, which 'hatches' four arms with folding rotor blades, sports a 4K camera that can shoot 360-degree panoramic images. The drone wouldÂ also allow its users to upload mid-flight real-time HD footage to their social media accounts.
