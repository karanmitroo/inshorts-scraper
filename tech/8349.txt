Tesla is offering the owners of its Model S and Model X cars a free monthly trial of the Autopilot feature. The feature lets a car navigate itself along road curves, manage speed and change lanes with a single tap. The car can park itself on the user's command. Users can also make the feature permanent via a software update.
