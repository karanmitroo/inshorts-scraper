Google-owned video sharing platform YouTube on Tuesday debuted a new logo for the first time since its launch 12 years ago. Besides the new logo, YouTube has also redesigned its mobile app and desktop version to give it a cleaner look. YouTube also plans to launch gestures support on its app to let people switch between videos with a swipe.
