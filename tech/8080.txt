Instant messaging app Line has begun offering delivery on-demand services in Thailand. Under the pilot move, users can avail courier, food and grocery delivery services via the new ‘Line Man’ app. The service is powered by Lalamove, a logistics startup that will provide motorbike delivery staff wearing green jackets clad with Line’s cartoonish emoji characters.
