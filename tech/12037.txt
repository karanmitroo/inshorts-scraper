Google has made an investment in ‘no-shake spoon’ that will allow people with essential tremors and Parkinson's disease to eat without spilling. The technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced. Google got into the no-shake utensil business in September this year. More than 10 million people worldwide have essential tremors or Parkinson's disease.
