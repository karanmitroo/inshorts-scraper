Users of Xiaomi's Mi Band 2 fitness tracker have complained that the device does not work on black people or dark skin. According to users, the device can't pick up accurate heart rates unless it is placed on lighter parts of their skin like the palm. Users also said placing a sheet of paper between the band and skin works.
