The inventor of electronic mail Raymond Tomlinson sent the first email to himself in 1971 via a computer network called ARPANET, 18 years before the World Wide Web was invented. Tomlinson said the first message was likely "QWERTYIOP or something similar". 'Internaut Day' was celebrated on Tuesday to mark 25 years since the World Wide Web was publicly made available.
