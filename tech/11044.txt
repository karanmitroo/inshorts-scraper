Actor Amitabh Bachchan has unveiled the new look of Worldoo.com, a website that aims to take children's “creative engagement to a new level” by helping them initiate into the world of internet. The website claims to give children specialised spaces to learn about subjects like Life Skills or Geography with new flag-bearers, “Mo” and “Ki”, whom the children help fight social issues.
