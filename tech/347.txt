Campaigners and activists in the Philippines have developed an app which lets users locate free condom distribution centres in the country. The campaign is being led by 'Save the Children' and 'LoveYourself' social groups to promote safe sex. Further, the organisations have also installed 30 condom dispensers in the capital Manila to promote HIV awareness.
