According to sources, the government has ordered to unblock all the 32 websites that were being used by terrorists after these sites promised to cooperate with the authorities and removed "jihadist" content. The websites were blocked in November following an order from a Mumbai court. The websites included dailymotion.com, github.com, archive.org, heypasteit.com and vimeo.com among others.
