American direct broadcast satellite service Dish has launched a $30 remote control called 'Hopper Voice Remote', which can be operated through voice commands. The remote has a button on its side that activates voice commands like “Watch ESPN,” “Record this,” or “Romantic Comedies featuring Harvey Keitel.” It also has a touchpad-like interface that allows gesture-based commands.
