Austrian and Chinese academies of sciences have successfully conducted the first-ever quantum-secured intercontinental video call between Vienna and Beijing. The call was made possible using the first quantum satellite Micius launched by China in 2016. Micius uses entangled photons (light particles) for communication, which if intercepted, renders the information useless, also exposing the hacker.
