Facebook and Twitter have joined Google-backed First Draft Coalition, a network of over 30 news and technology companies to prevent fake news from spreading and improving the quality of information on social media. The network said it would launch a platform where members can verify questionable news stories. Other members of the group include Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, and CNN.
