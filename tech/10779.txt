Scientists from Dehradun have decided to use drone technology to control the cases of man-animal conflict in and around forest areas. If an animal is reported to be lurking close to human habitat, a drone fitted with a GPS and hi-resolution cameras can be sent to track its exact location. The animal can then be driven back to the forest.
