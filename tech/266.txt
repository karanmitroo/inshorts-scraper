YouTube has temporarily suspended ads on YouTuber Logan Paul's account, who made â‚¹80 crore through his channel last year, citing "recent pattern of behaviour". Paul, who earlier posted a video of an apparent suicide victim, recently filmed himself operating a taser on a rat. After the suicide victim video, Paul had apologised and pledged $1 million for suicide prevention.
