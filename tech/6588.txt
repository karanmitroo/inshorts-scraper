Tokyo's Haneda airport is experimenting with Hitachi's EMIEW3 humanoid robot assistants in its passenger terminal. For a two-week period, the robots will direct visitors to an information display, and answer questions in both English and Japanese. This precedes a full scale robot assistant program due to start later this year, in which robots will physically guide users to desired locations.
