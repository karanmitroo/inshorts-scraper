The self-lacing Autodisc shoes made by German athletic apparel maker Puma can be connected to a smartphone to adjust tightness and monitor battery levels. The shoes can be charged by placing the heels on an accompanying wireless-charging mat until the indicators stop blinking. Puma has made only 50 pairs of the Autodisc shoes.
