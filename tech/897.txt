NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope has made its latest discovery using Google's artificial intelligence (AI), the space agency said. The telescope, which has gazed at over 1,50,000 stars, transmits back data that leads to several discoveries, including first-time observations of planets outside the solar system. Further, NASA is set to reveal the discovery made by Kepler on December 14.
