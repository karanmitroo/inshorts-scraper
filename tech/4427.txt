Microblogging site Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey on Sunday tweeted, "The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the US". Dorsey's comments come after US President Donald Trump ordered to limit immigration from seven nations. "This Executive Order goes against our principles. It's wrong," Dorsey further tweeted.
