Chinese internet giant Baidu has implemented its facial recognition technology in the town of Wuzhen, which has been preserved as a historic park, to let tourists gain entry to various attractions without physical tickets. Visitors will have their pictures taken when they enter the park, which will be used to verify their identity at 10 camera gates around Wuzhen.
