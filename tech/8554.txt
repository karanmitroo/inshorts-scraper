North Korea has officially announced that it is blocking Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, South Korean and "sex and adult" websites. The government has named the websites as specific examples of what it is blocking “for a certain period of time.” Reportedly, Facebook and Twitter have been informally blocked in the nation for months, and North Koreans can access the government-sanctioned intranet.
