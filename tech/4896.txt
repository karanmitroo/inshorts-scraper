The US government has started asking foreign travellers to provide information regarding their online presence on social media like Facebook and Twitter in an effort to help identify terrorist threats. The policy applies to those travelling under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the US and stay without a visa for 90 days.
