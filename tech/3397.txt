World's most valuable company Apple's self-driving test car was recently spotted for the first time in the Silicon Valley. The car, a Lexus RX450h SUV, was fitted with standard third-party sensors and hardware, two radar units and a number of cameras. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor gave Apple clearance to carry out trials with three vehicles.
