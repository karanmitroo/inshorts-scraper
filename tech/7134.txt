A Chinese province on Friday unveiled an electric bus equipped with a “black box” that automatically sends information and video footage to the control centre in case of an accident. The updated security system features emergency buttons which change the bus number on the exterior to “SOS” when pressed, accompanied by emergency lights and alarms.
