University of California scientists have discovered that sunflowers do not just respond to sunlight but also to an internal biological clock. They concluded this after shifting sunflower plants into specially made chambers with a fixed overhead light that was always on. The flowers' faces continued moving as if the sun was rising in the east and setting in the west.
