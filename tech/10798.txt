NASA scientists have captured the flyby of a peanut-shaped asteroid, 1999 JD6, which came close to Earth on July 24. An asteroid will come this close to Earth next in 2054. The asteroid, which appeared to be a contact binary, meaning it had two lobes stuck together, made its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 7.2 million km.
