Amazon has added a 'Package X-ray' feature to its iPhone app to let users 'see' what's inside their packages without opening them. Users can only scan the barcode on the packages which have been ordered using their Amazon account to view a list of all its contents. Amazon claims this will help users keep track of packaged Christmas presents.
