North Korean ambassador for American affairs at the UN, Pak Song-il, has asked the US to provide evidence to support its claims that the WannaCry ransomware attack was engineered by North Korea. He called the allegation an effort to create an "extremely confrontational atmosphere". The cyber attack hit around three lakh computers in 150 countries earlier this year.
