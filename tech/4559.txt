LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner admitted on Twitter that he originally believed Apple's wireless AirPods were overhyped. However, he added that he was "completely wrong" about the headphones and now feels that they are a breakthrough. "Did something today I haven't done in 30 yrs: Hit golf balls while listening to music. Felt like I was in a commercial," Weiner added.
