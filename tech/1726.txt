The world's largest aircraft 'Stratolaunch' built by Microsoft Co-founder Paul Allen has completed its first engine test this week. The company said "each of the six engines operated as expected" during the three-phase test. Notably, Stratolaunch, which has a 385-feet wingspan, can carry up to 250 tonnes of cargo and is capable of launching rockets.
