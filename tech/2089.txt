A New York court has approved a class action lawsuit against Sony for overstating claims that its Xperia line of phones and tablets were "waterproof." The lawsuit, which covers 24 phones and tablets, seeks a reimbursement of up to 50% to each US customer who bought a water-resistant Sony Xperia device but faced water damage.
