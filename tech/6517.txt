Facebook Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday shared an old picture as Facebook's News Feed completed 10 years since it went live on the social media platform. "This invention is one of my favorite stories from Facebook's history," said Zuckerberg in a post. The News Feed feature was launched two years after Facebook was introduced.
