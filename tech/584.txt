Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey will not seek re-election to Walt Disney's board, according to a filing. Disney said that it had become increasingly difficult for the two to avoid conflicts relating to board matters. Former Starbucks CEO Orin Smith will also leave the board, following rules that specify retirement at age 74.
