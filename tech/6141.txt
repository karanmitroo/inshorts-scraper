The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has warned the owners of certain Samsung washing machines made between March 2011 and April 2016, due to concerns over exploding units. A Texas woman has claimed that her washer exploded and penetrated the interior wall of her garage. This comes amid Samsung's efforts to replace Note 7 smartphones worldwide over exploding batteries.
