Microsoft researchers are working on a project "Premonition", a system that aims to detect outbreaks of infectious diseases before they become widespread. The approach aims to catch mosquitoes using drones carrying specialized traps and then use cutting-edge molecular biology and cloud-based data analysis to detect diseases. The team has tested the concept in the Caribbean island of Grenada so far.
