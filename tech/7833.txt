The US Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal from Google to dismiss a 2008 class action lawsuit from California advertisers who purchased advertisements through the company's AdWords service. The advertisers alleged that Google misled them by not informing that their advertisements might appear on error pages and parked domains. Advertisers are seeking a refund on their payments.
