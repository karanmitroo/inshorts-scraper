Norwegian startup reMarkable has developed a â‚¹38,500 E-Ink tablet 'reMarkable' which the company claims feels like paper. The device which comes with a marker allows users to write and draw on the 8x11-inch electronic paper, and does not require an external light source. It has a 100 millisecond response time and lets users write in real-time on the screen.
