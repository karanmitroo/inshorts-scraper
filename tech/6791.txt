Google Co-founder Sergey Brin admitted in a conference that it "was probably a mistake for [him] to be working on anything tangentially related to social", when asked about Google+ and its social media competitors. "I'm just not a very social person...I don't connect with a lot of people. I'm kind of weirdo", added the billionaire who turned 43 on Sunday.
