According to a senior NASA scientist, the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission will be the biggest collaboration between the two space agencies till date. NISAR, expected to launch in 2020, aims at building a 2,600-kilogram satellite that will “effectively make a time-lapse movie of the Earth”. Costing over $1 billion, the mission will track disturbances in the ecosystem.
