Google is planning to have a squeezing feature called Active Edge in Pixel 2 which would allow the phone to respond with preset functions on squeezing. In a legal filing, HTC revealed that it will manufacture Pixel 2 with squeezing sensors from its in-house model U11. For instance, if the user squeezes the phone sides, it will activate Google Assistant.
