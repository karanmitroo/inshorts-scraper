Microsoft will reportedly be making its digital assistant Cortana available as a stand-alone app to iOS and Android users, using research from an artificial intelligence project called "Einstein." Cortana has been used in Windows Phones for a year and would also be introduced to the Windows 10 operating system for desktops this autumn.
