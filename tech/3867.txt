A 3-year-old toddler succumbed to injuries while two girls were critically injured after a hoverboard exploded inside a house in the US. One of the victims jumped from the house's second-floor to escape the blaze. This comes after numerous product recalls and repeated warnings were made by the US government over the past two years to avoid potentially hazardous hoverboards.
