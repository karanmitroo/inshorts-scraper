Popular photo-sharing mobile app Instagram has announced that it will not ban photos of breastfeeding and stretch marks. Its new guidelines read, "...for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity... but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed." Facebook, which owns Instagram, also clarified its community guidelines last month allowing breastfeeding photos.
