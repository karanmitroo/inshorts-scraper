American author Dennis Cooper recently claimed that Google has deleted his blog which he had maintained for 14 years, without warning. Cooper reportedly updated his blog six times a week, which also had an unfinished novel that he was working on for seven months. He said his lawyer talked multiple times to Google's lawyer, but hasn't got any response yet.
