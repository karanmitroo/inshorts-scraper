'Veil Garments', has launched water-repellent hijabs that stay dry at all times- like a raincoat. Apart from having a cooling technology, the veil also absorbs 80% of heat rays and keeps the fabric much cooler. Ordinary dark-coloured fabric absorbs 90% of heat rays. The 22-yr-old founder of the brand, Ahmad Ghanem, launched the product on 'Kickstarter'.
