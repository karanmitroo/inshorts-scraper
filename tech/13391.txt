The sun will backlight Saturn on July-19, allowing you to clearly see the planet's rings, photograph them and observe the changes over the past seven years, since Saturn was last photographed. NASA is encouraging people to capture photos of Saturn and send them in, which will be compiled into a collage and posted on its website.
