Israel's Minister of Public Security, Gilad Erdan on Saturday said, "Facebook, which brought an amazing, positive revolution to the world, sadly, since the rise of Islamic State...has simply become a monster." He further accused Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg of not doing enough to prevent incitement against Israel, adding that the social media platform was "sabotaging" Israeli police work.
