A Boeing aircraft completed its first test-flight using 'green diesel', a fuel blend of vegetable oils, waste cooking oil and animal fats. Boeing used the fuel to power a 787 test airplane, using a blend of 15% green diesel and 85% petroleum jet fuel. Green diesel offers to make sustainable aviation bio-fuel more available and more affordable, the company said.
