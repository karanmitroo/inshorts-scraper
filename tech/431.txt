Canada-based researchers have developed an Augmented Reality system that projects patients' internal anatomy directly on the body, doing away with the need to make incisions. Called ProjectDR, the technology uses infrared cameras and body markers that project images while tracking body movement. Further, doctors can choose to see only the lungs or blood vessels, depending on the case.
