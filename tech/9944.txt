NASA finally launched its Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) with over 7,000 pounds of cargo on Sunday from Florida. “The mission will deliver experiments, equipment and supplies to the orbiting laboratory and its six-person crew of astronauts and cosmonauts,” NASA said. This is Orbital ATK's fourth cargo resupply mission to the ISS.
