A Thai man filmed himself killing his 11-month-old daughter and live-streamed the video on Facebook before committing suicide, according to reports. "The man had an argument with his wife. He was jealous and thought that she had other boyfriends," police said. It is believed to be Thailand's first killing that was broadcast on the social networking site.
