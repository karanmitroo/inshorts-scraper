Australia has announced to replace passports with biometric recognition of passengers' faces, irises or fingerprints as the means of identification at its international airports. The intention was that international passengers could "literally just walk out like at a domestic airport", an official said. Notably, the government aims at automating 90% of air traveller processing by 2020.
