A hacker group called 'Spain Squad' managed to bring back several Twitter accounts which the micro-blogging platform had suspended. The group claims that the exploit used to reactivate the banned accounts could also be used to control active accounts, change Twitter handles and suspend accounts on Twitter's behalf. Twitter has reportedly re-suspended the accounts which the hackers had activated.
