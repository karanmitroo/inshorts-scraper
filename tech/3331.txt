In a court hearing on Wednesday, Google accused Uber of stealing its self-driving technology by making a fake company 'Otto' and acquiring it within months of its launch. Earlier, Google had accused Otto's founder Anthony Levandowski, who was a former Google engineer, of stealing 14,000 files before he quit the company. Levandowski joined Uber after it acquired Otto last year.
