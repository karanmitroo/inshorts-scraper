Technology giant Apple's virtual assistant Siri on being asked "What is an Indian?" replied "they are a bit brown and they smell like curry and eat it". Siri's answer was picked from an edit made to the Wikipedia article for "Indian" on June 8, 2017. Apple later made changes to ensure that Siri doesn't pick up incorrect Wikipedia answers.
