Over 4,200 websites, including the ones run by the US and UK government agencies, were hijacked to mine cryptocurrency Monero, according to UK-based security researcher Scott Helme. The websites were infected through Browsealoud tool, made by software maker Texthelp, which reads out webpages for people with vision problems. Texthelp said it has disabled Browsealoud to investigate the hack.
