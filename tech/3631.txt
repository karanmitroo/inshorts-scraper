A new Japanese law that defines cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and others, as a legal payment method has come into force in Japan. According to the new law, all virtual currency exchanges are to be regulated by the Japanese Financial Services Agency. They must also be registered with the financial watchdog and must verify identities of customers opening accounts.
