US-based physician Dr. James Collins has developed a cooking device called MasterSous which can stir and regulate the cooking temperature of food using an app. The app allows users to set the cooking time, temperature and style of cooking like deep fry or saut√©. The device also has a dial to set the duration and cooking frequency of the food.
