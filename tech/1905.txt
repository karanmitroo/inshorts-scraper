Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a recent post said Trump's decision of scrapping the 'Dreamers' program is cruel. Adding the Dreamers "don't deserve to live in fear", Zuckerberg said, "It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it."
