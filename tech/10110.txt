Switzerland will soon have operational driverless public transport buses that can ferry nine passengers at a time. The buses will be launched in the canton of Valais and two more will be pressed into service in Sion early in 2016. The electric-powered autonomous buses were built by a collaboration of a public bus service PostBus and a Swiss startup BestMile.
