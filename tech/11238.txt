French cosmetics giant L’Oreal is partnering with bioprinting-startup Organovo, to develop a way to 3D-print skin to test their cosmetic products. L’Oreal currently grows skin from tissues in a process that utilizes tissues donated by plastic surgery patients which takes about a week to complete. It hopes to automate the process with Organovo's in-vitro methods, said VP of L'Oreal's Technology Incubator.
