Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has said it would repay owners $425 million of the money stolen in what is being considered the biggest cryptocurrency theft ever. The amount is nearly 90% of the $533 million (58 billion yen) worth of NEM coins lost in the attack. The announcement came less than 48 hours after the hack was discovered on Friday.
