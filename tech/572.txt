Google-owned video sharing platform YouTube will be rolling out new features including one which allows users to watch videos in incognito mode similar to Google Chrome. The 'Dark Theme' feature, which is already available for the desktop users, will tone down the screen's glare and experience. YouTube will also allow users to swipe to skip ads between videos.
