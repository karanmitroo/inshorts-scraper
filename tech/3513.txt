A public vending machine that dispenses free clean needles was recently unveiled in Las Vegas, US, in an attempt to reduce transmission of diseases among drug users. Users will reportedly have to register for the service and will be allowed to get up to two packs of needles weekly. The packages will also comprise disposing containers and addiction treatment pamphlets.
