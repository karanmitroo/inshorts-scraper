A US-based startup has developed a smart reverse osmosis water purifier 'WaterO', which displays purification levels and reminds the user to stay hydrated. Controlled through an app, the 3-litre capacity purifier does not need any plumbing for installation and lets the user select the amount of water to be dispensed. The app also alerts user for timely exchange of filters.
