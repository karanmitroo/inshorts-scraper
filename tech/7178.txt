Electronic cigarette company VMR Products has launched the VERTX Plus e-cigarette which features a touchscreen. Users can adjust both the heating element's voltage (3.5-4.5 V) and the device's LED indicators by swiping across its face. The $90 device features a 420 mAh lithium-ion battery and will offer three times as many puffs as other e-cigarettes per cartridge, the company claimed.
