In a bid to end the practice of manual scavenging, the Kerala government is procuring 50 robots which are developed to clean sewer holes. The robot, named 'Bandicoot', has been developed by Kerala-based startup 'Genrobotics'. The robot has four limbs along with a bucket system and can go into a sewer hole, identify the problem and clean sewer holes.
