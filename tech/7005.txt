The new iPhone which may be released next month, will reportedly have dual camera and no headphone jack. The dual camera will produce brighter and sharper images with better details in low light. The 'home' button will be reengineered into a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback via haptic vibrations. The new iPhone is expected to run on iOS 10.
