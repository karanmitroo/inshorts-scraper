IBM recently announced it would provide its technology and resources to help track the spread of Zika. It is collaborating with the New York-based Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to devise algorithms that can determine which primates are the virus carriers. It also runs the 'OpenZika project' for screening millions of chemical compounds to identify candidates to combat the virus.
