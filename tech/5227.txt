In one of the largest known federal hackings to date, the FBI hacked more than 8,000 computers in 120 countries on just one warrant during a child pornography investigation. The investigation also included hacking of a satellite provider. Further, the FBI ran 23 child porn websites on government servers this year in an attempt to catch potential paedophiles.
