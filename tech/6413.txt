Jim Beam whiskey has launched its own version of the Apple Watch at $17.99, which comes with a 44 ml pop-up shot glass. Calling the watch a 'drinkable wearable', the company claims it to be stylish, wearable and drinkable. However, unlike technology giant Apple's Watch, Jim Beam's watch doesn't have Wi-Fi, screen, fitness tracker or the ability to tell time.
