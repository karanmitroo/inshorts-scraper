A village named 'Xilinshui' in northern China has created a giant QR code made of trees, to boost local tourism. The village reportedly used 1,30,000 juniper trees to create the square code, which measures 227 metres (744 ft) on each side. On scanning, the QR code directs users to Xilinshui's official tourism page on China's messaging app, WeChat.
