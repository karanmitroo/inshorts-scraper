Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that it is hard to check 'objectionable content' on WhatsApp due to end-to-end encryption. The government can take action once the content is reported as it has laws in place, Prasad added. Facebook-owned chat app WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption only allows the sender and receiver to view the messages exchanged.
