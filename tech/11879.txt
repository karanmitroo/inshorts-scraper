Gmail has been blocked in China after six months of disruptions to the email service in the country that already blocks an array of Google services. An anti-censorship advocate has blamed the Great Firewall for this censorship. Reports said, many Gmail web addresses were cut off in the country on Friday and the service was still down on Monday.
