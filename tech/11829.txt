Twitter accounts of the New York Post and United Press International were briefly hacked on Friday. Hackers posted tweets with false economic and military news, which were later deleted. One tweet on UPI's feed read that the Pope said World War III had begun. Jenny Tartikoff, a spokeswoman for New York Post said that the hack is being investigated.
