China-based laptop maker Lenovo on Tuesday agreed to pay $3.5 million to settle allegations that it sold laptops with pre-loaded software that compromised users' security. The software was able to access users' personal information like Social Security numbers, according to the US trade regulator. Lenovo also agreed to get consumers' consent before installing such a software, the regulator added.
