In 1991, Nintendo published a game called 'Time Twist' exclusively in Japan featuring Adolf Hitler, Jesus, and white supremacy group Ku Klux Klan. The text-based game was set in historical locations and involved themes like religion, war, and racism. Video game promotion platform 'Hardcore Gaming 101' said, "[It's] like someone read Nintendo's censorship guidelines and...broke all of them".
