Researchers at the Harvard University have created a liquid battery that could last for more than 10 years and remain non-corrosive and non-toxic. A liquid battery is a battery that stores energy in liquid solutions. The researchers modified the battery's molecules in the electrolytes in a way that the battery only loses 1% of its capacity every 1,000 cycles.
