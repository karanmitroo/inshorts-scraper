Swedish car manufacturer Volvo on Friday announced it has acquired US-based car valet and concierge startup Luxe. The Swedish automaker, which also acquired Luxe's key staff including app developers, said the acquisition will provide advanced algorithms in areas such as arrival time prediction. Founded in 2013, Luxe lets users coordinate a driver to park, clean, and refuel their car.
