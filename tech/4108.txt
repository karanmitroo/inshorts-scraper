China has appointed 1.6 metre-tall self-driving robot police officers with electric riot control tool to patrol the streets. One of the robots appointed at a Chinese railway station can facially recognise the staff with their work passes. Besides fighting crime, the robots are also capable of monitoring air quality, temperature, and track potential safety hazards, fires, and criminal activities.
