A month after WannaCry attacked systems worldwide, a new ransomware called 'Petya' has hit computers in countries like Ukraine, Russia, India, and US. Petya differs from typical ransomware as it doesn't just encrypt files, it also overwrites and encrypts the information in hard disks. Petya has hit corporate networks hardest as it spreads quickly among computers connected on same networks.
