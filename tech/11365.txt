NASA's 'Messenger', the only spacecraft to orbit planet Mercury, Thursday ended its 4-yr tour as it crashed into the planet. The spacecraft plunged from orbit as planned and slammed into Mercury at about 8,750 mph (14,081 kph). Messenger, that started its tour in 2011, circled the planet 4,105 times and collected more than 277,000 images.
