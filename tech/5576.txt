The cost of repairing the Touch Bar or the multi-touch glass strip in the keyboard of Apple's newly-launched MacBook Pro laptops will cost over â‚¹13,000. This  is more expensive than getting a regular MacBook's keyboard repaired. The new MacBook Pros also have a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, positioned right next to the Touch Bar.
