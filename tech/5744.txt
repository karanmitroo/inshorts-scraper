Facebook on Friday updated its censorship guidelines, under which it will allow "newsworthy" graphic content including violence and nudity, which might otherwise "violate its standards". Facebook will work with journalists, photographers, and law enforcement officials to decide what to allow on its platform. This comes after criticism of Facebook's censorship of an iconic Vietnam War photo.
