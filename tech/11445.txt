Bengaluru's Chinnaswamy Stadium became the first sporting venue in the country to switch to solar power. A 400 kV rooftop solar power installation shall fulfill a significant portion of power consumed by the facility but won't be used to fuel the floodlights. Another 850 kV solar photo-voltaic panels would now be installed atop the western stands in the second phase.
