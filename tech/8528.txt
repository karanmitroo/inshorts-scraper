VideoStitch has launched Orah 4i, a tiny 4K virtual reality (VR) camera that supports live streaming, enabling users to produce full 360Â° videos in real-time. It aims for users to capture and directly broadcast videos on platforms like YouTube and Facebook. Generally, VR cameras require users to take out memory cards and do postproduction work to stitch spherical videos together.
