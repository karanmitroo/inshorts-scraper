Students from IIT-Indore and IIT-Madras have created two underwater robots respectively that have caught the attention of the Defence Research and Development Organisation. Mimicking movements of a fish and a turtle respectively, the robots can probe underwater conditions, be used for surveillance purposes, control the orientation of missiles, and resist undercurrents without harming aquatic life.
