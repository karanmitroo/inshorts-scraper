A five-year-old girl in England accidentally placed an Amazon order for a £107 (₹9,200) diamond necklace and 12 Disney toys worth £287 (₹24,600) through voice recognition technology without her parents' knowledge. The matter came to light when the necklace was delivered, and her mother checked her order history. She contacted Amazon, following which the orders were cancelled and money refunded.
