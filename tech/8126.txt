Sentient Science, a NASA spinoff,Â has developed a software tool that predicts machine failures by 'cloning' their parts. Called DigitalClone, it uses an understanding of the physics of a given part, such as friction and wear, to determine when it is likely to break. This enables replacement of parts before machines like helicopters and telescopes break down, thus extending their lifespan.
