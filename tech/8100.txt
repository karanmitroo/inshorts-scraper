A 30-member team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on Saturday unveiled the prototype of a high-speed Hyperloop pod meant to carry passengers through vacuum tubes at 1280km/h. The pod, currently a third of the size of the actual pod, is propelled by magnets that will levitate it off tracks. However, the pod's current version can reach 402km/h.
