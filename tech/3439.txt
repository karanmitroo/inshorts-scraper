Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2015 threatened to remove Uber from App Store after learning Uber was secretly identifying iPhones even when the app was deleted from the phone, according to The New York Times. Uber had managed to hide this activity from employees at Apple headquarters. Cook held a meeting with Uber CEO after which Uber ended the practice.
