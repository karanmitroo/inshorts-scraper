E-commerce major Flipkart on Wednesday announced the launch of 'Image search' feature on its mobile app, designed for its fashion category. The added feature provides a way to find similar products on Flipkart as well as reduces the search time. It is still in beta testing stage, and will be rolled out to users via an app upgrade.
