Yahoo had rejected an offer to buy Google for $5 billion in 2002, when the then CEO Terry Semel refused the deal after months of negotiation. Yahoo initially made a $3 billion offer, but walked out after Google made a counter-offer of $5 billion. After Google's reorganisation, parent company Alphabet's valuation is about $730 billion while Yahoo's is $35 billion.
