Researchers at Netherlands' Eindhoven University of Technology have started manufacturing parts for a cycling bridge using 3D-printed reinforced concrete. The team initially built a 1:2 scale model that was able to hold a weight of 2,000 kg. The bridge will reportedly offer higher stability as steel reinforcement cables can be printed along with the concrete parts, leading to 'pre-stressed' parts.
