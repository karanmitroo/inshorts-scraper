US Navy on Friday demonstrated the interiors of Zumwalt destroyer, reportedly the most expensive warship ever built for the navy at over $4.4 billion. The 186-metre-long ship is equipped with stealth features and a gun system that can launch 600 rocket-powered projectiles at targets more than 110 kilometres away. It is named after World War II hero Admiral Elmo Zumwalt.
