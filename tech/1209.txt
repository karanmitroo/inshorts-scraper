Technology giant Google has started rolling out an update for its Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones including new Saturated colour mode. This comes after users reported Pixel 2 XL's screens turning grey, suggesting burn-in. The update also includes a fix for the faint clicking noise heard in some Pixel 2 phones, the company said.
