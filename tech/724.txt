Former female Google employee Heidi Lamar has filed a complaint against the company, accusing it of paying female teachers lower salaries compared to their male counterparts working for its Children's centre. Google employed nearly 147 women and three men as teachers but two of those men were paid higher than nearly all of the women, she said.
