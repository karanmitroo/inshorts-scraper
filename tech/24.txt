Google has sold its restaurant review service Zagat, which it had bought for a reported amount of $151 million, to the US-based restaurant discovery platform The Infatuation for an undisclosed amount. However, Zagat and The Infatuation will operate as two distinct brands, with individual platforms, and distinct purposes, the company added. Zagat was acquired by Google in 2011.
