US-based oral care startup Kolibree has unveiled a smart toothbrush that uses augmented reality to educate kids to better brush their teeth. The app-connected toothbrush shows the areas to brush in real-time on the smartphone and lets children play games while brushing. The toothbrush was unveiled at CES 2018 and also enables parents to monitor their child's brushing habits.
