Search giant Google has been sued by 3 female ex-employees alleging gender pay gap. Google "continues to discriminate against its female employees by systematically paying them lower compensation" than male employees who perform "substantially similar work under similar working conditions," the lawsuit read. However, denying the allegations Google said it has systems to ensure they pay fairly.
