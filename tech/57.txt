Ex-Google employee, Loretta Lee, has sued the company alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination, claiming she was subjected to "lewd comments, pranks and even physical violence" on a daily basis. She claims her male co-workers spiked her drinks, sent sexually suggestive messages and, in one case, slapped her. She further claimed the company took no action after filing a complaint.
