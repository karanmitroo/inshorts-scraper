A Nokia brand photographer on Tuesday accidentally shared a clip of the company's upcoming smartphones on the video platform Vimeo. The 30-second clip, which was later taken down, showed the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 with two other devices. One of the devices, expected to be the company's latest flagship 'Nokia 9', showed a dual-camera setup.
