The website AnandTech, which tracks hardware trends, reported that Samsung has been caught boosting the score of Exynos Octa, the processor used in Galaxy S4 (sold in India), to make it appear faster than the processors made by other companies. As per AnandTech, S4 identifies some benchmarks and artificially boosts the processor-speed accordingly, thereby creating the illusion of performing faster.
