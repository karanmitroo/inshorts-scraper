US-based company Das Keyboard has launched internet-connected 5Q keyboard that lets users assign colours to certain keys to indicate when they get notifications. The keys can be set to notify users of online deals, important emails, or sports updates. The flashing speed of colours can also be made to increase as a deadline for a task approaches.
