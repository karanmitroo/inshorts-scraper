Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank on Wednesday revealed its plans to start a phone store staffed mainly by ‘Peppers’, its humanoid robot. The store will reportedly be run by five or six Pepper robots, demonstrating and helping customers choose phones to purchase. Launched in June 2015, Pepper is capable of recognising and responding to human emotions and remembering faces.
