Microsoft has launched its Selfie app on iOS that lets users edit selfies with the help of features like noise reduction and colour balance. The app supports 13 photo filters and also allows users to compare the edited image with the original one. It "takes age, gender, skin tone, lighting, and many variables into account" and “applies different models automatically”.
