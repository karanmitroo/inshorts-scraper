Technology industry news publisher TechCrunch on Thursday in a report titled 'Google isn't safe from Yahoo's fate' said that Google is on the wrong side of major trends in the digital advertising industry. "It’s not clear if Google’s advertising business will sustain its dominance," it said, adding that its competitor, Facebook, is on the right side of all these trends.
