A 55-year-old British woman, Diane Hill has created a set of emojis called 'Emoldjis' to represent the elderly generation. The emojis depict memory pills, false teeth, backache, glasses, and family among other elderly people-related things. The woman has sent off the emojis for official approval from the Unicode Consortium, which regulates emoji updates.
