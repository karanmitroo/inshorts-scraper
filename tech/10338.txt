Flipkart has reportedly launched a grocery delivery mobile application, Flipkart Nearby, on Google Play Store in select neighborhoods of Bengaluru. The application claims to let users order groceries at any given time and delivers them between 10 am and 8 pm. The service, currently available on Android, only accepts cash on delivery as a form of payment.
