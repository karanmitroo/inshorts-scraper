Silk Labs, a startup co-founded by a former Mozilla CTO has developed a smart home sensor 'Sense', that can learn a user's behaviour and pattern. It uses facial recognition to identify whoâ€™s entering the house, then turn on lights, set the thermostat to the desired temperature and play music. Sense can distinguish between people and keeps a tab on pets.
