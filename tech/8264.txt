Beijing-based startup Zero Zero Robotics has developed Hover Camera, a foldable drone that automatically follows its owner via face tracking technology. The drone features a 13 MP main camera that can capture 4K videos, and another downward-facing 3 MP camera. Its four propellers are fully enclosed by a carbon fiber frame, reportedly making it a safer drone.
