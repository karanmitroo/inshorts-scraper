Intel warned some customers, including several Chinese technology firms, about security flaws within its processor chips before informing the US government, the Wall Street Journal has reported. China's Alibaba was reportedly among the firms notified of the flaw early on. An Intel spokesperson said the company wasn't able to tell everyone because the news was made public earlier than expected.
