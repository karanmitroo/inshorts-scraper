The latest update of Google's Android keyboard Gboard will now allow the users to draw the emoji they wish to send across. "In the emoji search box, you can now tap the emoji handwriting icon to draw emoji directly onto the screen. Your drawing will automatically be recognised and show results for your favourite emoji," Google said in a blogpost.
