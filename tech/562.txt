Google-owned video sharing platform YouTube has announced that it will require creators to have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of annual viewing time to monetise their videos. This comes after YouTuber Logan Paul published a video showing dead body of a suicide victim. The new eligibility policy for all existing channels will be effective from February 20.
