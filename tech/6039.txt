Jeff Bezos' aerospace company Blue Origin successfully completed its rocket's in-flight escape system test. While the crew capsule was safely recovered during the test, the New Shepard rocket unexpectedly remained intact and returned to the Earth. Prior to the launch, Bezos had expected the rocket to be destroyed during the test. This marks the rocket's fifth successful return to Earth.
