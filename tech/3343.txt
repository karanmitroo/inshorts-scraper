Microsoft executive and mixed reality headset HoloLens' inventor Alex Kipman in a recent interview said, "The phone is already dead... People just haven't realised." Kipman believes that a HoloLens-like mixed reality device will replace the phone. Technology major Apple, as well as $4.5 billion startup Magic Leap, are reportedly working on similar headsets.
