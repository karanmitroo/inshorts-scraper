South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung has announced that the replacement stock of the Galaxy Note 7 devices will be marked with a blue 'S' on the box to distinguish them from the devices with faulty batteries. The barcode label will also have a small black square. The new Galaxy Note 7 phones will be available starting September 21 in Australia.
