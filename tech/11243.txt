The video-calling feature of Facebook's Messenger app is now available globally, the company announced Tuesday. It was initially rolled out in April-end in select markets. Currently available only on Android and iOS, the feature uses WiFi or Data connection to make the video call. Users can call a friend even if both of them are not on the same platform.
