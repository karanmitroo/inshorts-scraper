According to Google’s new VR job postings, the company is planning to build “multiple” consumer VR hardware devices. Currently, Google’s VR offerings only include the Google Cardboard, a fold-out cardboard mount for smartphones that lets users experience rudimentary virtual reality. Notably, only last week Google announced a dedicated Virtual Reality unit with Clay Bavor as its Vice President.
