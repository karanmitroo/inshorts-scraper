Social media giant Facebook was fined $1.4 million by Spain for breaking the country's privacy laws on Monday. Spain's data protection authority alleged Facebook used personal data of users for advertising purposes. The authority added, Facebook collected the data without informing users how information would be used and also noted it didn't delete the data that was no longer useful.
