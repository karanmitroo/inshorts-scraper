Messaging service WhatsApp was down for 45 minutes and kept crashing repeatedly on Thursday as thousands exchanged greetings on New Year's Eve. The application raised error messages saying there is no working internet connection despite the users' Mobile and WiFi connection. According to reports, the Facebook-owned messaging service has around 900 million users across the globe.
