Former Twitter and Medium executive Jason Stirman recently launched his new app called Lucid, available on the Apple App Store for free. The app offers advice and meditation training from sports coaches who have trained sportspersons like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. For the app, Stirman and his team have raised $1.5 million in seed funding so far.
