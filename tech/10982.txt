Apple Music is set to go live on Tuesday but the users will reportedly have to go for a manual updation to listen to the broadcast, as the launch coincides with the upgradation of Apple's operating system to iOS 8.4. Apple Music will be free for the first three months and will thereafter be charged $9.99/month.
