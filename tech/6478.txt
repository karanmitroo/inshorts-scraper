Seattle-based startup Sewbo has developed a robotic arm that it claims is the first robot that can sew an entire article of clothing. The robot uses a non-toxic polymer to stiffen fabric to make it resemble cardboard, and the pre-cut pieces are fed into a sewing machine. The polymer stiffener is later removed by dropping the fabric in hot water.
