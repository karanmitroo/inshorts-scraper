Facebook Tuesday said that the outages suffered by the social networking site and its   photo-sharing site Instagram, was due to an internal software networking error, and not hacking. "This was not the result of a third-party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems," Facebook said in a statement.
