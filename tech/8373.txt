A US-based startup has developed 'Balluga', a $1,199 smart bed that lets users have a good sleep by setting ideal temperature, adjusting firmness and providing a massage. Controlled through an app, the bed uses movement sensors to automatically light up during the night to provide visibility to the user. It also comes with anti-snoring system and 10 years of warranty.
