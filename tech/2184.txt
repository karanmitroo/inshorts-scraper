Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday tweeted about the risks of artificial intelligence. "Everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too," he tweeted. In March, Musk launched an artificial intelligence startup Neuralink, which is developing devices that can be implanted in human brains to keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence.
