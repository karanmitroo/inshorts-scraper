Facebook on Sunday said, "There is no room for content that promotes violence, direct threats, terrorist or hate speeches on our platform,'' adding, ''We work regularly with safety organisations and policymakers worldwide, including Israel, to ensure people know how to make safe use of Facebook." An Israeli minister earlier accused Facebook of not doing enough to prevent incitement against Israel.
