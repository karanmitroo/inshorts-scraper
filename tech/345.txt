University of Copenhagen researchers have printed medicinal drugs in QR-coded patterns onto an edible material. The production can be tailored to fit each patient and can protect against wrong or fake medication, according to the researchers. The QR code enables storage of data in the "pill" itself and patients can read about the pharmaceutical product by doing a quick scan.
