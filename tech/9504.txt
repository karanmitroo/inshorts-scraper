Netflix is taking steps to evolve its proxy detection system and restrict access for people who trick the website into providing them with unavailable content. Senior executive David Fullagar said, “[I]n coming weeks, those using proxies and unblockers will only be able to access" content available in their countries. Further, Netflix is “making progress in licensing content across the world".
