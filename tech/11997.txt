Scientists have developed a machine that can sniff out tiny amounts of toxic gases - for example, a whiff of nerve gas or a hint of a chemical spill from up to 1km. The machine is built with technology that uses a form of invisible light, which is more sensitive than current sensors and even works below normal atmospheric pressure.
