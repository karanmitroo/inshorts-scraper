Twitter has launched a new 'while you were away' service which recaps important tweets users may have missed since their last login. The feature works like Facebook's news feed that presents status updates and posts in a ranked manner. The feature will help preserve important tweets that could get missed by the rapid flow of tweets on a daily basis.
