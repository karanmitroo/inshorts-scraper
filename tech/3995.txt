High-speed transportation technology startup Hyperloop One has said India is among the countries that have the highest potential in the world. "We can go into a city without disturbing the city. We can go underground and no need for government to buy land," said CEO Rob Lloyd. "We're looking at both intercity and intra-city transportation concept for India," he added.
