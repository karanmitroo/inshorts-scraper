Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned in court on Tuesday regarding a case where video game company ZeniMax has sued Facebook-owned VR firm Oculus for stealing its technology. Zuckerberg defended Oculus, saying, "I've never even heard of ZeniMax before". ZeniMax has accused Oculus Co-founder of creating a "false and fanciful" story that he built the technology in his parents' garage.
