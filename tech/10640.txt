Cloud service provider Akamai Technologies has finally won an almost decade-long patent infringement fight with Limelight Networks over ways to store and deliver video content. Ten judges of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit voted unanimously that Limelight had infringed an Akamai patent. The decision made on Thursday effectively revives a $45.5 million infringement verdict.
