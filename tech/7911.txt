Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft have committed to a European Commission code of conduct to tackle illegal online hate speeches. Dedicated teams in the companies will review and remove potentially offensive content in under 24 hours. In addition to the new guidelines, the companies will share their methods with other such companies not signed up to the code of conduct.
