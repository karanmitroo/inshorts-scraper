US-based computer manufacturer Maingear has built a Coca-Cola themed gaming PC with a real glass Coke bottle being used as a reservoir at the top. The two companies collaborated for marketing purposes and the device will not be available for sale. "Coke is a simple pleasure..and everyday gaming moments go better with a refreshing ice-cold Coke," said a Coca-Cola executive.
