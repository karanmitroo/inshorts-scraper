The upcoming model of Nissan's Pathfinder will include sensors that honk if kids or other belongings are left behind in the car. The sensor Rear Door Alert detects when the rear door is opened before a trip, and if the driver neglects to open it later, the horn will beep several times. The model is set to release in 2018.
