Education technology company Coursera's Co-founder and President Daphne Koller recently said in an interview, "Your old college diploma isnâ€™t good enough for the 21st century economy." Koller added, "The things you learned in college 15 years ago are no longer the skills needed for your next job." She also said that old-fashioned college lectures are going to get extinct.
