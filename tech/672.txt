During the introduction of the first iPhone, the then Apple CEO Steve Jobs made a public prank call ordering "4,000 lattes to go" from a nearby Starbucks. The call, which Jobs made while demonstrating the working of Google Maps, was also the first ever phone call made on an iPhone. Notably, the first iPhone was unveiled on January 9, 2007.
