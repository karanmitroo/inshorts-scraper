In an interview, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki suggested Facebook "should get back to baby pictures and sharing". On being asked if YouTube worries about Facebook as a competing video platform, Wojcicki said, "you always have to take your competitors seriously, but you don't win by looking backwards and around". Wojcicki added Facebook should do what is best for its business.
