New York-based startup Pressto has launched 'Being', a mobile app that allows users to view Instagram from another person’s eyes. Users can browse the photo-sharing service as it would be seen by a friend or any celebrity given that they have public accounts. The app offers several categories including celebrities, artists, athletes and techies, and lets users track which accounts are trending.
