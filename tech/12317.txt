Blackberry launched its square-screened smartphone, the Passport, on Wednesday. The smartphone has a large touchscreen and a slimmed version of the company's well-known keyboard, on which users can type to enter text, or swipe lightly. The phone is now on sale in some markets, with a suggested retail price of $629 in Canada and $599 in the United States.
