Some users of Google's Huawei-made Nexus 6P smartphones have complained of "battery failure" after installing the Android 7.0 Nougat update on their phones. A user posted a YouTube video demonstrating how his phone shutdown while at 53% battery and could only be switched on after plugging a power cable. Google had started rolling out Android 7.0 update in August.
