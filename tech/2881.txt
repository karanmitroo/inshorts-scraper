French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday launched 'French Tech Visa', a fast-track four-year residence permit for entrepreneurs and their families. Talking about the need to reduce regulation and become a "country of unicorns", Macron said, "We want the pioneers, the innovators, the entrepreneurs of the world to come to France and work with us on all possible innovation."
