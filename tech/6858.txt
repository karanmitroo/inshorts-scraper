Google on Thursday announced its plans to open a 14,000-square-foot space for startups and developers in San Francisco this September. The space will host events like developer meet-ups, Codelabs, and Tech Talks. The third class of Launchpad Accelerator, Google's program under which it provides startups with resources and up to $50,000 in equity-free funding, will also be held there.
