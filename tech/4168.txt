BBC presenter Nick Robinson during a radio show on Thursday morning announced that Santa Claus isn't real, but later tweeted an apology for the "fake news". Robinson said, "It's like learning Father Christmas isn't real for the first time, isn't it?" during the live broadcast. Robinson's apology came after Twitter users pointed out that even children listen to his show.
