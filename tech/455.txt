Apple on Wednesday said it will release new battery features for iPhones after it faced criticism for slowing down older iPhones. The update would display the condition of the phone's battery and recommend if it needs to be serviced. Users would also be able to see whether the feature preventing unexpected shutdowns is on and can turn it off.
