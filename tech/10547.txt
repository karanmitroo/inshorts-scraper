Amid the controversy surrounding the issue of renaming Delhi's Aurangzeb Road to APJ Abdul Kalam Road, search giant Google has already changed the street's name in its web mapping service. Furthermore, Wikipedia has also joined Google in renaming the street. Notably, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had announced on Friday that the road will be renamed to honour the former president.
