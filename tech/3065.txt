Russia's largest bank Sberbank is planning to deliver cash via drones, its Deputy Chairman Stanislav Kuznetsov has said. "We can use it for other kinds of deliveries too, and not just for the delivery of cash," he added. The cash delivered through the drones would come with certain security features like permanent ink taint to catch the thieves red-handed.
