General Motors-owned car-sharing platform Maven started operations on Friday in San Francisco. The service rents out GM vehicles, including the Chevrolet Volt hybrid electric vehicle and the Cadillac Escalade SUV, with prices starting at $8 per hour. Cars can be booked and unlocked via an app, and have to be returned at the same spot.
