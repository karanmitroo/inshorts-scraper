A 3D printer machine, Foodini, that can print out edible dishes, will be made available in the market by mid-2015. The machine uses the same technology as a 3D printer, and deploys edible ingredients squeezed out of stainless steel capsules instead of plastics. Priced at $1000, Foodini can print a wide range of dishes, from sweet to savory.
