A Japanese firm has co-developed 'T-Frend' drones that would track overworking employees in order to combat the overwork culture in the country. The drones would hover over employees and blare music to force them to go home. Long working hours have been blamed for dozens of deaths in Japan due to strokes, heart attacks, and suicides.
