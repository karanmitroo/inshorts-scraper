London's Southbank Centre is currently hosting a 'Virtual Reality Orchestra' that simulates an orchestral experience via virtual reality headsets. Visitors can experience the London Philharmonia Orchestra 'sitting amidst' performers as they perform Sibelius' Fifth Symphony in the Royal Festival Hall. "We wanted... people to get an insight of the dynamics," Philharmonia Orchestra said.
