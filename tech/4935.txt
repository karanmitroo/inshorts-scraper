French aircraft and jet manufacturer Airbus has revealed a concept for commercial planes with swappable modules called 'A3 Transpose'. Planes could be installed with different changeable sections like gyms, coffee shops or kid-safe play areas, making existing ones more flexible. Interestingly, Airbus had earned a patent for completely detachable cabins last year.
