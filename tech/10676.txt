Google has scrapped its plans to use Puerto Rico as the initial test market for its modular smartphone initiative, Project Ara. However, the company intends to continue to develop the program, it announced over Twitter on Friday. The smartphone will reportedly let the user swap out every important hardware component, enabling him to essentially build his own device.
