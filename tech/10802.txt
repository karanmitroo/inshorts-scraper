Facebook has introduced a new feature wherein users can wish their friends on their birthday by just typing the numeral 1. Facebook will notify users through text about the birthdays of people on their list. Users can simply reply ‘1’ to post a generic ‘Happy Birthday’ message. Users will have to switch on 'Facebook Texts' functionality to activate the feature.
