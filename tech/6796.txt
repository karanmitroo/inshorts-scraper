Of the reported eight private jets owned by Google Co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, one is a used 180-seater Boeing 767-200 airliner. The plane, called 'Google Jet', is almost 70% longer and over thrice as heavy as conventional executive jets. Brin, who turned 43Â on Sunday, reportedly argued with Page over having a "California king-sized" bed aboard the plane.
