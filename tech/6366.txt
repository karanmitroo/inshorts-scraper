Apple fan Ayano Tominaga bought a body pillow bearing Steve Jobs' picture to a camp outside an Apple store in Tokyo. Tominaga had been sleeping outside the store with the pillow for two days, waiting to buy the iPhone 7. She also bought the pillow during iPhone 6 launch in 2014, where she spent nine days outside the store.
