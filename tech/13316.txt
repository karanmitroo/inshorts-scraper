On Wednesday Google introduced the Chromecast, an HDMI 2-inch dongle that communicates with video and audio apps - including YouTube, Netflix and Pandora - running on Android or iOS, and wirelessly transfers that content to big screen TV. Chromecast will sell for $35 at Google Play store in the US and will include three free months of Netflix for a limited time.
