Social networking giant, Facebook Friday said that it has stepped up battle against spammers who promise to deliver "likes" to its members, and warned users on using such scams. It has obtained legal judgments of nearly $2 billion against fraudulent activities on Facebook. The move appears to counter concerns that users are buying "likes" to make them appear more popular.
