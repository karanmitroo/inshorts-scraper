Elon Musk-led SpaceX has built a 1.5-km long vacuum tube close to its headquarters in California for a Hyperloop pod competition between 30 teams from across the world. Musk announced his plan for Hyperloop, a futuristic transport system with speeds of over 1125 kmph, in 2013. Most teams are based out of universities including MIT's Hyperloop and Berkeley University's Bloop.
