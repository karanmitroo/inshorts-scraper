Harvard researchers have developed a â‚¹290 device that lets men check their fertility at home with their smartphone. It includes a disposable microfluidic chip with a tiny tube for sperm sample, which is put on the back of the phone, where a dedicated app analyses it using the phone's camera. The device takes less than five seconds to complete test.
