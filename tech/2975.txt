Several shipping firms in Japan have come together to develop remote-controlled cargo vessels that could be launched by 2025, according to reports. The ships would use the internet of things to gather data, including weather conditions and shipping information. The project is aimed to reduce the number of accidents at sea by removing the potential for human error.
