On being asked if he missed Steve Jobs, Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak said, "Extremely. The days I miss the most are the...five years before Apple started." He also said they used to experiment with technology and devices that Wozniak built. "I designed a computer, but Jobs...made it into a product...told the world why they needed a computer," he added.
