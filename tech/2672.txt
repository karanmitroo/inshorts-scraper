ATMs in Macau casinos have installed software which requires customers who make a withdrawal to stare into a camera for six seconds so a facial recognition software can verify them against their identity card. The system will help detect money launderers who withdraw significant amounts for chips, gamble very little, and then cash out to move the remainder.
