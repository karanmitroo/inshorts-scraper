Union HRD Minster Smriti Irani has launched a web portal to simplify the process of registration and allotment of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs). ISBN is a unique 13-digit number used to identify books, displayed in bar-code format. Publishing houses and authors can now procure ISBNs within a week, where earlier the process used to take a few months.
