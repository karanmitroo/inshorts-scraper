Tim Peake on Friday became the first "official" British astronaut to carry out a spacewalk after stepping outside NASA's International Space Station's Quest airlock. The planned six-and-a-half hours walk was, however, cut short after Peake's colleague Tim Kopra reported a "small amount" of water in his helmet. The astronauts had been outside the space station for four hours.
