Shares of tech giant IBM dropped on Friday by around 2.7%, wiping $3.8 billion (over â‚¹24,400 crore) from its market capitalisation. This came after billionaire Warren Buffett announced his Berkshire Hathaway, IBM's largest shareholder, has shed a third of its stake in the company. "I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago," Buffett said.
