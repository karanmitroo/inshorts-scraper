Three students from Ukraine have made a portrait of Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs using keys from computer keyboards. The students from a private IT academy spent around three months disassembling about 100 keyboards to make a replica of Jobs' face. The artwork, which includes the words 'Apple', 'Steve Jobs' and 'iPhone' currently hangs in a classroom at the academy.
