In a first, Harvard scientists have encoded a small movie clip in the DNA of living bacterial cells and then played it back. They used the CRISPR gene-editing technique to encode and retrieve reconstructed frames of a classic 1870s racehorse in motion sequence of photos. "We want to turn cells into historians," said researchers, who aim to develop "molecular recorders".
