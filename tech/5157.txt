Netherlands-based startup Wolk has developed an airbag to prevent hip fractures in the elderly caused by falling. The airbag, which is to be worn as a belt, uses algorithms and sensors to detect when the user is about to fall and automatically inflates. The airbag can then be reused by fitting it with a new inflator.
