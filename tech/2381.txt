A website called 'tenyearsago.io' allows users to see what specific web pages looked like on a particular day ten years ago. While the designs of the pages have changed, the content remains largely the same. For example, the White House web page a decade ago showed George W Bush, while Apple's website introduced the iPhone for the first time.
