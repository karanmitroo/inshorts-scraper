A group of hackers posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online on Monday and demanded a multimillion-dollar ransom in Bitcoin to prevent the release of television shows, including 'Game of Thrones' (GoT). Draft scripts of GoT episodes were reportedly stolen. The hackers demanded their "6-month salary", which would amount to at least $6 million as per their claims.
