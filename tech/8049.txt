A 2012 LinkedIn hack, thought to have exposed 6.5 million passwords, has impacted over 117 million accounts, LinkedIn said on Wednesday. Someone going by the name "Peace" is selling those stolen username-password combos on the dark web for around $2,300, according to the online magazine Motherboard. Linkedin said that it has reset passwords for all accounts believed to be compromised.
