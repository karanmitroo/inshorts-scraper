Over 2,500 students from Sias International College in China have set a record for forming the world's largest 'human' QR code. The students used white and peach-coloured umbrellas to form the variation and coded pattern of 51-metre-long and 51-metre-wide figure. The code was successfully scanned and $150,000 bonus was received from the event's collaborator, Didi Express.
