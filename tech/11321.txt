Ashutosh Tiwari and Yogesh Dubey, 25-yr-old engineers from Mumbai, have set up a website- superpandit.com- that enables booking of pandits online for ceremonies. The start-up is being mentored by Mumbai-based innovations firm Lemon Ideas. The service is currently available only in four cities- Mumbai, Nashik, Nagpur and Varanasi. However, there are plans to expand it.
