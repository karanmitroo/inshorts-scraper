American internet media company BuzzFeed has apologised after being sued by Russian tech executive Aleksej Gubarev for including his name in an unverified dossier on US President Donald Trump. The 35-page dossier claims Gubarev used "porn traffic to plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against Democratic Party leadership." BuzzFeed has blacked out his name from the document.
