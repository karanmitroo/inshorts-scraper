Flipkart announced on Monday that it will be rolling back its in-app chat 'Ping' and image search feature from June 25. Both these features had been released less than a year ago by the company's former Chief Product Officer Punit Soni. However, it will continue to support the 'visually similar' feature and is working on a direct user-seller chat.
