Symbolics, a Massachusetts-based computer manufacturer (now defunct), had registered the first domain of ‘symbolics.com’ on March 15, 1985. This was before the invention of the World Wide Web, when the internet was mostly used as a military and an academic tool. However, the first ever domain name to be created was 'Nordu.net'.
