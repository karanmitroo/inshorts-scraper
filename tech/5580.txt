US retail giant Walmart has accidentally put Google's voice-based smart home assistant 'Google Home' on its shelves, a week earlier than its official launch date of November 4. While many other retailers have the device in stock, none have put it on shelves yet. Priced at $129 (nearly â‚¹8,600), Google Home can play music, manage house tasks and answer queries.
