A team of scientists from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and Stanford University in US, have developed a new method for creating elastic high-capacity batteries from wood pulp. Using nanocellulose from tree fibres, they produced a 3D-battery material that can withstand shock and stress. "A 3D-structure enables storage of significantly more power in less space," a researcher revealed.
