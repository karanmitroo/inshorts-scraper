A Chicago-based woman who was at a cafe which was attacked during the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks is suing Twitter, Facebook, and Google, alleging that they helped the growth of ISIS by giving it social media access. At least 130 people were killed in the ISIS-claimed attacks which happened at cafes, a national stadium, and a concert hall.
