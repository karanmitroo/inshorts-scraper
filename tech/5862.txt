The music video for Australian alternative rock singer Dan Sultan's latest single 'Magnetic', features a stop-motion film of a 3D printed bust of him. Since he "couldn't be around" to be filmed for the project, the studio decided to use a 3D scan of his head. The video required 60 3D printed parts, 2,700 images and two months to complete.
