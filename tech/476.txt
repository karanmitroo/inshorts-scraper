Photo-sharing app Snapchat's Vice President of Product Tom Conrad will quit the company in March, Conrad has confirmed. "It's time for me to put my energy outside of tech, into music, food, photography and things closer to art," Conrad said. He joined Snapchat in 2016 and will reportedly be replaced by Snap's Director of Growth, Jacob Andreou.
