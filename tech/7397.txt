YouTube on Wednesday reported that its Content ID tool generated over $2 billion for copyright owners since 2007 and around $1 billion in 2015. Content ID tool lets copyright owners "claim" videos that users upload to get part of the ad revenue. This came after several celebrities, including Taylor Swift, called for better copyright infringement protections and revenue for artists.
