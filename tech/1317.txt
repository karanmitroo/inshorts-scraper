Twitter has banned US President Donald Trump's advisor Roger Stone for threatening CNN anchors on the social media platform. Stone's tweets came after CNN published a report that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had filed his first indictments in the Russia investigation. In one of the tweets, Stone insisted that CNN anchor Don Lemon should be "confronted, humiliated, mocked and punished."
