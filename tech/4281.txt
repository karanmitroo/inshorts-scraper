Photo-sharing app Pinterest has launched 'Lens', a tool that lets users point their phone's camera at objects like shoes to search for similar products on the platform. It can be used on items like tables to find similar designs and other furniture from the same era. Another use for 'Lens' includes getting recipe suggestions by pointing the camera at vegetables.
