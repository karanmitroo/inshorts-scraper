In worldâ€™s first commercial attempt to replace humans with machines, flying robotic waiters, called Infinium-Serve, will be launched in a Singapore restaurant chain by the end of 2015. They will be first launched at Timbre Group's five outlets in Singapore. The project is estimated to cost a "low seven-figure sum" for the five outlets, Infinium Robotics CEO Woon Junyang said.
