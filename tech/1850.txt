South Korean electronics giant Samsung on Tuesday said it aims to launch a foldable smartphone next year under its Galaxy Note brand. Samsung has been planning such a smartphone since 2013 when the company first showcased its flexible display prototype called Youm. The announcement comes just hours before Apple is reportedly said to announce its 10th-anniversary iPhone models.
