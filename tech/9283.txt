US startup Violettas has created app-controlled LED shoes 'Sync Footwear', that changes colours and syncs the lights to live music. It consists of a circuit board, lights and rechargeable batteries hidden in the sole. Through the app, users can customise the colour of their shoes and sync the music playlist in their phones with the shoes.
