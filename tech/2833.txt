A US-based design firm has developed a smart Bluetooth-enabled coaster called 'Brio' that tracks motion and sends users a notification if someone moves or tampers with their drink while they aren't looking. The â‚¹2,500 coaster, which is meant to be carried by users to bars and parties, has 24 bright white LED lights that light up in different patterns.
