Sony on Monday unveiled a smart earbud called the Xperia Ear that allows users to access their phones without touching them. Powered by Sonyâ€™s voice technology, the Bluetooth-enabled device works like a virtual assistant and responds to voice commands. It offers water protection, an all-day battery life and will be available this summer in Graphite Black colour.
