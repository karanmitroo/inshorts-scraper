Instagram's CEO Kevin Systrom in a recent interview said that while the photo-sharing platform's 'Stories' feature is "definitely similar" to Snapchat, it hadn't been copied. Systrom added that Instagram was further building on the technology that Snapchat had created. The 'Stories' feature lets users share photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours.
