Bangkok police are investigating reports of two men posing as Thai air hostesses to scam 30 men into sending them money. One victim claims he sent over â‚¹28,000 to the 'air hostess' after she asked for a loan. A stewardess, whose photos were used by conmen, said she has been charged with fraud despite not being involved in the scam.
