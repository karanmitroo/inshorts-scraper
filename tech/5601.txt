Tesla Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk unveiled a solar roof made up of glass tiles on Friday. Made jointly with SolarCity, a solar company that Musk seeks to acquire, the tiles have been designed in four styles and cost less than conventional solar panels. It can also incorporate heating elements to clear the roof of snow and keep generating energy.
