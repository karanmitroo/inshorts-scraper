A Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Beijing, named Longquan, has developed a robot monk that can chant Buddhist mantras and move via voice command. Called Xian'er, the two-feet tall robot can hold a conversation by answering around 20 questions about Buddhism and daily life, and can also perform seven types of motions on its wheels.
