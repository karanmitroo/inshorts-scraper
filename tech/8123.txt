Italian startup Smart Micro-Optics has developed 'Blips', a $23 portable set of ultra-thin adhesive micro and macro lenses, which turns any smartphone or tablet into a microscope. While the micro lense provides high resolution micro images up to 4 microns, the macro lense provides 10 times optical magnification. Microscopic images are visible through a dedicated Android or iOS app.
