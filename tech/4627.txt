American software maker Adobe has created a concept of a software that would let users edit photos by using a voice-based digital assistant. A video shared by Adobe shows a user cropping, flipping and sharing an image to Facebook using voice commands. Adobe says the concept is the first step towards an interface that'll include search and editing tools together.
