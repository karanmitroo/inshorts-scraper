Japanese researchers have claimed to develop a glass that can heal its cracks when pressed by hand, without heating it. The properties of the 'polyether-thioureas' glass were discovered accidentally by an undergrad who was preparing the material as a glue. He found the polymer edges would adhere to form a strong sheet after being compressed for 30 seconds at 21Â°C.
