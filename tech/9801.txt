The US Department of Energy has developed a new two-dimensional crystalline allotrope of boron named Borophene, which could be stronger than Graphene, hardest material known to man. Boron, being a non-metallic semiconductor, was fused in its gaseous state with silver to form a single-atom layer resulting in a material with electrical conductivity supposedly higher than any other.
