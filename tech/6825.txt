In an IPO letter to its prospective investors, Google Co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin wrote, "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." The letter added, "We will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects because of short term earnings pressure." Google went public on August 19, 2004, raising $1.9 billion.
