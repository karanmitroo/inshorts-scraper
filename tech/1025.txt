Researchers at National University of Singapore have designed a drinking glass that pairs digital taste, scents and colour sensations to alter a drinker's perception of a beverage's flavour. Called Vocktail, it features three scent cartridges and micro air-pumps which release molecules for the purpose. Its rim has attached strips which send electric pulses to the tongue, stimulating taste buds.
