A Facebook bug on Friday caused the social network to briefly declare around two million people, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, dead on their profiles. Several users were greeted with a eulogy message when visiting the profiles of friends and family, while some found their own accounts memorialised. Facebook apologised for the mistaken posts and said it was a 'terrible error'.
