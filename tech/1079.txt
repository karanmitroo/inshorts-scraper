Instagram's Co-founder Mike Krieger has said the biggest issue the app faces is that it uses 'too much data" and "takes too much space". Krieger said the company thought if these two problems are solved, more people will try the platform. Krieger added he is also spending time with Instagram's engineering team to focus on optimising Instagram for data usage.
