Yahoo will stop letting consumers access its various online services by signing-in with their Facebook or Google credentials. The change, which will be rolled out gradually, will require users to register for a Yahoo ID in order to use any of its services. The company said the new process "will allow it to offer the best personalized experience to everyone".
