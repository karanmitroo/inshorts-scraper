A US judge has dismissed a lawsuit accusing Facebook of tracking users' internet activity after logging out, saying it was plaintiff's responsibility to keep browsing history private. The lawsuit claimed Facebook violates wiretapping laws by tracking users when they visit websites with its "like" button. However, the judge ruled that plaintiffs failed to show that this caused any "realistic" loss.
