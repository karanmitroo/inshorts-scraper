China-based smartphone maker Huawei trolled Apple's face recognition technology, used in the latest iPhone devices. In a Facebook post, it showed a clown emoji animation failing to unlock a smartphone, mocking Apple's Face ID technology which failed to recognise its software chief's face during iPhone X launch. The video ends with Huawei announcing it will unveil "#TheRealAIPhone" on October 16.
