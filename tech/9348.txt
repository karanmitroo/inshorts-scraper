Amazon has allowed a provider to offer monks on its website in Japan, who are usually needed to perform funerals and other rituals in the country. A basic plan, including a monk’s transportation and donation, costs 35,000 yen ($300). The service is listed under Amazon’s ‘Home and Kitchen’ section. However, this move is being opposed by Buddhist organizations in Japan.
