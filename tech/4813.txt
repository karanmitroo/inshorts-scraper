A US-based startup has created 'Juno', a â‚¹5,400 smart makeup mirror that senses the surroundings to provide perfect lighting for various occasions like indoors, office, and evening. The lighting can also be controlled through a dedicated app. The mirror, with 5-times zoom, also comes with special built-in light for selfies and can also serve as a reading lamp when required.
