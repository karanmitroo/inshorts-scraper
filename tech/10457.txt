NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has recently produced an image of the Messier 63 galaxy. Captured by Hubble’s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, it is nicknamed the Sunflower Galaxy because of its resemblance to the spiral of seeds at the centre of a sunflower. The galaxy is 27 million light years away from Earth.
