Bangalore-based startup Inito, founded by IIT alumni Aayush Rai and Varun AV, has developed a smartphone-based medical diagnostic which lets one find up to six fertility days every cycle by measuring fertility hormones in urine. The startup, which has raised about $1 million so far, has priced the device at ₹4,699, while an eight-pack fertility test strip costs ₹1,150.
