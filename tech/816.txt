US-based scientists have developed a technique for directly printing metal circuits to create stretchable electronics. Instead of ink, researchers used metal alloys having melting points of 60ÂºC. The circuit's conductivity was unaffected even after being bent 1,000 times and stretched to 70% of tensile strain. Further, in case of damage, the circuits could be "healed" by heating, said researchers.
