Canadian startup Spring Loaded Technology has launched a bionic knee brace called Levitation. Claimed to be the worldâ€™s first knee brace, it stores kinetic energy when a user bends their knee to give them extra support when they straighten their leg. Powered by a mechanical hinge, it is constructed from lightweight carbon fiber, and can also be worn under clothing.
