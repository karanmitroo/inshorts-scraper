Google on Thursday rolled out a feature that lets users play the games Tic-Tac-Toe and Solitaire directly from the Search page. Users can search for the games on the Google home page on desktops or through the Google App on smartphones. The games have different levels of difficulty, and Tic-Tac-Toe can also be played against a friend.
