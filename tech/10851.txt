NASA has released the new image of the sunlit side of planet Earth taken by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite from one million miles away. The picture, captured on July 6, is a combination of 3 different filtered images taken by the satellite's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). DSCOVR was launched in February to monitor solar winds.
