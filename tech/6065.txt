Japanese tech giant Panasonic has developed an interactive mirror which first scans a user's face and decides which areas require cosmetic help. The mirror then delivers the data to a makeup printer which releases a combination pad of foundation and concealer to be applied on the blemishes to fix them. The 'smart mirror' is currently in prototype phase.
