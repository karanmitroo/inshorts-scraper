The government has initiated the process for the public roll-out of new-age e-passports, which will make the document more secure and also substantially reduce the time required by the holder for immigration. An electronic chip, containing identidfication data, will be embedded in the passport's back cover. India has so far tested e-passport's success on only a few official passports.
