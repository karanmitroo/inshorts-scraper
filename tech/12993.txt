The father of modern computing, Alan Turing was granted a rare royal pardon Tuesday for a criminal conviction for homosexuality that led to his suicide. Sadly, he was chemically castrated with injections of female hormones for having sex with a man. Notably, only four royal pardons had been granted since 1945. Turing killed himself in 1954, aged 41, with cyanide.
