Researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China have unveiled 'Jia Jia', a new humanoid robot that can speak, show micro-expressions and move eyes and body. Programmed to recognise both human and machine interactions, the robot has autonomous navigation and offers services based on cloud technology. It took three years for the researchers to complete the robot.
