US-based startup EyeQue has built a ₹2,000 smart fitness tracker that lets users check their eyesight at home by connecting it to a smartphone. The cylindrical microscope uses the phone’s display and a set of lenses to measure the eyesight. On completing the checkup, the tracker provides users with an eyeglass number through a dedicated app.
