The Supreme Court has questioned tech giant Google whether it could "prevent" the uploading of obscene content like sexual violence videos online. The court asked Google about its in-house procedure to identify such content and how much can they do to prevent it. Google replied it cannot identify such content and that it needs to be reported.
