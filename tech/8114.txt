Apple has confirmed in a statement that an "extremely small" number of customers were having their music libraries disappear without their permission due to a bug in iTunes. This came after a designer named James Pinkstone blogged about his 122 GB of music files getting deleted. Apple said it will release an iTunes patch next week to fix the issue.
