Electric carmaker Tesla has reached an agreement with China, instead of India, to set up its first electric car factory outside the US. The announcement came after months of speculations that Tesla would make its cars in India. This deal will allow Tesla to avoid 25% duty China imposes on imported cars and have a larger customer base than India.
