Twitter on Tuesday allowed its users to retweet their own tweets and quote themselves by using the retweet button. Previously, users were allowed to only retweet tweets sent by other accounts. Twitter last month changed its 140-character limit and excluded @names in replies and media attachments like photos, GIFs, videos and polls from the character count.
