The latest version of Apple's operating software, iOS 10, which became available for download on Tuesday, allows users to uninstall 23 built-in apps including Mail, Maps and Weather. Users can also delete Contacts, and their contact information will remain in the Phone app. The apps, which account for under 150 MB space, can later be reinstalled from the App Store.
