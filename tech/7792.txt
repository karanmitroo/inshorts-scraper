US-based scientists have developed an algorithm that helps them to use satellite data to determine groundwater levels across large areas. The data was obtained by monitoring tiny changes in the elevation of Earth's surface using electromagnetic waves. "It could be especially useful in agricultural regions, where groundwater pumping is common and aquifer depletion is a concern", a researcher said.
