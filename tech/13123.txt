Blackberry has begun to roll out the much-awaited Blackberry Messenger (BBM) service to Android and iPhone devices. The cross-platform offering, which got delayed by a month due to some issues, is now being rolled out in a phased manner. A total of 6-million Android and iPhone users have registered for the pre-launch and are allowed to use the platform right-away.
