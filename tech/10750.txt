Russian company Zvezda NPP has developed a gen-next, lightweight spacesuit equipped with climate control and unique safety systems for astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The spacesuit will reportedly ensure that astronauts, even when affected by an aggressive environment like open space, feel absolutely comfortable and safe. They will be sent to the ISS this year.
