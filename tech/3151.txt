Hackers behind a ransomware called 'ThunderCrypt' reportedly agreed to unlock a Taiwanese man's computer after he said that he didn't have enough money to pay the ransom. Accepting that their Taiwanese campaign had failed, the hackers agreed to forego the $650 ransom. The hackers instead suggested that the man could donate a few cups of coffee to them.
