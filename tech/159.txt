Google's next Android version, Android P, will reportedly feature safeguards for preventing background apps from accessing the phone's camera. The system will shut it off and display an error message if an inactive app tries to use the camera. Earlier reports suggested the Android version will also feature improved battery life and support designs like multiple screens and foldable displays.
