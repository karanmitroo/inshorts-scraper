According to research firm Symbolic Software, China has completely blocked WhatsApp, including the exchange of text messages ahead of the ruling party's meeting next month. In July, China partially blocked WhatsApp, disabling people from sending photos, videos and voice notes. Symbolic Software said China may have recently upgraded its firewall to block WhatsApp's heavily encrypted messaging.
