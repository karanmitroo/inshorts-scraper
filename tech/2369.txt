Slovenia-based startup Margento has developed a technology which allows users to make mobile payments on feature phones using their voice. The patented 'Data Over Voice' solution does not require internet and sends encrypted audio signals between two face-to-face phones to complete a payment. The technology is expected to be launched in India in August.
