The official Twitter account of Disney-owned media company ABC News was hacked on Thursday to post tweets in favour of US President Donald Trump. Several of the tweets also linked to an account, @the6clerk, which has since been suspended by Twitter. Apart from the American broadcaster's main account, its sister account Good Morning America was also hacked.
