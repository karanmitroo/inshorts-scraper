Switzerland's postal service on Tuesday said it had begun testing parcel deliveries by unmanned drones. "The drone follows secure flight paths and is capable of transporting loads of up to one kilo over more than 10 kilometres with a single battery charge," a statement said. Swiss Post also said that it expects to mainly use the drones in emergency situations.
