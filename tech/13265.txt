Google's Palestine site has been defaced by a hacker group named Hackteach. A message posted to the site reads: "uncle google we say hi from palestine to remember you that the country in google map not called israel. its called Palestin". A Google spokesperson said the domain was not hacked but users visiting google.ps were redirected to a different website.
