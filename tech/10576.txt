Google launched a service on Friday in San Francisco wherein it will connect users with professional home-service providers directly through its search results page. Google will let users contact pre-screened professionals (plumbers, handymen, locksmiths), who in turn would pay to be featured in top results. With this, Google escalates competition with the likes of Amazon, Yelp, and TaskRabbit.
