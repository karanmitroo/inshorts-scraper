A Singapore-based startup has developed a Heads-Up Display called iSCOUT that lets drivers accept or reject calls with the wave of a hand. It also projects information such as car speed, fuel level, and GPS navigation as a floating virtual image in front of the driver. Other features of iSCOUT include blind spot cameras and dashcams.
