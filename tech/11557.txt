NASA's Opportunity Mars rover has become the first vehicle to complete the distance of a marathon (42 km) on another planet. It covered the distance in about 11 years and two months. Opportunity's long-term goal was to explore the rim of the Endeavour Crater after its lifespan went beyond scientists' expectations.
