Canada-based startup Nanotips has created 'Taps' stickers that can be stuck on gloves to make them touchscreen-friendly, using electric conductivity. The textured stickers also have a unique 'fingerprint' which can be used to access a phone's fingerprint lock without users having to take off their gloves. The Taps stickers are priced starting at approximately â‚¹550 for a pack of four.
