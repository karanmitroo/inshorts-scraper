Social networking giant Facebook has changed its 'friends' icon in a bid to promote gender equality. The older icon had the man in the front and the woman behind him, while in the new logo, the woman is in front of the man. Furthermore, the 'groups' icon has also been changed, placing the woman in the front yet again.
