The first handheld scientific calculator in the world was introduced by technology company HP in 1972. The HP-35 calculator was deemed too expensive by a market study. HP Co-founder Bill Hewlett said, "We figured, in the first year, if we could sell 10,000 calculators, we'd break even. We sold 100,000." HP was incorporated on August 18, 1947.
