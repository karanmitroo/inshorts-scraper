Speaking about net neutrality, IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that a citizen's right to access the internet was "non-negotiable" and the government will not allow companies to restrict people's entry to digital space. Facebook's Free Basics programme was not allowed by the government because it had offered access to select internet services, he added.
