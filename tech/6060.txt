Software major Microsoft has killed its fitness wearable named 'Band'. While the 'Band 2' has been completely removed from the company's online store, the wearable is available through Amazon's remaining inventory. The team responsible for making the Band was recently dissolved by Microsoft and the company has confirmed that no Band 3 will be launched this year.
