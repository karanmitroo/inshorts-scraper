Apple CEO Tim Cook has explained why the company's upcoming wireless AirPods will not fall out of users' ears. Cook said that wires apply weight on earbuds, causing them to slip, while the $159 AirPods won't face this issue. He shared that he had "been on treadmills, walking, doing all the things (he'd) normally do", without his AirPods falling out.
