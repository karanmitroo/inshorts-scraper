China-based electronics company OnePlus on Tuesday confirmed that its next flagship smartphone 'OnePlus Two' will have a Type-C USB port. It is a reversible plug connector type USB, meaning users will not have to worry about which way the cable is facing. It will also charge the device faster and allow transfer of power, video, and audio in both directions.
