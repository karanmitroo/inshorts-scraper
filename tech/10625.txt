Microsoft in a lawsuit has accused InterDigital Inc of US antitrust violation as the latter allegedly infringed terms of licensing patents on industry standards and charged exorbitant rates instead. The lawsuit comes as the U.S. International Trade Commission is set to decide if Microsoft smartphone imports should be banned in the US on charges of infringing two InterDigital patents.
