The US militaryâ€™s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on Wednesday announced a program to build implantable neural devices that would allow the human brain to communicate with a computer using binary code. The new program, dubbed Neural Engineering System Design, would improve research capability in neurotechnology and would help in therapies for improving sight and hearing deficits.
