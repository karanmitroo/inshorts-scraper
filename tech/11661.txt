Russian federal space agency 'Roscosmos' has announced that it will build a Russian space station once the International Space Station (ISS) is mothballed next decade. Roscosmos also pledged its commitment to the ISS until 2024. The agency's decision comes less than a year after Russian officials said they would not extend funding and other support for the ISS after 2020.
