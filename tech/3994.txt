Celestine Omin, a 28-year-old software engineer travelling from Nigeria to New York, was detained by the US Customs and Border Protection office at the airport and asked to solve an engineering test. The test was reportedly taken to confirm that Omin is actually an engineer. "I would never get into the United States," Omin said after he took the test.
