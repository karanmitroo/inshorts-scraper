Researchers from the Queen's University Belfast, UK have invented the worldâ€™s first porous liquid. The liquid has the ability of absorbing large amounts of gases into its pores, a trait that can reportedly be used to capture harmful carbon emissions entering the Earth's atmosphere. So far, porous materials, that are used for manufacturing several products including petrol, have been solids.
