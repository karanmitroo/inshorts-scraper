Google has removed a Taliban-developed app called Alemarah from the Play store, two days after it was discovered by SITE Intel Group. The app gave access to Taliban videos and statements in Pashto language, as part of a growing digital campaign by the group. The Taliban also has a website in five languages with active presence on Twitter and Facebook.
