Three Australian airlines have reportedly banned passengers from using or charging Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones during flights due to concerns over the phone's fire-prone batteries. Qantas, its budget unit Jetstar and Virgin Australia said they imposed the ban as a precaution, following the world's biggest smartphone vendor's recall of its Note 7 phones in 10 markets.
