South Korean electronics major Samsung reportedly tried to bribe a Chinese man to keep the video of his exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone private. Two Samsung employees offered him a new Note 7 and about $900 in compensation on the condition to keep the video private. â€œThis is an issue of deception. They are cheating Chinese consumers," said the man.
