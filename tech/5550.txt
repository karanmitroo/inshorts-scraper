California-based startup Mega Tiny Corporation has developed 'PowerBulb', a light bulb that can double as a charger. The LED bulb, which costs $34 (â‚¹2,270), has two USB charging ports that can be used even when the light is off. The startup claims to use 'MegaSmart' charging technology that sends more power to the device when it senses a lower charge.
