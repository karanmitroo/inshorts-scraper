Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella in a blog post about his son with special needs said that he was sad for how things turned out for him and his wife, Anu. "To say that period of time was difficult is an understatement," he wrote. Nadella's son Zain, currently 21 years old, has cerebral palsy and is confined to a wheel chair.
