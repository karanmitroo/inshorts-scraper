Google has filed an application to patent the use of holograms in its wearable device Google Glass to improve the augmented reality experiences. Further, a US-based startup Magic Leap is speculated to be taken aboard for making the said holograms under what the company now calls 'Project Aura'. Magic Leap has already filed trademarks for augmented reality content.
