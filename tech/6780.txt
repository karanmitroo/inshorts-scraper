MIT researchers have developed a new algorithm that can detect depression in an individual from their Instagram photos. Combining data from standard clinical depression surveys with Instagram photo ratings for 170 test subjects, the algorithm correctly identified 70% of depressed individuals. Findings indicate that depressed individuals tend to post bluer, grayer images and receive fewer likes.
