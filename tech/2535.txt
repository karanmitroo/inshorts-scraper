Google parent Alphabet's research organisation Verily has announced that it will release 10 lakh sterile male mosquitoes every week for 20 weeks in California. The project will target female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that are known to spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus. Verily expects Aedes aegypti population to drop steeply if the females mate with the sterile mosquitoes.
