Apple offered a $1 billion bond dedicated to financing clean energy and environmental projects on Tuesday. It is the first corporate green bond offered since President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement. Apple had issued its first green bond of $1.5 billion, the largest by a US corporation, as a response to the 2015 Paris agreement.
