During a conference, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick said that the company is not planning to go public soon. “Give us a few years, give us a little time and when the time is right, something like that will happen,” Kalanick remarked. Being more than five years old, he also added the company is “too young for the prom.”
