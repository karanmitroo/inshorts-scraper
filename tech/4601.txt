Electronics maker Panasonic has deployed its hospitality robot 'HOSPI' for a five-day trial at a Japanese hotel where it serves drinks to the guests and makes bus announcements. The robot stores bottled water in its lower section and makes announcements in three languages namely Japanese, English and Chinese. The autonomous robot uses sensors to avoid collision with walls or people.
