California-based manufacturer of home products Simplehuman has developed a voice-controlled trashcan that can be opened by saying "open can" or "open sesame", priced at $180 (approximately â‚¹12,200). The voice commands used to open or close the dustbin can be localised for different countries. The dustbin also uses motion sensors and can be opened by waving a hand over it.
