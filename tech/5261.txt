Los Angeles-based startup Holi has created a ₹17,000 smart alarm clock called 'Bonjour' which talks to the user, plays music and shows traffic. The clock checks traffic reports and wakes up the user earlier than scheduled if there’s a major traffic jam. It also records sleep patterns and gives suggestions to enhance the sleep.
