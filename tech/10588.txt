Researchers from the University of Michigan and NASA have developed a new material that can quickly repair itself. The material was made by sandwiching a reactive liquid in between two layers of a solid polymer. When the material was broken during tests, the liquid reacted with oxygen from the air to form a solid plug in under a second.
