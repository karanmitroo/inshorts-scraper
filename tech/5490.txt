Microsoft's former CEO Steve Ballmer has said that his decision to push Microsoft into the hardware business contributed to the breakdown of his relationship with longtime friend and company's Co-founder Bill Gates. Ballmer said he wanted to enter the mobile device market years earlier, but Gates and other Board members had disagreed. Microsoft eventually entered the hardware market in 2012.
