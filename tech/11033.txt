Researchers at the University of Dundee have discovered a new compound, DDD107498, that can kill the parasite that causes malaria while protecting people from the disease and preventing its spread, all in a single dose. The discovery, reported in the journal Nature, has been tested on mice and is now being prepared for testing on humans.
