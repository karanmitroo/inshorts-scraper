Samsung has unveiled an Internet-of-Things refrigerator that supports an embedded camera designed to monitor spoilage. Users can keep an eye on the food through a 21.5-inch full HD touchscreen display on the four-door fridge, or remotely through a mobile app. The smart fridge also features a stereo speaker system and also notifies users on detecting spoilage.
