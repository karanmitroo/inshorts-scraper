The Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks has issued an order saying no to all software patents in India. This comes after the patent office published revised guidelines last August allowing the patenting of software which demonstrated technical advancement, but did not clarify what it meant. However, software will continue toÂ be protected by copyright laws.
