'Domino's Pizza' in New Zealand (NZ) is aiming to become the first company in the world to become an unmanned commercial drone delivery service on a regular basis. New Zealand became one of the world's first countries to clear commercial drone deliveries in 2015. Notably, a US convenience store chain conducted the first single commercial drone delivery in July.
