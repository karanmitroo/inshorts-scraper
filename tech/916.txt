University of California San Diego engineers have developed a smartphone case that can record and track a user's blood sugar levels. Called GPhone, it features a sensor at its corner, on which enzyme-packed pellets that are housed in a 3D stylus, can be attached. Users can dispense a pellet onto the sensor and drop blood sample to measure glucose concentration.
