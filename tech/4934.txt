A woman who participated in the 2016 'Reddit Secret Santa' discovered that Bill Gates was her Secret Santa. The Reddit user 'Aerrix' shared photos of the gifts, which came with a note "there are a few video games to play, some things to keep you warm and three of my favourite movies for you to watch over the holidays."
