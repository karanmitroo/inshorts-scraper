Co-founder of social media app Phhhoto Champ Bennett has slammed Instagram for cloning its GIF-making feature and said, "I'm not sure Instagram has a creative bone in their entire body." He added, "We watched Systrom [Instagram CEO] quietly using Phhhoto almost a year before Boomerang was released." Phhhoto announced it is shutting down its app due to "unsustainable" server costs.
