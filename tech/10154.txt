Facebook on Thursday unveiled a feature called ‘Music Stories’ on iOS that enables users to post 30-second music clips directly from Apple Music and Spotify on their timeline. This will let people preview songs straight on their Facebook news feed and purchase or save them on the respective music streaming service without leaving the social networking website.
