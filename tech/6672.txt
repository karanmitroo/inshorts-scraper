Facebook has reportedly fired a team of 15-18 contractual employees who used to write description for trending topics, with an hour's notice. They were given six weeks' worth of severance pay and were asked to leave Facebook's office within an hour. The employees had earlier claimed that the pro-conservative topics were purposely suppressed from appearing on the trending list.
