Web streaming service Netflix will reportedly add an offline viewing feature for desktop and mobile applications of its video streaming service before the end of the year. Earlier, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had said that offline mode was "never going to happen". Later in April this year, he said he is "keeping an open mind" about it.
