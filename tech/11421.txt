The iconic Hubble space telescope is celebrating its silver jubilee on Friday. The NASA-European Space agency joint venture was launched in its orbit, 552 km above Earth, on April 24, 1990. The telescope has travelled 3 billion miles so far, with 1.2 million observations and has given modern astronomy some of the most spectacular images of the universe in history.
