A user of Samsung's Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone in South Korea has reportedly spotted burnt-in pixels on his device's screen. The burn-in appeared near the phone's pressure sensitive home button which always stays on. Screen burn happens when a single image is left on the screen for too long, creating a permanent mark on the display.
