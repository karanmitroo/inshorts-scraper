France's lower house of parliament on Thursday passed an amendment imposing a $385,000 fine on technology companies that refuse to provide encrypted data in terror-related cases. The National Assembly is set to vote on this entire bill on March 8. The news came amid the ongoing Apple-FBI controversy over the decryption of San Bernardino shooter's iPhone.
