Several porn websites on Monday blocked Californian users from their sites to protest against a proposed law which would make condoms mandatory in adult films shot in the state. The websites displayed pop-ups urging visitors to vote 'no' on the proposition in November. The law would allow any Californian resident to sue producers of porn if it doesn't feature condoms.
