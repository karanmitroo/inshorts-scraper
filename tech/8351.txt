MIT researchers have demonstrated an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that was able to predict around 85% of cyber attacks, almost three times better than the current systems, with the help of input from cyber security experts. For the results, the developed system was implemented on 3.6 billion pieces of data, generated by millions of users in three months.
