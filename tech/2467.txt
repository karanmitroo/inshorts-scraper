Technology major Apple is reportedly working with Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex to develop electric automotive batteries. Apple received a permit to start testing self-driving cars in April this year. The company's CEO Tim Cook has also confirmed that Apple is building technology for self-driving cars, but did not say whether it will make a car of its own.
