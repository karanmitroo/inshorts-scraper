Apple on Tuesday was granted a patent for "Detachable wireless listening device" which describes a headphone design that accepts audio signals through a cord and also wireless protocols. The design features a magnetic attachment mechanism connecting the earbuds to the main cord. If the earbud-side cord is detached, the system can detect the change and can activate the wireless communications.
