Chief Design Officer at Apple, Sir Jony Ive, has designed the annual Christmas decor for London's iconic Claridges hotel. The installation features four-metre tall light boxes that glow with black and white photographic images of snow covered silver birch trees, set on a white floor. Interestingly, the Christmas tree has been left unlit, keeping with Ive's minimalistic style.
