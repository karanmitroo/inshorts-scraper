Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's Global Vice President Hugo Barra in a recent interview said, "It was a mistake not bringing the 64 GB Xiaomi Mi 5 to India. He added, "Maybe it would have taken some more time as the supply chain for the 64 GB was a couple of weeks behind, but that would have been the right decision."
