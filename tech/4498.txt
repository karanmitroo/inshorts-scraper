Whistleblower website WikiLeaks has called on hackers to leak US President Donald Trump's tax returns so that they could be published online, according to reports. This comes after White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday said that Trump will not release his tax returns. Interestingly, Trump made a campaign pledge of releasing his tax returns after an audit.
