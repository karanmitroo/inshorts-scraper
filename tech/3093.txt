Colin Furze, a YouTuber who runs 'Furze's Invention Show' on the video sharing platform, has built 'Play-o-Wave', a fully functional microwave with a screen mounted on its door to play video game. Furze also demonstrated both the functions of his invention, as he played a biking game while an onion was being cooked in the microwave.
