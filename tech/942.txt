Apple's market share in the United States slipped from 40.6% in 2016 to 32.9% in the quarter ending October 2017, according to a report by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. The report further pointed that Apple market share also slipped in Japan and key European markets. The decline has reportedly been attributed to the unavailability of iPhone X in the October quarter.
