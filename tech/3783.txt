A 32-year-old man from London was electrocuted to death while charging his iPhone in the bath. The man, who rested the charging cord on his chest while using the phone in the bath, got electrocuted when it fell into the water. The severity of the burns earlier raised suspicion of an attack, but the incident was recently ruled as accident.
