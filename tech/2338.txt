Google's head of connectivity in India recently talked about the Google RailTel, which has started providing free WiFi at 140 railway stations in India. "If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacity", he said. The initiative aims to cover 400 stations across the country.
