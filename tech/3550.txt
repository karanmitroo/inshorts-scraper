New York University student Dejian Zeng has shared his experience of working undercover in a Chinese iPhone factory for six weeks. Zeng's job entailed inserting screws in iPhones for as long as 12 hours daily. "Sometimes they don't allow you to speak. You just sit there and wait until the next phone comes in...I consider it as torture," he said.
