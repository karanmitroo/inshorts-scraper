US-based robotics company Zipline on Friday launched drones to deliver blood to inaccessible clinics in the East African nation Rwanda. The drones have the capability to make a round trip of 150 km and are launched using catapults with the deliveries being made using a bio-degradable parachute. Notably, Rwanda uses around 6,50,000 units of blood per year.
