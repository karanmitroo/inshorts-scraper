Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff confirmed on Thursday that the company also made a bid for LinkedIn, the business networking service that was sold to Microsoft for $26.2 billion earlier this week. While the bid amount was not revealed, Salesforce was reportedly interested in LinkedIn's recruiting business. Last year, several reports had emerged of Microsoft trying to buy Salesforce.
