Microsoft Thursday unveiled three new Office apps for the iPad, and also made its Office apps for iPhone and Android, completely free to use. Earlier, the Office apps for the two smartphone platforms were free to download, but using them required subscription. However, Microsoft mentions that the free use is intended for home use and not for business users.
