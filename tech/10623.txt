Google has launched a feature called Rediscover This Day that automatically creates animations and stories with images from as far back as three years. The animation can then be pushed out to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Additionally, one can manually edit a timestamp on a Google Photo. The feature is available for the web, and Android and iOS apps.
