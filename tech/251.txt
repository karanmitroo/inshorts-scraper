Indian-origin teenager Medha Gupta has developed an app called Safe Travel which sends alerts to emergency contacts if a user does not reach their destination on time. It reportedly took her 40 hours to design, program, test and troubleshoot the app. She also won the annual Congressional App Challenge for the app which is only compatible with iOS.
