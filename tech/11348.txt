The annual Eta Aquarid meteor shower will take place today as the Earth will cross the orbital path of Halleyâ€™s comet. Although this shower remains active from Apr-19 to May-20, it is best seen on May 5 or 6 when the Earth strikes most deeply into the stream of the comet debris. The Eta Aquarids can produce upto 40 meteors/hour.
