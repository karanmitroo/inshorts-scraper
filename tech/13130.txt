To promote breast cancer awareness, Nestle Fitness introduced a high-tech, pink bra that automatically sends a tweet each time it is unhooked, with the view to remind women of their monthly breast self-exam. Every time this bra is unhooked, a special mechanism under bra's hook sends a signal to a cell phone, which in turn generates a tweet.
