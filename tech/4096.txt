South Korean tech giant Samsung has refuted a report that claimed the company plans to sell refurbished units of the Galaxy Note 7 in India. The report had said that Samsung had slightly redesigned the phone and placed a smaller battery to prevent explosions. Samsung released the findings of its internal investigation into the Galaxy Note 7 explosions last month.
