Video messaging application Snapchat on Thursday rolled out a new feature in its latest update that would enable its users to share a unique profile URL with others. The feature can be used by swiping down from the Snapchat camera screen, then hitting 'Add Friends' button, and selecting 'Share Username', where a unique username URL can be shared.
