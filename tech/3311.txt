Multiple retailers in Malaysia have reportedly been selling counterfeit versions of the yet-to-be available Nokia 3310 handsets. The fake devices have colourful plastic bodies like the 3310 with a Nokia logo on top of the display. However, the clones feature a smaller screen compared to the Nokia 3310 and don't run Nokia's Series 30 software platform.
