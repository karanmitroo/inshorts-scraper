Facebook has rolled out its Mentions app, that allows celebrities and individuals with verified accounts to connect with their followers, on Android. Through Mentions, users can broadcast live videos and share status updates and photos directly with their fans, without spamming anyone else's News Feeds. The app was launched on iOS in July 2014.
