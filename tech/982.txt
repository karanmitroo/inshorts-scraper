E-commerce major Amazon has received a patent in the United States for a drone that can destruct itself in case of emergency. The patent describes a drone that will feature a 'fragmentation controller' which will detect disruption in the drone's flight and in response will destruct itself. The drone will also be able to control its fragmentation.
