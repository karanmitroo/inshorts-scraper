Users of Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones have reported that the camera app freezes with pink and purple lines on the screen. Users also complained of large blocks of the screen's content randomly moving around the display, before the phone completely stops responding. Google has acknowledged the problem as a software issue and is working on a fix.
