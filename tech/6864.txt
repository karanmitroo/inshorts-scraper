Ford Motor has announced that it will mass-produce fully autonomous vehicles without brake pedals and steering wheels by 2021. "A driver will not be required", said Ford CEO Mark Fields adding that these vehicles, specially designed for ride-sharing, would "improve safety and solve...environmental challenges for millions of people – not just those who can afford luxury vehicles.”
