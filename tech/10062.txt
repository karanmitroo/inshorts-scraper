Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a smartphone named BioPhone that can allegedly monitor usersâ€™ heart rates and other physiological measurements while in the pocket. The device reportedly derives biological signals like beating of heart from its accelerometer, based on which it can suggest users remedies like trying more breathing exercises.
