Instagram Co-founder Kevin Systrom was approached by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 to join the newly launched social networking site, while he was at Stanford University. "Unfortunately, I decided I wanted to stay in school, ..would've loved to have been part of Facebook's growth," Systrom said about declining the offer. Interestingly, Instagram was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012.
