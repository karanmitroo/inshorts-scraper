Apple on Friday announced that it will start charging for iTunes Radio from January 28. Users will have to pay a monthly subscription fee of $10 to Apple Music to access the ad-supported service, that enables users to create customized radio stations based on preferred artists and songs. However, Beats 1, Appleâ€™s curated internet radio station, remains free.
