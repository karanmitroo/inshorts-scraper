Facebook on Wednesday acquired face recognition technology provider FacioMetrics, a Carnegie Mellon University spin-off company. The startup has created an app called Intraface that can detect seven different emotions on the user's face. A Facebook spokesperson said, the acquisition "will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos" on the platform.
