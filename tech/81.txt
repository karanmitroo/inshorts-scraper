Google CEO Sundar Pichai doesn't have authority over parent company Alphabet's overall resource allocation to Google, as per a report quoting SEC filings. Further, Pichai neither receives financial information about Alphabet's other subsidiaries nor has any decision-making power over them. However, Pichai can commit Google to investments up to a set amount without Co-founder Larry Page's approval.
