Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have "painted" the smallest version of the Mona Lisa ever, which measures 30-microns - just a third of a human hair's width. Called the "Mini Lisa", the work is result of a process called ThermoChemical NanoLithography, in which incredibly precise variations in heat produced lighter or darker shades of gray in a special dye.
