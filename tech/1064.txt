Facebook has promised to tell users whether they liked or followed a member of Russia's "troll army", which is accused of trying to influence elections in the US and the UK. Adding that the move is aimed at "protecting people from bad actors", officials said, "It is important that people understand how foreign actors tried to sow mistrust using Facebook."
