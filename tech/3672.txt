Billion dollar data-analytics startup Palantir, backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, has said that its investor KT4 Partners is using "baseless accusations" to get its hands on confidential information. Earlier, KT4 Partners had sued Palantir for records to determine whether Palantir blocked it from selling stake. As part of the dispute, Palantir also accused KT4 Partners of stealing trade secrets.
