Toyota said Monday that a hydrogen-powered vehicle that emits only water vapor as exhaust will go on sale in the US  in 2015, a year earlier than it promised just two months ago. The electric car, which Toyota calls FCV for now, uses hydrogen as fuel for a battery. The car is expected to be priced between $50,000 to $100,000.
