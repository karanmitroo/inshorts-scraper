Germany-based researchers have developed a new biometric authentication system called 'SkullConduct', which works by analyzing skull vibrations in reaction to an ultrasonic signal. The system plays a one-second long audio clip into the user's head and analyzes the signal after it's traveled through the skull. The team found that the system successfully identified the subjects 97% of the times.
