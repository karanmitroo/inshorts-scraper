Several government websites in the US state of Ohio were hacked on Sunday with a message that purports to be supportive of the Islamic State. "You will be held accountable Trump, you and all your people for every drop of blood flowing in Muslim countries," read the message. All affected servers were taken offline and authorities are investigating the incident.
