Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview to The Washington Post said, "The CEO job is lonely." Cook added, "Iâ€™m not looking for any sympathy. You have to recognize that you have blind spots. We all do." The 55-year-old CEO will be completing five years at Apple on August 24 this year, after taking over from Steve Jobs in 2011.
