A solar eclipse visible to North America on August 21 could wipe out enough power generation to supply about 70 lakh homes, a Bloomberg report claims. The eclipse will cast a shadow along a 113-kilometre-wide corridor in US and impact 9,000 megawatts of power generated by solar farms and rooftop panels. The event could trigger spikes in wholesale power prices.
