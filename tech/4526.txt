The world's first iPhone model, launched by Co-founder Steve Jobs in 2007, has become useless after American telecom company AT&T shut down its 2G cellular network. The original iPhone can no longer make calls or send text messages as it supported only AT&T carrier. The handset stopped receiving software updates in 2009 and was declared obsolete by Apple in 2013.
