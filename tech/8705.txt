Researchers from the University of Rochester have developed a machine-learning algorithm that enables a computer to catch alcohol-related tweets and those sent under the influence of alcohol. Another algorithm was designed to find a Twitter user's home location to determine whether they are drinking at home or not. For this, researchers fed the system with 11,000 alcohol-related geo-tagged tweets.
