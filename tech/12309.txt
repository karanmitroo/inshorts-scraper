Passengers flying into, or out of Europe, can use portable electronics including phones at any time during flights, European Aviation Safety Agency has announced. Guidelines are effective immediately. But, airlines will need to certify their planes aren't affected by transmission signals before allowing devices to be used. Airlines will also need to equip their aircrafts with network connectors.
