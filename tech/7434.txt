Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who turns 44 on Tuesday, married Anjali, a classmate from Chemical Engineering Department at IIT Kharagpur. They have two kids, a boy and a girl, and live in Los Altos Hills in San Francisco, California. Pichai's friend from Kharagpur had reportedly said that "becoming Google CEO was easier for Sundar than expressing feelings for Anjali."
