Scientists in the US have developed a coffee-cup-sized prototype of a surgically implantable artificial kidney. The prototype uses a silicon nano filter to remove toxins, salts and water from the blood. The filter is designed to work on blood pressure alone without a pump or electrical power. The device is an alternative to kidney transplantation or dialysis for patients.
