The hack of nearly half a billion Yahoo accounts in 2014, which was confirmed by the company on Thursday, is the biggest known data breach ever. The hacking of over 360 million MySpace accounts earlier this year comes second, while the 2016 LinkedIn leak comes third with over 100 million accounts hacked. Yahoo believes the breach was a "state-sponsored act".
