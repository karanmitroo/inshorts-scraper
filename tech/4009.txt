Israel-based technology startup Kado claims to have created the world's thinnest wall charger for mobile devices like smartphones and laptops that can fit within wallets. Measuring under 0.2 inches in thickness, the charger has collapsable prongs and internal circuitry to be as thin as a USB port. It also has a 2-foot retractable cable for power and data transfer.
