Electronics maker Samsung's store at a Singapore mall caught fire on Tuesday, prompting nearby stores to close temporarily. The cause of the fire still hasn't been determined and the extent of property damage is yet to be ascertained. This comes a day before Samsung is scheduled to launch Galaxy S8, the company's first smartphone after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco.
