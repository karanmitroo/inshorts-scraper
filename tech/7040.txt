US-based startup Modifi has built mods that can convert old smartphones into cost-efficient sensor systems for security, fleet management and baby monitoring purposes. The mods can detect light, sound, movement, magnetic fields and power outages, while users can create customised sensor alerts for the same. The devices can also begin recording videos according to user-defined triggers.
