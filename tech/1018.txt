The government has decided to allow digital payments for charging electric vehicles through various platforms including the BHIM app and Bharat QR code. The move follows recommendations from the Committee for Standardisation of the Protocol for Charging Infrastructure set up by the government. The committee also recommended that metering be done as per units consumed for charging each vehicle.
