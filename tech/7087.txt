Facebook has unveiled a new 22,000-square-foot hardware laboratory in its California headquarters, named 'Area 404'. The lab will be used by Facebook to prototype its solar drones, Internet-beaming lasers, VR headsets, and next-generation servers. The aim of the lab is to cut down the time it takes Facebook to get a device from conception to mass production.
