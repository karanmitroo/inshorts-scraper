The Free Software Movement of India (FMSI) launched a four-day campaign against Facebook’s Free Basics initiative in Hyderabad on Saturday. The campaign seeks to scrap the “misleading” initiative and claims that it violates net neutrality. The campaign also introduces FreedomBox, an alternative to Free Basics that “acts like a router” and “creates a network of personal servers to protect privacy”.
