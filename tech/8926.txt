A Russian startup has developed 'Evapolar', a $179 portable personal air conditioner that cools, humidifies and purifies air. It contains a removable water tank of 710 ml capacity which lasts for 6-8 hours. Evapolar claims to be 12 times more energy efficient than traditional split systems. The air conditioner can reach a maximum cooling temperature of 17Â°C.
