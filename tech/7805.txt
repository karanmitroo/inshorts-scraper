YouTube on Thursday launched a feature called 'Smart Offline' in India to let users take advantage of cheaper data rates charged by mobile operators at night. This feature lets users schedule their offline video downloads for night using a new 'Save overnight' option when discounted data plans are active. Scheduled videos can be watched offline in the morning without buffering.
