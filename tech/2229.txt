The Islamic State used PayPal and fake eBay transactions to channel around $8,700 to an operative in the US, a report has revealed. The operative, who was arrested last year, reportedly used the money received from ISIS to purchase a laptop, a cellphone, calling cards, and a VPN, all of which were used to communicate with the terror group.
