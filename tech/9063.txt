Electric car maker Tesla now owns the domain tesla.com, which was earlier owned by Stu Grossman, a fan of renowned electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Grossman owned the domain since 1992 to apparently turn it into a fan website. The domain now automatically redirects users to Teslaâ€™s official website. However, the details of the ownership switch have not been revealed.
