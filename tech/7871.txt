American technology firm Yahoo on Wednesday disclosed three National Security Letters (NSL) that it received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asking for information related to user accounts. The company said that the disclosure "marks the first time any company has publicly acknowledged receiving an NSL following the reforms of the USA Freedom Act", that were introduced last year.
