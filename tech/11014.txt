Venus and Jupiter- the two brightest celestial bodies after the Sun and the Moon- will appear closest to each other on June 30 this year. The planets which are moving closer every week since last winter will appear to be colliding, says NASA. The celestial phenomenon can be seen in the western sky once the sun is down.
