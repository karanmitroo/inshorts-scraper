According to the government's chief policy think-tank NITI Aayog, imported components for electric vehicles (EV) could make India vulnerable to cyber-security breaches. NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat said India should manufacture the majority of the parts as equipment shipped from overseas could be compromised. All software and at least 55% components need to be made domestically, Saraswat added.
