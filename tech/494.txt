University of Michigan researchers have patented a system that could use glasses or a headset to prevent motion sickness while in a moving car. The glasses provide light stimuli in the rider's visual periphery to mimic the outside movement to prevent getting sick. It has been designed for users to read a book or check their phone in self-driving cars.
