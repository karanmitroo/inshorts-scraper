According to a report by the Norwegian Consumer Council, smart internet-connected toys can be used to spy on children and their homes. The report said that anyone can talk and listen through the toys by using a smartphone. Further, the report claims that dolls made by Genesis Toys transfer all audio to US-based company Nuance Communications without permission.
