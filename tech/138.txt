A video shows a four-legged robot, made by Boston Dynamics, opening a door despite obstruction by a man. He first halts the robot with a stick, then pushes the door to prevent it from opening and finally tries to pull the robot back. The robot, however, managed to open the door, even after one of its body parts fell off.
