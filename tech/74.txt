Facebook-owned WhatsApp has added time and location filters which can be used while editing photos or videos. The users can tap the smiley icon while editing the photos to add the filters which have been introduced on both Android and iOS operating systems. Along with this, WhatsApp also added a feature to let users search the list of group participants.
