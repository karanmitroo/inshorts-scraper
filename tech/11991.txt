American geneticist James Watson (86), who was awarded the Nobel prize in 1962 for discovering the double-helix structure of DNA, Thursday sold his medal for $4.75 million at an auction in New York. Watson will donate a portion of the money to the University of Chicago (where he studied) and Clare College at the University of Cambridge (where he worked).
