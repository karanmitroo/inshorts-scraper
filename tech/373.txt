Facebook has filed a patent for a technology to automatically detect users' socio-economic status by collecting users' personal data, like education, homeownership and internet usage. The patent also suggested an algorithm which may improve the company's advertisement targeting capabilities. Facebook would ask users about their travel history, devices the user owns, and highest level of education.
