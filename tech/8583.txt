Photo-sharing app Instagram has launched its Discover People page on the web. The tool, denoted by a little compass icon on the homepage, allows users to check out a bunch of people they would be interested in following, along with three of each userâ€™s most recent photos. Notably, the feature was already available on Instagram's mobile apps.
