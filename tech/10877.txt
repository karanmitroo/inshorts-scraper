Yahoo has launched a video chat app, called Livetext, which allows users to share silent video of themselves with friends, while typing. The text they type pops up over the video. Livetext is currently available only in Hong Kong iTunes store. The conversation is initiated via text and the video begins immediately upon the recipient entering the chat.
