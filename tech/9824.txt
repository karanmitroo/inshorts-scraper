The official Facebook page of Star Wars Movies has released a new display picture filter that adds a lightsaber, an intergalactic weapon from the movie, to usersâ€™ profile pictures. Users have the option of choosing between a red and a blue lightsaber. This comes ahead of the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens that will release globally on December 18.
