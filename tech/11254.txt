A 13-year-old Indian-origin boy, Shubham Banerjee, who invented a low-cost portable Braille printer 'Braigo' has been invited by Microsoft to integrate it with Windows to make it easily accessible to the visually-impaired. Shubham, an eighth-grader, showcased his invention at a tech fair organised by Microsoft and is planning to commercially launch it in November at  a price point of $500.
