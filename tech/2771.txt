Operations at one of the terminals of Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port, India's largest container port, were disrupted by the 'Petya' ransomware on Tuesday, marking the first reported case of the ransomware in India. This comes after several businesses across Europe and the US reported that they were targetted by the 'Petya' ransomware, which experts say is similar to WannaCry ransomware.
