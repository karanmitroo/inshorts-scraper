Google on Friday announced plans to shut down Picasa by May to focus on a single service Google Photos. However, content stored on Picasa Web Albums will be available on Google Photos. Picasa's Desktop Application will not get updates after March, but users who already have the application can continue using it. Google had acquired photo-sharing service Picasa in 2004.
