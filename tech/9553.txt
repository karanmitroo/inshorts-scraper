In a TED Talk, Raymond Wang, a 17-year-old has discussed the new device he invented, which re-circulates the air in an airplane cabin to prevent the spreading of germs in the closed space by 55 times. The device, put between seats, pulls the exhaled air out before it can circulate around the cabin and be inhaled by co-passengers.
