Facebook is trying to simplify its privacy policy, largely to address criticisms that it's too complex and lengthy for the average user. The new policy explains what types of information Facebook collects and how it uses the data. The new policy is 70 percent shorter than the old one. A finalized version will take effect soon after Nov 20.
