A recently uploaded video shows a four-legged robot, made by American company Boston Dynamics, opening a door for another robot. The robot called 'Spot Mini' weighs 30 kilograms and can work for about 90 minutes on a single charge, depending on what task it is performing. The all-electric robot can also handle objects and climbs stairs.
