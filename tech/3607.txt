Social media platform Facebook on Wednesday said it was launching tools to make it easier for users to report "revenge porn", or when intimate photos of people are shared without consent. Facebook also said its new photo-matching will automatically prevent images from being shared again once they have been banned. Accounts of people who share revenge porn may be disabled.
