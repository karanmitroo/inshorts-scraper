UK-based augmented reality (AR) app Blippar has launched a 'Halos' feature that lets users turn their face into a digital "billboard". It lets users create a profile by saving their face and providing information like favourite music and latest photos. This information shows up in bubbles around the user's face in AR when someone scans their face with the app.
