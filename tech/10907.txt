Amazon on Monday launched a dedicated iOS app for its Cloud Drive service, which was previously available only for desktop and Android devices. It allows users to view files and folders, preview documents and photos and share files to other apps. Amazon also offers a $12 per year plan with unlimited photo storage and 5 GB for all other files.
