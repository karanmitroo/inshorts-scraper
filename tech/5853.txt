Popular cartoon sitcom 'The Simpsons' offered a scene in virtual reality (VR) using Google Cardboard, in celebration of the series' 600th episode. Titled 'Planet of the Couches', the short experience is reportedly inspired by the classic science fiction film Planet of the Apes, and features VR in the opening couch scene.
