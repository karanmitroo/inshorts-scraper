Turkey has blocked social media site Reddit under the country's Internet censorship law 5651 that bans sites suspected of having content like pornography, piracy, and criticism of Mustafa Atat√ºrk, the country's first President. Prior to this, Turkey had blocked YouTube, Bitly and Twitter for a short while. However, it is still unknown when the Reddit ban will be lifted.
