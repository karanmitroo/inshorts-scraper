Researchers at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science have created stretchable and electrically conductive fibres that can allow for monitoring of human movements using wearable garments and even store energy. The fibres can be knitted and braided with traditional techniques while the textile itself is based on polymeric composite fibres.
