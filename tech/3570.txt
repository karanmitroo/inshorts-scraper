A hacking group has leaked passwords providing access to NSA hacking tools in a protest against US President Donald Trump. The group named TheShadowBrokers has warned Trump in a blog post "Don't Forget Your Base" for backtracking on campaign promises. Further, the group criticised Trump for strikes against Syria, saying "[W]hose war are you fighting?", asking to keep "America first".
