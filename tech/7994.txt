Beijing-based Transit Explore Bus recently showcased an elevated mass-transit concept, 'Straddle Bus', that glides over the traffic and allows cars to pass beneath it. It runs on two-lane wide tracks with a capacity of 1,400 passengers. The invention can be cheaper and quicker to develop than subway, and can help save on fuel consumption and carbon emissions, the company claimed.
