In a first, US-based scientists have developed a technique to write nanoscale patterns with metallic ink using an electron microscope. Conventionally, such patterns are made through lithography, which requires masks to prevent material from accumulating on protected areas. The new method, which was able to write at 40 nanometers resolution, is like lithography without the mask, researchers said.
