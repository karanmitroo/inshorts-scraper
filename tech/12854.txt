A new system called 'Email Miles' has been developed, which calculates "the number of miles" an email has travelled before reaching an inbox. The system uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and Internet tracking to determine the distance. According to its inventor Jonah Brucker-Cohen, the system does all of its calculations using the internet and a coordinate mapping system.
