A man named Jon Cleaver has made a custom 3D printed iPhone 6 case called 'Pokéball Aimer' that helps Pokémon Go mobile game players to catch Pokémon better. The mobile game requires users to aim the 'Poké Ball' on a Pokémon to catch them. The case ensures that users' fingers do not go sideways and aim directly at the Pokémon.
