A Russian YouTuber who filmed himself playing Pok√©mon Go in a church has been convicted for "inciting religious hatred." The man was handed a suspended sentence of three-and-a-half  years. The court agreed that a number of videos on his channel hurt the feelings of religious people by comparing Jesus Christ to a zombie and saying that God does not exist.
