WordPress, a platform that allows creating websites, has rolled out HTTPS encryption support for all the custom domains hosted on its platform. HTTPS, a protocol for secure communication over a computer network, would be enabled automatically on all the websites. The websites will also be provided with an SSL certificate, for establishing encrypted links between a browser and web servers.
