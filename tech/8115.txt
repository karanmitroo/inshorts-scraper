Residents of Bengaluru can now connect with senior police officials through WhatsApp regarding any complaint they have. The city’s 10 Deputy Commissioners have been provided with numbers that can only be used for WhatsApp messages, and not SMS or calls. Through this, the DCPs can be in direct touch with the citizens and consequently send personnel to attend to them.
