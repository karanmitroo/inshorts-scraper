Chinese smartphone maker ZTE has unveiled the 'Gigabit Phone', which it says is the world's first 5G network compatible smartphone. Its download speeds can reach 1Gbps, 10 times faster than the first generation of 4G services widely in use. The 5G-ready phones will come with instant APP technology, which removes the need for download or installation of applications, said ZTE.
