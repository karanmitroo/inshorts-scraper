Microsoft on Thursday opened a HoloLens experience section designed specifically for developers in the company's new retail store located in New York City. A sign up would be required for the experience before it's developer-edition release in early 2016, priced at $3000 per unit. HoloLens is an upcoming augmented reality project which combines the virtual world with the real-world environment.
