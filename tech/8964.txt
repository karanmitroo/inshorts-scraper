A US appeal court on Friday ruled in favour of Samsung in the $119.6 million patent case against Apple. The court said that Samsung did not infringe Apple's patents including "quick links",  "slide-to-unlock" and "auto-correct". The ruling reverses the May 2014 verdict where a federal court in San Jose ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million to Apple.
