Technology major Google on Wednesday launched its digital assistant called 'Google Assistant' for iPhones. Google Assistant on iOS will be able to carry out actions like sending iMessages and playing songs but will not let users perform actions like setting alarms. Notably, Google Assistant has been pegged as direct competition for Apple's own digital assistant 'Siri'.
