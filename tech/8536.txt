Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday launched a mobile application 'Vidyut PRAVAH - Electricity Price & Availability Highlights' that provides information on electricity availability, demand, shortage, and prices. The app will help common people in demanding 24x7 power from their states and will make the state governments more accountable, said the minister.
