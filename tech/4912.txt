Families of victims of the Orlando gay nightclub shooting that left 50 dead have filed a civil lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, and Google for allegedly providing "material support" to help radicalise the shooter Omar Mateen. They claimed that Mateen had not been a member of any terrorist group before he was radicalised by terrorist propaganda on the internet.
