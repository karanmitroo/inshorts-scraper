Scientists at the Queen Mary University of London have developed a sketch-based image retrievalâ€‹ system which could help online shopping consumers search for a product by drawing it. The system's top 10 product retrieval accuracy is claimed to be close to 100% in some product categories. It was trained to match drawings to photos by learning interpretations of hand-drawn sketches.
