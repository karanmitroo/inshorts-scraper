Instagram has banned the eggplant emoji from its newly unveiled function to search for images by emoji, after some users posted it to represent a penis. A search for the 'eggplant' hashtag results in "no tags found". However, the eggplant emoji can still be used in photo captions and provides results when used in the "people" search.
