Electric carmaker Tesla has said CEO Elon Musk will not receive any fixed salary or bonus under a new long-term deal. He will only receive a compensation based on a combination of the company's market capitalisation and operational milestones. The deal also requires Musk to lead the company over the long term while also ensuring flexibility to appoint another CEO.
