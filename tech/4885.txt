The Canadian government has declared high-speed internet a basic telecommunications service and wants its citizens to have access to an unlimited data plan option and speeds of at least 50 Mbps. The internet will be available at homes, businesses, and even along major Canadian roads. Until now, only landline telephone was considered a basic service in the country.
