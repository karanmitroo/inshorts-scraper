British Airways has started rolling out a facial recognition technology at its London Heathrow Airport to allow passengers to go through boarding gates faster. The biometric devices at the airport's main security screening area capture a traveller's features and boarding pass, after which a facial scan at the gate allows them to board the plane without showing documents.
