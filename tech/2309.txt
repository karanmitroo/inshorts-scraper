Apple has filed a patent for a screen that would let users stop people around them from peeping into their devices. The patent describes "displays with adjustable angles-of-view" that use a backlit screen with adjustable lenses. Further, it also describes an "electrically controllable filter layer" that can darken parts of the screen to protect a user's privacy.
