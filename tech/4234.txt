The two primary keyboards used today are mechanical and membrane keyboards. Mechanical keyboards, found in the classic IBM Model M, have buttons with a spring mechanism, and are comparatively louder and are more durable. Membrane keys, found in the Apple keyboard, are made of pressure sensitive pads and don't 'click' like mechanical keys.
