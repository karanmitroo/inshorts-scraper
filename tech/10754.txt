Social network giant Facebook has launched its new feature 'Live' for celebrities to broadcast live videos for their fans. The new feature is available on Facebook Mentions which is only available to verified public figures who are using FB Pages. Unlike Meerkat and Periscope, the live streaming videos will not disappear from Facebook and will stay there until deleted personally.
