After reports of Apple planning to ditch their home button from iPhones, a new report suggests the upcoming 10.9-inch iPad will be the first Apple device to not have a home button. Eliminating the physical home button will allow a larger screen to fit into the iPad, the report said. The home button could be placed underneath the display glass.
