An outdoor screen in Cardiff, UK was hacked earlier this week to broadcast swastikas, a photo of Donald Trump as Pepe the Frog, and other 'offensive' messages. One of the images said, "Warning. This is a Shariah controlled zone. No alcohol. No gambling. No porn," while another displayed George Orwell's novel 1984's quote, "Big Brother is watching you."
