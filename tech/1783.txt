Apple has said iPhone X's Face ID failed to recognise software chief Craig Federighi's face during launch because people tried authenticating their face before the stage demo. During the launch, iPhone X directed Craig to enter a passcode. Apple said, the Face ID failed because the people "weren't Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do...require his passcode."
