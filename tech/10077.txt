Google has updated its Local Guides program under which it is rewarding Guides who frequently contribute in improving Google Maps. Guides that reach level four of the program will get 1TB of free storage space on Google Drive, a service which otherwise costs $9.99 per month. Other lower levels Guides will get perks like early access to new Google products.
