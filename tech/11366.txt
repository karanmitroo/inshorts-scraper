To save time and get rid of complex processes, Andhra Pradesh Circle of India Post is planning to launch an initiative of sending parcels through 'Speed Post' via ATMs in tie-up with SBI. With initial 95 ATMs allotted for this facility, Postmen will visit these ATM's, clear letter boxes and forward it to the section concerned for further delivery.
