Scientists from University College London have created ‘My Text in Your Handwriting’, a program that replicates an individual's handwriting by imitating factors like their specific character choices. The algorithm is able to reproduce any text in the same style as the sample of handwritten text. So far, the team has successfully replicated the handwriting of Abraham Lincoln and Frida Kahlo.
