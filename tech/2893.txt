A German court has lashed out at Google via legal injunction for not doing enough to comply with European Union's "right to be forgotten." The right allows citizens to request search engines to remove links with inaccurate or irrelevant personal information. Google removes the links but the takedown requests remain visible in an online database, which the court has forbidden.
