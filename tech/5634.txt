Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong on Thursday joined the company's board amid a global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. The move gives Lee, the grandson of Samsung's founder, a greater say over top management and in strategic calls, including restructuring and mergers. Notably, his appointment comes on the same day that Samsung reported a 30% decline in profits.
