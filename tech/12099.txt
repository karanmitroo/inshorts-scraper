The world's first zero-gravity 3D printer has been installed on the International Space Station to help astronauts experiment with additive manufacturing in microgravity. NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore installed the printer, designed and built by 'Made In Space' for NASA, inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox. The printer was launched in September aboard the SpaceX 4 resupply mission to the ISS.
