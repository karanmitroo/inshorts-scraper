Technology giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook earlier this week received company stock worth $89 million (â‚¹570 crore), according to filings. Cook received the performance-linked prize as Apple outperformed more than two-thirds of companies in S&P 500 index over past three years. The payout is part of the welcome package to Cook after he succeeded Steve Jobs in 2011.
