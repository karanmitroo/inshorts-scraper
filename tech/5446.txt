South Korean electronics major Samsung, which killed its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone over exploding batteries, will reportedly get rid of the iconic physical home button from its next device, the Galaxy S8. Other reports suggest that Galaxy S8 will come with Samsung's own voice-based assistant and feature an edge-to-edge display. The device is set to launch in early 2017.
