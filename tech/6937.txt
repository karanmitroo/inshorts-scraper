Mumbai-based Biosense has developed ToucHB, a tool that can measure haemoglobin levels in a patient without extracting blood with a needle. Patients can place ToucHB on their right eyes and the device analyses the paleness of their skins and mucous membranes to give instant readings. The anaemia-screening, battery-operated tool is currently being used in 2,000 villages across three states.â€‹
