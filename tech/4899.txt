Expanding its social media outreach, the Ministry of External Affairs on Friday launched a ‘Twitter Seva’ service. This move will centralise its grievance redressal mechanism by bringing over 200 social media handles, including those of Indian Missions and regional passport offices, under one platform. Further, it will provide for the prompt resolution of grievances on a real-time basis.
