Samsung has introduced Voices of Life, an app that aims at connecting mothers to their premature babies. It transmits a mother's voice and heartbeat to her baby inside an incubator. These maternal sounds reportedly enable premature babies to develop a healthy brain. Further, the captured sounds are ‘wombified’, a process which removes high frequencies not present in the womb.
