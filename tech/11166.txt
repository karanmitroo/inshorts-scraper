Lego on Monday launched its very own Minecraft-like video game, called Lego Worlds. The game features procedurally generated landscapes where players can modify their surroundings based on some real-world Lego kits, to create whatever they like. The game is currently in 'Early Access mode' on Windows for $17. Multi-player and sharing features are also missing from the game currently.
