Sony, Panasonic, and Hitachi-LG have settled a class-action lawsuit, making US-based buyers of their decade-old PCs with DVD drives eligible to claim $10 for each drive. These companies were accused of inflating the prices of optical drives sold to PC makers like Dell and HP. A total penalty of $124.5 million has been submitted by the companies.
