In order to support the LGBT community, Facebook on Thurday announced that it has added the ability to select a custom gender. However, the feature will only be available in US for now. The feature also lets users define which pronoun theyâ€™d like to be referred to as - male (he/his), female (she/her) or neutral (they/their).
