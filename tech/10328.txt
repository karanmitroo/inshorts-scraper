Under its 'Project Lightning', microblogging site Twitter on Tuesday launched a new feature 'Moments' in the US, to let users view the day's most shared tweets. The feature adds a lightening bolt tab on the Twitter's mobile app, which opens a list of day's most popular tweets. With Moments, users can also view feeds from accounts they do not follow.
