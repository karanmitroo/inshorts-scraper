US' Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai has cancelled his visit to the world's largest consumer electronics show CES 2018 after receiving death threats, according to reports. This comes after FCC voted 3-2 to repeal Obama-era 'net neutrality' rules in December. Various technologists including Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak had opposed the ending of net neutrality.
