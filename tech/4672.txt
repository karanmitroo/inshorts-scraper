Ukraine-based developers have created 'Hushme', a voice masking Bluetooth headset that lets users have a private telephonic conversation in public. Hushme combines a pair of earphones with a voice mask that covers the mouth. The headset also connects to a smartphone app to let users make their voice sound like Darth Vader, R2D2 or Minions.
