NASA astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams on Friday concluded their nearly six-hour spacewalk after installing a new dock onto the International Space Station (ISS). The dock will be used in 2017 by private companies Boeing and SpaceX to start transporting crew to and from the station, marking it the first such instance for private companies.
