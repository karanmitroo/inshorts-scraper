The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will launch a satellite developed by the students of IIT Bombay. Called ‘Pratham’, the satellite will measure the total electron count of the ionosphere. The satellite was conceptualised by two students of the Aerospace Engineering department - Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay and Shashank Tamaskar - in July 2007.
