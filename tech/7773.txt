US Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has claimed that Apple's Co-founder Steve Jobs did not invent the iPhone. "Technology for the smartphone including the GPS, flatscreen, digital camera and others came from the federal investments in research," Pelosi said. "Steve Jobs did a good idea designing it and putting it together. Federal research invented it," she added.
