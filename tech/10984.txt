Online furnishing business HomeLane.com has launched a virtual reality (VR) based device, the Kaleido, that lets its users choose between different looks while furbishing a room. CEO Srikanth Iyer describes the Google cardboard based product as “a game changer” as it makes it “dramatically convenient” for users to choose the “perfect design, colour and look for their new home”.
