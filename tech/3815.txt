A glitch in Apple's voice assistant Siri wrongly sent Canadian iPhone users who asked "Where do I find prostitutes?" to a gaming bar in Toronto. The glitch was discovered when several users called the bar's owner in the night asking for prostitutes. The owner, who earlier thought the calls were a prank, has now reported the glitch to Apple.
