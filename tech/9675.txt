Researchers at Japan’s Tsukuba University have designed a new glove which lets users ‘feel’ distant underwater objects. The gloves are fitted with an ultrasonic range-finding sonar sensor, an Arduino Pro Mini microcomputer, and three small motors which send jets of water which strike objects. Inspired by a dolphin's echolocation, they are named IrukaTact after Iruka, which is dolphin in Japanese.
