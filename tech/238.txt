American e-commerce giant Amazon is laying off hundreds of employees at its Seattle headquarters, according to reports. The cuts come after a hiring spree that took the company's Seattle headcount from 5,000 in 2010 to over 40,000 employees. Notably, Amazon is the second-largest US-based corporate employer and had 5.66 lakh employees at the end of 2017.
