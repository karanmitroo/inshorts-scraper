According to a book by former Facebook employee Antonio Garcia Martinez, the company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an emergency meeting and declared a lockdown on the day Google Plus was launched in 2011. Martinez claims Zuckerberg hinted at product changes to counter Google's new product in a speech. Martinez also called Zuckerberg's speech 'aloof,' 'geek-speak,' and 'borderline psychopathic.'
