Microsoft-owned smartphone keyboard app maker SwiftKey has launched 'Swiftmoji', a new app into a private beta test on Google Play that suggests a set of emojis while the user is typing. It also offers word suggestions, auto correction, customisation of the keyboard's size and swiping option for input. However, SwiftKey has not yet made a formal announcement about Swiftmojiâ€™s debut.
