Members of the public were allowed on the maglev train of Japan for the first time on Sunday. The train which "floats" above tracks using magnetic levitation hit a speed of 311 mph (500 kmph). Maglev trains are even faster than Japan's bullet trains and are expected to cut the current travel time by half, from 90 to 40 minutes.
