Facebook has upgraded its Messenger app for Windows 10 with the ability to make voice and video calls. This means that Windows 10 Messenger users will now get a phone icon in their app screen, allowing group voice calls or one-on-one video calls within a single window. However, the Windows Phone version has not received the upgrade yet.
