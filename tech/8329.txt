The FBI on Thursday revealed that it spent over a million dollars to unlock the San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook’s iPhone, but hasn't found anything yet. FBI believed that the phone contained data to prove Farook’s relation to Islamic terrorist groups. Notably, the iPhone was unlocked using an alternate method after Apple refused to do so citing privacy concerns.
