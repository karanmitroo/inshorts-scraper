Skin care company Nivea has launched 'Nose', a beta version of an app that alerts men on smelling bad. Combined with a hardware sensor technology inside a mobile cover, it detects the user's odour when the smartphone is placed close to the armpit. The company will launch a consumer version of the app after testing it throughout this year.
