Ringing Bells, the maker of the ‘Freedom 251’ smartphone, has claimed to have refunded its first 30,000 pre-booking orders. It will now only accept the cash-on-delivery mode of payment for the phone that costs ₹251. Company President Ashok Chadha said, "This will ensure further transparency and clear any misgivings”. Ringing Bells plans to sell 25 lakh handsets before June 30.
