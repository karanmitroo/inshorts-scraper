The personal data of over half a million Australian Red Cross blood donors was compromised on Friday. Australian Red Cross CEO Shelly Park said that the data was left unsecured by a contractor who maintains Red Cross' website. The information includes whether the individual had taken drugs or engaged in "at-risk" sexual behaviour like sex work and gay sex.
