At least 10 iPhones were destroyed in an Apple Store in France on Thursday, after a man started smashing the devices with a metal ball. According to reports, he shouted, "Apple is a company that violated European consumers' rights...I told them, 'Give me my money back'. They said no." The man has reportedly been arrested and an investigation is underway.
