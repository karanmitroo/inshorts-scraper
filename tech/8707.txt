Paris-based startup Wezzoo has developed 'Oombrella', a smart umbrella which alerts the user before it rains. Connected through an app, it tracks hyperlocal weather data and alerts 15 minutes before it rains. It also tracks activity and sends a notification to users if it is left behind. A smart capsule is also available separately which can turn any umbrella smart.
