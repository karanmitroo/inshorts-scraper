NASAâ€™s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has completed over six years in orbit, has revealed that the moon is shrinking. The LRO captured pictures of the moon, discovering over 3,000 cliffs or faults. As the core of the moon is cooling, portions of the outer liquid core solidify, causing a decrease in volume and leading to the formation of faults.
