A London-based startup has created an app called 'AirDates' that lets users discover passengers to date while travelling. Users can post their travel itineraries ahead of time to potentially meet other passengers on the same journey. The company's CEO Michael Richard claims that the inside of a plane is the "safest place to have a date."
