Through its Digital News Initiative, Google has given â‚¹5 crore to Press Association for a project under which robots will produce "a daily diet of compelling stories". The project, called Reporters and Data and Robots (RADAR), will produce 30,000 stories a month for various media outlets. However, Press Association claims that the bots will not make human journalists obsolete.
