Image hosting website Photobucket has been accused of blackmail as thousands of listings on online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy were left with error messages in place of images. Users accused Photobucket of 'quietly' introducing a â‚¹26,000 annual fee to embed images on third party websites. The fee was also likened to ransom by some users.
