A US Federal judge on Monday ruled that the government cannot force Apple to unlock an iPhone while hearing a narcotics case in New York. Notably, this comes while Apple is fighting a US government request to unlock the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. Apple has been arguing that the government's request threatens the balance between fighting crime and preserving privacy.
