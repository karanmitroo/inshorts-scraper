Google sheltered about $19.2 billion in 2016 using "Double Irish" and "Dutch Sandwich" tax trick, which saved it around $3.7 billion in taxes, according to Netherlands regulatory filings. The amount of money moved by Google through this tax structure in 2016 was 7% higher than in 2015. Google responded by saying it complies with the tax laws in every country.
