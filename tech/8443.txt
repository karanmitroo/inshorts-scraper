A Hong Kong-based startup has created Move It, an app-connected personal gym equipment for fitness training. The device has four parts and a set of Bluetooth-enabled handles that connects to each of the four parts for different workouts. The workout information is displayed on the app, and the training progress can also be shared with friends.
