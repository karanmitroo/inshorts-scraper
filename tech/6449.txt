MIT engineers are designing an imaging system that can read closed books. The system combines Femtoâ€‹-photography, that captures images trillionths of a second apart, with terahertz radiation, the band of electromagnetic radiation between microwaves and infrared light, to distinguish between ink and paper. The prototype was able to identify letters on the first nine pages of a stack of paper.
