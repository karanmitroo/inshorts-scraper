A hacking duo has explained that the We-Vibe 4 Plus smart vibrators can be remotely activated by anyone. They also revealed that every time the intensity of the vibrator changes or every minute it's in use, the connected app conveys the temperature of the device to the manufacturer. This helps the company gather information about the usage of the device.
