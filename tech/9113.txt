LG unveiled its new Stylus 2 smartphone on Tuesday. The phone sports a stylus with a nano-coated tip instead of a rubber tip for better accuracy. It features a 5.7" HD display, 1.5 GB RAM, 13 MP/8 MP cameras and is powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor. It will release in Asia later this year in three colour variants.
