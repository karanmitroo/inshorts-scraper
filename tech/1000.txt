A class action lawsuit has been filed against Google for selling data of more than five million iPhone or iPad users without consent in the UK. The lawsuit claims that Google accessed users' browsing history, bypassing the default privacy settings on Apple's default browser, Safari. The lawsuit is also aiming to get around $3.6 billion as compensation for the same.
