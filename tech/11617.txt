In a move to strengthen the public distribution system network, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Tuesday launched digitised ration cards for the first time in the state. The move is estimated to benefit more than five crore people, the CM posted on Facebook. Digitisation will also help the government check fake ration cards.
