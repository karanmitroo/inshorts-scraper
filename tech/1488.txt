Facebook on Friday launched a service in the United States, through which users can order food and get it delivered by using Facebook's app or website. The feature allows users to browse nearby restaurants by visiting the 'Order Food' section on Facebook's 'Explore' menu. The social media giant has partnered with food ordering services like Delivery.com for the same.
