LinkedIn has launched a new app, called LinkedIn Students, aimed at helping college students find a job. The app suggests companies and job roles based on the schools attended by users and the subjects they major in. Available in the US on Android and iOS, the app delivers career advice content and also lists alumni working at recommended companies.
