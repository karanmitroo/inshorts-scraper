Facebook on Tuesday launched a new feature for photos called 'Slideshows'. It will pre-make a slideshow of more than five photos or videos taken by users in the last 24 hours and pop it in their News Feed. Available currently on iOS, the feature will also let users customise their slideshows through 10 different themes including nostalgic, playful and bollywood.
