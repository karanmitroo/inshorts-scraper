Alphabet’s high-speed internet business, Google Fiber's CEO Gregory McCray has quit the company only five months after taking over the role. The reasons for McCray’s departure are unclear, but he didn’t have a smooth term as his first address to employees made several of them upset. "I’m confident we'll find an amazing person to lead," said Google Co-founder Larry Page.
