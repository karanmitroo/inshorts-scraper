French company Enhancia has unveiled a MIDI ring at CES 2018 which allows a user to trigger musical effects like pitch bends or vibrato by making specific movements while playing a keyboard. The lightweight ring communicates with a hub connected to the computer. The hub charges the ring and also directs which effects are mapped to which movements.
