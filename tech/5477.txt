The research arm of Disney has developed a 360Â° virtual reality (VR) application that lets users 'feel' the rain. Using a specially-designed chair and VR headset, the app provides full body sensation and enables users to customise the effects from light sprinkle to heavy downpour. The chair has a grid of six vibrating sensors and two subwoofers to provide sensations.
