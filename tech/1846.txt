A team of professors from ETH Zurich university has started a project to design and build a three-storey DFAB house using a team of robots and 3D printers. The robots weave steel-wire walls into complex patterns filled with concrete to construct the 656 -square-foot house. The house is scheduled to be completed in 2018.
