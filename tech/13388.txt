Google shuts down Reader, which allowed users to read various news feeds and articles in one central Web application, on July 1, citing a drop in usage and a shift toward a smaller selection of Google services. As alternatives to it, experts highly recommend Digg Reader and Feedly. The other options include The Old Reader, Flipboard and AOL Reader.
