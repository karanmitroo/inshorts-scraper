Google has started testing a feature on Android that lets users post video reviews on Maps. Available under Google's Local Guides program, it lets users record a 10-second video directly through the Google Maps app or upload up to 30-second video from their camera roll. Users can select a place in Maps and tap camera icon to record the video.
