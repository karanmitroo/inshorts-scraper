Ahmedabad has become the first Indian city to get an Intelligent Traffic System (ITS), which is a pilot project to alert commuters about the traffic situation. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) launched the project in association with Japanese firm Zero Sum Ltd, on a 10-km stretch. After its successful completion, the project would be extended to other cities of Gujarat.
