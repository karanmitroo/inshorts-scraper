Hong Kong-based LAAB architects has converted a 309-square-foot apartment into a smart transformable home with guest bedroom, kitchen, bathtub, home theatre and gym. Spaces open and close according to the userâ€™s needs at a particular time, wherein a space that holds a bathtub in the morning becomes a bedroom at night. The entire house was built within tolerances of 3mm.
