Facebook has begun placing warnings over videos posted to its site, stating their contents might "shock, offend and upset" if viewed, preventing videos from getting auto-downloaded unless clicked. They will also place checks on displaying objectionable content to users who have identified themselves as under-18. The move comes after pressure from Facebook's own safety advisers.
