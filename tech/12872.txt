Nokia will unveil a low-cost smartphone running a version of Google Inc's Android operating system at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this month, said a Wall Street Journal report. However, Nokia and Microsoft has declined to comment. Reportedly, Nokiaâ€™s Android phone will be aimed at emerging markets and will not feature some of Google's higher-end, custom Android features.
