Chinese startup AvatarMind has created a three-foot robot nanny named 'iPal' to look after the kids aged between 3-8 years. The robot's autonomous learning engine helps it to remember the kids' preferences and interests in order to improve the conversation. It constantly takes photos and videos of the kids, which can be accessed by the parents on their smartphones.
