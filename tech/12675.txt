An experiment in energy-saving road design kicked off along a 500-meter stretch of highway in Oss, Netherlands, where civil engineering firm ‘Heijmans’ is testing "glow in the dark" lane lines as a possible alternative to overhead lights (or street lights). The trial run is the first real-world application of designer Daan Roosegaarde's "Smart Highway" concept.
