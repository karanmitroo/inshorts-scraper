Facebook will become the worldâ€™s biggest virtual graveyard by 2098, according to researchers from the University of Massachusetts. The social network, which currently has 1.5 billion users worldwide, will also have more profiles of dead people than of living users by the end of the century. This will happen because Facebook refuses to delete the accounts of dead users.
