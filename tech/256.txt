Cryptocurrency mining websites have been hijacking Android phones to mine cryptocurrency Monero, according to cybersecurity firm MalwareBytes. The researchers claimed that infected apps with 'malicious' ads steered users toward the websites. The firm estimated that at least two of the sites had over 30 million visits per month, and the combined domains had about 800,000 visits per day.
