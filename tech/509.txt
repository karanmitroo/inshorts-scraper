Social media platforms YouTube and Facebook are removing videos that show people eating detergent as part of a challenge. Both platforms said their policies do not allow for the "promotion of physical harm and self-injury". This comes after the 'Tide Pod Challenge' went viral on social media, as part of which people ingested detergent pods.
