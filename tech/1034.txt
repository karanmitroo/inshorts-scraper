Mozilla's Firefox internet browser will notify users when they visit websites which are known to have faced a recent breach, Mozilla developer Nihanth Subramanya confirmed. Mozilla has partnered with website 'Have I Been Pwned' that allows users to check if their passwords have been compromised, for the purpose. However, the feature will not prohibit users from accessing the websites.
