Micromax, in partnership with Visa and TranServ, has launched a native digital wallet app called Udio. Besides being usable online, the wallet can also be used offline at mVisa-enabled stores. mVisa is a card-to-merchant payment service where users can scan QR codes to make payments. Micromax is also working on enabling contactless payments via NFC on its future smartphones.
