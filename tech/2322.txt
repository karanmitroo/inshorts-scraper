China has taken down two online chat robots over 'unpatriotic' comments. On being asked whether it loved the Communist Party, one of the bots replied, "No", while the other dodged a question on its patriotism with, "I'm having my period, wanna take a rest." The bots are believed to have learnt the responses from users of Chinese app Tencent QQ.
