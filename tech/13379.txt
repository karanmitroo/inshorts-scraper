Micro-blogging site Twitter has announced plans to show 'tailor-made' adverts based on users' browsing patterns(using cookies) - although their personal email addresses will be unreadable, adding that the ad pilot is US-only. But the users can opt out of the third-party access by way of un-checking a box in their account settings unlike Facebook, Google and Amazon.
