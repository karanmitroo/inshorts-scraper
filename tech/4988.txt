Apple on Tuesday rolled out the iOS 10.2 update which introduces a 'Panic' or SOS button for iPhones and iPads in India. The emergency button, which is Apple's first India-specific feature, will automatically dial '112' when the power button is rapidly pressed a specific number of times. India will start its countrywide single emergency number 112 from January 1, 2017.
