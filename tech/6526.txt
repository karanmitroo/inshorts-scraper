Google on Tuesday said that it was rolling out 'Shop the Look', a tool that provides users with purchase links to clothes and accessories directly from the Search page. Users will be able to search for terms like "summer dress" and "cocktail attire" to view a gallery of outfits from which they can buy the featured products.
