A 16-year-old Panipat student, Arsh Shah Dilbagi has built a device called 'TALK', which uses signals from a person's breath via Morse code, picked up by a sensor, and then converts them into speech. Dilbagi has entered the Google's Global Science Fair as the only finalist from Asia this year, for developing a device that helps people with developmental disabilities.
