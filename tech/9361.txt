Google on Tuesday announced a new feature that lets YouTube video uploaders attach a donation card to their videos. The donation card lets video uploaders raise money for verified non-profits of their choice. Donations from any country can be made through the information button on the video, but uploaders can only choose from US-based 501(c)3 public non-profits.
