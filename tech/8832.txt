Facebook has launched a revamped version of its Messenger app on Android. The Material Design-styled overhaul features a blue navigation bar at the top of the screen with buttons to access chat, groups and settings, among other things. At the bottom, there's a floating action button thatÂ lets users carry out common actions like search, adding contacts and making a call.
