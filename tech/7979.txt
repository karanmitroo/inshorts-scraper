Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted that prices for the iPhones in India are high during an interview to NDTV. “The duties and the taxes and the compounding of those takes the price and it makes it very high," said Cook. "Our profitability is less in India, it’s materially less — but still I recognise that prices are high”, he added.
