In a bid to promote its intelligent parking assist technology, Japanese automaker Nissan has developed self-parking office chairs that automatically park themselves with a single clap of the hand. Called Okamura, theÂ chairs are tracked by four wall motion cameras and are simultaneously controlled via Wi-Fi. However, the chairs are not expected to hit the market anytime soon.
