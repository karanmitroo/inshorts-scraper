Luke Bannister, a 15-year-old British drone racer, has led his team Tornado X-Blades Banni UK to the first World Drone Prix title held in Dubai. The team beat the Russian and Dutch sides in the 591-metre 12-lap final race. The races, lasting around 10 minutes, saw pilots wearing head-gear linked to the live-feed from their drones.
