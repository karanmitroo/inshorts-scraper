Boston-based startup Kuvée has developed a smart wine bottle that keeps wine fresh for 30 days. The 750 ml bottle features a rechargeable touchscreen that displays the history of the wine, suggests food pairings, estimates how much wine is left and provides personalised wine recommendations. Priced between $15 and $50, Kuvée has also raised $6 million in funding.
