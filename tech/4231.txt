The website of the Ministry of Home Affairs was hacked on Sunday, prompting the National Informatics Centre to temporarily block it, an official said. Meanwhile, the computer emergency response teams are looking into the incident. In January, the website of National Security Guard (NSG) was hacked by suspected Pakistan-affiliated operatives and anti-India content was posted on it.
