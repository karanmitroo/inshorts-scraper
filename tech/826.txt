Virgin Hyperloop One has achieved a record speed of nearly 387 kmph during its third phase of testing at hyperloop test site in the US. The record breached the previous record of 309 kmph, which was achieved by the high-speed transportation technology startup in August. Hyperloop One's pods use electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation to travel in near-vacuum tubes.
