Apple has said that it "needs a little more time" before it can start selling its $159 AirPods that were to launch in October. The wireless earphones were unveiled by Apple at its event in September to accompany the iPhone 7 smartphones which don't have a headphone jack. Apple did not say how long the AirPods will be delayed for.
