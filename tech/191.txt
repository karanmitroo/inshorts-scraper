A Belgian court has ordered Facebook to stop tracking people on third party websites or pay a $125 million fine. The court also ruled Facebook had to delete all the data it gathered illegally on Belgians, including people who were not Facebook users. "It also does not gain our consent to collect and store all this information," the court said.
