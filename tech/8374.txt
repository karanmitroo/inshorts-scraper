A Greece-based startup has developed 'Kyon', a smart pet collar that tracks pets' emotions, location and calls the owner in case the pet is lost. The collar also pacifies pets from entering into fights with the other pets. With battery life of a month in a single charge, it also alerts owners if their pet is drowning or feeling sick.
