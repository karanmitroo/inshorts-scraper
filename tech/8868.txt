Swabhimaanya, an organisation authorised by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), has created India’s first Aadhaar Card-linked app for instant verification of citizens. Called ‘TrustId’, the app specifically aims at authenticating domestic helps and workers from the unorganized sector. Each user will get 25 free credit checks, after which ₹5 will be charged for each credit check.
