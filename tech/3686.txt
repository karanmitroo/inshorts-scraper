Android Co-founder Andy Rubin on Monday showed his smartphone startup's first device, which looks like a bezel-less smartphone. Bezel-less smartphones are supposed to have an edge-to-edge display where bezel, the border surrounding the smartphone's display at the edges, does not exist. This comes after SoftBank cancelled $100 million funding to Rubin's startup 'Essential'.
