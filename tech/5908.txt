German automaker BMW's 2017 5 series will be the first vehicle to feature Apple's wireless CarPlay infotainment system. Drivers will no longer have to connect their iPhone via USB to replace the car’s central software with Apple’s version. This will allow the phone and its apps to be operated via the in-car screen via touch control or an iDrive Controller.
