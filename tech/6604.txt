IBM's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Watson has created the first-ever AI-made movie trailer, for an upcoming 20th Century Fox movie 'Morgan'. Scientists fed Watson with 100 horror movie trailers, on which the supercomputer performed visual, audio and composition analysis to find what people find scary. The AI then selected ten scenes from the full movie for a human editor to arrange.
