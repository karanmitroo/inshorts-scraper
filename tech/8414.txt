The Canadian Police reportedly had access to BlackBerry Messenger conversations through the company's 'master encryption key' since 2010, according to recent court documents. The Canadian police during an investigation intercepted over 1 million messages sent through Blackberry Messenger between 2010 and 2012. However, the documents do not specify how the police obtained the key.
