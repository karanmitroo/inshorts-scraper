A Senegalese man has been sentenced to five years in prison in the US for selling pirated CDs and DVDs that would've been worth â‚¹5 crore if sold legitimately. The pirated content included movies like Kung Fu Panda and The Dark Knight. The man fled the US after pleading guilty in 2010 and was eventually arrested in Morocco last year.
