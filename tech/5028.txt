A new Mac app called 'Touch Bar Piano' has been launched that turns Apple's latest MacBook Pro's Touch Bar or the touch sensitive strip on the keyboard, into playable piano keys. It's even possible to pick out individual keys to play a song. The app includes 127 other instruments, including stringed instruments and choir sounds.
