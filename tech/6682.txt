British-born computer engineer John Ellenby, who had pioneered the development of laptops, died earlier this month at the age of 75 in San Francisco, US. The cause of his death is yet to be determined. Ellenby founded Grid Systems, a company known for making the first commercially successful clamshell laptop, the Compass, which went on sale in 1982 for $8,150.
