Apple has paid over â‚¹3 crore in fine for operating and closing two hazardous waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. Both the plants together created at least 8 lakh kilograms of electronic waste from Apple devices. Apple described its conduct as "an oversight in paperwork" that did not affect its health and safety standards.
