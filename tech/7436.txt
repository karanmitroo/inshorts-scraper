The families of five Israeli and US citizens killed by Palestinian attacks have filed a lawsuit against Facebook seeking $1 billion in damages. In the lawsuit, the social network was accused of playing a key role in the Palestinian fundamentalist organisation Hamas's ability to plan and carry out the terrorist activities, by facilitating communication and recruitment.
