Users of Apple's older smartphones like iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S have reported battery failure on their devices after updating to iOS 10.1.1. Some users said that the battery drains completely in 20 minutes, while others complained that their devices turn off when the battery falls below 30% charge. Apple has not yet responded to the complaints.
