China on Thursday opened its first highway with built-in wireless charging systems for electric vehicles in the country's Shandong province. The one-kilometre-long road contains over 10,000 photovoltaic panels that convert sunlight into electricity. China has become the world's second country to construct a photovoltaic highway after France which introduced a road fitted with solar panels in 2016.
