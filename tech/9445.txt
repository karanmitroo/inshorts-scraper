Facebook has said that it is bringing Apple’s 3D touch feature to its timeline, allowing iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus users to preview content without leaving their current page. The feature, called Peek and Pop, takes advantage of Apple's latest iPhones' pressure-sensitive screen to enable users to hard-press on links to preview content before deciding to actually open the page.
