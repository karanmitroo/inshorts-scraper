A US-based legal firm has sued Apple over a touchscreen problem in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, accusing it of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty. The issue, which was reported last week, causes a grey bar to appear at the top of the phone, rendering the entire screen unresponsive. Apple reportedly denied repairs of such phones.
