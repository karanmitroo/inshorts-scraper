Uber has claimed that its self-driving car program never possessed or used the technology over which Google spinoff Waymo has sued it. Waymo's lawsuit accuses former Google engineers of downloading confidential files about its custom 'LiDAR' technology for self-driving cars and then joining Uber. However, Uber maintains it still uses commercially available LiDAR systems and not a custom version.
