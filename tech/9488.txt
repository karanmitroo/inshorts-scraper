Facebook on Wednesday launched an online Sports Stadium to allow sports enthusiasts to discuss games in real-time. The virtual platform features live play-by-play action, live commentary, news, individual plays, scores and other such stats. To access the Sports Stadium, users have to search Facebook’s main app by game, which will then lead them to the dashboard of the specific sport.
