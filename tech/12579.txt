Google on Tuesday announced the debut of a 64-bit version of Chrome for Windows, starting with the introduction of 64-bit Dev and Canary channels. Google explains that going 64-bit has three main advantages: speed, security and stability. Based on Chrome’s six-week development process, we don’t expect a 64-bit version of Chrome beta or Chrome stable before August at the earliest.
