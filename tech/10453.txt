Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that the company was close to shipping the test of a button to express empathy on posts that are inappropriate to Like. “We didn’t want to just build a Dislike button because we don’t want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people’s posts,” he said.
