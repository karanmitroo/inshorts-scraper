A new version of the autonomous sit-to-stand desk which remembers the perfect sitting and standing heights was launched on Thursday on Product Hunt. It is available at $299 with a 5-year warranty and 30-day trial. The company will release its iOS & Android app in February which will respond to voice-based commands, used for services like ordering cab or food.
