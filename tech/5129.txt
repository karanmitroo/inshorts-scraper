Apple is reportedly planning to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service. The company is assembling a team of robotics and data collection experts to use drones to capture and update Maps faster than the camera-equipped minivans it currently uses. Apple drones will monitor street signs and track areas that are under construction.
