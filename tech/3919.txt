Google in 2009 hired goats to mow its lawns at their headquarters in California, United States. Under Google's 'low-carbon approach', about 200 goats spent roughly a week eating the grass and fertilising at the same time. Referring to the event, Google's blog stated that the goats were "a lot cuter to watch than lawn mowers".
