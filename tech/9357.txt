Google in America is reportedly testing solar-powered drones to deliver high-speed internet from the air under a project named 'SkyBender'. Google is using these drones to experiment with a technology that could possibly form 5G wireless internet, which will be 40 times faster than the 4G network. Google is planning to deliver internet access throughout the world with self-flying aircraft.
