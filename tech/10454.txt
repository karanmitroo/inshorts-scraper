According to media reports, Facebook is developing a virtual reality application that would allow users to view videos filmed in 360 degrees just by tilting their phones. The stand-alone application would enable this through a multi-camera setup. Besides acquiring VR firm Oculus VR last year, Facebook had announced in March its plans to support spherical videos within its News Feed.
