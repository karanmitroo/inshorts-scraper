A chatbot lawyer called 'DoNotPay', created by Stanford University student Joshua Browder, has reportedly saved its clients nearly â‚¹60 crore by defeating about 3.75 lakh parking tickets in two years. The artificial intelligence-powered bot, available in US and UK, lets users search for queries like, "I got an unfair parking ticket" and generates appeal letters on a case-to-case basis.
