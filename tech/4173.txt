Pavement lights have been embedded into a pedestrian crossing in Netherlands' Bodegraven-Reeuwijk municipality to help smartphone users cross the road safely. The light strips, meant for people looking down at their devices, switch between red and green to signal when it is safe to cross. Councillor Kees Oskam said people were increasingly distracted by â€œsocial media, games, WhatsApp and music."
