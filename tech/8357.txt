California-based startup Magic Instruments has developed 'Rhythm Guitar', a digital guitar that does not have any strings along its fretboard. Instead, each fret has been replaced by a button, which represents an entire chord, rather than a single note. The device comes with a mobile application, featuring instructions on how to play some of the most popular songs.
