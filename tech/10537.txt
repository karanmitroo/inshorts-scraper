According to a Facebook post by CEO Jan Koum, WhatsApp hit 900 million monthly active users on Friday. This represents a 50% growth rate of the company in the last one year. The messaging service, that charged $1 per year before getting acquired by Facebook for $19 billion, is speculated to be finally inching closer to an actual business model.
