Google has removed the highlighted carousel, which showed illegal torrent sites like The Pirate Bay and TorrentFreak, on searching 'best torrent sites'. This comes after Google faced criticism for the same. A Google spokesperson said that the carousel "wasn't working in the intended manner" and the company has fixed the issue now.
