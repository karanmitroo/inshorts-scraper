NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has resumed the relaying of information, after a brief hiatus, during which its software was being upgraded. Curiosity is now continuing to drill into the Martian soil. Currently, the rover is exploring the lower regions of Mount Sharp known as Aeolis Mons. Earlier this month, Curiosity drilled into a crystal-rich rock called "Mojave" at Gale Crater.
