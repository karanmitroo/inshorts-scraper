China-based Hangzhou Bina Industrial Technology Company is reportedly threatening to fire its employees if they buy the new iPhone 7, amid allegations that Apple programmers could be 'anti-Chinese'. The company has posted a notice in its offices titled 'Patriotism' for its 50-strong workforce. It has also instructed its employees to trade in their existing iPhone handsets for China-made phones.
