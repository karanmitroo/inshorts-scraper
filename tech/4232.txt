Nature Cycles, a fertility app which algorithmically monitors female fertility has become the world's first smartphone app to be officially approved for use as contraception. The app can now be prescribed by doctors in Europe and the UK instead of condoms or IUDs. Nature Cycles tells women when they can have sex with little risk of getting pregnant.
