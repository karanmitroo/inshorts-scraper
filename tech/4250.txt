Online travel company Expedia's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi ended the firm's earnings call this week by telling investors, "Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year." Khosrowshahi, who is an immigrant from Iran, reportedly said this with reference to US President Donald Trump's policies. Expedia has also filed a legal challenge against the immigration ban.
