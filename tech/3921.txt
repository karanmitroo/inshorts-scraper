Apple's former Senior Vice President of Retail Ron Johnson has revealed that the company's Co-founder Steve Jobs initially called the idea of having tech support stations in Apple stores called 'Genius Bar' idiotic. "I've never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people...You can call it the Geek Bar," Johnson recalled Jobs as saying.
