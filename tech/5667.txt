Google has acquired US-based eye-tracking startup Eyefluence to reportedly integrate the technology in its new Virtual Reality (VR) headset. Eyefluence enables users wearing head-mounted VR glasses to use their eyes as a mouse and make selections only with their eye movements. Founded in 2013, the startup had raised a total of $21.6 million (over â‚¹144 crore) from two funding rounds.
