Yahoo, which disclosed the world's largest data breach of one billion accounts last year, said on Thursday that another 32 million user accounts were hacked in the last two years. An unauthorised third party accessed the company's code to hack the accounts, said Yahoo. Earlier, Verizon, which is buying Yahoo, lowered its original offer by $350 million to $4.48 billion.
