A startup founded by three college friends, 'Cafe X' has opened a coffee shop in San Francisco that is entirely run by one robot. The robot works inside a glass kiosk and uses beans from local coffee shops to create a variety of coffees. The customers can order coffee either through tablets placed on kiosks or through the cafe's app.
