Scientists have developed the first 3D mini lungs from stem cells. These 3D structures are more similar to the human lungs than the previously made 2D structures, as per researchers. The scientists used embryonic stem cells, proteins that help in development of lungs, growth factors and protein mixture in a Petri dish for the experiment.
