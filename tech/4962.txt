A US court has ordered a suspect to surrender his iPhone 5 passcode to police for obtaining evidence in a case against him. This counters another US court ruling in a case where it said suspects can be asked to unlock phone with their fingerprint, but can't be forced to reveal their password as it violates their rights against self-incrimination.
