Todd Katz, a former oil services firm executive who was sued for pretending to be Tesla CEO Elon Musk in an email, has accused Tesla of hacking his Twitter account. Katz also argued that the email sent was too "goofy" to be believed and "nobody who received this...grammatically deficient email ever believed that it really came from Elon Musk".
