The Baltic nation of Estonia has blocked its residents' identity cards after finding a security flaw in the ID chips, leaving individuals vulnerable to identity theft. ID cards issued from October 2014 to October 25, 2017, will be frozen until owners apply for updated certificates with the fix. The online identity system gives citizens access to government and private services.
