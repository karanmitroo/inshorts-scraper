Japanese metal band 'Crossfaith' has launched a website that lets visitors headbang to its music while tracking their movements using the webcam. The website checks if the visitor headbangs continuously and gives headbang count and artwork at the end. The website senses when the listener gets tired and gives ten seconds to start headbanging 'energetically', or the progress is reset.
