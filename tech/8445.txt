Based on a US Navy technology, a startup has created an adjustable belt strap called MiClimate which can be worn around the waist to control body temperature. The small vents within the belt direct heated or cooled air to the user's body. With a four-hour battery life, the device can cool down 10°C and heat up 20°C from ambient temperature.
