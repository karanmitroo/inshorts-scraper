Ronald Wayne, Apple's third co-founder along with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, recently admitted that he's never owned an Apple product in his life. Wayne sold his 10% stake in Apple for $800 just 12 days after it was incorporated in 1976. It is estimated that his shares would have been worth $67 billion now.
