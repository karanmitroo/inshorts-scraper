Apple has admitted that it slows down old iPhone models that have low capacity batteries to avoid unexpected shutdowns. In a statement, the company said the Lithium-ion batteries lose charge as they age, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its components. Earlier, users had reported perceived slowdowns of their smartphones due to new iOS updates.
