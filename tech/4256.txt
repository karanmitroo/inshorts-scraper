A New Zealand-based software engineer has claimed he put the motherboard of his Nexus 5X smartphone in an oven to fix a bootloop issue. The man said he heated the motherboard placed on crushed aluminium foil to fix a poorly soldered joint. LG is offering a full refund to users whose Nexus 5X phones were restarting repeatedly, rendering them useless.
