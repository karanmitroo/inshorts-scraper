Samsung has rolled out support for content and ad blocking on its Android smartphones. The update is being launched on devices running the Android Lollipop or a higher operating system. However, the feature will only work in the default Samsung Internet Browser, and not any third-party browser like Google Chrome. Last year, Apple had also rolled out ad blocking support within Safari.
