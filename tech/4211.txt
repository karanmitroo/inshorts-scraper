Ride-sharing service Uber announced that it has deployed its mapping technology in Singapore, making Asia the fifth continent in which the billion-dollar startup is mapping roads to take on Google Maps. The move will help Uber develop more precise traffic patterns and pick-up and drop-off locations. The road data will be collected using additional technology on existing Uber taxis.
