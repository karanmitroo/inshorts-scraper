Researchers from the Queen’s University have developed the world’s first flexible display smartphone named ReFlex. The phone senses the force with which a user bends the screen, allowing them to experience physical tactile feedback when interacting with apps through bend gestures. For example, users can play Angry Birds on the smartphone by bending the screen to stretch the slingshot.
