In a development to create self-charged personal electronics, Chinese scientists have developed a new device that can charge smartphones on the go - without the need for an electrical cord. A nanogenerator, incorporated directly into a cellphone, could harvest and convert vibration energy from a surface, such as the passenger seat of a moving vehicle, into power for the phone.
