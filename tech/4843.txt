California-based startup Byte Foods has raised $5.5 million (â‚¹37.5 crore) in seed funding for its smart vending machines in office spaces. The machines let users take out items and examine them without charging as long as the items are placed back. Byte Foods also developed software to predict demand for different items at each office where its machines are stationed.
