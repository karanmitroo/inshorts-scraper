A Reddit user on Monday asked Bill Gates, "Did you copy Steve Jobs or did he copy you?" during the billionaire's fifth 'Ask Me Anything' session. Bill Gates replied, "The main 'copying' relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did...their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows."
