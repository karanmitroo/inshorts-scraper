Google’s e-mail service Gmail was launched in an invitation-only beta version on April 1, 2004. Launched with 1 GB of storage capacity per user and a search-oriented interface, Gmail in 2014 became the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion installations. The launch was initially met with skepticism due to it falling on April Fool’s Day.
