Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton's sister Pippa Middleton's iCloud account was recently attacked by hackers who stole 3,000 photos from the account. Besides Pippa's photos, the stolen photos include images of Kate and her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The photos were offered on WhatsApp to two publishers by an anonymous seller who asked for $65,000 within 48 hours.
