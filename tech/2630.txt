The Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport on Thursday said a battery bank caused a minor explosion and caught fire after an angry passenger threw it on being told he couldn't bring it onboard his flight. The airport reiterated electronic devices are not allowed in cabin baggage on UK-bound flights. Several passengers shared photos of smoke at the airport's gate on social media.
