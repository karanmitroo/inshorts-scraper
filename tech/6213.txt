Micro-blogging site Twitter is reportedly in talks with technology majors Google and Salesforce for a potential sale and may receive a formal bid soon. The potential buyers of Twitter are said to be interested in the data the company generates. Founded in 2006, Twitter's user growth has stalled and revenue has fallen in the last two years.
