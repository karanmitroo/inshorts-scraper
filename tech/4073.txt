Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs' biography author claims Jobs' silver Mercedes car never had a number plate as he didn't want to be tracked. Reports suggest Jobs found a loophole in California laws, allowing cars less than six months old to drive without plates. He made an arrangement with a leasing company to exchange his car for a new one regularly.
