Astronomers have confirmed the discovery of the nearest rocky planet outside of our solar system. The planet, named HD 219134b, takes three days to orbit its host star, and is 21-light years away. About 1.6 times the size of earth, it's too close to its host star to sustain life. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has confirmed the finding.
