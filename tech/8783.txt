US-based Arx Pax unveiled a new hoverboard that uses magnetic field architecture, enabling its hover engines to float over conductive surfaces like copper and aluminium. The engines generate a magnetic field to create small closed loops of electricity called 'eddy currents' upon interacting with such surfaces. These currents then create a magnetic field within the surface, lifting the hoverboard.
