US-based startup iFutureLab has created a device called 'FitSleep', that lets users fall asleep faster. Put beneath a pillow or mattress, FitSleep tracks users' heart rate, respiration rate, body movements and sleep patterns to emit alpha waves of 0-13 Hz. These waves accelerate the time taken by the users to fall asleep and reach the deep sleep phase.
