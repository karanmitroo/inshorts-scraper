Journalist Barkha Dutt's verified Twitter account was hacked on Saturday, with hackers posting over 10 tweets that included obscenities. "Long live the Legion. Catch one of us? Gotta catch 'em all... The idea shall never die!", one of the tweets read. The group responsible for this hack had earlier hacked Rahul Gandhi's and Vijay Mallya's Twitter account.
