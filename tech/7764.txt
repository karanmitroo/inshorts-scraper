Apple on Monday launched the developer version of 'watchOS 3' on the first day of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The operating system claims to be seven times faster than the old one and features iPhone-like control for apps, 'Scribble' for quick replies and a special mode for disabled. Apple is also working on an SOS button for medical emergencies.
