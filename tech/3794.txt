The FBI has arrested a man three months after he allegedly tweeted a seizure-inducing flashing image to a journalist with epilepsy. The tweet also said, "You deserve a seizure for your post." Upon searching the perpetrator's iCloud account, the police found a screenshot of a fake Wikipedia page for the journalist with date of death listed as December 16, 2016.
