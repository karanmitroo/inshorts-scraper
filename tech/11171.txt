Google has launched an initiative 'The Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities' to support emerging technologies that help people with disabilities live independently. Googleâ€™s charitable division Google.org will award up to $20M in grants to non-profit start-ups like E-Nable that work on assistive technologies. The programme is already on and will accept ideas until September 30, 2015.
