Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has said that Twitter mistakenly pointed to the wrong reason for not taking action against anti-Muslim videos retweeted by US President Donald Trump. Earlier, Twitter had said it believes there is "a legitimate public interest" in availability of the videos. Retracting from the comment, Twitter said, the videos are permitted based on its current media policy.
