Google Maps has received a 'Catching Pokémon' feature on the Android app that allows users  to indicate when and where they have been playing Pokémon Go. Available under the 'Your Timeline' option in the Google Maps, the feature indicates the distance a user has covered while playing the game. Notably, Pokémon Go doesn’t offer a tracking functionality yet.
