Europe's Sweden opened its first ever electric road on Wednesday to provide power for heavy hybrid electric transports on public roads on a pilot basis. The two-kilometre long electric road's technology is similar to the light rail, with contact lines 5.4 meters over the roadway. The lines can provide up to 750 volts DC of electricity to a truck.
