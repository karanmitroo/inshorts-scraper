The US Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Chief Technology Officer Eric Burger had expressed concerns about the plan to repeal net neutrality rules, according to reports. In an email to FCC commissioner's office, Burger said that ending net neutrality "is not in the public interest." On Thursday the FCC voted 3-2 in favour of repealing net neutrality, claiming it stifled competition.
