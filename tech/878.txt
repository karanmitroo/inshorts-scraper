While talking about billionaire Elon Musk-led electric car maker Tesla, American investor Jim Chanos has said that the company "is headed for a brick wall". He also said his short against Tesla has lost him money and he doesn't know when the company's stock will decline. "When Tesla's stock price will fall, the company will fall," he added.
