Israel's Space Communication company on Sunday said that it could seek $50 million or a free space flight from SpaceX. The company's satellite was destroyed by an explosion at the company's Falcon 9 rocket launch last week. The Israeli company said that it could also collect $205 million from Israel Aerospace Industries, which built the satellite.
