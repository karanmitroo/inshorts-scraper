Germany's highest court has ordered parents of three children to pay a â‚¹2.4 lakh fine after someone in the house illegally downloaded Rihanna's 2010 album "Loud." The state prosecutor reportedly said that nobody will be forced to "deliver their children at knifepoint," but if parents refuse to name the guilty party, whoever pays the internet bill will be held responsible.
