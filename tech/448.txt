The US state of Washington has  reportedly tabled a bill that aims to ban devices containing "difficult or impossible to remove" batteries. With a potential start date of January 1, 2019, the law would require portable devices to be repairable rather than disposable. This comes after Apple admitted to slowing down older iPhones with iOS updates due to ageing batteries.
