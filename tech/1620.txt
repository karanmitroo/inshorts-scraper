Germany and UK-based researchers have developed computer chips that use light rather than electricity, mimicking the way brain's synapses operate, while being a thousand times faster. Conventional computers are "relatively slow" and "pretty dumb", and consume more power when made faster, said researchers. Developing brain-like computers has long been the "holy grail" of scientists, they added.
