Google claims its self-driving cars have been taught to perfectly execute a three-point turn, a method of turning a vehicle around in a narrow space. The cars reportedly had to be taught to choose the option that's the quickest and "feels natural to passengers". They were therefore taught to 'mimic' human patterns, favouring wider forward arcs rather than short movements.
