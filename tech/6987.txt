Thai telecommunications regulator NBTC on Tuesday said that it will set no-go zones for Pok√©mon Go players to keep them off limits from prominent tourist destinations. Places like Royal Palace grounds, Buddhist temples, hospitals and government buildings will come under the purview of the new regulation. The game's master licensee will ask developers to withdraw such locations from the app.
