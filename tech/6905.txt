A startup has developed a pair of smart rings called 'HB Rings' that allows couples to send and receive each other's heartbeat in real-time. Connected through an app, the steel rings send the user's heartbeat to the paired ring on a single tap. Each ring lasts for about 14 hours on a single charge and has a scratchproof sapphire surface.
