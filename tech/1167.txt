Photo-sharing platform Instagram has started testing a feature for selected users which allows them to follow hashtags, like other user accounts. According to the feature, an option to follow hashtags appears to "see top posts and recent stories" when a user clicks on them. However, Instagram has declined to share any information regarding the feature.
