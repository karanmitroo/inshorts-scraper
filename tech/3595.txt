Technology major Apple has received a patent for an anti-shock device that will protect smartphones from falls and float if the phone contacts a water surface. The patent details a spring-loaded bumper system that deploys when it detects that the phone is in free-fall. The 'bumper cushions' may also be coloured to better the appearance of smartphones, Apple added.
