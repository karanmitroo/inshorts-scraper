Google Maps on Friday rolled out an Android update to let users personalise their home and office address by selecting stickers from a set of 24 stickers. The stickers feature an igloo, a treehouse, a farmhouse, a castle and a submarine among others. Google said that saving these addresses will allow users to get one-tap access to driving directions.
