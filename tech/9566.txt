Grindr, the social network app for gay men, on Tuesday sold 60% stake to Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech for $93 million. This is the first time that the US-based company has taken investment from outside the country. Valued at $155 million, the app's Founder and CEO Joel Simkhai and its employees will retain the remaining shares.
