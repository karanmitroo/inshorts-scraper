Some Facebook employees have put a series of posters at its Menlo Park office, which questions the cultural inclusion or diversity of employees at the company. The posters imply that thereâ€™s no talent in places like Africa and South America. While one poster describes a content strategist as "meek and unassuming", another describes UX researchers as "dry, dour, humorless beasts".
