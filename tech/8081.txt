London's Science Museum has started a campaign on crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to rebuild 'Eric', the United Kingdom's first humanoid robot. Built in 1928 by British duo Captain William H Richards and Alan Reffell, the walking and talking robot travelled the globe before it disappeared in the 1930s. The robot was made mostly from aluminium and weighed 45 kilograms.
