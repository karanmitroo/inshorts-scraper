Camera startup GoPro's shares hit a record low on Monday after Goldman Sachs and Citigroup recommended selling the stock. The shares fell 10% to $7.95, their lowest since GoPro first sold shares to the public at $24 in 2014. Goldman Sachs said it expects GoPro to "continue to struggle fundamentally" as its core action market has largely saturated.
