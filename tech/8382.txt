Facebook is testing a revamp of its News Feed where it features multiple news sections like World & US, Sports, Food, Music and Animals & Pets. The sections appear at the bottom of the screen and are accessible by tapping or swiping left or right. Users can also edit the categories theyâ€™d like to see in the new mobile layout.
