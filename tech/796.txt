Google's photo sharing and storage service Google Photos is rolling out video collages called "Smiles of 2017" that displays smiling pictures of the users with a background song. Users can open the Google Photos app and tap the 'Assistant' icon to check whether the feature is available or not. The videos have not been rolled out for all users yet.
