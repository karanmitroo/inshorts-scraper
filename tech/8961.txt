Apple on Thursday filed a motion against the court order to help the FBI unlock the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. In the motion, Apple stated that the demand violates its First Amendment rights against compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination. Notably, the FBI had asked Apple to create backdoor access to the iPhone. The case will be testified on March 1.
