Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp is testing a feature to let users switch between video and audio calls without interrupting the ongoing call, according to reports. Currently, to switch between the calls, users have to end the ongoing call and then redial. The recipient of a call will also have an option to reject the switch, the reports added.
