Chinese gadget maker Lenovo will reportedly stop marketing smartphones with its own brand name and adopt the Moto label from now on. The company had acquired Motorola from Google for nearly $3 billion in 2014. Interestingly, Lenovo had announced its plans to phase out the Motorola name earlier this year to replace it with the 'Moto by Lenovo' mark.
