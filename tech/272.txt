As many as 1,218 drones outfitted with LED lights were used during a light show at the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics on Friday, setting a world record for the 'most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously'. The drones, controlled through an automated software program, flew in sync and created light-up images of Olympic sports and the Olympic rings.
