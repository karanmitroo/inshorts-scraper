Several pairs of Snapchat's 'Spectacles' sunglasses priced at ₹8,700 ($130) have been listed on e-commerce major eBay for up to ₹67,000 ($1,000) each. The company on Thursday started selling its smart glasses with built-in cameras through vending machines called 'Snapbots' and the initial supply has already been sold out. Spectacles can be used to capture and share 10-second snaps.
