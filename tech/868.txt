A United Nations-backed report has revealed that e-waste weighing 44.7 million tonnes, equivalent to nine pyramids of Giza, was generated across the world in 2016. The waste, which includes discarded mobile phones, old computers and TV sets, contained $55 billion worth of gold, silver, and copper. The study projected that e-waste generated will climb to 52.2 million tonnes by 2021.
