Original staff members of popular torrent website KickassTorrents have launched a fully operational torrent website that looks identical to its predecessor. The US government took KickassTorrents offline in July and arrested its alleged founder Artem Vaulin. The new website uses the domain 'katcr.co/new/' as domains like 'kickasstorrents.com' and 'kat.cr' have been seized by the FBI.
