IIT alumnus Rajiv Khosla, who is currently a professor at Australia's La Trobe University, has designed a "Partner-Personal Robot" (PaPeRo for short), capable of walking, talking, shopping, and even understanding human emotion. "It will provide personalized services naturally. It looks at the mood and the expression and then responds accordingly. It is not a button-bound apparatus," Khosla explained.
