Technology giant Apple's Co-founder Steve Wozniak during a roundtable in Singapore said, "I am very happy with the way Apple is going." Wozniak added, "When Steve Jobs died...a lot of people said, 'Apple has lost a key force and will be in decline and won't be innovative.' I said wait for a couple of years, don't be judgemental."
