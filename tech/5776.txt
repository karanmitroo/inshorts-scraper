Inventors from SkunkLock have developed a bike lock that emits a special "smelly formula" on being cut, making the thief vomit. The security device, which costs around â‚¹6,600 ($99), is made up of a pressurised inside with a noxious chemical deterrent that induces vomit when exposed. The San Francisco-based team is currently seeking crowdfunding through website Indiegogo.
