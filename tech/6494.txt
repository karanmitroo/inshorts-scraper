A YouTube video, 'Apple-Don't Blink', sums up Apple's presentation in San Francisco on Wednesday in 107 seconds. Starting with CEO Tim Cook's carpool to the event, the video highlights the new iPhone's features, including the removal of the '100-year old' headphone jack. It further introduces the wireless AirPods, and shows the water-resistant Apple Watch Series 2.
