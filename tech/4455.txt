Searching for 'a**holes' on Twitter no longer shows US President Donald Trump's account @realDonaldTrump as the top result, a few days after the issue was reported. However, searching for 'tiny hands' still recommends Trump's personal handle in the results. Twitter's algorithm reportedly uses tweets mentioning a user in addition to a user's account description to show search results.
