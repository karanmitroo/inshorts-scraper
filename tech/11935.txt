Tag Heuer is planning to launch a smartwatch to directly compete with products like Apple Watch. "We started on the project about four months ago. We have done several partnerships and might also do acquisitions," Tag Heuer interim chief executive Jean-Claude Biver said Tuesday. Tag Heuer would make an announcement once it has a good product to present, Biver added.
