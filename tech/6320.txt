Palo Alto has rejected Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to demolish and rebuild his four homes neighbouring his primary residence. It noted that the rebuild will create a giant compound and reduce the city's housing stock. The homes were bought by Zuckerberg for $30 million in 2013 after a developer threatened to build a house with views into his bedroom.
