According to a report by the Android Police, Google is working on two Android Wear devices of its own, codenamed "Angelfish" and "Swordfish". With a diameter of 43.5 mm, the Angelfish will supposedly feature LTE, GPS and heart rate tracking. While, the Swordfish will be a bit smaller than the Angelfish and will lack LTE and GPS.
