Automaker Ford has created a cot for babies to help them sleep by playing a muffled engine noise to simulate a ride in the backseat of a car. The crib also reproduces movements similar to a car ride and LEDs that move to mimic passing street lights. However, Ford has reportedly created only one unit of the crib.
