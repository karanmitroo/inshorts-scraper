Public payphones in the New York City have been replaced with free public Wi-Fi hotspots and Android tablets at 'LinkNYC' kiosks. The tablets allow users to check emails, make a phone call and browse Google Maps with no time limit. The kiosks also include a port for headphones and two USB ports for charging phones.
