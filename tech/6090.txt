Dutch startup Hamwells has raised $1.3 million funding to create a smart shower that recycles each water drop seven times. While the shower can be fixed on a wall, the reservoir that collects and recycles the water can be submerged into the floor. Connected to an app, the shower lets users stream music and records the quantity of water saved.
