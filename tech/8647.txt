Facebook on Tuesday activated its Safety Check feature for Brussels, where a series of explosions left at least 34 dead and 186 injured. The feature allows users to check if their Facebook friends are safe, and also mark them as safe. Originally used for natural disasters, the feature has so far been activated for Paris, Nigeria and Turkey terrorist attacks.
