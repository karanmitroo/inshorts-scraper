The CEO and Co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights, Anand Sanwal has said that the things between Google and Uber escalated from frenemy to enemy quite quickly. Sanwal's comments come after Google spin-off Waymo, working on self-driving cars, sued Uber for theft of its core technology last week. Notably, Google invested $258 million in Uber in 2013.
