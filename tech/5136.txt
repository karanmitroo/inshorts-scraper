Microblogging platform Twitter has appointed Keith Coleman as head of its product team, the third executive to lead the division in less than a year. The company on Thursday confirmed that it has acquired Coleman's consumer mobile app startup Yes. Twitter itself has been rumoured to be up for sale and reportedly hired bankers last month to field acquisition offers.
