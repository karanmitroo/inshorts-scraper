Scientists have devised a smartphone-based test that uses a single drop of blood to detect HIV in 10 seconds and can be further developed for Zika and Ebola detection. The test uses disposable quartz biochips, based on microelectronic components used in smartphones. Early diagnosis and treatment can increase life-expectancy by 10 years, also reducing infant mortality by 76%, researchers said.
