LG on Tuesday unveiled its latest flagship phone, the G3, which includes anti theft software that can render the phone unusable if stolen. The so-called "kill switch" will allow a user to remotely wipe the data from a phone, as well remotely lock it permanently, making it harder for the phone to be resold.
