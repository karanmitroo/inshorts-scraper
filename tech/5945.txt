Lithium batteries, commonly used in smartphones, have two electrodes on opposite sides and lithium ions move from one electrode to another during charging. Both the electrodes should never touch and to prevent this from happening, battery makers insert separators in between. In case of Samsung Note 7, the separators were reportedly flawed and the two electrodes touched leading to explosion.
