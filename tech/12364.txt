CBI chief Ranjit Sinha on Saturday rejected the affidavit filed by NGO CPIL, which levelled allegations against him in the 2G scam probe and questioned the source of information for the allegations. In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, he added that it was not enough for CPIL to quote an unnamed whistle-blower.
