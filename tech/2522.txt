South Korean company LG has unveiled a steriliser that uses ultraviolet light to continuously disinfect the rubber handrails of escalators while moving. Through a process called ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, the steriliser kills microorganisms by targeting their nucleic acids or disrupting their DNA. The device powers itself by converting the escalator's movement into electricity.
