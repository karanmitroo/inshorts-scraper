Credit reporting firm Equifax has been sued by its consumers in a lawsuit seeking $70 billion in damages over the hack which compromised personal information of about 143 million Americans. The lawsuit alleges Equifax was negligent in protecting consumer data. "Equifax could have... increased the amount of money it spent to protect against cyber-attacks but chose not to," it read.
