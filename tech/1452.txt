Security researcher and activist Morgan Marquis-Boire has been accused of sexually assaulting an individual in 2014. Ron Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab where Marquis-Boire worked as a researcher, released a statement acknowledging the same. Marquis-Boire resigned from Citizen Lab shortly before the organisation was made aware of the alleged assault.
