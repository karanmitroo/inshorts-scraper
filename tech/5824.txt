Apple may reportedly not have a USB port in its new MacBook Pro laptops. The laptops would likely have a USB Type C port, which could be used for charging, as the company is also looking to do away with MagSafe 2 and Thunderbolt 2 ports, commonly used for charging. Apple is rumoured to unveil new laptops later this month.
