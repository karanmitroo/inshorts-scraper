Twitter on Wednesday launched its app on the Windows 10 Mobile operating system. The app features support for Moments, group Direct Messages, video tweets and quote tweet. Users can also access top tweets, search, check out profiles and explore Moments without logging into the app. Earlier, Twitterâ€™s Windows app only supported PCs and tablets, and not mobile phones.
