A new wearable sensor helps robots read a wide range of human expressions, like laughing, smiling, frowning, crying, etc. The stretchable and transparent sensor, created by layering a carbon nanotube film on two different kinds of electrically-conductive elastomers, also has applications in health-monitoring (checking heartbeat, breathing, etc.). The technology will help create humanized robots.
