Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, two hackers who wirelessly hijacked a Jeep Cherokee last month, have been hired by taxi aggregator Uber. They will reportedly be helping Uber to develop its own fleet of self-driving cars. The duo, who had turned off the SUVâ€™s engine and disabled its brakes, had forced Chrysler to recall 1.4 million units of the model.
