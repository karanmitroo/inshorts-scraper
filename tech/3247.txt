A Norway pizza shop this week was caught using hidden cameras in its digital billboard that scanned onlookers' faces in real-time. The facial recognition code was found recording traits like people's gender, if they were wearing glasses and whether they were smiling. The billboard reportedly showed men ads for meaty pizzas and women were presented with a salad.
