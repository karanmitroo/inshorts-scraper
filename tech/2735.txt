Two Bluetooth-enabled fidget spinners exploded in the US states of Michigan and Alabama this week. The fidget spinners, both of which used Bluetooth to connect to phones to play music through built-in speakers, exploded while charging for less than 30 and 45 minutes. One of the spinner's box did not have any instructions but only read "Made in China".
