Canada-based startup Undigo has created an underwear for women that fits in lipstick-sized mini capsules at â‚¹1,100. The sterilised underwear which comes in various sizes can be taken out of the aluminium capsule through pulling a strip available underneath its lid. The capsule also has a 'wash-me' bag to discard an unwanted underwear.
