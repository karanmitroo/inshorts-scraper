Since Samsung's market share & profits are dwindling, the company is planning some restructuring steps in management and plans to shut down certain unprofitable services, including ChatOn messenger. The shut down will take place in certain markets only. The company’s official said, "Samsung’s IM service won’t be shut down in the markets where it has received positive reactions and reviews."
