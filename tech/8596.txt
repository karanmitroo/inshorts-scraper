Microsoft has unveiled a holographic communication method called holoportation using its HoloLens augmented reality (AR) headset. The system allows people in two different locations to teleport into one room and interact in real-time. For this, a personâ€™s entire movement and speech is captured in 3D and projected into another room. The holographic interaction can be recorded and even shrunk down.
