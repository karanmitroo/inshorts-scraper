Motorola took to Twitter on Friday to accuse Samsung of stealing its always on display feature for smartphones. Motorola tweeted, "In what galaxy is it okay to steal competitor phonesâ€™ cool features? #TheOriginalAlwaysOnDisplay #motozdroid." Motorola in 2013 had launched Moto X smartphone that featured always on display. A similar feature is available in Samsung's recently launched Galaxy Note 7.
