Pizza Hut on Wednesday introduced the world's first playable DJ pizza box in the UK. The cardboard pizza box, which features two turntables, can be connected to a laptop via Bluetooth and synced with a DJ app to enable controls like volume and pitch speed among others. The boxes will be available exclusively at five Pizza Hut UK outlets.
