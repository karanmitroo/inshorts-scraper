Aircraft manufacturer Airbus recently unveiled 'Thor', which it claims is the world's first 3D-printed aircraft, at the 2016 edition of the Berlin Air Show. Weighing 21 kilograms and measuring 13 feet in length, the aircraft has been printed from a substance called polyamide. Printed aircraft offer ecological benefits as lighter jets use lesser fuel and release fewer pollutants.
