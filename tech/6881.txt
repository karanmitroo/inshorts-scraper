Edward Snowden, the former contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA), on Tuesday, alleged that the "circumstantial evidence indicates Russian responsibility" in the alleged NSA hack. Earlier, NSA was allegedly hacked and malicious software was stolen, which was later put online for auction. He termed the attack as a "warning", which "could have significant foreign policy consequences."
