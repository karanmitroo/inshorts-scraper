Qantas airline has launched a virtual reality app to allow passengers to explore places in Australia. It features 13 different experiences including aerial views of sites at Sydney Harbour, Uluru, and Hamilton Island captured in a 360Â° video. "Our aim... is to connect with travellers by showcasing parts of Australia they may not be familiar with," said an official.
