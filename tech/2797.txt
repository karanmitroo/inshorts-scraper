A UK man has been found guilty of exploiting loopholes in a bank’s computer to steal nearly ₹82.5 lakh, which he spent on face tattoos, a BMW, and a Range Rover. The loophole allowed him to transfer non-existent funds between his current and savings account between midnight and 1 am. The 24-year-old has been sentenced to 16 months in jail.
