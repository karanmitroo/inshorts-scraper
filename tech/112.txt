Stanford University researchers have developed a stretchable electronic skin which is sensitive enough to feel the footsteps of an artificial ladybug. The waterproof skin can stretch to twice its size without impacting the sensors due to its hi-tech polymer layering. The technology could be used to make elastic touchscreens for use in smart clothing and wearable electronics, said researchers.
