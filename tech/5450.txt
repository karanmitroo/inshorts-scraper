American technology company GoPro has issued a press release announcing the recall of the Karma drone over a power lose malfunction. The Karma drone was in the market for 16 days and the company has recalled all the 2,500 drones sold so far. This comes after the company announced last week that it missed revenue expectations by 23%.
