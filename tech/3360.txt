Hacker group 'TheDarkOverlord' that recently leaked the upcoming fifth season of Netflix series 'Orange Is the New Black', has claimed it has access to 36 other yet-to-air movies and television shows. The list includes series like 'New Girl', 'Superhuman', and 'Portlandia', movies including 'Handsome', and a YouTube Red special. Earlier, the hackers had demanded ransom from Netflix.
