American investment manager and short-seller Jim Chanos on Tuesday said that the announced merger of Tesla with SolarCity in a $2.6 billion deal will make Tesla a "walking insolvency". Chanos added, "The synergies are questionable at best." He further predicted that the combined entity will depend accessively on the capital market and willâ€‹ burn roughly $1 billion cash per quarter.
