Twitter on Thursday announced a deal to revive Politwoops, a website that archives politiciansâ€™ deleted tweets. Earlier in 2015, Twitter had blocked the API access for Politwoops, a platform that reportedly makes public officials accountable for the statements they make. Twitter has reached an agreement with The Sunlight Foundation, the organisation that operates the website, for the same.
