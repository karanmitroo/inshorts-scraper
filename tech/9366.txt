General Motors has created a dedicated team to speed up the development of its self-driving and electric cars. For this, the company has appointed its Vice President for global product programs, Doug Parks, as the Vice President for autonomous technology and vehicle execution. General Motors plans to launch its electric Chevrolet Bolt car late this year at about $35,000.
