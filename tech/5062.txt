A New Zealand man of Asian descent has claimed that he had his passport photograph rejected when facial recognition software mistakenly registered his eyes as being closed. Twenty-two-year-old Richard Lee had submitted his picture to an online passport photo checker. He later said, "It was a robot, no hard feelings. I got my passport renewed in the end."
