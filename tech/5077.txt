Google has launched a new feature that lets users tweet emoji directly to @Google and get search results for food joints, activities, and locations close to their location. The feature will work with over 200 different emoji like pizza for Italian caf√©s, dogs for animal shelters, ATM cards for bank locations, and sun emoji for weather updates along with GIFs.
