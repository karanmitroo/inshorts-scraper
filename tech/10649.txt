Astronomers have discovered a new ring galaxy 30 million light years away from Earth, that has arisen from a galactic collision and been captured on camera in a bull’s-eye view. The find was led by astronomers Professor Quentin Parker (University of Hong Kong) and Professor Albert Zijlstra (University of Manchester). It has been named "Kathryn's wheel” after Catherine Wheel fireworks.
