Apple's advertising lead, Ken Segall, revealed in 2013, that they were initially considering alternate names for iPhone which included 'iPad', 'Tripod', 'Telepod' and 'Mobi'. The names were being considered because the term 'iPhone' was a bit controversial as Cisco owned the "IPHONE" trademark for its IP-based phone system. Notably, Apple was incorporated on January 3, 1977.
