The first two-way long-distance phone call over outdoor wires was conducted between Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson on October 9, 1876. They talked to each other over a 3.2-kilometre wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston for three hours. The pair also conducted the world's first transcontinental telephone call thirty nine years later.
