Digital payments startup Paytm is planning to launch its own messaging service by the end of August, according to reports. The chat platform, which will allow users to send videos, audios, pictures, and texts, will reportedly be embedded in Paytm's current app. The new service by SoftBank and Alibaba-backed Paytm is expected to rival WhatsApp.
