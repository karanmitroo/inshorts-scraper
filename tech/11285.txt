FINDER (Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response), a heartbeat-detecting technology developed by NASA, helped rescue 4 men trapped under 10-feet debris of the 7.9-magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25. FINDER uses microwave-radar technology to detect heartbeats of victims trapped in the wreckage. NASA had sent 2 prototype FINDER devices to Nepal after the quake struck.
