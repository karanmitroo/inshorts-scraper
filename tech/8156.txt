Twitter has reportedly blocked US intelligence agencies' access to Dataminr, a company which provides analytics and identifies patterns across every tweet published. It analyses tweets to signal about terror attacks, political unrest and other events. Notably, data requests to Twitter from US government increased by 65% in the last six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.
