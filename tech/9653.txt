New World Hacking, a cyber group against the IS, has claimed responsibility for bringing down BBC’s main news website on Thursday. The group had carried out the DDoS attack to reportedly test its own capabilities. It said, “We realize sometimes what we do is not always the right choice, but without cyber hackers...who is there to fight off online terrorists?”
