Russia has threatened to block Facebook if it does not comply with a law mandating that Russian citizens' personal data must be stored within the country. "We will either achieve adherence to the law or the company (Facebook) will cease its operations on Russian territory. There are no exceptions here," chief of the Federal Communications Agency Alexander Zharov said.
