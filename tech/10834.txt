Scientists at NASA have discovered an Earth-like planet, named Kepler-452b. Found using NASAâ€™s Kepler telescope, Kepler-452b is around 60% bigger than the earth and is located about 1,400 light years away in the constellation Cygnus. It is circling a star that is very similar to the sun at a distance about the same as Earth's orbit, the scientists said Thursday.
