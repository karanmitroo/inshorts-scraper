E-commerce major Amazon has filed a patent for a multi-storey warehouse for its delivery drones which resembles a beehive in shape. The patent states that the warehouses will be built within densely populated urban areas. The illustrations in the patent suggest the warehouse will have multiple windows for drones to fly in and out of the building.
