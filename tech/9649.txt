Taiwan-based company D-Link has developed a sound-based alarm system, called the Smart Alarm Detector, that can send alerts to users' phones in case of any emergency. The device can pick up sounds like fire alarms, breaking of glass, doorbells and more. With a reported cost of $60, the system is set to be released in the second quarter of 2016.
