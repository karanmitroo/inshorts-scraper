US-based researchers have developed a system that teaches people Morse code within four hours using Google's smart headset, Google Glass. The system delivered a series of vibrations near the ear to participants who played games while feeling the taps and hearing the corresponding letters. Participants were able to write codes for every letter with 98% accuracy after the experiment.
