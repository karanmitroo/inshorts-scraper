In a bid to compete with Google Now, Apple on Tuesday unveiled Siri's new 'Proactive' functionality that will play music when earphones are plugged into the iPhone or iPad. Siri's word recognition error rate is 5% compared to Google Now's 8%, Apple claimed. Siri  will now understand natural language and remind users to leave on time using the Calender app.
