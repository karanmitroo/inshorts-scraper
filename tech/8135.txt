A US-based startup has created 'Movpak', a $1,200 backpack with an inbuilt remote-controlled electric skateboard that goes up to 20 mph. The backpack gets fully charged in two hours and allows 10 miles of skateboarding per charge. The skateboard, with tracking capability for security, comes with front lights for visibility in the night and supports Siri and Google Now.
