Police in the US stopped a woman from committing suicide this week by using Facebook and Google Maps. They conducted a phone ping test to get her coordinates after she went live on Facebook speaking about her suicide. The team then found the woman in her car by identifying the buildings and surrounding area from her Facebook Live feed.
