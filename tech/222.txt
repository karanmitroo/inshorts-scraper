Talking about YouTube's policy on terminating user accounts at a recent interview, the platform's CEO Susan Wojcicki said, "We do have a three strikes rule." Adding that the company makes sure to be consistent, she stated that they do terminate accounts all the time. This came in response to a question asking why YouTuber Paul Logan's account was not terminated.
