A man named Chris Gillespie, who registered 763 domain names that included the word 'google', has lost a lawsuit against technology giant Google which claimed 'google' should no longer be trademarked. Gillespie said the word 'google' has become synonymous with the generic verb for "searching the Internet." The man sued Google after the company revoked his domain names like "GoogleBarackObama.com"
