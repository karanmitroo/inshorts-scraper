Facebook Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg created a family messaging system called ZuckNet when he was 12 years old. The system was used by his father in his dental office, so that the receptionist could inform him of a patient without shouting. It was also used by the family to communicate within the house. Notably, Zuckerberg turned 33 on Sunday.
