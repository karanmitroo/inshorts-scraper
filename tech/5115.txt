Tasmania-based Women's Legal Service has launched a website for Indian women to educate them about their legal rights in partnership with TRS Law Offices. The website, 'Girlsgottaknow.in', has different heads such as relationships, employment, partying, renting, and money. Each of these sections has a brief description about the situation and legal options available.
