Online survey company SurveyMonkey named its Chairman and former GoPro executive Zander Lurie as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), according to reports by Re/code. He will follow Bill Veghte, who is leaving the company due to 'differences of opinion on strategy' with the investors. Zander held the position temporarily last year after the demise of then CEO David Goldberg.
