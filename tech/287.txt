The Internet Association, which represents companies including Facebook and Google, has expressed support for a bill seeking to restore net neutrality by invalidating a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) order. The association said the decision leaves consumers with no "meaningful protections" to ensure access to the internet. The net neutrality rules were repealed in 2017.
