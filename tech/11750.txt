Twitter is reportedly going to open a Research and Design (R&D) centre in Bangalore, its first office of that kind outside the US. The micro-blogging site will use the team of ZipDial, an Indian startup Twitter recently acquired, as the basis for the R&D facility. The move comes as a result of Twitter's increased focus on fastest-growing markets like India.
