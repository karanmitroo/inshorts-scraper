High-speed transportation technology startup Hyperloop One's Director of Software Engineering Kyle Wall recently took to Reddit to host an 'Ask me anything' session. On being asked who would take the first test ride in a Hyperloop pod, Wall joked that it would be the least productive intern. The Hyperloop One team also shared details of the startup's planned Hyperloop routes.
