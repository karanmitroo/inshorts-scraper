Whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks recently urged followers to not ask for 'proof of life' of its Founder Julian Assange who is currently living in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. "Please stop asking us for 'proof of life'. We do not control Assange's physical environment or internet connection. @MashiRafael does," tweeted the organisation, referring to Ecuador's President Rafael Correa.
