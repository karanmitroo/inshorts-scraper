The World's first smartphone, the IBM Simon, completed 20 years since its launch on 16th August, 1994. Simon could make calls, receive pager messages, and send and receive emails. It had a calculator, a calendar, and an address book and phone was able to send and receive faxes. The phone was called "personal communicator phone," as "smartphone" wasn't coined then.
