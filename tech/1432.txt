Israel's Space Communications has signed a deal with Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch two communication satellites into the orbit. Spacecom said the first satellite launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled for 2019 at no extra cost after its last satellite was destroyed during a test firing last year. The second is expected to be launched in 2020.
