American electric carmaker Tesla's Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk has revealed that Tesla is building custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Musk claimed that the chips' processing power would help Tesla's Autopilot drive at least 10 times more safely than a human. "We get there faster if we have dedicated AI hardware," he added.
