Software maker Ham Radio Deluxe has been accused of disabling a customer's legally-purchased software after he posted a negative review about its product. The company allegedly provided a solution to the customer's issues, which instead blocked him out. "We would like to request that you not use our software due to the review you placed...Remember that?", said the company's representative.
