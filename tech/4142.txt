American automaker Ford has denied a report by Bloomberg that its engineers have been falling asleep while testing the company's self-driving cars. However, Ford noted that "high levels of automation without full autonomy capability could provide a false sense of security" to drivers. Ford's autonomous vehicle plan includes removing the car's brake pedals, gas pedals and steering wheel.
