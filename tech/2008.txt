US-based social media platform Reddit's first employee Chris Slowe has been appointed as the startup's Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Slowe was the startup's founding engineer when he joined the team in late 2005. Founded by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, Reddit raised $200 million earlier this year, which gave it a valuation of nearly $1.8 billion.
