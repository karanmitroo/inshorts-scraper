The latest version (v9.12) of Google Maps has a 'funny' Easter egg which scolds a user for asking "are we there yet?" repeatedly. The first time Google Maps tells the estimated time left to reach the destination. The next two times it only says "no". After that it shouts, "If you ask me again, we won't stop for ice cream."
