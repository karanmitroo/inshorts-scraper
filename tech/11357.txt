Scientists at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany have created a portable invisibility cloak that can make small objects disappear from sight without specialised equipment. The cloak, however, cannot hide a human. The object to be concealed is placed inside a hollow metal cylinder coated with acrylic paint, which diffusely reflects light. The cloak is a tangible, solid-state device.
