Scientists have developed prototypes of a robot called Hedgehog in NASAâ€™s laboratory. The Hedgehog, a cube with eight spikes (instead of wheels), can reportedly hop and tumble across low-gravity environments with ease and will be used to explore smaller space objects like asteroids and comets. The prototypes have been recently tested in microgravity in NASA's C-9 aircraft.
