South Korean technology major Samsung's lithium ion and renewable division, Samsung SDI, has developed a new electric vehicle battery that claims to give 600 kilometres of travel after just 20 minutes of charging. This range is higher than 426 kilometres, the current range offered by a fully charged Model S car manufactured by Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker Tesla.
