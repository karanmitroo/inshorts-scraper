Samsung has partnered with Six Flags, one of world's largest amusement park operators, to launch VR roller coasters at nine amusements parks in the US. Backed by Samsung’s Gear VR headset, the rides will offer visitors additional sensory experiences like being sent to the future to save the world. This is being called the “first-ever interactive gameplay technology on a roller coaster.”
