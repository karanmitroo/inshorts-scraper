Canadian electric utility Nova Scotia Power has set up a pilot project using a combination of Tesla's Powerwall 2 home batteries and Powerpack batteries for a smart power grid experiment. The project will serve 300 houses, with 10 users having Powerwall 2 batteries. The test run is expected to go live by February end and will last until 2019.
