Nokia has reportedly filed a trademark request for 'Viki', which is believed to be an upcoming virtual assistant to rival Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. However, Nokia has refused to comment on the development of such an assistant and said, "Nokia registers trademarks from time to time but we don't comment on whether they may be used for Nokia products."
