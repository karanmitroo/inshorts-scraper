The US-European Cassini spacecraft will fly 50 kilometres above the South Pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus passing through the jets of water vapour and frozen particles erupting from it. The spacecraft will gather samples to identify hydrogen molecules in the plume which in turn might provide clues to the potential for life in the ocean.
