Five girl students, all aged 14 from Bengaluru won the "Technovation challenge" held at San Francisco last week. Team "Pentechan" reached the summit at a global pitch and bagged $10,000 as seed funding for their mobile App, Sellixo. Inspired by PM Narendra Modi's Swachh Bharat Mission, the app provides an online marketplace for users to buy and sell dry waste.
