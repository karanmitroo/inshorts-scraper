Panasonic has developed a 'Megahonyaku' megaphone that has the ability to translate a user's voice from Japanese to English, Chinese, and Korean. The device has around 300 preset phrases including "watch your step" and "the train has been delayed" to help communicate with tourists in Japan. The multilingual megaphone is already being tested by Japanese police and transport companies.
