MIT engineers have created a programming language that enables designing DNA-encoded circuits to give specific functions to the 'E. coli' bacteria. To achieve this, computing elements like logic gates and sensors were designed and encoded in the bacteria's DNA. The researchers plan to make the language's interface, which does not require genetic engineering knowledge to use, available on the web.
