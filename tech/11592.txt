The Indian Patent Office has denied Facebook a patent for a crawler application in the country. The ruling by V Saravanan, assistant controller of patents & designs, stated that the application was not patentable as it lacked an inventive step. The patent application had been filed in 2007 by Truveo Inc, which was later assigned to Facebook.
