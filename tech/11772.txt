The Union home ministry has recommended that all states should replicate the woman safety scheme, Himmat, that was launched in Delhi on January 1. It is an Android-based mobile application that lets registered woman users send out SOS alerts to the police for help. Reportedly, about 14,000 women in Delhi have downloaded the app.
