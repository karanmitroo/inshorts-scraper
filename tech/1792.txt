US Senator Al Franken has written a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook raising concern over users' privacy and security in the newly launched iPhone X. He questioned whether the Face ID "technology will perform equally well on different groups of people." He further asked Apple to provide information on steps "it intends to take" to protect its users.
