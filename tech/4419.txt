Google Co-founder Sergey Brin on Saturday joined protests against US President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration and said, "I'm here because I'm a refugee." Brin attended the protest at San Francisco International Airport and declined further comment as he was present in "a personal capacity". His family had emigrated from the Soviet Union to the United States in 1979.
