UK-based automaker Jaguar Land Rover has revealed a concept of a voice-activated Artificial Intelligence (AI) removable steering wheel 'Sayer' for self-driving cars. It will be a part of Jaguar's upcoming concept car, the Future-Type. Sayer will be capable of tasks like reminding owners when they need to get up or order a self-driving car to arrive in time for appointments.
