BJ Heiney, the man behind the now-defunct Yahoo Kids search engine, has launched a new child-friendly search engine, Thinga. The child-focused platform enables safe browsing, as it only displays results which are either hand-picked by Heiney’s team or pulled from whitelisted, child-friendly websites. The ad-free search engine also offers browsing categories like Video and Animals on its homepage.
