Google has launched a â‚¹3,400 ($50) phone case for its Pixel handset, which shows live images from Google Earth on the handset. From the ice formations of Antarctica to the beaches of the South Pacific, the case sets select images as wallpapers. A button on the wallpaper lets users explore the location in more detail on the Google Maps app.
