Mass media company Comcast has made its live streaming app, Xfinity Share, available to all its customers. The app used to be exclusive to Triple Play package customers, but now can be accessed by every voice, video, home, and internet subscriber. It broadcasts video streams, photos and recorded videos not just on one's own TV, but on other subscribers' TVs.
