The TIME magazine has named 'The Hackers' among its Person of the Year 2016 runners-up. "They made vulnerability the new normal and took aim at democracy itself," the magazine said in its announcement. "Hardly a week passed without news of some kind of digital breach, somewhere in the world, often establishing some kind of record," the magazine added.
