Indian smartphone maker Lava is reportedly planning to buy Nokia's non-operational Chennai handset factory. The two companies have signed a nondisclosure agreement. "Lava's manufacturing team has already visited the plant and has done the assessment. It will make a proposal to Nokia mid-December after taking all aspects into consideration," one of the people familiar with the discussion said.
