A team of South Korean researchers has developed ultra-thin and transparent oxide thin-film transistors (TFT) that can be used to make high-performance wearable and transparent displays. Earlier such flexible transparent displays faced challenges like poor transparency and low electrical performance. However, the new attached oxide TFTs showed an optical transparency of 83%, the team claimed.
