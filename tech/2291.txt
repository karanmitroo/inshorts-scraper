Harvard scientists have created a tiny robotic arm that can reportedly make complex surgeries for body parts like brain and lungs safer. It lies flat on endoscope and pops up to assist in surgical procedures on reaching the desired spot. The flexible device combines soft and rigid components so that it can handle tissues more gently than a sharp tool.
