Uber Co-founder Travis Kalanick, while describing a call between him and Google's Co-founder Larry Page, said they "didn't understand each other." According to Kalanick, Page "kept saying" that Uber had taken Google's intellectual property (IP) and kept "telling him that hiring his people was not taking his IP." He further offered to open up the records to prove his point.
