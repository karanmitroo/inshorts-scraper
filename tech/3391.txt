Following a user's query on Twitter, Samsung has confirmed that the home button on its Galaxy S8 smartphone slowly changes position. The feature serves as a screensaver and prevents a 'screen burn' on the phone's OLED display. Screen burn happens when a single image is left on the screen for too long, creating a permanent mark on the display.
