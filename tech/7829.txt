Apple has removed a game app called 'La Petite Mort' which simulated female orgasmic sounds. The app includes pixelated landscapes which respond to the touch of the users' fingers with corresponding sound effects. While there are no points or levels, users can unlock various 'experiences' based on their movements. However, the app is available on Google Play Store.
