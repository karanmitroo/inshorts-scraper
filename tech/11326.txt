French researchers have claimed to create human sperm in a laboratory for the first time, which will help in the treatment of infertile men. Isabelle Cuoc, the CEO of the Kallistem laboratory, said that they had taken male fertility tissue known as spermatogonia and turned it into mature sperm in test tubes. This complex process usually takes 72 days.
