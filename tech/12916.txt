Google is reportedly set to add an 8-inch tablet to its successful Nexus range of smartphones, bringing direct competition to Apple's iPad mini range. It is likely to adopt Intel's Bay Trail-T processor platform for the upcoming tablet. Asus, which made first and second generation of Nexus 7, will help Google develop the new model, to be launched in mid-2014.
