American multinational Kodak accidentally released a picture of its upcoming phone which is scheduled to be revealed on October 20. The picture shows the power button on the new Kodak phone, embedded in a machined groove and with a Kodak K stamped on it. While the company deleted the tweet, the image can still be found on the company's website.
