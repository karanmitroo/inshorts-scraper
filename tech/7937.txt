An adaptation of the King James Version Bible featuring emojis will release on Apple's iBooks on Sunday. The book, called 'Bible Emoji: scripture 4 millennials', took six months to complete and features around 80 emojis that replace the words like the Earth, God and light. Further, around 15% of the Bible text has been replaced with modern slangs.
