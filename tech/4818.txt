Facebook temporarily banned a journalist from posting on its platform after he called Trump supporters “a nasty fascistic lot”. Facebook said it had “reviewed and restored” the post and that it was removed in error. "Those who hold Trump to the standards of any other person have found...these Trump followers are a nasty fascistic lot," the post read.
