A Taiwanese company has unveiled HiMirror Plus, a mirror with LED lighting that shows users how they would look in five different settings, including sunset view, outdoor on a sunny day, brightly lit office, shopping mall, and party venue. The mirror also claims to analyse the wrinkles, dark circles, and pores on a user's skin and recommend customised skincare routines.
