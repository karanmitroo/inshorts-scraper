Apple has confirmed that it is aware of the instances where iPhone X's screen will become temporarily unresponsive to touch after a rapid change to a cold environment. The issue will be addressed in an upcoming software update, Apple added. This comes after users reported that the touch was inconsistent in the cold but functioned normally in warmer environment.
