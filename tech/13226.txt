Creating a new record, Apple sold 9 million handsets of its latest smartphones, iPhone 5s and 5c, during the first 3 days of their availability. The cheaper 5c and availability in Asian markets have led to increased sales. Their new operating system iOS 7 was also received well, with 200 million devices running it.
