Billionaire Chris Sacca, who has invested in companies like Instagram, Twitter, and Uber, has written a post apologising for contributing to sexism in the tech industry. Sacca admitted he "looked the other way and didn't speak up at times," as he wanted to fit in with the 'guys'. He also shared how the birth of his daughter changed his thinking.
