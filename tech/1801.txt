Search giant Google said it has disabled a majority of offensive advertisement keywords after BuzzFeed found that Google allowed advertisers to target users searching for racist terms. BuzzFeed conducted an advertisement campaign targeting keywords like "Why do Jews ruin everything" and "the evil jew." It found that advertisements were visible when the offensive keywords were searched.
