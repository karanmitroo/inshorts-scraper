A new study shows that there is hardly any difference in the manufacturing cost of an iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5. Adding new features, such as a 64-bit app processor and a fingerprint identification sensor, has brought the manufacturing cost of a 16GB iPhone 5s to $198.70, a mere $1.70 rise from the manufacturing cost of an iPhone-5.
