Netherlands-based startup Somnox has developed a 'sleep robot', which it claims can improve a user's sleep through its 'breathing' rhythm. The technology makes the pillow-like device fall and rise, providing the user with a breathing sensation. The app-connected device can also play the sound of heartbeats and music, which automatically turns off after the user falls asleep.
