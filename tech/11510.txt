Social networking giant Facebook has launched a web browser version of Messenger in order to enhance the chatting experience of users while using a desktop or a laptop. Just like the Facebook Messenger app, the web version allows the user to send sticker, picture, and signature thumbs up. However, the voice message sending feature has not been made available yet.
