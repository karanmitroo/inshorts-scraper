India's first ever solar powered boat called 'Aditya' was launched at Kochi's Vembanad lake in Kerala on Thursday. The 75-seater boat fitted with 78 rooftop solar panels, will ferry along a 2.5-kilometre route 22 times a day. The boat can travel at a maximum speed of about 14 kmph and cruises without noise and minimal vibration, unlike the diesel ferries.
