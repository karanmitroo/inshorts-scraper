Internet hosting service GitHub user 'idoideas' has developed an app called 'XOutOf10' which allows users to put the iPhone X 'notch' on Android phones running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or above. The 'notch' in iPhone X screen is used for camera and Face ID sensors, while the 'notch' customised for Android phones is just black space and will have no functions.
