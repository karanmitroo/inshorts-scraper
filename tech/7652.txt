Apple has patented a hand detection technology that would allow hand-held devices to determine which hand the user is using and then automatically customize the user interface for optimal thumb reach. The company has also patented a stylus with multi-touch sensors, that would allow it to sense finger position, touch patterns and use them as gesture controls for corresponding devices.
