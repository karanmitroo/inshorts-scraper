UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has accused firms like Facebook and Google of profiting from online sex trafficking, according to a report by The Sunday Times. According to NCA, the companies have become the "key enabler for the sexual exploitation of trafficked victims in the UK". The internet firms need to do more to stop exploitation, an NCA executive said.
