WhatsApp has launched new features on iOS including the ability to save incoming media content for specific chats and groups. Earlier, users could either save media for all chats or for none.Â Further, missed WhatsApp calls now show inside the chat itself rather than the recent tab. Users can also share PDFs through WhatsApp, a feature already available on Android.
