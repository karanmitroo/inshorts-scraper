China on Tuesday launched the world's first quantum satellite, which will help the country to establish hack-proof communications between space and the ground. The satellite will alert the sender and alter or delete the message when hacking is attempted. If the two-year mission is successful, China will attempt to build a worldwide network that can send uncrackable messages.
