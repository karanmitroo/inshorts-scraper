LinkedIn, the professional-network, announced on Monday that "sponsored-jobs" will now appear as part of a user's Feed on both desktop and mobile, which previously only appeared under "Jobs You May Be Interested In". LinkedIn believes that this will enhance the visibility as 30%-users view job-postings from their mobile-phones. Facebook and Twitter have already been promoting sponsored-content in their News Feed.
