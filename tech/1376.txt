Canadian smart-lighting startup Nanoleaf Aurora has developed triangle-shaped LED lighting panels that let users change its colour through an app. An add-on module called 'Rhythm', which plays music can also be attached to the panels to move the light in sync with the music. The panels which can be interlocked also allow users to control the brightness of the light.
