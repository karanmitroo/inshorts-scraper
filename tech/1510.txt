Finnish technology company Nokia on Tuesday announced it is halting the development of its virtual reality (VR) camera 'Ozo' which costs $45,000. The company said it found that the VR market was developing "slower than expected" and plans to reduce investments and focus on technology licensing opportunities. Nokia unveiled the camera in 2015 and originally priced it at $60,000.
