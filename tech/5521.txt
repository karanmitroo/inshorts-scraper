Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller in an interview disclosed why the company removed the SD card slot, which is used for reading camera memory cards, from its latest MacBook Pro notebooks. "It's a bit of a cumbersome slot," he said adding that many cameras in the market were now incorporating wireless transfer technology and didn't require the slot.
