Nokia Bell Labs in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom and the Technical University of Munich have demonstrated 1 Tbps fibre optic cable data speeds in a field trial with "real conditions," including varying channel conditions and traffic levels. Using a new modulation technique called 'Probabilistic Constellation Shaping', researchers were able to make transmissions reach up to 30% further.
