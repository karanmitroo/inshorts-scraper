A Berlin-based artist has developed a garment called Hyperface that can prevent a wearer's face from being recognised by computers. The technology aims to overwhelm and confuse computer vision systems by feeding them false information through certain patterns printed on the clothes. The artist previously developed a makeup and hairstyle technique to make detection of faces by computers difficult.
