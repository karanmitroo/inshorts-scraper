Facebook has launched a White House Messenger bot in the US to allow people to talk to President Barack Obama. The messenger bot, activated on White House's Facebook page, is an addition to existing ways of communicating with the White House which include handwritten mails, emails, and phone calls. Obama will read 10 such messages every day, officials said.
