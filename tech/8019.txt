Brazilian startup HOO.BOX has developed 'Wheelie', prototype of a face-controlled wheelchair which operates through facial, head, or iris movements. The wheelchair consists of a 3D RealSense camera that captures nearly 80 expressions from a user's face including smile, eyebrows up, kiss movement, tongue out and others. These expressions are used by the wheelchair to move, turn and stop itself.
