Space transport company SpaceX successfully landed the booster Falcon 9 rocket late on Monday after successfully putting 11 small data-relay satellites in orbit. SpaceX's two previous failed attempts at landing had ended in an explosion and a fatal crash. The cost of space travel would be significantly reduced if the rocket stages can be refurbished, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said.
