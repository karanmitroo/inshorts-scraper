Oculus Co-founder Palmer Luckey on Saturday in a Facebook post said, "I am deeply sorry that my actions are negatively impacting the perception of Oculus and its partners". "My actions were my own and do not represent Oculus," he added. Luckey recently invested $10,000 in Nimble America, a company creating anti-Hillary Clinton memes and supporting US Presidential candidate Donald Trump.
