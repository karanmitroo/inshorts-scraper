Australian detergent company OMO has developed 'Peggy', a smart clothespin that alerts users before it is about to rain through its humidity, light and temperature sensors. Connected via an app, the clothespin also tells the best time to wash the clothes and how long it will take it to dry. It also updates users about good weather to go outdoors.
