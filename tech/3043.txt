Mobile accessory maker Spigen has accused Android Co-founder Andy Rubin's new startup Essential Products of infringing upon its existing trademark. Spigen has trademarked the name 'Essential' for accessories like chargers and Bluetooth headphones. Spigen claims that it has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Essential Products, and that Rubin's startup has had its trademark attempt rejected twice.
