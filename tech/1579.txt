Social media giant Facebook is reportedly testing a facial recognition feature, codenamed Project Aloha, for account login and verification. The feature will be available on devices which have already been used to login. "It is another step, alongside two-factor authentication via SMS, that were taking to make sure account owners can confirm their identity," Facebook said in a statement.
