Technology giant Apple's Co-founder Steve Wozniak, who turns 66 on Thursday, met his wife on Dial-A-Joke, a telephone service that users could call to listen to jokes. The electronics engineer met his first wife during a 'live call' he personally answered. Wozniak had started the service as a hobby in 1973.
