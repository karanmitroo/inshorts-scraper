Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the social media major does not want to assess the trustworthiness of news sources by itself.  "People are smart. They know what they want and what's good," Zuckerberg added. Further talking about the two-question survey Facebook designed to help it judge news' trustworthiness, Zuckerberg revealed that it is being done "for years".
