Apple is preparing to release racially diverse emoji in 6 different skin-tones in its next update of icons. The 300 new emoji included in the latest developer version of iOS 8.3 won't be available to the public until the update is released later this year. Apple is also adding 32 new country flags and an expanded family including same-sex couples.
