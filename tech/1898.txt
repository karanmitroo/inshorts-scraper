Technology giant Apple has decided to end hosting its annual Apple Music Festival previously known as iTunes Festival in London 10 years after its launch. The show which was first held in 2007 was designed to boost its iTunes business. Artists like Adele, One Direction, Ed Sheeran, and Lady Gaga have performed at the festival during its decade-long run.
