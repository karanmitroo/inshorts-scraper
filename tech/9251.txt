Israel-based startup OTM Technologies has developed a smart mobile input pen 'Phree', that makes any surface writable by securing the penned information. Controlled through a dedicated app, Phree connects to all devices including phone, tablet, laptop and lets users receive and send text messages through an integrated touchscreen. Phree comes with a special case that also acts as a charger.
