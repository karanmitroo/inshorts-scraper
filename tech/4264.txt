Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that the company is making an anechoic or echo-free chamber to perform sound experiments in its Oculus Research lab in Redmond, Washington. "When it's done, this will be one of the quietest places in the world, so quiet you can hear your own heartbeat," said Zuckerberg. This is the second anechoic chamber by Facebook.
