Coca-Cola has become the first company to pay Twitter for creating a custom-made emoji for its #shareacoke test campaign. Under this concept, if one uses a particular hashtag, a custom-made emoji automatically shows up in his tweet. Earlier, companies like Star Wars andÂ Dominos had used such hashtag-activated emojis for free on Twitter.
