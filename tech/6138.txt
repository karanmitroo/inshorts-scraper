Richard Branson-led Virgin Group has asked its employees in the UK and US to shut down their emails for two hours a week, in a bid to improve their creativity. Running since June, the policy encourages employees to take part in brainstorming sessions, walking meetings and running clubs. Employees can also hold one-on-one meetings with their bosses during the break.
