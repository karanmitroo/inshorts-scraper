Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos originally planned on naming the website 'Relentless.com' and registered the URL in September 1994, which still redirects to Amazon's website. 'Cadabra.com' was also taken into consideration but was reportedly dropped after Bezos’ lawyer mistakenly heard “cadaver". Other names suggested for the website, which was launched on July 16 1995, were 'Awake' and 'Browse'.
