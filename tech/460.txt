Google's parent company Alphabet has launched a cybersecurity business named 'Chronicle' which aims to help companies find and stop cyber attacks before they cause harm. Chronicle was founded in 2016 as a project under Alphabet's research lab, X. Chronicle will help teams search, retrieve information, and run analysis "in minutes", rather than the days it currently takes, Alphabet claimed.
