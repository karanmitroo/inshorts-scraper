Ten indigenous visibility measuring devices named 'Drishti' have been installed on three runways of the Delhi airport to ensure safe landing and take-off of aircraft in poor visibility conditions. The devices have been developed by Bengaluru-based CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories and will be used to report runway visual range, which is crucial for safe landing and take-off in poor visibility.
