Pavel Durov, cloud-based instant messaging service Telegram's founder, dismissed media reports that said Google tried to acquire Telegram for $1 billion. According to the reports, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made an offer to buy Telegram last year, which Durov rejected. Calling the rumors "bullshit", Durov said, “I haven’t had any acquisition talks or meetings with Google…all of that is false.”
