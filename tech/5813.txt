WikiLeaks on Monday claimed that Founder Julian Assange's internet connection was cut off by Ecuador. "We can confirm Ecuador cut off Assange's internet access Saturday, 5pm GMT, shortly after publication of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches," WikiLeaks tweeted. "Ecuador will continue to protect Julian Assange and uphold the political asylum granted to him in 2012," said the Ecuadorian government.
