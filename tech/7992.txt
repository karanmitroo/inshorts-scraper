Pizza Hut Asia and MasterCard are reportedly partnering to bring SoftBank's Pepper humanoid robot to take and process customers' orders by the end of 2016. Pepper will help customers with the menu, personalised recommendations and offers. Further, customers can pay for their pizzas through the MasterPass wallet app or scanning a QR code on the tablet attached to Pepper's chest.
