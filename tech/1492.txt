E-commerce giant Amazon is reportedly working on a smart doorbell device to give delivery drivers one-time access to a person's home to drop off packages. Amazon is also in talks with smart license plates-maker Phrame to deliver items to a user's car. The initiatives are part of Amazon's efforts to fix problems associated with unattended and stolen delivery packages.
