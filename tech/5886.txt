Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) firm Oculus has acquired InfiniLED, an Irish startup that manufactures low-power LED displays. Founded in 2010, InfiniLED specialises in ILED (inorganic LED), which could replace OLED and plasma by offering greater power efficiency at a lower cost. Earlier, Oculus had acquired the company that designed Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller, among other acquisitions.
