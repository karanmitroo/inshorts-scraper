A new study shows that there are particular time-slots on social networking websites that attract maximum views. It was observed that the best time to post, on weekdays, was 6-8AM for Facebook, 1-3PM for Twitter and 9-11AM for Googe+. Also, people are less likely to check Facebook during office hours and shorter tweets receive more engagements than tweets over 100-characters.
