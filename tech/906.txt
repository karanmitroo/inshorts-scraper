The terminals of Tokyo airport will be "scattered" with robots who will help visitors arriving for the 2020 Olympics, an official has said. The robots will perform tasks including helping with luggage, providing language assistance and giving directions to the visitors. "We want foreign tourists to think that the Japanese people are cool when they come here," the official added.
