YouTube has been criticised for allowing a video, which suggested a survivor of last week's Florida school shooting was a paid actor, to trend at number one position. The video's description read, "David Hogg the actor..." and under it, YouTube's algorithm suggested clips with similar claims. "Our system misclassified it," a spokesperson said about the video, which was later removed.
