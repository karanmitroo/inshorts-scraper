In reaction to plaguing malicious Chrome extensions, Google will block local Chrome extensions on the Windows platform from January ensuring installation only from the Chrome WebStore. However, its Dev and Canary channels will continue local installations. Google says, it hosts none of the malicious extensions and recommends developers to migrate extensions hosted outside the Chrome WebStore "as soon as possible".
