After Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy, its Founder Nick Denton tweeted, "Even with his billions, Thiel will not silence our writers. Our sites will thrive — under new ownership — and we'll win in court." A user tweeted, "Is this the end of #Gawker? Hmm. I don't really mind either way." "#GawkerMedia responsible for its own downfall," tweeted another user.
