Amazon unveiled the prototype of its unmanned delivery drones it announced two years ago with a promotional video on Sunday. Narrated by ex-Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, the video shows a family receiving replacement soccer shoes in 30 minutes. Amazon, waiting for aviation agency's commercial operation approval, did not say when the 'Prime Air' delivery drones will be in service.
