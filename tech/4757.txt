Japanese startup Cerevo has developed 'Taclim', a pair of what it claims to be the world's first virtual reality shoes for simulating different surfaces like desert, grassland or water in a game. The shoes have eight built-in interactive tactile devices which bring a sense of touch and allow a user to even feel kicking an enemy during a game.
