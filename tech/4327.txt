American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has hired Oxford Performance Materials to make over 600 3D-printed parts for its Starliner 'space taxis' which will launch NASA astronauts into space. The parts will be printed with a plastic called PEKK, which is claimed to be as strong as aluminium and resistant to radiation and temperatures ranging from about -149ºC to 149ºC.
