Yahoo has announced it is shutting down its News Digest app and replacing it with the newly-launched Newsroom service. News Digest is based on an app bought by Yahoo for an estimated â‚¹193 crore in 2014 from Nick D' Aloisio, who was a teenager at that time. The closure marks one of the first cuts following Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo.
