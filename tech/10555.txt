Scientists of the UK-based Binghamton University have claimed that the human body has gone through four main stages of evolution. The conclusion was made after the researchers analysed a collection of 4,30,000-yr-old fossils found in Spainâ€™s Sierra de Atapuerca. The Atapuerca individuals were relatively tall, with wide muscular bodies and less brain mass compared to the Neanderthals.
