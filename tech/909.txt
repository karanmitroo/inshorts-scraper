A restaurant in Chennai called 'Robot' has started using faceless robot waiters who glide around the restaurant and serve food to customers. The four robot waiters, which have been imported from China, are battery-operated and can be controlled through sensors. The co-owner of the restaurant Vekatesh Rajendran said the robots are also programmed to stop if someone blocks their path.
