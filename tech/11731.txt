In order to let astrophotographers take better images of stars, Nikon has unveiled a special variant of its D810 DSLR, the new D810A. The camera has a better infrared cut filter that will help users to capture the hydrogen alpha spectral wavelength. Also, through its "Long Exposure Manual Mode", users can leave shutters open for 4-900 seconds.
