For the first time the US Navy has flown an aircraft using 3D-printed parts deemed essential to maintaining safe flight. Tested in an MV-22 Osprey, the parts played a key role in securing the engine to the plane. According to a one-minute video, the engine nacelle contained a titanium 3D-printed link which helped hold the engine onto the wing.
