MIT researchers are developing a smartphone app that can provide diagnostic information to users about their vehicles, like if their car's tires require air. The software would derive information by analysing the car's sounds and vibrations, which will be measured by a phone's microphone and accelerometers. MIT said that the technology might be available to people within next two years.
