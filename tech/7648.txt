Xiaomi on Thursday launched its first smart folding electronic bicycle called 'Mi Qicycle' in China at $455. The app-connected bicycle has a 250W 36V motor which adjusts power based on the user's pedaling. The bicycle's app provides GPS navigation with real-time statistics including speed, distance, power, and calories burnt. It can ride up to 45 kilometres on a single charge.
