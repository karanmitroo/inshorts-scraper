Bengaluru-based aerospace startup TeamIndus, one of the five finalists of Google's $30-million race to the Moon, has terminated the launch agreement with ISRO. This came a day after Google called off the contest saying no team will be able to attempt launch by the deadline. TeamIndus' deal termination was reportedly attributed to lack of funds, procuring hardware and management issues.
