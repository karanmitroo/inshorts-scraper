A team of MIT researchers has developed 'Interactive Dynamic Video' in which users can interact with or directly manipulate objects in videos. The model works by using certain algorithms to analyse vibrations given off by every object in a video captured using traditional cameras. The analysis provides realistic prediction models to anticipate objects' reactions to other forces acting upon them.
