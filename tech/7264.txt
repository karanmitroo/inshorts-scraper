Lenovoâ€™s modular phones Moto Z and Moto Z Force, which will release in US on July 28 at $624 and $720 respectively, are "the best-made devices in Motorola's history", said Engadget. Verge said the phones "are unique... fun... a little gimmicky". "If you're not interested in snapping on an extra battery... or speaker, then skip the Moto Z", wrote CNET.
