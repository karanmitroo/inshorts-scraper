Researchers from the Brown University (US) have used data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to discover glass deposits on Mars, opening the possibility of past life on the planet. The glass deposits were found within impact craters on Mars formed in the heat of a violent impact. Previous research has shown that ancient biosignatures can be preserved in impact glass.
