A Google employee has filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of running an internal "spying program" that encourages employees to snitch on one another if they think someone leaked information to the press. The complaint also claims that Google's internal confidentiality policies violate California state laws. The suit could result in a fine of $3.8 billion for Google.
