Responding to a Snapchat filter featuring squinted eyes which allegedly promoted stereotypes against Asians, a Twitter user posted, "Dear @Snapchat, thanks for the overly-racist new filter...when can we expect Blackface?". Another user tweeted,"Racist filters are not cute", "I'd like to apply as your "Is This Racist?" manager", tweeted another. The filter has since been taken down by Snapchat.
