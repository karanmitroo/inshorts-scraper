German scientists have developed an inhaler which they claim can make lungs resistant to air pollution. The inhaler is based on ectoine, a naturally-occurring organic compound commonly found in bacteria in the Egyptian desert. Ectoine reportedly creates a stabilising protection layer on the lung cells' surface, reducing inflammation and preventing further damage.
