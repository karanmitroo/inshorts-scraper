Advertising models in the future may be based on a 'Gaze Tracking System',  which monitors eye movements to pin down what the user is looking at and charge advertisers accordingly. The patentee Google refers it to as 'pay-per-gaze' and plans to set up its advertising model. Speculations are that 'Google Glass' may be the device equipped with this technology.
