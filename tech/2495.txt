Arcade games company Atari has created 'Speakerhat', a cap with in-built speakers that connect to users' phone via Bluetooth to play music and receive phone calls. Speakerhat wearers will also be able to sync with one another and listen to the same music at the same time. Only 10 people are being chosen for a beta test of the cap.
