Paris-based wireless device manufacturer Parrot has developed a fixed-wing drone, Disco, that can fly at speeds up to 80 km/hr for 45 minutes, and features a 'Cockpitglasses' system that lets users get a first-person view. Priced at $1,300, the drone, which will launch next month, also sports a 14-megapixel wide-angle camera which sends the video feed to the users' smartphones.
