Japanese car-maker Toyota Wednesday said it would recall 1.67 million vehicles, 1.05 million in Japan and 615,000 overseas, voluntarily to address three separate defects, including a faulty brake master cylinder that could hinder the brake's performance. The brake defect is found in some models of Toyota's Crown Majesta, and the Noah and Voxy models produced between June 2007 and 2012.
