A subsidiary of China's broadcasting regulator has sued Apple over showing a war film made in the 1990s. According to a Beijing court, Apple has infringed the film's production centre's exclusive online rights to broadcast a film depicting Chinese fighting the Japanese soldiers in the early 1930s. The centre also sued the app that enabled users to watch the film.
