Dublin-based kitchen technology firm Drop has partnered with German electronics manufacturer Bosch to bring remote monitoring functionality to ovens. Bosch Series 8 oven users will be able to monitor key parameters like time, temperature, and settings via Drop's Recipes app. The partnership is expected to extend to other kitchen appliances, for example, remotely checking a fridge's contents.
