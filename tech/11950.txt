Xiaomi's star smartphone, the Redmi 1S will go to its next sale Flipkart, on Dec-23, according to the company. This comes after the Delhi High Court gave temporary relief to the Chinese phonemaker by allowing it to sell its phones featuring Qualcomm processors, for some time. The Redmi Note, which features a Mediatek processor, won't be available right away.
