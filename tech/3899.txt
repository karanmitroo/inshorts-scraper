Apple will build a floating solar farm in Japan to power its component supplier Ibiden's manufacturing entirely on solar energy. The move is aimed at curbing the country's emissions problem. The farm will generate 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours per year of clean energy, which is equal to taking over 4 lakh cars off the road for a year.
