US-based National Institute of Standards and Technology has reportedly funded several companies to develop touch-less fingerprint readers. As they work on the prototypes incorporating new sensory technologies and algorithms, NIST plans to develop the metrics to evaluate their accuracy. Such readers are expected to produce clearer images and come in handy while identifying a large number of people.
