Google, which launched its first smartphone 'Pixel' in 2016, will be launching its next Pixel smartphone later this year, Google's head of hardware Rick Osterloh said. Like its previous handset that has a starting price of â‚¹57,000, the next handset will also be a premium smartphone. There's no plan for a budget Pixel phone in the near future, he added.
