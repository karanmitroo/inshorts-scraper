Taiwanese electronics company HTC has confirmed that its upcoming new smartphone will be squeezable. The phone's metal frame will reportedly include embedded sensors that will enable its owner to control settings and make gestures by squeezing its sides or swiping up and down on them. This comes amid rumours that rival Samsung is testing foldable smartphones.
