Researchers at the University of California-Berkeley have developed algorithms that enable robots to learn things like humans, by trial and error. The technique was demonstrated by getting a robot to complete tasks like screwing a cap on a bottle and assembling a toy place without pre-programmed details about the surroundings. This new branch of artificial intelligence is called deep learning.
