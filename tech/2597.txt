Mark Karpeles, former CEO of failed Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has pleaded not guilty to embezzlement charges and data manipulation. He was charged for diverting $3 million (â‚¹19 crore) customer funds to an account in his name. The exchange was shut in 2014 after losing Bitcoins worth nearly $500 million at the time, for which the exchange blamed hackers.
