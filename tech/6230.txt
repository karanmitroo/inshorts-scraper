Users of Apple's latest smartphones iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have complained of poor audio quality during phone calls. "It's like the phone is hollow and the sound is coming from behind it", wrote an iPhone 7 Plus owner on the company's 'support' forum. Earlier, some users had also reported that the devices were producing a hissing sound.
