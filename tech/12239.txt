Hackers have reportedly leaked explicit photos of several Snapchat users, using a third-party service that saves images. The leak has caused a huge concern that many of the images may be of children, as half of Snapchatâ€™s users are aged between 13 and 17. At least 1 lakh photos are believed to have been accessed by hackers.
