YouTuber SuperiorSandbox has trolled Googleâ€™s official 'Introducing Pixel' advertisement by making a similar video featuring a Motorola Nexus 6 smartphone. The video points out that some new features in Pixel being advertised by Google were already available in the Motorola Nexus 6 handset launched in 2014. Notably, Google has stopped supporting Nexus 6 devices from October this year.
