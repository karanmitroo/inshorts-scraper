New Zealand-based designers have created a map called 'Sailing Seas of Plastic' which visualises concentration of floating plastic debris in the oceans. According to the map, the North Pacific Ocean suffers the most from plastic pollution, with an estimated 2 trillion individual pieces adrift in its waters. Indian Ocean is the second most polluted with 1.3 trillion plastic pieces.
