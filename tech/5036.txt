German mobile operator T-Mobile has announced a new technology called 'Digits' that lets customers use one phone number across all their connected devices. Instead of authenticating devices through SIM cards, the technology gives customers their own identity. On logging in once, a user's call history, texts, and even voicemail becomes available on all of the devices connected to that number.
