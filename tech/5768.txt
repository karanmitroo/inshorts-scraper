American technology company HP on Thursday launched 33 printers in India with 17 A4 printers and forayed into the A3 copier market with 16 printers. The A3 printers will make use of HP's recently launched PageWide technology that reportedly offers fast print speed with energy efficiency and up to 50% less cost per page than the comparable colour laser printers.
