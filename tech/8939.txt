Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel today said the government will use YouTube and local cable TV to telecast live proceedings of the House if the Centre does not respond to its proposal. Goel wrote to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry in November seeking approval to set up a channel on the lines of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV.
