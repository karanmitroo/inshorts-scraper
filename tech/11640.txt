Google has launched its new online web store, Google Store, to sell Chromebooks, Nexus devices and other products sold through its Google Play Store. Unlike the Play Store that includes apps, music and movies, the Google Store is only for hardware. Those who have recently purchased products via Play Store will have their orders automatically transferred to the new store.
