A Chinese state broadcaster has accused electronics company Samsung of "discrimination" and "arrogance" against Chinese consumers over the recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. The broadcaster noted that Samsung issued an apology to US consumers with replacement options and compensation, whereas in China, the company only issued a brief statement saying most phones didn't need to be replaced.
