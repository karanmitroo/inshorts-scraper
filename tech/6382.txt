Google has launched a bug bounty program called 'Project Zero Prize', offering a total cash prize of $350,000 to participants who successfully hack its Nexus 5X and 6P flagships. Knowing only the devices' phone number and associated email address, the participants should be able to remotely open an email or a text message through their exploits.
