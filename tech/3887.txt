Microsoft Co-founder Bill Gates has lauded Indian-American Neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi's book 'When Breath Becomes Air' and said that it left him in tears. Kalanithi was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2013 and passed away two years ago aged 37 after a long battle with lung cancer. "All lives have equal value. But some deaths seem particularly cruel," said Gates.
