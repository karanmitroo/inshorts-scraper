New Zealand-based entrepreneur Nick Gerritsen has developed the world's first AI politician 'SAM', which can answer queries related to housing, education, and immigration policies. Gerritsen hopes SAM will be advanced enough to participate in the 2020 elections but was unsure of whether it would be legally possible. Gerritsen said the bot may help bridge the growing political and cultural divide.
