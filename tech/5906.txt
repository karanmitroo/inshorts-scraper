Google on Thursday launched a feature in UK and US which will tag news stories in search results as 'Fact Check' to help readers examine claims about topics like urban legends, politics, and health. The company said such stories will be transparent about sources and methods, with references to primary sources. Existing Google tags include 'In-Depth', 'Opinion', and 'Highly Cited'.
