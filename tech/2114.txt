UK-based Drones Direct has suspended sales of a £2,000 (₹1.6 lakh) drone after an ad showed that it could be used to walk dogs. The Proflight Walkies Dog Drone, fitted with a retractable lead to keep dogs under control, was also slammed by drone maker DJI. "It would be extremely dangerous to use drones in this manner," DJI spokesperson said.
