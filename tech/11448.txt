The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has developed a device called NailO- a tiny stick-on-nails-like device that enables the users control electronics with just their thumb. The wireless trackpad can be controlled by simply running a finger over it. The processor, battery, sensing chip and Bluetooth radio are included on a circuit board that sits under the capacitive trackpad.
