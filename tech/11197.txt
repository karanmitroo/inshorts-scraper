In a patent application filed last week, Samsung described a mobile device running on Android which can switch over to Windows when inserted into a dock. The device will be placed between a keyboard and a display at a docking area. Patently Mobile reported that the hybrid device will be also able to charge the smartphone when connected via dock.
