Search giant Google had offered $30 billion to acquire Snapchat in 2016, according to reports. Google's offer was apparently an open secret among the Snapchat employees and was on the table even after Snapchat's IPO in March 2016. Snapchat Co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel showed no interest in selling his company to Google or anyone else, reports added.
