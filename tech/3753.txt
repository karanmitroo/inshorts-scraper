Lawyers of US President Donald Trump have reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to a 17-year-old girl from San Francisco to shut down a website called 'KittenFeed' designed by her. The website, initially called 'TrumpScratch', lets users scratch Trump's face with kitten paws. However, a Trump Organisation spokesperson denied sending such a letter.
