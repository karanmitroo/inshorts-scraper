Korean multinational, Samsung, is looking to open 3,000-4,000 exclusive outlets across Indian towns (with a population of less than 1,00,000) as part of its strategy to boost sales in low-penetration, but fast-growing markets for electronic devices. The company has already set up 10 such stores on a pilot basis. Samsung is No.1 in India's smartphone and flat-panel TV markets.
