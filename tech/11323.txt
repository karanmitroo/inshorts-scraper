The Management board of the Sabarimala temple (Kerala) is planning to install a fully robot-controlled prasadam (Appam) manufacturing and packing unit before the next pilgrim season, which begins in mid-November. A Bangalore-based company had designed and completed its demonstration on Thursday. The board is planning to install three units that could produce 1 lakh packets of Appam a day.
