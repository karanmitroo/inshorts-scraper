Hootsuite's CEO Ryan Holmes has claimed his book 'The 4 Billion Dollar Tweet' inspired Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein to begin tweeting. "He dropped me a note when he got onto Twitter only a couple weeks ago, and he said, hey you convinced me I'm getting into the game," Holmes said. Blankfein first tweeted on June 2.
