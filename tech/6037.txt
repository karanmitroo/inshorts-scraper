US-based company ESI has developed 'ePhone7', a landline phone with a 7-inch touchscreen, meant to be used at business desks. The touchscreen allows users to access contacts, teleconference, record visual voicemails and watch them later. It also displays corporate directories, call history and supports syncing contacts from both the Android and iOS smartphones.
