Security researchers have identified a new malware called 'EternalRocks', which they say exploits the same vulnerability as WannaCry ransomware and is stronger than the latter. Similar to WannaCry, EternalRocks uses NSA tool 'EternalBlue' to spread itself from one computer to the next through Windows. Additionally, it uses six other NSA tools that could help it spread faster than WannaCry.
