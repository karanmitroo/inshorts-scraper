Article-saving, read-it-later app Pocket has added the 'Dyslexie' font to its platform on iOS, aiding people with dyslexia to read better. The font is designed to create subtle changes in character structure to prevent confusion between letters that look similar. Dyslexia is a learning disability that can make it difficult for people suffering from it to read letters and numbers.
