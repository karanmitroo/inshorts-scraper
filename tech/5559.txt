Peter Thiel-backed software startup Palantir, which was last valued at $20 billion, on Monday won its lawsuit against the US Army. Palantir alleged that the Army didn't research commercially available products before awarding contracts for its combat data system as the law required. The verbal ruling allows the company to be eligible for the $200 million contract.
