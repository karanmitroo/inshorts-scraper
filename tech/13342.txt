After 15-years of work, Scientists from French company Carmet have designed an artificial heart made up of cow-tissue, regulated by sensors, softwares and micro-electronics and powered by lithium-ion batteries. The artificial heart, the first heart made of cow-derived materials,  would be of great value if the human trial succeeds. Artificial hearts aren't new and many trials in past have failed.
