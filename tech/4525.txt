Apple has sued chipmaker Qualcomm for $1 billion accusing it of overcharging for royalties and refusing to pay $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said Qualcomm charges the former at least five times more than other cellular patent licensors. Apple further said that the more it innovates, the more money Qualcomm collects and it becomes more expensive to fund innovations.
