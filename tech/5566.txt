British music creation startup Roli has created 'Blocks', a set of modular pieces that can be joined to create a 'music studio'. Starting at $179 (approx â‚¹12,000), the default pressure-sensitive Block can create about 120 instrument sounds with varying vibrato, pitch and tone. The connected iOS app can be used to store and share the music created.
