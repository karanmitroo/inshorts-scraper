Facebook has launched a platform called ThreatExchange, building upon its earlier ThreatData framework, allowing users to share information on security threats. It has added a set of APIs, which allows all participants to share and query information. ThreatExchange is currently open to only a set of pre-approved partners like Yahoo, Dropbox, Bitly etc to prevent hackers from accessing information.
