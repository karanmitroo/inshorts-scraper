Oracle was sued on Wednesday by a former employee who claimed that she was terminated for complaining about improper accounting practices in the company's cloud services business. She said that her bosses instructed her to make Oracle's cloud services' results look better by adding millions in accruals for expected business "with no concrete or foreseeable billing to support the numbers".
