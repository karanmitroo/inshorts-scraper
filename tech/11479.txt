A Japanese district court on Tuesday issued an injunction halting the restart of 2 nuclear reactors citing safety concerns, in a blow to Japan's plans of returning to nuclear energy. Both the reactors had received approval from Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority but the court ruled the new regulations in place after the 2011 Fukushima disaster were no guarantee against reoccurrence.
