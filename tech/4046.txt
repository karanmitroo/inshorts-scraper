After stealing a Brazilian woman's iPhone 5s, the robbers reportedly created a website identical to Apple's sign-in page to trick the woman into revealing her password. The woman's husband sent a message to the stolen iPhone offering to buy it back, but started receiving messages with links to the fake site asking them to log in to retrieve the iPhone.
