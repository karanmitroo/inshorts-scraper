IIT-Kharagpur, which already runs a master's degree course in medical technology, will soon become the only one in the chain to impart medical education alongside technology, as Government has sanctioned a 400-bed super-speciality hospital for IIT-Kharagpur, which will have a medical college attached to it. The construction work of the Rs 230-crore project is slated to begin before Durga Puja.
