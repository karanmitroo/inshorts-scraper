Technology startup WobbleWorks has launched '3Doodler PRO', a 3D-printing pen which can print with materials like wood, copper, bronze and nylon. Elements of these materials are blended into the plastic filament used in the 3D-printing pen. The resulting prints smell like wood, shine like metal, or have a fabric-like feel which can be dyed in different colours.
