Google may reportedly face a $3.4 billion fine from the European Union in a 2010 case for promoting its shopping service in internet searches at the expense of rivals. This will be the biggest anti-trust fine to date, surpassing a 1.1 billion-euro fine imposed on Intel. Google may reportedly be banned from continuing to manipulate search results to favour itself.
