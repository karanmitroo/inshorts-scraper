Researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Android smartphones that could let attackers take control over victims' devices without them knowing. Called 'Cloak and Dagger', the flaw exploits how Android automatically grants the draw-on-top permission for apps downloaded from the Play Store. The apps can then lure users to click on unseen buttons and record their activity on the phone.
