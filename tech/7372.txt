US-based startup Voxelight has developed Sunscreenr, a portable viewer that shows users where they've missed a spot when applying sunscreen or where sunscreen has worn off. Looking through Sunscreenr, users will be able to see dark areas that are covered with sunscreen, and light areas that are vulnerable to sun damage. The waterproof viewer can be pre-ordered for $109.
