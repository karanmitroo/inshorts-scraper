Skype plans to launch an India-specific app considering the low internet speed in the country.  "Indiaâ€™s 2G and 3G network, as well as the mix of phones in use, pose very specific challenges for us. The new application will be much lighter than the one now available, and will require far less computation resources and memory," an official said.
