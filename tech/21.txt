IBM has settled a lawsuit with its former employee Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who was sued by the American technology giant one day after she was hired by Microsoft as Chief Diversity Officer. IBM had earlier enforced McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect its competitive information. As part of the settlement, McIntyre will not begin her new responsibilities at Microsoft until July.
