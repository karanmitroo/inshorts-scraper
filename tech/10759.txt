Google Inc and Samsung Electronics Co have announced releasing monthly security fixes for their Android phones. The move came after Joshua Drake unveiled Stagefright, the hacking software that could access a phoneâ€™s sensitive content with a multimedia message. Nexus phones will reportedly be updated with bug protection this week while other Android handset makers are expected to follow soon after.
