Ex-Google VP Vic Gundotra recently posted photos of his children shot using an iPhone 7 plus and mentioned that he clicked them "without even using the flash." Praising the camera by calling it "stunning", he further said, "If you truly care about great photography, you own an iPhone. If you don't mind being a few years behind, buy an Android."
