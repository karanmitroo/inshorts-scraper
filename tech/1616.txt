The US Federal Communications Commission's Chairman Ajit Pai on Thursday urged Apple to activate iPhones' FM radio chips that don't exist in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models. Pai asked Apple to "reconsider its position" in light of recent hurricanes in the US. In response to Pai's demand, Apple said they don't have antennas designed to support FM signals.
