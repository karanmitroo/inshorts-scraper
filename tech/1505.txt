Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for live-streaming his animated self touring the hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico in virtual reality (VR). According to the CEO, he wanted to show how VR could "raise awareness" of events but "this wasn't clear" in the presentation. However, the 9-minute video is still available on Facebook.
