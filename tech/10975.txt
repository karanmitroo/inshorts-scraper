Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Switzerland) have developed a robot that can be controlled by thoughts and brain signals. The researchers believe that the technology could restore a sense of independence among the disabled. It was tested on some disabled people who "managed to remotely control the robot with ease after less than 10 days of training."
