Scientists in the US are reportedly working to develop artificial intelligence (AI) that can translate animals' vocalisations and facial expressions into English. A Professor Emeritus at Northern Arizona University is collecting videos of dogs showing various barks to train the AI algorithm. The professor reportedly claimed that a pet translator could be available in less than a decade.
