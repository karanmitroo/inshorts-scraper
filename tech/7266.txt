Telecommunications company Telefónica is launching O2 Banking, a mobile banking service in Germany which will reward customers by crediting additional data volume to their smartphones. The more that customers use the MasterCard provided by O2 Banking, the more free wireless data they’ll receive. "We are offering our customers megabytes – not meagre interest", said the COO of Telefónica Germany.
