Tom Scharfeld, a 40-year-old-engineer who created the iPhone app called 'iTrump' won a trademark dispute against US President Donald Trump this month over the name of his app. The app teaches people how to play the trumpet. Scharfeld filed to register the iTrump mark in 2010, which Trump's lawyers argued diluted the quality of "the famous" Trump mark.
