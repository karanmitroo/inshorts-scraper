A South Korean appeals court has freed Samsung heir Jay Y Lee and suspended his sentence for bribing the country's former President Park Geun-hye. Lee's prison term has been reduced by half to 2.5 years, though he is free to go on probation for four years. The court said Lee was only guilty of bribing the confidante of Park Geun-hye.
