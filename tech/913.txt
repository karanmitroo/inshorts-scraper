In a first, US-based researchers have 3D-printed plastic objects and sensors that can communicate with WiFi-connected devices on their own. The technology named "printed WiFi" uses the mechanical motion of springs and switches to reflect radio signals. It can have multiple applications, for example, sensing the detergent quantity left in a bottle based on flow rate and automatically order more.
