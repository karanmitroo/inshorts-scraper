Airtel digital TV Tuesday announced its partnership with Samsung to launch India’s very first Integrated Digital TV (iDTV). Samsung’s SmartDirect TVs will come with an in-built Airtel digital TV Smart Card, which will enable DTH signal reception without the need for customers to install an external set-top-box (STB).
