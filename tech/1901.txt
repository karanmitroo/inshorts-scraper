Billionaire Elon Musk's space exploration startup SpaceX has opened applications for its third Hyperloop Pod competition to be held in 2018. The competition will again take place at SpaceX's 0.77-mile long test track, and will challenge student teams to design the fastest pod. According to SpaceX website, the participating pods must be self-propelled and cannot use SpaceX's pusher vehicle.
