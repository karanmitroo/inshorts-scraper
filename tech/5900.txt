Some Indian consumers who had pre-ordered the now-recalled Samsung Galaxy Note 7 claim that they still haven't received their refunds. Samsung opened pre-orders for the smartphone in India in August but on the day of the launch, sent messages announcing that the phones delivery would be delayed. Consumers claim that Samsung still hasn't communicated with them about the matter.
