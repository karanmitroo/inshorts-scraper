LinkedIn has agreed to pay $13 million to settle a class-action lawsuit. Apparently, the connection requests that LinkedInâ€™s Add Connections tool sends to people are followed up with two reminder e-mails. The lawsuit alleges that those reminders are not approved by users from whose contact lists the people are selected. Users who qualify for the suit will reportedly be paid.
