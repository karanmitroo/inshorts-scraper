Technology giant Google has added the 'Instant Apps' feature in the Google Play Store through a "Try Now" button to let users try Android apps before downloading. The feature is currently available for some apps including New York Times Crossword and BuzzFeed News. The Instant Apps feature, allowing users to try apps without downloading, was first introduced last year.
