Technology major Apple has received a patent for a method to let users call emergency services discreetly by using their fingerprint. The patent describes how users can programme different fingerprints, patterns and even the amount of force required to switch the phone into 'panic mode'. The mode can initiate emergency calls, activate a live-stream, or provide location data via GPS.
