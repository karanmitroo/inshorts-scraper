Microsoft on Monday launched 'Planner', a new project management and team collaboration tool for Office 365 users. With this, the company will enter into a competitive space that includes Trello, Asana and Atlassian's JIRA Core. Planner features a board-based interface where users can plan projects for their teams, assign tasks, share files and get a visual overview of the progress.
