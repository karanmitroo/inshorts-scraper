Rotimatic, a one-foot-long robot roti-maker, is world's first ever fully automated appliance which can pop out one fluffy chapatti per minute. All one needs to do is put flour and water in the containers and dock it atop the robot. The brainchild of Pranoti Nagarkar and Rishi Irani, this machine will be out in 2015 and will cost Rs. 36,000.
