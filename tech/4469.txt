A user of Snapchat's Spectacles has claimed that the case of the smart glasses melted while on charge. "I got a burning smell, it had melted the internals...Luckily, the Spectacles weren't inside the case, so they didn't go the same route as a Note 7," said the user. Snapchat replaced the Spectacles and has recalled the melted case for investigation.
