Google recently released an advertisement for its Photos app, mocking iPhone's storage capabilities. The ad depicts a "Storage Full" alert resembling iPhone's interface coming up when trying to take photos. The company promotes its 'Free Up Space' feature at the end of the ad with the tagline, "Take as many photos as you want, without running out of space".
