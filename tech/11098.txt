Technology experts have warned that 'Unfriend Alert' app that notifies Facebook users whenever someone unfriends them from their friend list may steal users' data. The app is sending login credentials not directly to FB but to yougotunfriended.com, security firm MalwareBytes said. Experts further added that the app that displays ads can also install malicious software on the user's device.
