Swedish researchers have developed an image-processing technique to diagnose ear infections using smartphones and the cloud. The software first uploads the images of the eardrum to the cloud and then compares them with a high-resolution archive of images to search for predefined visual features. According to the published study, the auto-generated diagnoses had an accuracy of 80.6%.
