Technology giant Microsoft's Corporate Vice President (CVP) Joe Belfiore in a tweet admitted that Microsoft is no longer working on building Windows 10 mobile hardware or features. He also said that the lack of app developer support led to the platform's failure. This comes after Microsoft released a version of its Edge web browser for iOS and Android.
