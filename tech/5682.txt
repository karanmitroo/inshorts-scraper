Chinese security camera maker Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology said its products were used to launch a cyber-attack that severed internet access for millions of users. The attackers hijacked their CCTV cameras using malware called Mirai, the company said, adding that cameras made before September 2015 were potentially vulnerable. Notably, the cyber-attack took down sites including Twitter and Spotify.
