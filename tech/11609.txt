An Idaho couple, Jared and Kirsten Maughan, has created an app which 'cleans' books by removing cuss words that would offend the reader. The app, called 'Clean Reader', has 3 settings, namely, "clean", "cleaner" and "squeaky clean". It is available for free on App Store and Google Play, but the user will have to purchase books from the app itself.
