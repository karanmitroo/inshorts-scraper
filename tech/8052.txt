IBM Research scientists have demonstrated reliably storing three bits of data per cell using the Phase Change Memory technology, instead of the usual storage density, that allows cells to be either 'on' or 'off'. The technology will be significantly cheaper than DRAM, which are typically used in personal computers, and will be significantly faster than flash storage, a researcher said.
