Even though Apple's iPhone 5C or 5S hasn't been launched in India yet, one can still buy 5S at the cost of Rs. 65000-100000, depending on the dealer or the city they are in. Also, the factory-unlocked iPhone-5C can be bought from eBay at Rs 55,000 (without official warranty). The prices are very high particularly for the gold-coloured iPhone-5S model.
