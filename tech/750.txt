Apple has patented a long-range wireless charging technology that will let users charge multiple devices from a particular distance from the charger. The technology will also reportedly allow devices to be charged based on priority. For instance, users can set up charging transfers in an order so that the iPhone gets power first, followed by other connected devices.
