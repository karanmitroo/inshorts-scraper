Technology giant Apple has reportedly partnered with Australian startup Sonder Design to incorporate E-Ink keyboards which can be customised to change the keys displayed into its MacBook laptops by 2018. The keyboard can display app-specific layouts or be customised by users to set their own hotkeys. An existing similar concept by Sonder can be connected to Macs using Bluetooth.
