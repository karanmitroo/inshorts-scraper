Manish Singhal, the Co-founder of pi Ventures, in a recent interview said the products that do not use artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) will die a natural death. He also said, we are moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world. Singhal added that the products that utilise intelligence from data "very well" will become market leaders.
