Google has launched Gmailify, a service that lets non-Gmail users access Gmailâ€™s spam protection, inbox organization and Google Now features without changing their existing e-mail addresses. Users can link their Yahoo Mail or Outlook accounts to Gmail by signing in through the Gmail app and enabling Gmailify. Notably, users can already access e-mails from other providers from the Gmail app.
