Social networking giant Facebook has reportedly been sued for allegedly snooping on user's private messages without their prior consent in order to mine the data for its own profit. The lawsuit was filed by two plaintiffs, Matthew Campbell and Michael Hurley, who have accused Facebook of scanning private messages with URLs in them. However, Facebook has refuted the allegations.
