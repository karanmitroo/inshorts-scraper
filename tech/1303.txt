The CEO of encrypted messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov, has said that the platform blocked more than 8,500 channels in October over terrorist links and incitement of violence. "The promotion of violence in any form is banned," Durov added. Telegram has faced criticism in the past over claims that terrorists and other criminals used it for encrypted communication.
