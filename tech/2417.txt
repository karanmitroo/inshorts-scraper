Apple supplier Foxconn plans to build a factory for producing LCD panels in the US over the next three years. It will be built on a 20,000-square-foot plant which will engage at least 3,000 employees. The announcement came soon after Trump said that Apple CEO Tim Cook promised to build "three big plants, beautiful plants" in the US.
