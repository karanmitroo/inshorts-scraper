An eatery at the Oakland International Airport has employed SoftBank's 4-foot tall humanoid robot 'Pepper' to greet the travellers and sell beer and burgers to them. It also offers directions to any traveller looking for help in finding their way around the airport. The robot also has speech-recognition abilities and chest-mounted touchscreen to provide more information.
