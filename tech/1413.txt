Motorola's new video shows a mirror to the society on how affected their experience of Diwali is due to their smartphone habits. In the video, several people are questioned as to which Diwali was the most memorable. The video culminates with the realisation that we aren't celebrating Diwali how we used to, asking what choice will you make this Diwali.
