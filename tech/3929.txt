British broadcaster BBC has claimed that Facebook failed to remove "sexualised" images of children on its platform and instead reported its journalists to UK's National Crime Agency. Facebook reportedly asked BBC to give examples of photos that were flagged but not taken down by its moderators, and then reported the journalists for "distributing images of child exploitation".
