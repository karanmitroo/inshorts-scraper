Harvard University's news website The Harvard Crimson was hacked on Thursday to post fake headlines and altered photos of Facebook Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. The hack happened while Zuckerberg was on campus to receive an honorary doctorate degree, 13 years after dropping out from the university. Harvard's satirical student publication, Harvard Lampoon later claimed responsibility for the hack.
