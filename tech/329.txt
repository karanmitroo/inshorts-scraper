In a Facebook post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said, "I've made almost every mistake you can imagine," adding that he has made dozens of bad deals. "I've trusted the wrong people and I've put talented people in the wrong roles", he said. However, he added that the Facebook community exists, not because of avoiding mistakes but trying to solve challenges.
