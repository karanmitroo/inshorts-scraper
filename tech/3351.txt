Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company is experiencing a "pause in purchases of the iPhone...due to earlier and more frequent reports about future iPhones." Apple shipped 50.8 million iPhones in the quarter ended April 1, 2017, down from 51.2 million a year ago. However, revenue from iPhones grew 1% as the phones were priced higher than previous years.
