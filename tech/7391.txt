Google on Tuesday announced a series of updates for its search results that will help its users find best deals on flights and accommodations. It will highlight deals when certain hotels are cheaper than normal, and will suggest tweaking the dates of the stay to get cheaper deals. The new features will also include price tracking for flights.
