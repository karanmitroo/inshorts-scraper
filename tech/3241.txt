Technology companies Intel and Samsung have backed a lawsuit by US government agency FTC against chipmaker Qualcomm for unfairly using its patents to harm competition. The company has been accused of "abusive patent and commercial practices" and refusing to license its technology. Earlier, iPhone maker Apple also filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm for charging excessive royalties.
