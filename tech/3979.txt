The government will launch an 'I am Trolled' app to help women internet users threatened with physical violence or trolled on social media, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi said on Friday. "It is unfortunate to see that women are equally abusive on social media as men," she added. Further, 'panic button' for women will also be functional from March-end, Gandhi said.
