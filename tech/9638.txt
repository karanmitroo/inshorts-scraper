French electronics company Withings has developed a smart thermometer 'Thermo', that detects the body temperature within two seconds. The device detects the body's temperature after receiving a light touch on the temple. The recorded temperature can be seen on the device as well as on a dedicated app provided by the company. Withings has priced the Thermo at $100.
