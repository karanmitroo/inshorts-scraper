Facebook has shut down a 200,000-member Australian group, 'Bloke's Advice' after allegations that its posts incited domestic violence against women and encouraged assault. An organisation called 'The Red Heart Campaign' started a petition for its removal on Change.org, which brought national attention to the group. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the group's removal because of its posts.
