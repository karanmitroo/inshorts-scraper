A UK-based startup has developed a smartwatch 'Blocks' with modular strap, which comes with different modules for various functions. The modules perform functions including heart rate tracking, camera, GPS, gesture control, finger identification and flash memory. A user can choose the modules with desired functions to build their own customised smartwatch.
