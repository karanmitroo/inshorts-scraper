Mozilla on Wednesday rolled out an update for its open-source web browser Firefox for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android platforms, featuring a new free cross-browser video chat app called 'Firefox Hello'. The new app doesnâ€™t require its users to sign up to receive calls, but the same would be needed for adding contacts and calling the contacts directly.
