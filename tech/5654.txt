A Finance Ministry official from South Korea on Tuesday said that electronic giant Samsung's decision to end production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone likely erased 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points from the country's GDP growth in Q3. South Korea's central bank has estimated GDP growth at 0.7% in the third quarter compared to the previous three-month period.
