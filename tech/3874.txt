Tom Moore, the head of Google's 'Project Loon' to beam internet to remote parts of the world using balloons, has stepped down after only six months. Moore is being replaced by wireless antenna company Quintel's CEO Alastair Westgarth. Google started testing Loon balloons in 2013 and is working with Vodafone in New Zealand and Telefonica SA in South America.
