After completing 7 years at the International Space Station, NASA's humanoid robot 'Robonaut' is being sent back to Earth for repairs. Developed in collaboration with General Motors, the robot originally had just a torso with five fingers on both hands to perform tasks like humans. However, after addition of legs in 2014, it started malfunctioning due to compatibility issues.
