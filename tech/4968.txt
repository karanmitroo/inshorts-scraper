Social networking giant Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey has not received an invitation to the US President-elect Donald Trump's tech summit, scheduled to start on Wednesday in New York. The event, however, will be attended by Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, among others. Notably, Trump had extensively used Twitter for his election campaign.
