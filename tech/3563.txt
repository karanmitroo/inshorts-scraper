Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco has called off its planned $2 billion acquisition of US television maker Vizio, citing "regulatory headwinds." LeEco Chairman Jia Yueting last year admitted that the company was facing a cash crunch and got over-extended in its global strategy. The company has also been accused of being behind on payments to suppliers and delaying employee salaries.
