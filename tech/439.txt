Twitter has revealed that Russian-linked Twitter bots shared US President Donald Trump's tweets almost 4.7 lakh times during the final months of the 2016 Presidential elections. They accounted for over 4% of the retweets Trump received from September 1 to November 15, while Democrats' candidate Hillary Clinton got less than 50,000 retweets by the automated accounts during the same period.
