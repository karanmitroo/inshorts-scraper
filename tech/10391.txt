Almost three-fourth of women worldwide are exposed to some kind of online violence, a UN report claimed. Only 26% of the law enforcement agencies in the 86 nations surveyed took appropriate action against cyber violence. Nearly 35% of victimised Indian women reported the cyber violence, while 46.7% did not and the rest were unaware of being exploited.
