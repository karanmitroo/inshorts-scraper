Technology giant Google has admitted to serving advertisements on its paid YouTube Red subscription service which is supposed to be ad-free. Earlier, users had claimed that ads were displayed on the home page and underneath certain clips. After initially suggesting that some ads were allowed on YouTube Red, Google issued a clarification later and blamed it on a technical issue.
