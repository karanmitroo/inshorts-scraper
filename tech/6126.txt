US-based wearable technology firm BSX Athletics has developed what it claims to be the first wearable gadget that monitors body hydration level in real-time. Named 'LVL', the wristband monitor also tracks sleep, heart rate, activity and mood, and displays the data on an OLED touchscreen. The product has been launched on Kickstarter and is expected to be priced at $199.
