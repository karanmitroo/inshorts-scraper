Cyber Caliphate, a hacker group supporting the ISIS, has reportedly hijacked over 54,000 Twitter accounts, including the ones owned by members of the CIA and FBI. Done in response to a drone attack that killed a British ISIS extremist, the group also made sensitive data of the account holders public. Cyber Caliphateâ€™s main Twitter account has been suspended since.
