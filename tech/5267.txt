Mozilla Firefox has unveiled its new web browser for iPhones called the 'Firefox Focus,' a private browser that blocks advertisements and analytics that track a user's data automatically. An ‘erase’ button removes the entire browser history in a go. Based on the feedback of the iPhone users, Firefox plans to launch the browser for Android users as well.
