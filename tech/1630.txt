Technology giant Microsoft's Co-founder Bill Gates in a recent interview said, "I recently did switch to an Android phone," and added that it runs "a lot of Microsoft software". While Gates showed no interest in an iPhone but he did admit that Steve Jobs was a "genius". Microsoft started selling Samsung Galaxy S8 with Microsoft applications earlier this year.
