A group of roughly 20,000 attendees at Niantic's Pokémon Go Fest on Saturday booed the executives on stage after the game stopped working due to technical glitches. The attendees reportedly shouted "Fix your game" and "We can't play" after the company's CEO John Hanke took the stage. Niantic has announced that it will refund attendees and give them $100-worth Pokécoins.
