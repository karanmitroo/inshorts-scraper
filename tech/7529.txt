Cambridge-based James Newman has developed a giant computer called Megaprocessor, which is 33 feet wide and 6 feet high, at his home. Having started working on the project in 2012, Newman spent almost $53,000 on the computer, that features 40,000 transistors, 10,000 LEDs and weighs around 500 kg. He has so far used the computer to play 'Tetris'.
