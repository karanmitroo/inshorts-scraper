The East African nation of Rwanda is being considered for testing the worldâ€™s first port for cargo drones. "Specialist drones can carry blood and life-saving supplies over 100 kilometres at minimal cost", complementing the relatively weak terrestrial infrastructure of its hilly landscape, one of the proposals read. The drone-port project is expected to begin in 2016.
