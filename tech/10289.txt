NASA has released the first-ever 4K UHD video taken in space. In it, Astronaut Scott Kelly at the ISS is dissolving an effervescent tablet in a floating ball of water. Due to the camera recording four times the resolution of standard 1080p HD cameras, one can view details like individual pockets of water exploding off the surface of the ball.
