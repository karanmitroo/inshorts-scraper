About 20,000 ancient trees on Mountain Tai in China now have digital ID cards, which will provide a range of information about the trees. Along with basic information, the system will help officials examine the growing environment, condition of trees and climate, among other things. The system will also help calculate whether a tree is healthy, weak or dying.
