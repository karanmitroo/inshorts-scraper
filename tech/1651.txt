Twitter has refused to take down a tweet by US President Donald Trump on North Korea, saying it was "newsworthy" and in the public interest. Trump's tweet threatening that North Korea "won't be around much longer" was reported for violating Twitter's terms of service by some users. The policy bans using the platform to make violent threats, directly or indirectly.
