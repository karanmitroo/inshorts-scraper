Retail chain Tesco opened what is believed to be the world's first virtual reality (VR) store in Seoul, South Korea in 2011. Customers were required to scan barcodes of products displayed on screens at the Seolleung subway station, and the items were later delivered to them. Over 500 items, including food, electronics, and toiletries were offered at the virtual store.
