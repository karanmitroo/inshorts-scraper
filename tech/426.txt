Chat app Discord has shut down a user-created group named 'deepfakes' on its platform, that was spreading fake celebrity porn videos using artificial intelligence (AI). A company spokesperson said the group violated its rules against non-consensual pornography, and such violations warrant "an instant shut down on the servers". The group reportedly contained at least 150 logged in users.
