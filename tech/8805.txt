Yahoo has announced an update that lets users sign up for its services without having to specially create a new Yahoo e-mail address. Users can now access Yahoo platforms through their existing e-mail addresses including Gmail and Outlook. The feature is currently operational for Yahoo Fantasy Sports and will soon roll out for Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo Messenger.
