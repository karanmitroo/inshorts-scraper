NASA has announced five research projects that may help make planes more efficient and green. The projects are aimed at shrinking fuel use, reducing aviation’s impact on the environment and quieting noise around airports. One of these studies will be based on Lithium-Air "breathing batteries” which expel oxygen as the battery is being charged.
