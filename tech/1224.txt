Afghanistan will not block instant messaging services WhatsApp and Telegram, the government has said. This comes after Afghanistan's acting minister for telecommunications said last week that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to block the services over "technical problems". The order had ignited a backlash, with people describing the blockage as an assault on their right to free speech.
