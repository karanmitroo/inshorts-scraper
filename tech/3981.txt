Pizza Hut, in collaboration with custom sneaker maker The Shoe Surgeon, has introduced a new pair of shoes named 'Pie Tops', which can be used to order pizzas. The tongue of the right sneaker has a button, which on being pushed, triggers the Pizza Hut mobile application to order pizza. The order can also be customised on the application.
