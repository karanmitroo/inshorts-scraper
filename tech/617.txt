Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie Bezos have donated $33 million in college scholarships to give undocumented immigrants called 'Dreamers', the opportunity to go to college. The amount will fund 1,000 immigrant graduates of US high schools with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. The aid will help students pay the cost of tuition, fees and books.
