TRAI Chairman RS Sharma has said that Apple's stance of not allowing its Do-Not-Disturb app to appear on the App Store is "unreasonable". Earlier TRAI had accused Apple of engaging in "data colonisation" and being "anti-consumer" over the same issue. The TRAI app which is supported on Google's Play Store allows users to flag spam calls and messages from telemarketers.
