Japanese artist Ei Wada created music using a row of old Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) television sets. He used the capacitive effect of the TV screens to create percussive sounds with varying pitch. Wada, who also leads a live act called the 'Open Reel Ensemble', specialises in repurposing old electronic appliances and gadgets into musical instruments.
