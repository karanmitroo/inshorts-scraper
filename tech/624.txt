Gaming hardware maker Razer has developed a wireless and battery-less mouse which draws its power from the mousepad in real-time, with the combo being priced at $250. Unveiled at CES 2018, the technology called Razer HyperFlux, allows the mousepad to create a magnetic field that transfers power directly to its companion mouse rather than charging a battery.
