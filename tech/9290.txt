Technology giant Apple recently acquired LegbaCore, a security firm that was able to permanently infect Mac computers in August last year by silently embedding itself in the operating system's firmware. Saying that they weren't sure of the reason for this acquisition, one of the LegbaCore co-founders Xeno Kovah mentioned in a tweet that it could probably be for "low-level security".
