Britain is set to get the world's biggest wind farm after the proposal for the 1.2-gigawatt Hornsea Project One in northern England was accepted. Scheduled to be completed by 2020, the farm would span up to 407 square kilometres and would use 174 wind turbines, each 190 metres tall. The construction of the project will create an estimated 2,000 jobs.
