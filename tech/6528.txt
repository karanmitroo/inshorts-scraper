A Huawei Honor 8 smartphone was attached to a balloon and set off into the sky on Monday in Sweden, in an attempt to set a record for the highest livestream from a smartphone. Huawei Technologies' Peter Lundkvist said the balloon burst at an altitude of 18,421 metres, adding, "Hopefully, Guinness (World Records) will accept this as a world record".
