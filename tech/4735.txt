Japanese carmaker Honda on Friday unveiled an electric self-driving car concept called 'NeuV' that uses artificial intelligence to understand owners' emotions and also helps them earn money via ride-sharing. NeuV is designed to operate as a part of a self-driving ride-fleet, letting owners generate revenue from their vehicles when they're not in use.
