The daughter of an Apple engineer, Brooke Peterson, has claimed the technology giant fired her father after she posted a video of iPhone X on YouTube, before its launch. The video, filmed at Apple's campus, showed the engineer giving a peek at iPhone X's camera. She also said that she took down the video immediately after Apple asked her to.
