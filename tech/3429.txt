A Thai woman, whose husband broadcast the murder of their 11-month-old daughter live on Facebook before committing suicide, has defended the social media major. "I am not angry at Facebook or blaming them on this... I understand that people shared the video because they were outraged," she said. Facebook failed to take the video down for about 24 hours.
