US doctors have successfully performed the world’s first skull-scalp transplant on a 55-year-old man who suffered a large head wound from cancer treatment. The patient, James Boysen, simultaneously received the craniofacial tissue transplant as a kidney and pancreas transplant in 15-hour operation on May 22. "This kind of a triple transplantation has never been reported…," a doctor said.
