Singapore-based dating app HighBlood has been facing flak for sharing a 'racist' and 'elitist' post on Facebook. The app claims to be the world's first accountant-audited dating app to help users choose partners based on verified information like income, profession and education. The post says the app ensures "no banglas", a racist term for Bangladeshi migrant workers in Singapore.
