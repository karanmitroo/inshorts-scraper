Facebook has automatically started improving the contrast and lighting of all images uploaded by the users. The update, currently available to Apple users, will soon be added to the android Facebook app. There is also an option of adding filters but Facebook tries to make all uploaded images look better. The effects can be toned up or down before uploading.
