Two US Democratic senators have written to Secretary of Defense James Mattis asking which phone President Donald Trump is using. They have also asked if Trump has received a secure and encrypted phone since he took the office. Earlier, reports claimed that Trump is still using his old personal phone even after taking over as the US President.
