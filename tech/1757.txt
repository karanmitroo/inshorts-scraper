Action Launcher app, which lets users customise their Android phone's home screens, now also allows accessing some of Android Oreo's features on older phones. After being installed, the app allows users to have features like notification dots, adaptive icons, and restyled app shortcuts with in-app purchases. It also offers a Pixel-style home screen, with Google Now panel, on non-Pixel phones.
