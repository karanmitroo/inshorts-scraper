Dell has released its Chromebook 13 targeted at the business market. Designed to be used primarily for web applications, it does not have a hard drive aside from a small SSD to hold the OS. The device, slated for shipping in September, reportedly offers up to 12 hours of battery life, and can boot up in less than six seconds.
