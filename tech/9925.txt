Verizon Wireless has announced the launch of its Wi-Fi calling feature for Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge devices from next week. The feature, that can be activated for audio and video calls through a software update, lets users make phone calls even in areas with poor network coverage. The service will be available on iPhones by “early next year”.
