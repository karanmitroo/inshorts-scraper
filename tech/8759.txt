Google on Tuesday removed an app from its Play Store that was reportedly used by Pakistani intelligence agencies to spy on the Indian Army. Called SmeshApp, it was reportedly used during the Pathankot airbase attack to access classified information. The app allows third party access to personal information including text messages, location, phone logs and photos.
