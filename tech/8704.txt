Kazakhstan has banned smartphones in government offices and police stations to prevent information leak. A government document, leaked to the media, cites "increasingly frequent cases of confidential information being leaked through the WhatsApp mobile application" as the reason for the ban. However, basic mobile phones with no cameras and internet access can still be used in the said premises.
