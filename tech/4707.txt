Colorado-based startup Decibullz has created a pair of earphones that can be softened by putting in boiling water to mould the wings around the earbuds according to the shape of a user's ears. The wired earphones are priced at $59 (approximately ₹4,000) while the wireless version costs $119 (approximately ₹8,100). The earphones claim a battery life of 3-4 hours.
