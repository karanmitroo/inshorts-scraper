China-based startup Dreamlight has developed a sleeping mask that emits light from LED panels present on its inside to wake the user. Unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, the mask also emits infrared light that can enhance a user's beauty, according to Dreamlight.  The app-connected mask can also play white music and personalised audio to promote natural sleep.
