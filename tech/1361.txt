Reports have claimed that a Reliance Jio phone exploded in Kashmir while it was being charged, melting the back of the handset. However, the phone's battery was reportedly intact after the explosion, but the phone charger's wire melted. A Reliance spokesperson said the damage was intentionally caused and the incident was designed by vested interests to malign the brand.
