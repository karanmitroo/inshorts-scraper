Faceware Technologies, a facial animation and motion capture firm has built a video game technology that copies users' actual facial expressions in real time. It uses webcams to detect players' expressions and projects them onto their virtual avatars which are also synced with what they are saying. Multiplayer combat game Star Citizen will be the first to incorporate the technology.
