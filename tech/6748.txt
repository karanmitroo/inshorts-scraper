Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak has said that if the latest iPhone ships without a headphone jack, it would "tick off a lot of people". Reports suggest that unlike previous generations, the iPhone 7 will not have a 3.5 mm jack, instead users will have to buy additional adaptors to connect earphones to the phone.
