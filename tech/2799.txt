Surveyor General of India Swarna Subba Rao on Thursday said that Google Maps is "not authenticated" by the government and unfit for high-end applications. Rao claimed that the service is widely used by consumers to find just "restaurants and parks", and the government doesn't rely on it. A new initiative by Survey of India makes its maps accessible to Indians.
