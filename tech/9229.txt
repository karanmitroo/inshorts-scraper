US-based teen Utkarsh Tandon has made a 3D-printed smart ring called 'OneRing', that identifies and monitors Parkinson's motor symptoms. Available in three sizes, the ring generates daily patient reports and helps doctors to prescribe medications more accurately. The results of data collected by the ring can be viewed on a smartphone through a dedicated iOS app.
