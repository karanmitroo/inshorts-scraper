Durex recently conducted a social experiment dubbed "#DoNotDisturb" on six couples divided into two groups, couples with technology and couples without technology. The company invited couples on a holiday to observe which of these groups spend a better time together. Notably, in a Durex study on 2,000 adults, 57% respondents wanted their partners to turn their phones off during holidays.
