Amazon has revealed a new delivery locker for apartment buildings called 'The Hub'. The lockers will store parcels that arrive for residents of the building when they are away and can be accessed by entering a pickup code into a touchscreen panel. The company said the locker system will accept delivery from all carriers, and not just from Amazon.
