According to Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma, the Indian electronics company will start manufacturing all its phones in the country by 2018. The decision of shifting production back from China reportedly comes as Chinese labour costs have increased and the network of local suppliers has grown. Notably, Micromax recently announced an investment of â‚¹300 crore for ramping up domestic production.
