UK-based Windhorse Aerospace has proposed creating drones made from compressed vegetables and landing gear made from salami to provide food in areas of need. The startup's Founder Nigel Gifford claims a loaded version of the edible drone could feed 100 people for a day. Gifford previously led development of solar-powered drone Aquila, which was sold to Facebook for $20 million.
