A video shows a Microsoft employee installing Google Chrome after Edge stopped working during a presentation. In the video, the employee is seen informing the audience that he'll be taking a moment to install Chrome to finish the session. He further jokingly said, "We are not going to help make Google better", when prompted to share browser data with Google.
