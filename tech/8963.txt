Ubisoft's 'Far Cry Primal', released earlier in the week, strikes up a fine balance between tension and fun that elevates the overall experience, according to GameSpot. Rating the game as 7.9/10, IGN said that the detailed character designs and performances are excellent and successfully captures the primal ancient feel. However, the plotline lacks any real twist and variety, IGN added.
