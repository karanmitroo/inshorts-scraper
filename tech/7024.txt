A one-minute video on YouTube shows an architect using Microsoft's Augmented Reality headset HoloLens to design buildings. The architect is shown picking up overlays of structures from digital screens to check the size of the surrounding landscape and checking the building designs from inside for a more immersive experience. The architect claims that the HoloLens can replace physical drawings.
