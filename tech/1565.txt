Richard Smith, former Equifax CEO has said the data breach at Equifax happened because the individual who was "responsible for communicating in the organisation to apply the patch, did not." Equifax earlier admitted that the breach compromised personal information of 143 million Americans, nearly half the population of the US. The breach exposed dates of birth and addresses of customers.
