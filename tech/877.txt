Employment-oriented social networking platform LinkedIn dismissed a report that found a security flaw in the platform last month, researcher Khalil Shreateh has claimed. The bug could be disguised as a LinkedIn authentication prompt, thereby tricking users into sharing their passwords, Shreateh said. In 2013, Shreateh hacked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wall to highlight a security flaw.
