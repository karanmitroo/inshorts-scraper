Microsoft has created a chatbot that hides behind fake online advertisements offering sex in exchange for money and poses as a person to initiate conversations with potential buyers. Once an offer of money for sex is made, it warns buyers of its legal consequences. The bot, built in collaboration with non-profit organisations, aims to reduce demand for sex workers.
