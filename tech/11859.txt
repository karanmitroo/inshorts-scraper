NASA is very close to finding the Earth's twin planet, astronomers said Tuesday. Announcing the discovery of eight new planets, astronomers said that two of the eight are the most Earth-like of any known planets found so far outside our solar system. The two planets have hard, rocky surfaces, and suitable temperatures for the existence of life.
