Responding to a comment by Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak, Elon Musk has said that Wozniak "is a lovable, fuzzy bear". Wozniak had earlier said, "Now I don't believe anything Elon Musk or Tesla says, but I still love the car." Wozniak's comment was in reference to the delays in the implementation of technology that Musk claimed Tesla cars would have.
