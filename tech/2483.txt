World's largest criminal online marketplace AlphaBay's alleged Founder Alexandre Cazes was caught after the police tracked 'pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com' email address to him. Users who signed up on AlphaBay for the first time when the website was launched in 2014 received a welcome email from this ID. Cazes was arrested on July 5 in Thailand, where he was found dead last week.
