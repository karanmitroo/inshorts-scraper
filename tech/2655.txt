A San Francisco-based startup has created a toothbrush called Amabrush which claims to clean all teeth at once in 10 seconds. It is shaped like a mouthguard with a removable handle that vibrates and dispenses toothpaste on being pressed. Priced at about â‚¹7,300, a variant of the Amabrush also comes with a wireless charging option.
