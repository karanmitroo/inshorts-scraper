Germany-based researchers working with US chip manufacturer Intel have developed a 3D scanning method that can reconstruct a digital object even from incomplete datasets. Flawed or incomplete 3D geometries in current technologies cause problems for applications in augmented reality, robots and 3D printing, said researchers. The new technology can be developed to even work on deformable objects.
