Us company Battelle has developed a drone-defending gun 'DroneDefender', that produces an invisible beam to halt and bring down flying drones. The gun uses radio control frequency disruption that stops a drone from flying by keeping it unhurt. The gun can operate five hours in a single charge and has a range of 400 meters.
