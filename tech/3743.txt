Whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks on Thursday published documents pertaining to hacking attacks used by the Central Intelligence Agency to gain access to Apple products like MacBooks and iPhones. The documents also detail CIA's 'Sonic Screwdriver' project which allows attackers to activate the malicious software on MacBook laptops from a USB stick "even when a firmware password is enabled."
