Dutch inventor Moos Neimeijer has created a device called 'Minimeyes' in partnership with porn platform xHamster that minimises all open windows on a computer and mutes the sound when someone enters a user's private space. The Bluetooth-enabled motion sensing device, priced at â‚¹3,000, has a range of 16.4 feet and uses a passive infrared lens to monitor the room.
