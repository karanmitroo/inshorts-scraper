Google filed a patent on Tuesday for a drone 'delivery receptacle' that can store packages securely for delivery at different locations. The receptacle guides drones for delivery by connecting them in the air using infrared beacons. The project's leader had earlier said drones can start delivering packages by 2017 after the US Federal Aviation Administration finalises regulations for drones.
