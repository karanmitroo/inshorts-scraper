US-based wireless Bluetooth speaker maker Ultimate Ears has launched an update for its speakers' app to introduce a 'PartyUp' feature, that allows the users to pair more than 50 speakers at one time. The app also allows adjusting the volume of individual speakers. The company claims that it successfully paired more than 140 speakers at once in a testing environment.
