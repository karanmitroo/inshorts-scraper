The government is planning to enable users to make landline calls from WhatsApp, Skype and Viber. An inter-ministerial panel of the government will discuss the integration of these online services with internet service providers (ISPs) and telecom operators. An official said, “The move has been cleared by the inter-ministerial telecom commission and groundwork to get it going will start soon.”
