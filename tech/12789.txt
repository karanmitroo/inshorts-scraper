A team of Michigan State University scientists led by IIT Kanpur alum Anil Jain have built the first three-dimensional model of a human fingerprint. They have developed a method that takes two-dimensional image of a fingerprint and maps it to a 3-D finger surface. "This would help improve the overall accuracy of fingerprint-matching systems, leading to better security," Jain said.
