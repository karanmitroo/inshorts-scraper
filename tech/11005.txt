Microsoft is giving away Windows 10 for free to anyone as long as they test it out through the Windows Insiders program. The free upgrade offer will be applicable only to those who are running Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, provided it is installed within a year of July 29th. However, those running the counterfeit version will be charged.
