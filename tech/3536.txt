Hacker group OurMine this week hacked into several YouTube vlog accounts managed by media company Studio71 such as Roman Atwood and 'Superwoman' Lilly Singh in what it claims was the "biggest hack in YouTube history." The group changed video titles to "#OurMine," while the descriptions read, "Don't worry we are just testing your security, please contact us for more information."
