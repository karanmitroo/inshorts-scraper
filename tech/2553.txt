A French court on Wednesday ruled internet giant Google isn't liable for €1.1 billion (over ₹8,100 crore) in back taxes to the country. French authorities had accused Google of dodging French taxes by routing sales through Ireland. The ruling followed a court adviser's recommendation that Google did not have a "permanent establishment" or sufficient taxable presence to justify the bill.
