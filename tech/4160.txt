A US university's internet network was attacked by malware-infected devices like vending machines and light bulbs. The malicious software spread to over 5,000 of the university's devices by making use of their default or weak passwords. The devices were then re-programmed to try and connect to seafood-related websites every 15 minutes, making the university's internet slow or inaccessible.
