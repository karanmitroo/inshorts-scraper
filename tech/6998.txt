Scientists from US-based Iowa State University have created a self-destructing lithium-ion battery that can dissolve in water within 30 minutes. The 1 mm-thick and 5 mm-long battery is capable of powering a calculator for 15 minutes. Unlike normal batteries, the battery is encased in degradable polymer composite material, that swells and dissolves in water.
