Microsoft and Cyanogen are reportedly working on “deeply integrating” Microsoft's digital voice assistant Cortana into Cyanogen OS. In a bid to eliminate Google dependencies from Android, Cyanogen is planning to integrate third-party apps and services with core operating systems. This can effectively replace Google Docs with Microsoft Office, Google Now with Cortana, and Google Keep with OneNote.
