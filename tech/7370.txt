The first photo uploaded on the web is of an all-female parody pop group of CERN employees called ‘Les Horribles Cernettes’, taken on July 18, 1992. It was approximately the size of a stamp and took a minute to load. Though researchers internally shared scientific images before, this photo was the first "photo that opened the web to life."
