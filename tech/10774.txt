Manish Kumar, an Indian-American professor from Pennsylvania, has developed a self-assembling synthetic membrane that can aid in better water purification, drug delivery and DNA recognition. The biomimetic membrane is composed of fat and protein molecules that self-assemble into two-dimensional structures with parallel channels, and can transport a billion water molecules per channel per second.
