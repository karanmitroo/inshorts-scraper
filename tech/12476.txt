The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has rejected Apple's application to trademark the name 'Touch ID' for its fingerprint scanning technology. Apple's application was denied on the grounds that the trademark for the name 'Touch ID' has been granted to Kronos, a US-based company that makes workforce management software. The trademark was given to Kronos in 2001.
