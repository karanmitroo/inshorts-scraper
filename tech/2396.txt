Google has dropped the seven-year-old 'Instant Search' feature for mobile devices that showed search results while users were still typing their queries. Users will still be able to see recommended search results powered by auto-complete in the standard drop-down menu, but the results page won't load till users click enter. Google claims the move will make Search fluid across platforms.
