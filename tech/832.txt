Facebook has rolled out new tools which will allow users to block unwanted friend requests and messages. The features proactively recognise blocked accounts and help prevent them from contacting users even if they set up a new account. Facebook will also allow users to ignore a Messenger conversation and automatically remove it from the inbox without blocking the sender.
