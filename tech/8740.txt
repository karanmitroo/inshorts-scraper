Japanese conglomerate Canon has agreed to buy Toshiba's medical equipment unit for $5.9 billion, as the latter is selling the unit to help fund restructuring after the company witnessed a massive accounting scandal. Canon, which makes X-ray machines and eye examination devices, is planning to expand into high-margin medical devices, as demand for cameras has "declined" in recent times.
