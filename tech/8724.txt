Houston-based Jonathan Rockett has developed ‘The Shooting Club’, an app that aims to create a “social shooting experience”. It allows users to talk to other gun owners, find the nearest shooting range and use one of the app’s targets to record their shots. Users can also scan their targets, upload it to the app and compare it with other shooters.
