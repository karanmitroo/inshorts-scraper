Dutch inventors have created a 26-foot-long steel 'vacuum cleaner' to be placed atop buildings to filter out toxic particles from the machine's surrounding atmosphere. The vacuum has the capability to suck in air from a 300-metre radius and from up to seven kilometres upwards. It can filter out 100% of fine particles and 95% of ultra-fine particles from the air.
