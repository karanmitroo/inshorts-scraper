Owners of Samsung's latest flagship phone Galaxy S8 have taken to social media to complain that the handsets are randomly restarting by themselves. Some users claimed their smartphones had restarted over five times within the first 10 hours of use. Samsung customer service reportedly told a user that the restarts could be the result of issues related to third-party apps.
