Facebook on Thursday applied for a new patent for a ride-sharing feature that would be integrated on its events page with a new selection displaying "Going and driving" and "Going and not driving" options. The feature will then work like a standard ride-sharing application, showing the driving route and whoâ€™ll be picked up along the way.
