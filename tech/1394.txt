Google has said that it will reimburse the customers who overpaid for its newly launched Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones after pop-up shops in the US charged them an extra sum. The pop-up shops added an extra $30 to the original retailing price. Acknowledging the error, Google apologised for the confusion and said it has fixed the problem.
