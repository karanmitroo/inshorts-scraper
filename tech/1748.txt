Saudi Arabia has lifted its ban on voice and video calling apps such as WhatsApp and Skype, in a move aimed at boosting productivity and economic growth. The Ministry of Communications said the decision was "an important step in the kingdom's internet regulation". However, the authorities will continue to regulate the internet to restrict content that violates the kingdom's laws.
