Twitter on Wednesday launched a new timeline that shows users customised tweets at the top around the topics they are interested in, in reverse chronological order. Further, users can choose to turn on or turn off the feature. Twitter claims that the feature is already creating more live commentary. Notably, this comes after a massive backlash against the move.
