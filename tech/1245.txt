Microblogging platform Twitter has said that it has implemented safeguards to increase security after a Twitter employee on Thursday deactivated US President Donald Trump's personal account. Trump's account was brought back online 11 minutes later, the social media company said this week. After the incident, Trump's Twitter follower count briefly dropped to around 4,000.
