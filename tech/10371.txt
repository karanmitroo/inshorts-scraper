According to a report released by technology website Re/code on Tuesday, microblogging site Twitter is planning to launch a new product where users can share content beyond 140 characters. Twitter executives are also discussing to exclude the links and user handles from the existing 140-character limit, the report added. Last month, Twitter relaxed the 140-character limit on direct messages.
