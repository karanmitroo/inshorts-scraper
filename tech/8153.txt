Google today launched 'Gboard', a free keyboard iOS app in the US with integrated Google Search, GIFs and emojis. Users can search for images, videos, nearby stores, restaurants, flight timings, news, weather forecasts and other information directly through the keyboard without switching to the Google app. The keyboard also supports swipe-based typing by sliding finger from letter to letter.
