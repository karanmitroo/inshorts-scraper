Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos on Thursday tweeted his support for constructing a "superhighway in space." Bezos shared an article which said NASA should focus on developing infrastructure in space like human habitats with vegetable gardens and gas stations instead of building rockets. The article proposes that rockets be provided by private ventures like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Bezos' Blue Origin.
