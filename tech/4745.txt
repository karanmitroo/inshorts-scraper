California-based startup Sevenhugs has created a smart remote to control over 25,000 devices from companies like Samsung, LG, and Sony. The remote's 3.53-inch screen can adapt to each device the user points it at using WiFi, Bluetooth, Infrared and even motion tracking. Using special sensors, users can even order an Uber by simply pointing the remote at the door.
