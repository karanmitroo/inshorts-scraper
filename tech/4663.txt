Dutch startup Clear Flight Solutions has made a drone named 'Robird' that looks like an eagle to chase away the birds from airport areas to keep aviation safe. The remote-controlled drone can even glide through the air for periods of time and drive birds in the direction it is made to. The drones are 3D printed and assembled by hand.
