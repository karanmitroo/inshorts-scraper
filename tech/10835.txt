After the Mars Orbiter Mission and the launch of five British satellites, ISRO is planning its next ‘deep space exploration' missions to Venus, an asteroid, and a second time to Mars. “A project has to be formulated before we chart out a proper roadmap for the explorations,” ISRO Chairman Kiran Kumar said. NASA might possibly work with India in these missions.
