Technology giant Apple has admitted its smart speaker HomePod leaves "mild marks" when placed on a wooden surface. The stains can be caused by oils diffusing between the silicone base and the table surface, the company said. It is "not unusual" for any speaker with a vibration-damping silicone base to leave marks when placed on a wooden surface, Apple added.
