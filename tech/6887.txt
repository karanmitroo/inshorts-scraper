US-based man Tyrone Hazen has created a speaker named 'Fireside Audiobox' which plays music and also makes fire dance to the beat of the song being played. The handcrafted speaker connects with any Bluetooth-enabled device and provides eight hours of music playback on a single charge. Hazen mapped the sound waves within an aluminium tube to make the fire dance.
