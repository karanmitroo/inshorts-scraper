Hyperloop One has achieved a record speed of 309 kmph on its 500-metre Nevada track while testing its full-scale pod this week. While a test pod could only achieve 112.6 kmph earlier this month, the final Hyperloop system is expected to reach 1,200 kmph. Hyperloop One's pods use electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation to travel in near-vacuum tubes.
