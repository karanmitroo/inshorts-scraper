US-based researchers have created nanowires using genetically modified soil bacteria Geobacter, a species abundantly occurring in nature. Replacing the bacterial amino acids with tryptophan to increase conductivity, the team created wires smaller and more durable than conventional ones. If incorporated, future computer processors could reportedly be made using natural resources like plant waste.
