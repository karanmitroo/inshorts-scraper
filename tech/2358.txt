US state Hawaii will ban pedestrians using mobile phones while crossing the street in Honolulu from October. Pedestrians will be fined ₹1,000 to ₹6,400 depending on the number of times they are caught looking at a phone or tablet device as they cross the street, City's Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. However, people making emergency calls are exempted from the ban.
