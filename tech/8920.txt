Robert Ilijason, a 39-year-old IT specialist has opened Sweden's first 24-hour unstaffed food store which fully operates through a mobile app. The opening and closing of store door, purchases and invoices are all taken care of by the app. Customers scan the barcode of the items they need to buy and get charged for their purchases in a monthly invoice.
