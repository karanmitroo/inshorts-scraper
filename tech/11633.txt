California-based company 'Moon Express' will be teaming up with NASA to build a robotic lander that can mine the Moon. Co-founded by Indian origin billionaire Naveen Jain, the company became the first to successfully test a prototype of a lunar lander in 2015 and aims to send a commercial lunar lander called 'MX-1' to the moon by 2016.
