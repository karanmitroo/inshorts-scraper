Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk on Sunday said the company would not need to raise equity or corporate debt in the fourth quarter for its planned acquisition of SolarCity. The statement contradicts a filing the company made with regulators earlier regarding raising funds. Asked whether the company would raise funds in 2017 first quarter, Musk tweeted, "Probably not then either."
