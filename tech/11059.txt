The European Space Agency's comet lander Philae has woken up and contacted Earth after about seven months in hibernation, the organization announced on Sunday. Scientists lost contact with the solar-powered probe after it was dropped on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by its mothership Rosetta on November 15. “It’s good to hear from the lander. That’s somewhat of an understatement,” a scientist said.
