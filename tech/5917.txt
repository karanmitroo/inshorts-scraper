San Francisco-based game development platform MaxPlay has terminated almost all of its 70-member workforce. This comes after the company ran out of funds after a failed transaction aiming to push its MaxCore game engine to the market, according to CEO Sinjin Bain. He added that the company will now focus on licensing its technology to others.
