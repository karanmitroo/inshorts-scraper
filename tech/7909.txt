French Finance Minister, Michel Sapin has ruled out any possible back tax deal with Google after the company's Paris office was targeted by tax raids over unfulfilled back taxes. He further said that more companies could face tax-related raids in the future. Notably, Google has been accused of owing $1.78 billion in unpaid taxes by routing its transactions through Ireland.
