Oasis Games has developed ‘KOI’, the first ever PS4 game to have been made entirely in China. The game, to be showcased at the Game Developers Conference this month, features a "fish’s journey to cleanse waters polluted by mankind". Notably, only last year, China lifted its country-wide ban on the sale of gaming consoles.
