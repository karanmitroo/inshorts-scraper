US-based retail giant Walmart earlier this week announced it is deploying shelf-scanning robots across 50 locations in the United States. The robots which come with fitted cameras will roam the aisles to scan shelves for out-of-stock items, incorrect prices, and wrong or missing labels. The robots will not replace workers or affect the employee headcount in stores, the company said.
