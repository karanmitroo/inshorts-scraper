The world's smallest spacecraft ever launched have successfully been placed in low Earth orbit by ISRO's PSLV rocket. Named Sprites, the 3.5cmx3.5cm space probes weigh 4 grams each and run on sunlight. The probes are part of Breakthrough Initiatives, a $100 million program aimed at sending one-gram chips to star systems beyond the solar system in search of extraterrestrial intelligence.
