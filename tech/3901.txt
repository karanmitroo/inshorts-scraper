Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has urged world leaders to keep technology under control before it destroys humanity. "Technology has advanced at such a pace that this aggression may destroy us...We need to control this inherited instinct by our logic and reason," Hawking said. Humans should identify threats posed by artificial intelligence before the problems escalate, Hawking added.
