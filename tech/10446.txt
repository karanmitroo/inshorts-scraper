Yahoo has launched an update to its Mail that enables users to view both their e-mails and attachments side-by-side. While earlier a user had to switch between both windows, now he can read his e-mail and simultaneously view an attachment preview. Yahoo has done this with the help of Bookpad, an Indian cloud document firm that it acquired last year.
