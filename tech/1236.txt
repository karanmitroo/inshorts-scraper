The iPhone X could be affected by screen burn-in and other visual changes which usually occur in OLED displays, according to Apple. The company said it occurs when high contrast image on the screen leaves a permanent shadow on the display. However, Apple insisted that it has engineered iPhone X's OLED display to reduce the effects of burn-in.
