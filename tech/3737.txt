Japanese designer Kosho Tsuboi has made a 'Magic Calendar' that syncs with the users' smartphones to display their schedule on e-paper. On installing a dedicated Android application for the calendar, the schedule gets updated on the Magic Calendar when the users update it on their smartphones in real time. The calendar can last up to three months on one charge.
