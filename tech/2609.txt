World's largest particle physics laboratory, CERN, recently crossed a milestone of 200 million gigabytes of data permanently archived in its Data Centre. Over a billion particles colliding per second in detectors of the 27-km-long Large Hadron Collider generate data at a rate of one million GB per second. However, only the most "interesting" events (100-200 from 600 million) are archived.
