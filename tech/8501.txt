University of Washington and Microsoft researchers have created one of the first complete systems to encode, store and recover digital data from DNA molecules. This storage process can help in storing information millions of times more compactly than current archival technologies, like flash drives and hard drives. It can also preserve digital information for centuries without degrading it.
