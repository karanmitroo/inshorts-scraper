South Korean electronic maker Samsung on Tuesday unveiled its new television 'The Frame' that doubles as a picture frame and displays more than 100 different artworks when it is not being used. The television is fitted with Samsung's new gapless wall mount and invisible connection technology to make it look like an art piece hanging on the wall.
