Some users of OnePlus' latest smartphone OnePlus 5 have taken to the company's online forum to complain about a wobbling jelly-like effect on the screen while scrolling. Users said that scrolling slowly makes the text bunch up together or stretch out, creating a jelly effect. OnePlus acknowledged that it had received similar complaints but claimed the effect was "natural".
