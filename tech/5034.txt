Sony has announced 'Project Field', a new interactive gaming platform that combines physical game cards with mobile devices. The platform uses dedicated smart pads paired with a smartphone or tablet, where players move real cards on the pads to perform in-game actions on the mobile device's screen. The concept is currently scheduled for release only in Japan.
