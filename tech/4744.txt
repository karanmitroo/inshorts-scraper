A startup has made a â‚¹6,700 device called 'AirBar' that turns an Apple MacBook into a touchscreen. The bar-like device is a magnetic sensor that is placed below the bottom edge of the laptop's display to allow scrolling, swiping, zooming and other actions with touch. Available only for 15.6-inch Windows laptops until now, AirBar is also available for 13-inch MacBooks.
