Google has launched 'Files To Go' app in beta phase on the Play Store to share and manage files on Android devices. Google claims that the app, which has no ads or in-app purchases, can clean up the phone's space and is free of cost. It can also recognise spam and duplicate images, and enables users to share files offline.
