Security expert Jonathan Zdziarski has accused Apple of intentionally installing security backdoors in some 600 million iOS devices that offer surveillance-level access to data including photos, browsing history and GPS locations. Apple has issued a statement in response saying that the company's "diagnostic functions do not compromise user privacy," but Zdziarski said, "There is no way to disable these mechanisms."
