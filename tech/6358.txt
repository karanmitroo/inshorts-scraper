Russian state watchdog Roskomnadzor recently blocked adult websites Pornhub and YouPorn in the country. The watchdog also said its 2015 post about meeting "someone in real life" after a previous Pornhub ban continued to be "relevant" in this case. Meanwhile, Pornhub tweeted to Roskomnadzor, "if we give you guys a Pornhub Premium account, will you un ban Pornhub in Russia?"
