A construction-worker was rushed to Dr.Patil's Sai Leela Hospital after he accidentally sliced 90% of his hand off from the wrist with an electric-saw. As the doctor hadn't conducted a Hand-Salvaging surgery before, he immediately contacted, Dr. Hemant Patankar, who directed him on how to perform the 10-hour long operation going by photographs and details of the wound via WhatsApp.
