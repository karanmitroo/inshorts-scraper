Twitter's short-form video sharing app Vine, which recently faced shutdown, was reportedly asked for $1.2 million each by 18 popular Vine stars to keep making videos. These users had also threatened to move to Vine's rival platforms if the amount was not paid to them. Vine, however, turned down the deal, which reportedly caused the platform to shut down.
