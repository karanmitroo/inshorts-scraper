Chinese ride-hailing service Yidao Yongche's CEO Zhou Hang has accused technology company LeEco of misappropriating â‚¹1,200 crore that was meant for Yidao. LeEco acquired a majority stake in the startup in 2015. "Yidao right now faces capital issues. And the most direct cause of this issue is LeEco taking Yidao's 1.3 billion yuan," Zhou said in a social media post.
