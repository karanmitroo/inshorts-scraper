Apple has reportedly increased the limit to the number of songs that can be uploaded to iTunes Match to 1,00,000 from 25,000. iTunes Match is Apple’s music service that lets users store songs to iCloud for $24.99 a year. With this four-fold increase, users’ cloud-synced music libraries will store twice the number of songs Google Play Music offers.
