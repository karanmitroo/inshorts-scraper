Facebook Wednesday launched a new app Riff that allows users to make collaborative videos with friends. Users can start by making a short video clip (under 20 seconds) and then define it by a single hash-tagging topic. Their friends can then add their own clip to it. Riff is available on both Android and iOS platforms.
