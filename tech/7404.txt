Made In Space, a California-based company that operates a 3D printer on the International Space Station (ISS), plans to grow optical fiber in microgravity. It will attempt to create better fiber in microgravity as terrestrially produced fiber suffers from glass impurities, potentially resulting in signal degradation. The company is scheduled to send a manufacturing product to the ISS in 2017.
