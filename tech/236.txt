Talking about succession at a recent meeting, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said that "passing the baton" was one of his important roles as Executive Officer. Cook also said that every Apple board meeting in recent years has had succession planning on the agenda, but did not specify any potential successors. Notably, Cook succeeded late Steve Jobs as CEO in 2011.
