Lenovo on Thursday showcased its concept bendable smartphone 'CPlus' and tablet 'Folio'. The smartphone, which the company's CTO said will come in two sizes, can reportedly be worn like a wearable device by wrapping it around the wrist, while the tablet can fold in half. However, Lenovo has not revealed any time frame for its launch.
