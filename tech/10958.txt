Matti Makkonen, who developed the idea of Short Message Service (SMS) via mobile networks in 1984, has died at the age of 63 after an illness. Described as the "father of SMS", Makkonen never took the credit for the invention and called it a joint effort with Nokia which helped in popularising the service. He didn't even file a patent.
