Billionaire Warren Buffett, while speaking at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, said he should have seen technology giant Google's promise. "I had plenty of ways to ask questions...and educate myself," Buffett said, adding, "But I blew it." Further, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger called the firm's decision to not invest in Google its "worst mistake" in the tech field.
