Google announced its entry into the voice-activated home device market on Wednesday with the launch of ‘Google Home’. The Wi-Fi enabled portable speaker, powered by a voice assistance technology, can stream music, answer simple questions and perform some basic tasks. Amazon had launched a similar device named Echo almost two years ago and claims to have sold 3 million units.
