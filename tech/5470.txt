Technology giant Microsoft started working on the technology for an 'adaptive keyboard' that changes the function keys displayed depending on the application in use in 1999. The prototype featured on Microsoft's blog uses a touch-sensitive display strip above the keyboard. Microsoft rival Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro notebooks with a similar 'Touch Bar' feature last week.
