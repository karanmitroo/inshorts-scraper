US-based online retailer B&H accidentally listed the BlackBerry's Android DTEK60 smartphone for pre-order with a price of $499.99. The phone, which has not officially been announced yet, was accidentally leaked on BlackBerry's own website last month and on a Canadian retailer's site last week. Leaked features of the phone include a 5.5-inch display, 32GB internal memory, and 4GB RAM.
