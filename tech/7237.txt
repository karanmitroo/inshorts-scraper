The judge overseeing the probe that led to the arrest of suspected Islamist militants in Brazil last week said that Facebook and Twitter assisted the investigation by revealing suspects' social network activity. Investigators said the suspects had discussed online about attacking the upcoming Rio Olympics. "There is no anonymity for those sorts of activities on the Internet", the judge added.
