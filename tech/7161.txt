US-based startup Ava Science has created a smart bracelet called 'Ava' that helps women track their fertility. The bracelet identifies an average of five fertile days per cycle, doubling the women's chances to conceive. While its sensors gather physiological data points including body temperature to detect the fertile window, a dedicated app gives women an insight about their menstrual cycle.
