Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Saturday called artificial intelligence "the greatest risk we face as a civilisation". Musk claimed that computers with human-like intelligence could start a war by "doing fake news and spoofing email accounts and fake press releases, and just by manipulating information". The billionaire recently launched 'Neuralink' startup to merge human brains with AI.
