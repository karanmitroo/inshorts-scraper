Facebook has rolled out click-to-WhatsApp message button in ads so that advertisers can connect to the users via the messaging service. The feature is reportedly being rolled out in North and South America, Africa, Australia and most of Asia. However, it is not clear whether Facebook plans to launch the feature for regular users as well.
