NASA is developing a laser-based probe to study Earth's forests in 3D, to fill in missing information about their role in the carbon cycle. Scientists have not yet been able to quantify exactly how much carbon forests contain. The instrument, which is the 1st to systematically probe the depths of the forests from space, will help significantly in that direction.
