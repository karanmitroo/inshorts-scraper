Tech company Nokia has announced the launch of its iconic Snake game for Facebook Messenger users. The game, however, is not available in India as the Facebook Messenger in the country does not yet support the Instant Games feature. Unlike the mobile version which features colours and a new logo, the Facebook version of the game comes in monochromatic style.
