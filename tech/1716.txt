Researchers from South Korea, Japan, Scotland, and the US, have designed concept smart glasses that let users control phones via nose. The glasses have sensors embedded in the bridge and nose pads of the frame to identify specific movements. Users can reject a call, pause a video, or skip a song, by flicking or rubbing their nose.
