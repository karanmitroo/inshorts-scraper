A potentially damaging virus, which is affecting all the versions of Android prior to version-4.2.2(Jelly Bean), has been detected in Indian-cyberspace. The virus could be used to steal SMS, personal-details, IMEI-numbers, installed-applications and send SMS or make calls from infected-devices without user-consent. Internet-security sleuths have asked users to download applications only from trusted sources, reputed application-markets and Google Play Store.
