Dating platform Tinder has updated its site to add links to locations where sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are tested. This marks the end of Tinderâ€™s long-standing feud with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a sexual health advocacy group. Earlier, the foundation had put up billboards of Tinder being associated with STDs like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea in Los Angeles and New York.
