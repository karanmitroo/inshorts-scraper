Microsoft has launched Microsoft Rewards in an attempt to incentivise users to use its Edge browser. Edge users who sign up to Microsoft Rewards are awarded points for using the browser for up to 30 hours a month. Points can be exchanged for vouchers at Starbucks, Skype, or Amazon. The system is currently available only to US users.
