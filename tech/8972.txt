Boeing has patented a technology to 3D-print objects while they are levitating in space. The technology uses multiple printing heads that can increase the speed of printing many-fold. Further, it uses a central nugget of magnetic material that can be twisted as necessary, allowing access to the objects from all sides. Boeing plans to 3D-print aircraft parts using this technology.
