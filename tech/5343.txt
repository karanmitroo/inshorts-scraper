Apple has restored the peach emoji to its original form on a developer version of iOS 10.2 after facing flak for changing the 'butt' emoji to a more realistic version of the fruit. Other new emojis include male and female emojis for a teacher, astronaut and chef along with a finger-crossed emoji, a shrug emoji and a facepalm emoji.
