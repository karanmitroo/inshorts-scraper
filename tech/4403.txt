Alphabet Chairman and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt reportedly told the company's employees that US President Donald Trump's administration is going to do "evil things as they've done in the immigration area." Schmidt added, "the tone of this government is very much economic growth." Google's motto "Don't Be Evil" was dropped from its parent Alphabet's code of conduct in 2015.
