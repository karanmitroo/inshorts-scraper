Google has denied altering its search results to help the presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. "Google autocomplete does not favour any candidate or cause," said a Google spokesperson. The clarification came in response to a YouTube video pointing out that Google search does not suggest "Hillary Clinton crimes" when users type "Hillary Clinton cri," whereas both Yahoo and Bing do.
