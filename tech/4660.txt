Samsung's spin-off startup Mangoslab has created a printer called 'Nemonic' that allows users to print anything from their phone including their selfies on sticky notes in under five seconds. The printer does not rely on ink and uses thermal heat imaging to print. Printable sticky notes are provided with the printer at around â‚¹270 for 200 sheets.
