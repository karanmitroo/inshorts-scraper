NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has co-designed an iPhone case 'Introspection Engine' that alerts users when their smartphones are being monitored. It alerts users when a cellular, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection is being used to share or receive data. The case, which can also provide extra battery to the phone, shows the status of the phone's data on a monochromatic display.
