Bed sensor company Hello's founder James Proud has said the company, along with its product, the sleep monitor Sense, would be shutting down. In 2011, Proud was given one of Peter Thiel's entrepreneurial fellowships, a program that awards young people a $100,000 grant to develop an idea. Proud later launched Hello and raised nearly $50 million in funding.
