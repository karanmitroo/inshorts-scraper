Apple has notified its suppliers that it's cutting production target for the iPhone X in the three-month period from January by half, according to reports. The target has reportedly been cut to around 20 million units due to slower-than-expected sales in the holiday shopping season. Earlier, reports said Apple may stop iPhone X production by mid-2018 due to disappointing sales.
