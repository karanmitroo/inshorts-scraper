NASA on Saturday released a series of ten close-up photos of Pluto taken by the New Horizons Spacecraft that depict a full rotation of the planet. Pluto was between 400,000 and 5 million miles from the spacecraft when the images were taken by the spacecraft. A single Pluto day is equivalent to 6.4 days on Earth.
