After Samsung confirmed to skip the Mobile World Congress, China's Xiaomi has also decided to not attend the telecom industry's largest event beginning from February 27 in Barcelona this year. Xiaomi took to the stage during last year's event to introduce its flagship smartphone Mi5. This comes after Global Vice President Hugo Barra quit Xiaomi and joined Facebook this month.
