Elon Musk-led space exploration startup SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft on Wednesday aborted its planned rendezvous with the International Space Station to deliver nearly 2,500 kg of cargo to NASA astronauts. Dragon's onboard computers triggered the abort after recognising an incorrect value in GPS data about the station's location when it was only 1,200 metres away from the ISS.
