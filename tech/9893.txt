Twitter announced on Tuesday that it is testing a new timeline format that will sort tweets by relevance, in place of the existing reverse chronology.  "We're continuing to explore ways to surface the best content for people using Twitter," Twitter's spokesperson said. Twitter is reportedly experimenting under new CEO Jack Dorsey to deal with slowing user growth.
