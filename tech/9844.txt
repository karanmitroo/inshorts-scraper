Yahoo has launched a new Video Guide app that allows users to browse through content from across 30 video streaming services in addition to its own Yahoo Screen app, including Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. However, users will still have to subscribe to the service they choose to stream content from. The app is available on Android in the US.
