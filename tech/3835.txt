A charging Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone recently exploded near a sleeping five-year-old girl in China, causing second-degree burns on her face. While Samsung claims the handset's battery was fake, the vendor who sold the phone to the girl's parents says the phone was genuine. Samsung is investigating the incident and has offered to cover the girlâ€™s medical bills.
