'Open source', referring to a publicly accessible software which can be modified and shared by anyone, originated after Netscape released the source code for its web browser. The publicly traded company had reported bad financials and announced it would make its product core available to everyone. Notably, the term 'open source' was coined by Christine Peterson on February 3, 1998.
