Two 21-year-old, soon-to-graduate IIT Kanpur engineers have reportedly turned down Oracle's Rs 1.31 crore ($210,000) pay package offer. They may have opted for Google, which offered Rs 68.34 lakh ($110,000), or Tower Research Capital, a US-based financial services firm, which rolled out a package of Rs 74.55 lakh ($120,000), an official said.
