Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan has said that a "big number" of his staff will lose their jobs to automation. "In our bank we have people doing work like robots. Tomorrow we will have robots behaving like people," he added. He said accountants who "spend a lot of time basically being an abacus" would also be replaced by machines.
