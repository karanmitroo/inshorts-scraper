Researchers at the Cornell University, US, have created the world's thinnest transistor, which is just 3 atoms thick. They were produced using transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) and provide better yield-rates as compared to any other ultra-thin transistor. During tests, it delivered a success rate of 99%, and has practical applications in electronic items, including sensors and microprocessors.
