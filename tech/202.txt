The US' national labour body has found Google didn't break any law by firing ex-employee James Damore for writing anti-diversity memo in 2017. The counsel deemed parts of the memo as too "harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive" to come under protected speech in the workplace. Damore had filed a complaint against Google for violating his right to address workplace problems.
