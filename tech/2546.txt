Security camera footage from an underground train station in Minsk shows a woman's e-cigarette catching fire in her bag. The woman, who was reported unhurt by the fire, can be seen throwing the bag after the explosion. In January, a man claimed his e-cigarette exploded while he was using it, knocking out seven of his teeth.
