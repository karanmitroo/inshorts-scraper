Toyota in collaboration with DEKA Research and Development on Sunday launched a new version of its two-wheeled electric wheelchair iBot, which is capable of climbing stairs. The new wheelchair can move across varied terrain including glass, dirt and raise its seat to up to six feet. The wheelchair production ended in 2009 due to its high cost of $25,000.
