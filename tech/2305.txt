Russian firm Tactical Missiles Corporation is developing Artificial Intelligence-powered missiles that can reportedly make decisions like choosing a target by itself. "We saw this example, and when the Americans used it in Syria... when it is possible to re-direct [missiles] to targets," said the company's CEO Boris Obnosov. The US version of such a missile can shift its course instantly.
