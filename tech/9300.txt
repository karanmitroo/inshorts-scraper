Twitter is testing a dedicated GIF button inside its Android app, that is appearing between the camera and the poll icons. The button is currently enabling a small user base to post trending GIFs or choose their own from an array of mood-based categories. This is similar toÂ the dedicated GIF button inside the Facebook Messenger app.
