Four designers have together created a wearable for dating purposes called 'Ripple' that alerts users whenever they are being stared at by someone. To be worn on the shoulders, the wearable vibrates when staring is detected via a pair of onboard cameras. If the attraction is mutual, the tentacles on the wearable move in reaction to the other person's gaze.
