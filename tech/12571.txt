In a remarkable development, scientists in the United States have developed a technology that turns cow poo into water. The system produces about 50 gallons of water per 100 gallons of manure, but they're hoping to soon increase that to 65 gallons. If the system works, 870 million gallons of clean water could be produced every year in the US.
