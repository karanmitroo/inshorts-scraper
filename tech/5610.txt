A 19-year-old student from Texas collided with a parked police car while taking a topless Snapchat selfie. The police department tweeted on Thursday, "Don't Drink and Drive! Don't #snapchat photos to your boyfriend and drive!" She was arrested on the suspicion of driving while intoxicated and later released on a bond of $2,000.
