British publication The Guardian has admitted its January 2017 report on a loophole in WhatsApp's security system was incorrect. The report had claimed that the backdoor lets the Facebook-owned chat app intercept and read users' encrypted messages. The newspaper has said that "misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings" happened at several stages of the article's reporting process.
