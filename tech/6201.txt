Harsh Songra, a Bhopal-based 19-year-old boy, has created an app, called ‘My Child’, that helps parents diagnose developmental disorders in children. It identifies developmental, neurological, motor and speech impairment issues through a questionnaire consisting of only ‘yes’ and ‘no’ questions, and derives the results in 45 seconds. Notably, Songra himself suffers from a coordination disorder.
