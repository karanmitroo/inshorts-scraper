California-based company Enlighted has made sensors that can be used by offices to monitor when employees leave their desks. The sensors, hidden in lights and ID badges among other places, are reportedly in use by 15% of the Fortune 500 companies. The sensors also track conference room usage, employee whereabouts, and how long someone goes without speaking to co-workers.
