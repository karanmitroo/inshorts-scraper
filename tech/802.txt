A US court has fined Apple $25,000 for each day the company fails to produce evidence for a lawsuit against the chipmaker Qualcomm. The technology giant has until December 29 to turn over the documents or face more fines, according to the court filing. Last month, Qualcomm sued Apple for misusing its "unprecedented access" to chipmaker's code to help Intel.
