The US Supreme Court on Monday ruled that Apple must pay $450 million to end a lawsuit against the company which states that it conspired with five publishers including Penguin and HarperCollins to increase e-book prices. The Justice Department had earlier said that the scheme caused some e-book prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from $9.99 charged on Amazon.
