The US Air Force General John W Raymond in an interview on Monday said that he's "completely committed" to use recycled rockets like Elon Musk's SpaceX for future missions. He also said it would be "absolutely foolish" not to begin using pre-flown rockets to bring down mission costs. SpaceX reused its first Falcon 9 booster, earlier this year.
