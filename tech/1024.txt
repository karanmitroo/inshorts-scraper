Twitter blocked a New York Times account for almost 24 hours last week saying a tweet violated the micro-blogging website's rules against hateful conduct. The tweet by '@nytimesworld' had promoted an article about Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's apology to indigenous people in two provinces. However, Twitter later apologised and restored the account.
