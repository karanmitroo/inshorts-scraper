PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel at the Republican National Convention on Thursday said, "I am proud to be gay. I'm proud to be a Republican. But most of all I'm proud to be an American.” Supporting Republican candidate Donald Trump, Thiel said, "I’m not a politician. But neither is Donald Trump. He is a builder, and it’s time to rebuild America.”
