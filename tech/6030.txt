A company that makes accessories for Apple computers, Twelve South has made a candle named 'New Mac' which smells like a newly-unboxed Mac. The soy wax candle, which lasts for 45-55 hours, reportedly uses hints of mint, peach, basil, lavender, mandarin and sage to create the unique smell. The candle is being sold at $24 per piece.
