Canadian citizen Karim Baratov has pleaded guilty in a US court to aiding Russian intelligence officers in a 2014 hack of Yahoo that exposed around 500 million accounts. According to his testimony, Baratov gained access to users' accounts by phishing them with fake correspondences. Baratov was indicted in February this year along with three other individuals who remain in Russia.
