The Federal Communications Commission which regulates the telecommunications industry in the US, has slapped a $100 million fine on AT&T for violating the transparency rule of its 2010 Open Internet order on net neutrality. AT&T was found to have slowed speeds for customers that had unlimited data plans and it didn't adequately notify those customers prior to throttling their speeds.
