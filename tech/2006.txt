Facebook on Monday announced that it will block advertisements from Pages that repeatedly share fake news. Facebook claimed that this move will help reduce the distribution of false news and will keep the Pages that spread it from making money. However, Facebook added that the Pages may be eligible to start running ads again if they stop sharing false news.
