A US judge has told attorneys that Google Co-founder Sergey Brin "better show up" for a deposition in the company's lawsuit against Uber. Google sued Uber earlier this year over the alleged theft of its self-driving car technology. Google's other Co-founder Larry Page was also ordered by the court to submit to a four-hour questioning by Uber earlier in July.
