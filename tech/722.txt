Germany has enforced a law to fine social networks up to $60 million for failing to remove hate speech. The law, which was passed in June 2017, gives companies 24 hours, or seven days for "complex cases", to act after being informed about such content. Social networks and media sites with over two million members will fall under its provisions.
