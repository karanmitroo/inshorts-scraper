Turkish designer sisters Ezra Çetin and Tuba Çetin have used the Intel Edison chip to create an intelligent dress which releases 'butterflies' whenever anyone gets too close.  The proximity-sensing dress has been developed for their label 'Ezra+Tuba.' While the duo are known for their avant-garde designs, they believe that technology is necessary as the future of clothing evolves.
