Tumblr has updated its iOS app to let iPhone 6s users add live photos to their posts. A small icon will now be displayed in a corner of a live photo, which users can activate through 3D touch. Users with older iPhones can long-press the image to view the same. Tumblr is reportedly among the first to support this feature.
