Technology giant Google, which turned 18 on Tuesday, has announced a fast public Wi-Fi initiative for India called 'Google Station'. Under the initiative, Google will partner with cafes, malls and bus stops to roll-out safe Wi-Fi hotspots in public places and organisations. Last year, Google partnered with the Indian Railways and RailTel to provide Wi-Fi at 400 railway stations.
