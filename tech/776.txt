The government of Guangzhou city in China will allow citizens to verify their identities through Tencent-owned social media app WeChat using facial recognition technology. The electronic IDs, authenticated through an artificial intelligence (AI) system, will function the same as traditional identity cards issued by the state. The programme is expected to launch across the country next month.
