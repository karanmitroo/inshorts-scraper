Billionaire investor George Soros has said governments would soon start regulating Facebook and Google as they control over half of all internet advertising revenue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, the 87-year-old said, "Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered". He also predicted the tech giants would "compromise themselves" to access markets like China.
