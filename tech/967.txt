Canadian technology company BlackBerry has agreed to pay $137 million to Finnish technology company Nokia after the International Court of Arbitration ruled it failed to make certain payments to Nokia. BlackBerry said it is disappointed that the court disagreed with its arguments but accepts the court's decision. Nokia had accused BlackBerry of failing to make payments on patent license contracts.
