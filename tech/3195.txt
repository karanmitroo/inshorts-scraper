Friday's large-scale cyber attack dubbed as 'WannaCry' hit 2 lakh victims in at least 150 countries and the number is feared to increase when people will return to work on Monday, European Union's police agency Europol has said. The attack was unique as the ransomware was used in combination with "a worm functionality" so the infection spread automatically, Europol added.
