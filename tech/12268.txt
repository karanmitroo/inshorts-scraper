Samsung Electronics Tuesday said that its third-quarter operating profit is estimated to have fallen 60% (from 10.2 trillion won last year to 4.1 trillion won this year), which is its lowest level in more than three years. This comes amid rapid decline of its mobile business as lower sales of its top-end Galaxy smartphones hurt sales at its component businesses.
