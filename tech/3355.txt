Traffic police in China's Shenzhen has debuted a new 'lane robot', the first of its kind in the country, which helps administer rush-hour traffic by controlling a section of reversible lanes. The lane robot, which reduces the workload of police, is a guard rail that moves to alter the flow of traffic into different lanes in less than a minute.
