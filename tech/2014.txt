Chipmaker Qualcomm's President Derek Aberle on Thursday quit the company amid an ongoing lawsuit with technology major Apple. Aberle, who served the company for 17 years, will leave Qualcomm at the end of the year. Apple in January sued Qualcomm, accusing it of overcharging for royalties and refusing to pay $1 billion in promised rebates.
