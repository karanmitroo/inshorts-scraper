Famous Scientist Stephen Hawking (73) has applied to the Intellectual Property Office of UK to trademark his name. Hawkingâ€™s name has been attached to many items including t-shirts, mugs, wheel-chairs etc as he became a household name after appearing in many TV series. The move will prevent others from exploiting his name with inappropriate products.
