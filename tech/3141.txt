One of the China's largest online retailers, JD.com is building a drone capable of carrying over 900 kg of cargo for deliveries to and from remote parts of the country. It will likely be used to bring food from farms and agricultural warehouses to cities. JD.com started drone deliveries in four Chinese provinces last year.
