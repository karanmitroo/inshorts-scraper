Iraq has built a robotic vehicle which will reportedly be used to fight ISIS and take back control of a northern Iraqi city. The car-sized and tank-like robot is equipped with an automatic machine gun and a rocket launcher. It has four cameras which make it possible for operators to control the robot using a laptop from a kilometre away.
