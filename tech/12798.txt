Speaking about the importance of India as a market, WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said, "It's a very critical market for us. We want all smartphone users (in India) to be on WhatsApp. Then if that number is a billion, then it's a billion". At present, India has over 40 million users of WhatsApp, he added.
