Facebook has introduced a new feature that lets users post videos as comments to posts and status updates. Available across all Facebook platforms including Android and iOS, the feature can be accessed by using the camera button which was earlier used to post photos in comments. Notably, this is the third video-based feature introduced by Facebook this year.
