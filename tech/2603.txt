Hackers hijacked the airwaves of a UK radio station to play a song about masturbation at least eight times in the last month. 'The Winker's Song' was originally released in the 1970's and uses the word 'wanker' 36 times. The hackers have reportedly been using a transmitter to play the song on the same frequency as the station.
