A new mobile game based on US Presidential election candidate Donald Trump called 'Jrump' has been launched, with the tagline 'Make the galaxy great again'. It requires players to build a wall on which Trump jumps to reach the galaxy to "make it better". The game features Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders as Trump's obstacles.
