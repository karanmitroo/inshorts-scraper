A Republican lawmaker, who voted to rollback US internet privacy rules, told attendees at a town hall meeting, "Nobody's got to use the Internet." He said this in response to a question on why internet providers should be able to share customer data without permission. "If you start regulating the internet like a utility...we would have no internet," he added.
