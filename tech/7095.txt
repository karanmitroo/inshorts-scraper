YouTube was originally created as a video-sharing site called 'Tune In Hook Up' for people looking for dates. As per a 12-minute video by YouTube channel ColdFusion, the idea did not seem to catch on, and the website's name was changed to YouTube in 2005. It was acquired by Google for $1.65 billion in 2006.
