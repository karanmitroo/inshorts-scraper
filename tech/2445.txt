Google is testing a feature on its Search results page that would autoplay YouTube videos related to users' searched terms and keywords. According to the reports, the videos will appear in the right-hand side bar but their audio will not play automatically. A Google spokesperson confirmed the test, adding that the company has no plans to launch the feature yet.
