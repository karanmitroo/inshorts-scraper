iPhone users can play a game called ‘Steve – The Jumping Dinosaur Widget Game’ without unlocking their devices. Once installed, the game is added to an iPhone’s notification center, and can be played by swiping down the notification menu. It is currently more popular than Skype and Google Chrome in the 'free' category of the Apple App Store.
