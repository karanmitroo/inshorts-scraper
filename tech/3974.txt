Nintendo has admitted that the cartridges of its Switch gaming console have purposely been made to taste bitter to avoid "possibility of accidental ingestion." This comes after a number users complained on Twitter that the cartridges taste bad and wondered if they were toxic. However, Nintendo clarified that the denatonium benzoate bittering agent applied to the SD-sized cartridge is non-toxic.
