Researchers from Northwestern Medicine and Vanderbilt University have found a new strategy to kill Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Scientists have discovered the switch that turns off the immune cell's abundant sugar and nutrient pipeline, needed by the HIV to replicate. An experimental compound was used to turn off the switch to the pipeline, thereby starving the HIV to death.
