New York-based startup Waverly Labs has developed 'Pilot', a $129 set of smart earpieces that translate between different languages. Connected through an app, the earpieces need to be worn by two people who donâ€™t speak the same language. It currently translates between English, Spanish, French, Italian and plans to include East Asian, Hindi, Semitic, Arabic, Slavic and African languages.
