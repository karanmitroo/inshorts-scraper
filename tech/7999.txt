Benjamin Hubert, Director of the London-based industrial design agency Layer, has created 'GO wheelchair', a 3D-printed wheelchair with customisable seat to meet the specifications of the user's body. The user's body is scanned and the needs are assessed to 3D-print a seat. Further, the wheelchair comes with special gloves to access its wheels which have “almost BMX bike” grip texture.
