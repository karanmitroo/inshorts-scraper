James Friend, a UI engineer at Facebook, has built a Macintosh emulator that enables running the 1998 Macintosh System 6 natively in a web browser, without any additional plugins or extensions. The simulated demo comes with several classic applications including MacDraw, MacPaint and Kid Pix. James has made the project's source code available on the repository hosting service GitHub.
