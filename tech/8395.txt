A Ukraine-based startup has developed 'Ink Hunter', an app that lets users try tattoos before getting it permanently inked on their skin. The app places a tattoo design from its collection or one uploaded by the user on the desired area of the body. It also delivers temporary tattoo stickers to its users.
