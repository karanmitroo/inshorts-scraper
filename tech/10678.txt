US-based media company Comcast is preparing to launch a new video platform with content, Watchable, in partnership with digital publishers like NBC Sports and Buzzfeed. It will rival YouTube, Facebook's online video efforts, and the video platform Verizon is planning to unveil. The publishers will upload all unlicensed, original video content to Watchable for users to stream it on demand.
