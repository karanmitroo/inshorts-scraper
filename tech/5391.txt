Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg on Thursday said, "This was a historic election for women. For the first time in the US history, a woman was the nominee of a major party". Sandberg added, "Over 59 million Americans voted to put Hillary Clinton in the highest office. Even though we fell short, that should make us all proud".
