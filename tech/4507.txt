Former US President Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama have launched a website, Obama.org calling for ideas for the planned Barack Obama Presidential Center. "More than a library or a museum, it will be a living, working center for citizenship. That's why we want to hear from you," said Obama in a video introducing the website.
