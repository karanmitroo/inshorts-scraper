Photo-sharing platform Snapchat on Saturday forayed into the hardware segment by launching a pair of smart glasses called 'Spectacles' that capture 10-second videos. Priced at $130, the glasses will allow the video to sync wirelessly to a user's phone for sharing purposes. The camera in the glasses will use a 115Â° lens and the video captured will be circular.
