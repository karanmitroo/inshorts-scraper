FBI Director James Comey in an interview admitted that he covers his cameras at home with tape despite getting mocked for it, adding that it was a "sensible thing" people should be doing. “I think people ought to be taking personal responsibility for their own safety...It’s not crazy that the FBI Director cares about personal security as well,” Comey said.
