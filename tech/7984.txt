Dating app Tinder has reportedly sued '3nder', a dating app for people seeking threesomes, over the similarity between the names. Launched in 2014, 3nder is currently available on iOS and plans to launch an Android app this month. In response to Tinder, 3nder has launched a site called 'Tinder Wants to Kill 3nder' and is promoting '#TinderSuckMySocks' on Twitter.
