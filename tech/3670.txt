Gaming major Nintendo has accepted a cow-milking challenge inspired by one of its recently-launched video games, proposed by a US-based dairy farm and museum. In its letter to Nintendo, the farm wrote, "We have 30 prize-winning Jersey milking cows that we milk twice a day, and it is NEVER that easy... We also think that you guys look pretty slow."
