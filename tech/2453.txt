Colorado-based hardware supplier SparkFun's Founder Nathan Seidle has created a homemade robot to unlock a safe in just 15 minutes after his wife challenged him. The fully automated device, partially made from 3D printed components, took about â‚¹13,000 to build. SentrySafe, the maker of the safe, admitted its products have vulnerabilities but argued that 'average' people cannot replicate the robot.
