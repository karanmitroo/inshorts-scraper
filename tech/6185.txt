Some iPhone 7 owners have fallen prey to a spoof video that shows how to create a headphone jack in the device by digging a hole in the handset through a 3.5 mm drill. The users who drilled holes in their devices reportedly ended up destroying their handsets. Notably, Apple's latest iPhone 7 smartphone doesn't have a headphone jack.
