The rotating CEO of Chinese smartwatch maker Huawei, Eric Xu Zhijun at a recent event said, "I'm always confused as to what smartwatches are for when we have smartphones". He added he would never wear any smartwatch. Zhijun said that he keeps reminding Huawei's wearable development team to consider whether there are tangible needs for these products in the market.
