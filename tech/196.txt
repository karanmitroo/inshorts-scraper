US intelligence agencies including the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA have warned citizens to not buy smartphones made by Chinese technology giants Huawei and ZTE. The agencies said that the devices could be used by the Chinese government to spy on US citizens. The US government had earlier blocked Huawei from selling technology to several federal agencies.
