Google has partnered with US National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to offer an online test for users in the US searching for depression. The project aims to provide helpful information to people with mental health issues. "While this tool can help, it's important to note... not meant to act as a singular tool for diagnosis," Nami said.
