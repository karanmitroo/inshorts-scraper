NASAâ€™s mission to Jupiter is named after the Roman Goddess Juno, who is considered the wife of Roman God Jupiter. In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself for hiding. It was Juno who was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. Notably, Juno is designed to study Jupiter's origin and evolution.
