E-commerce giant Amazon has launched a hardware 'Dash Button' that allows its prime members to order a product by just pushing a button. The Dash Button is connected with the Amazon app through WiFi and comes with a reusable adhesive glue so it could be placed anywhere. Amazon confirmed that it is 'real' and not an April Fool's Day prank.
