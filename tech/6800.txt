American singer Barbra Streisand has revealed that she called Apple CEO Tim Cook to get Apple's voice assistant Siri to pronounce her name correctly. Streisand said, "Siri pronounces my name wrong...Streisand with a soft S, like sand on the beach." She added that Cook agreed and said that the pronunciation will be fixed with the next update on September 30th.
