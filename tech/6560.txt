Amsterdam-based digital mapping company TomTom has unveiled a circular satellite navigation system VIO, designed for scooters. It is a waterproof device that displays turn-by-turn directions and has a built-in speed warning which turns red upon exceeding the speed limit. The device, which connects to riderâ€™s phone wirelessly, also comes with customisable snap-on covers to match scooter's colour.
