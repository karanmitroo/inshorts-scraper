Apple on Monday announced that it has opened its digital assistant 'Siri' for third-party developers through an API, allowing them to integrate Siri's voice functionality into their own apps. This would enable users to use Siri to access third-party apps including WhatsApp, Slack, Uber and Skype. The company also announced that Siri will feature in its recently unveiled macOS Sierra.
