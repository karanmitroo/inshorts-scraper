The US Secret Service has reportedly warned banks of "jackpotting" attacks on ATMs across the country. ATM "jackpotting" is a method where thieves install malicious software and hardware on ATMs which force the machines to dispense huge volumes of cash. The Secret Service alert reportedly said hackers targeted stand-alone ATMs typically located in pharmacies and big retailers, and drive-thru ATMs.
