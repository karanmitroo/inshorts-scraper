Google on Friday launched its online advertising service application AdWords for the iOS platform. The Android app was launched almost a year ago. With AdWords, online marketers would be allowed to monitor and manage their online advertising campaigns. The app, however, would not allow new users to sign up, and only the existing users can sign into the application.
