Two engineering students from Karnataka's Kalaburagi district have developed a Bluetooth-enabled helmet which works with voice commands to help the user navigate through places. The helmet features inbuilt Bluetooth speakers, USB charging port, and can be used for six hours on a single charge. The helmet also has a cooling sheet on its front, which enhances a driver's night vision.
