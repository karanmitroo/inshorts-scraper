Students from Canada's University of Victoria have developed a prototype device which uses  green lasers to stop geese from destroying crops. The "automatic hi-tech scarecrow" is programmed to sweep low-powered lasers across a farmers’ field at night,​ when geese come there to roost and eat green shoots of common crops like wheat and barley.
