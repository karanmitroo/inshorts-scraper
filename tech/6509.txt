According to a facility launched on Wednesday, drivers would not be required to carry their driving licence and registration certificate, but can store them in 'DigiLocker', the secured national digital locker system. The soft copy can then be verified by traffic police and law enforcement agencies when required. Notably, DigiLocker helps in consolidating all important documents in digital form.
