Pokémon Go creator Niantic has introduced a ‘Buddy Pokémon’ system, enabling users to pick a favourite Pokémon from their collection. The buddy Pokémon will appear alongside the users' avatar inside the game, and will help open new in-game rewards. The game, which is the fastest to 50 million downloads, recently saw a decline in daily active users by 15 million.
