Xiaomi on Wednesday launched a USB-powered portable mosquito repellent device in China. Priced at $4, the circular device holds a replaceable mosquito repellent mat inside it. The device is dust-proof and lasts for up to 15 hours on a single charge from Xiaomi's 10,000 mAh power bank. The device, however, is currently available for buying only in China.
