Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced late on Thursday that the social network has set a new benchmark of being used by one billion users in a single day. "On Monday, 1 in 7 people on Earth used Facebook," Zuckerberg said. "This was the first time we reached this milestone. It's just the beginning of connecting the whole world," he added.
