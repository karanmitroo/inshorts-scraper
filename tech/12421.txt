China is planning to connect Beijing with 11 provincial capitals with a travel time of 8-hours, by high-speed bullet trains through undersea-railway tunnel. The network, extending 5,700 kms, will connect Northeast China and South-China's Hainan Province. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has also opened gates for private investments in the sphere of railways, solely managed by the government, as of now.
