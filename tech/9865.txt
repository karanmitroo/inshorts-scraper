At an event organised in IIT-Delhi, Jharkhand's 15-year old Prithvi Raj won the bronze medal for developing a jacket fitted with a fire-alarm device which can help visually-impaired people to walk more accurately. The entire setup, which includes a vibrating indicator, radio sensor and a headset, will cost less than â‚¹1000 and can be operated through a mobile application.
