Technology giant Google has announced the end of its pilot program that let users make payments by simply saying they're "paying with Google." The hands-free service used Bluetooth and location-based services to communicate the user's profile to cashiers when they walked into a store equipped with the payments system. The cashiers then authenticated the payment using an online photo ID.
