Technology major Microsoft on Thursday mistakenly released a software build for Windows Insider users that crashed their computers and phones. In a post explaining the accidental release, Microsoft advised customers to either wait for a new build or roll-back to the previous version. Users who had already allowed the update to start were advised to turn their Wi-Fi off immediately.
