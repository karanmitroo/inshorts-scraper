In an attempt to make its internet-connected eyewear more stylish, Google on Monday announced its alliance with Italian eyewear company Luxottica Group - the makers of Ray-Ban and Oakley frames. Luxottica will develop frames equipped with Google Glass, a computing device that includes a thumbnail-sized screen above the wearer's right eye to view internet content.
