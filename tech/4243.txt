US-based startup Agility Robotics, funded by the experimental research arm of the country's Department of Defense, has created a two-legged robot named 'Cassie' aimed at making home deliveries. The motors of the walking robot make it more steerable and give it a larger range of motion. Cassie also has motored ankles to help make it even sturdier.
