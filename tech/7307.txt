In 2009, the startup that made the personal assistant Siri, had signed a deal with communication technology company Verizon, to make Siri a default application on all Android smartphones. The company also reportedly created commercials touting the tool as an Android add-on. However, Apple bought Siri in 2010, ending its association with Android and making it exclusive to iOS products.
