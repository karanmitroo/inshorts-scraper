LinkedIn rolled out a new feature called LinkedIn Account Targeting that allows advertisers to aim sponsored InMail and updates toward their targeted companies on a large scale. To use this feature, advertisers first collate a list of their targeted companies which is cross-referenced by LinkedIn against the businesses in its network and then a user segment for ad-targeting is created.
