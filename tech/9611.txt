Smartphone-maker HTC unveiled the 'Vive VR', a virtual reality (VR) headset, on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Unlike most VR headsets that only track the movement of the head, the Vive VR tracks user's position in a room allowing easier interaction with the surroundings. It is reportedly expected to hit the market later this year.
