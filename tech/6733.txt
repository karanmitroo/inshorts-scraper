RailTel Chairman R K Bahuguna has reportedly said that the corporation might partner with Facebook to provide free Wi-Fi access to railway stations and nearby villages. "We will be able to offer data services up to a 10-km radius from a connected rail stop", Bahuguna said. Facebook recently completed a trial of its Express Wi-Fi service across 125 rural locations.
