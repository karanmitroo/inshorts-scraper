E-commerce company Amazon has dropped its legal contest against a warrant by the US police to access recordings from a voice-controlled Echo speaker to solve a murder case. This comes after the accused, James Bates agreed to let officials access the data. The victim in the case was found strangled and drowned in Bates' bathtub in November 2015.
