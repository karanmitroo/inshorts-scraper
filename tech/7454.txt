A YouTube user, named Paweł Zadrożniak, has uploaded a video featuring 64 floppy drives, eight hard disks, two scanners and other hardware components being used to create the 'Star Wars' theme music. The whole setup, named 'Floppotron 2.0', was also used to create the theme music of the American television series 'Hawaii Five-O' and Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' soundtrack.
