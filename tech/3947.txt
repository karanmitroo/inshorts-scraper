New York-based startup Sencity has built a smart dustbin for streets called 'TetraBIN' that makes throwing garbage a game. It features a game where bats fly in the air while dogs wait on the ground saying, "Feed me!" Every time garbage is thrown into the dustbin, the dog gets fed, and a redeemable reward code is given to the thrower.
