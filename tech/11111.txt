Apple is planning to launch its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, in Britain this summer. iPhones have a wireless microchip similar to those in contactless payment cards, which will allow users to pay simply by waving their handsets over the terminal. Transport for London is reportedly already taking payments from American tourists this way.
