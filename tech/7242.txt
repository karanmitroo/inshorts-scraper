Facebook has admitted that it blocked links to WikiLeaks' DNC email database of over 19,000 emails sent to and by US Democratic National Committee members which were leaked online last week. WikiLeaks had earlier provided a workaround for the same in a tweet. Facebook, however, did not reveal the reason for blocking the links and has reportedly fixed the issue.
