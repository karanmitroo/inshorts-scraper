US researchers have designed a mobile voting system optimized for use on a smartphone and tested its usability against traditional voting platforms. The study found that smartphone owners committed fewer errors on the mobile voting system than on the traditional voting systems. Mobile voting is advantageous as nobody has to wait in line at the polling place.
