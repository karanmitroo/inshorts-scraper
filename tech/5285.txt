According to Donald Trump's election campaign's Director of Digital Advertising, the campaign tried to purchase a specific emoji with the hashtag '#CrookedHillary' on Twitter. The emoji depicted a hand holding a bag of money and was changed to a figure of a person running with a bag of money. However, Twitter decided to not allow such forms of political advertising.
