According to a Wall Street Journal report, Google is building a new messaging application that is different from its existing service, 'Hangouts'. Google is expected to use its artificial intelligence know-how to integrate 'chatbots' into the new messaging service. The chatbot will reportedly answer questions posed by the user based on different web searches.
