The government has ordered internet service providers to block at least 40 webpages containing inflammatory content that may lead to religious intolerance. These webpages also include posts on social media and popular video-sharing platforms. Although the order to block the videos was passed on June 29, many videos couldn't be blocked as they were posted through a secure internet protocol.
