NASA's messenger probe that crashed into Mercury last week has sent data showing the planet's evolving magnetic field to be almost 4 billion years old. Mercury is the only planet to have a magnetic field like the Earth's and this data is key in unravelling the planet's history. The messenger was launched from the Earth on 2004.
