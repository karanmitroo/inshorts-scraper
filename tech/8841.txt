The world's first permanent Virtual Reality Cinema theatre has been launched in Amsterdam by creative agency Samhoud Media. Moviegoers at the VR Cinema will be placed in swivel chairs and given a Samsung Gear VR with a pair of Sennheiser headphones for the viewing experience. The company introduced the concept in 2015 with VR cinema kiosks.
