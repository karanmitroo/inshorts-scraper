The second game of the Chronicles series, 'Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India', which was released on 12th January, has a "simplistic story that never turns into anything more than following bad people", said IGN. The game has improved display but is quite similar to the previous 'China' version of the series in terms of gameplay, dull and frustrating, according to Eurogamer.
