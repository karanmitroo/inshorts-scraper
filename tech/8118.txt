Investigators probing the Bangladesh Bank heist of $81 million said on Friday that the cyber attack was similar to the attack on Sony's film studio in 2014. Further, investigators have reportedly uncovered a similar malware attack on a Vietnamese commercial bank. They said, "What initially looked to be an isolated incident...turned out to be part of a wider campaign".
