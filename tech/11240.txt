ISRO announced on Wednesday that it will launch an advanced communications satellite GSAT-6 for strategic purposes in July or August. The satellite will have an antenna which can communicate from anywhere using a handheld device. Earlier, the satellite launch had been planned in collaboration with a satellite-based multimedia company but the government cancelled the deal invoking sovereignty.
