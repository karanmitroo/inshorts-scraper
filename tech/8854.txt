A US-based startup has developed 'popSLATE 2', a 0.16-inch thick back display screen for Apple iPhone which comes with integrated battery and works as an e-reader and a smartwatch. It runs on e-ink and allows real-time update of events and switching between apps without unlocking the phone. The screen is compatible with iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus.
