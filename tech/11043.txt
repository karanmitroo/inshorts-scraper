An Amsterdam-based 3D printing company MX3D has developed a revolutionary robotic 3D printer that can "draw" structures in the air. The developers are now planning to build a steel bridge over a canal in the city. "The symbolism of the bridge is a beautiful metaphor to connect the technology of the future with the old city," a developer said.
