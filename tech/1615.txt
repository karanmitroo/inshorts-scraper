Austria-based startup Luke Roberts Lighting has created a â‚¹70,000 smart lamp that lets users move the direction of light via app. The Luke Roberts app, which is based on touch gestures, lets users paint the light in the desired direction and control the brightness of the light. The lamp also detects presence and automatically turns the light on or off.
