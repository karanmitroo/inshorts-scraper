Technology giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook in a recent interview said that currently "the technology itself doesn't exist" to make augmented reality (AR) glasses "in a quality way". According to Cook, their field of view and the display quality isn't there yet. He also said that Apple won't ship an AR product unless it can deliver "a great experience."
