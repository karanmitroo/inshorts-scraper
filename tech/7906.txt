The California Institute of Technology has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apple and chipmaking company Broadcom for allegedly violating four WiFi-related patents. The University claims that Apple's iPhones use Broadcom chips which copy its decoding and encoding technology to improve data flow. The lawsuit is calling for damages and a ban on the infringing hardware.
