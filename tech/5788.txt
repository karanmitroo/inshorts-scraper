Ecuador has confirmed that it cut off internet access in its London embassy temporarily to keep WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange from interfering in the US presidential election. WikiLeaks has been publishing hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign Chairman John Podesta. However, Ecuador reiterated its intention to "safeguard his life and physical integrity until he reaches a safe place".
