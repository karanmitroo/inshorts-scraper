Ice cream brand Cornetto has developed a set of smart rings called 'Commitment Rings', which lets couples watch new episodes of series on streaming services only when they are together. Couples need to register on the rings' app which links them to the streaming services. The app detects when the rings are together and unlocks the streaming service.
