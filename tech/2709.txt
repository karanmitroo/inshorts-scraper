American researchers have created electronics and circuit boards that come apart automatically when put in cool liquid. The electronics are made of silver nanowires and a polymer that is insoluble in warm water, but soluble in cold water. Such electronics can be used for secretive operations or as chip implants that can be removed without surgery.
