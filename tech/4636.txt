Volkswagen on Monday unveiled ID Buzz, an eight-seater electric minivan with a range of 600 km which can charge up to 80% in 30 minutes. The steering wheel of the self-driving minivan retracts into the cockpit and the driver's seat can be turned around to face the passengers in the back. ID Buzz is Volkswagen's first fully autonomous concept car.
