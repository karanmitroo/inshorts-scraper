US President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly worried about leaving his Android phone when he moves into the White House. Trump fears he might become isolated and would not be able to keep in touch with his friends and advisors. Notably, the secure phone given to Barack Obama does not allow texting, taking pictures or play music.
