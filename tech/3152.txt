Tennis player Sania Mirza was recently trolled on Twitter by a number of users for promoting OnePlus 3T smartphone by using an iPhone. The tennis player later took the tweet down, but several users had already noticed the goof-up. "Well, @MirzaSania needs to up her #PaidTweet game!" a user tweeted. "You deleted your devious tweet. Deceitful," tweeted another user.
