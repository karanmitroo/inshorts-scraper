The Railways has decided to use Artificial Intelligence to prevent the possibility of signals failing, moving from a find-and-fix to predict-and-prevent approach. Any flaws in the signalling system would be detected on a real-time basis and rectified to avoid possible delays and mishaps. A trial will be taken up in two sections of Western Railway and South Western Railway.
