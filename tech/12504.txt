Due to inefficient technology, the world's 14 billion electronic devices (including TV set-top boxes, printers, game consoles) waste $80 billion of power a year, according to the International Energy Agency. By 2020, an estimated $120 billion will be wasted as many devices use about the same amount of power even on standby, the agency added.
