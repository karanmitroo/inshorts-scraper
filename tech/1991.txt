A Japanese man said he was banned from Twitter after sharing a picture of a mosquito he killed. He had captioned it, "Where do you get off biting me all over...  Die!" He later set up a new account and tweeted, "When the mosquito was killed, the previous account was permanently frozen, is this a violation?"
