E-commerce major Amazon has been accused of copying its latest voice-controlled device 'Echo Show' from Nucleus, a startup in which it led a $5.6 million investment last year. Both devices are powered by Amazon's digital assistant Alexa and serve as home intercom systems and video-conferencing tools. Nucleus CEO Jonathan Frankel has accused Amazon of trying to "trample" over the startup.
