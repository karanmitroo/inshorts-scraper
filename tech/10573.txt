A team working at CERN's (European Organization for Nuclear Research) Large Hadron Collider have found evidence of leptons (subatomic particles) that appear to defy the Standard Model of particle physics. The discovery, scheduled for publication in Physical Review Letters, could provide a significant lead in the search for non-standard phenomena which would give evidence to non-standard physics.
