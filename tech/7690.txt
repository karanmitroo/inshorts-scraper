Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' private spaceflight company, Blue Origin successfully launched and landed its New Shepard reusable rocket for a fourth time on Sunday. The company also successfully tested the redundancy of its capsule's parachute system by intentionally failing one of the chutes. Notably, it was the first-ever time that the company live-streamed one of its launches.
