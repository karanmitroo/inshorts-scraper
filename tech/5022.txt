British outsourcing services company Capita has announced it will fire 2,000 employees and replace them with robots to save money. The money saved after firing the employees will be invested in more robotic workers, it added. Earlier, an Oxford study had predicted that there is 77% chance that the UK will lose 13 lakh "repetitive" jobs within 15 years.
