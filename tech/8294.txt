According to a court filing, the US government has withdrawn its lawsuit against Apple as the FBI has unlocked the iPhone seized in the Brooklyn drug case after obtaining the passcode from “an individual”. Last month, the FBI dropped its Apple lawsuit in the San Bernardino shooting case after paying a third party over $1 million to unlock the iPhone.
