US-based startup Camellia Labs has developed a $249 smart tea brewer 'Chime', which claims to brew a cup of Indian tea in three minutes. It includes a tea boiler, a milk carafe and tea capsules that contain cardamom, ginger and other traditional tea ingredients. The brewer's app allows users to adjust their tea to milk ratio, brew strength and temperature.
