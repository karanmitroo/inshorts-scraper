London-based startup Pavegen has made floor tiles that harness kinetic energy from footsteps to generate electricity. Every footstep can power about 20 seconds of light on an LED fitment. Further, the startup provides data like heat mapping and step counting. Pavegen claims to be powering South Korean vehicle manufacturer Kia's factories and football pitches in Nigeria.
