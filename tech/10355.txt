The US space agency, NASA, has shortlisted five proposals for its key spaceflight missions that may be launched as early as 2020. The chosen projects are for exploring Venus, various asteroids and near-Earth objects. The investigations into these proposals will reportedly be completed at an estimate of $3 million by September 2016, and one to two missions will be selected.
