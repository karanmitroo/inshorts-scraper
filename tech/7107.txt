Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, recently suffered a theft of reportedly 119,756 bitcoins, equivalent to over $77 million based on last week's $650-per-bitcoin price. Following the news, Bitcoin price dropped about 20% to around $540-per-bitcoin. This comes weeks after $50 million worth of ether – another type of cryptocurrency – was stolen during a test run.
