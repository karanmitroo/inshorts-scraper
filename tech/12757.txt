LG has announced its first Smart Bulb, a household light bulb that is connectable to iOS and Android devices. The Wi-Fi or Bluetooth-powered Bulb will blink when users get a phone call and result in 80% energy savings. The company has baked in a crafty security mode, to make it look like residents are at home, when they're actually away.
