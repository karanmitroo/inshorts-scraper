The widow of an American victim of the Islamic State (IS) filed a complaint on Wednesday against Twitter claiming it gave a voice to the terror group. “Without Twitter, the explosive growth of ISIS...would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Twitter had recently updated its content policy by blocking "hateful conduct" in a crackdown on terrorism-linked online propaganda.
