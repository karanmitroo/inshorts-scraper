Facebook is launching 'Snooze' feature which will give the users an option to temporarily unfollow a person, Page or group for 30 days, the social media giant announced on Friday. The feature will block content from the unfollowed person, Page or group from appearing on the News Feed. It will also notify when the Snooze period is about to end.
