Budget airline IndiGo on Thursday said that its official Twitter account had been compromised and the airline's team is investigating the matter. Some incoherent tweets were reportedly sent out from the official handle of IndiGo, which has over 40% share of the domestic market. "We have taken precautionary actions," IndiGo said.
