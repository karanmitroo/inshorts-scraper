A revolutionary waterless toilet powered by the sun, developed to help some of the worldâ€™s 2.5 billion people lacking safe and sustainable sanitation, will be unveiled in India this month. Designed and built using a $7,77,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the self-contained, eco-friendly toilet uses heating techniques to convert human waste into biochar (highly porous charcoal).
