Japanese scientists have discovered a ‘genetic switch’ - fox13 gene - that determines whether a germ cell would eventually become a sperm cell or an egg. The scientists made this discovery while conducting experiments on Japanese ricefish. The finding is expected to help in learning more about how the sexual fate of germ cells is determined during vertebrate development.
