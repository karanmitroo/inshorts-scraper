India's fastest supercomputer 'Pratyush' was unveiled at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, on Monday. The system, which will be a national facility for improving weather and climate forecasts, will also help improve India's peak computing capacity from 1 petaflop to 6.8 petaflops. Petaflop is a measure of processing speed and equals a quadrillion floating point operations per second.
