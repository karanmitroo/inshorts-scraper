Twitter reacted to Google firing an employee for writing the 10-page anti-diversity memo which went viral internally on Sunday. A tweet read, "You can't promote true diversity if you pretend differences don't exist." Another user tweeted, "Damore: @Google does not value diversity of thought@sundarpichai: That's a lie, and you're fired for even thinking that."
