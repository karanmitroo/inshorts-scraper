A five-minute video by YouTube channel 'TechRax' shows Apple's latest smartphone, a 32 GB black iPhone 7 being scratched with a knife and smashed with a hammer. The video shows the iPhone getting scratches on its matte black back panel but none on its screen with the knife. A blow by a hammer weighing 1.3 kg finally cracks the screen.
