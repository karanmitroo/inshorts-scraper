UK-based startup Vinaya has created 'Zenta', a $249 wearable which tracks users' fitness, activity, sleep, as well as emotions including happiness and stress. It tracks users' heart rate, electrodermal activity, respiration and blood oxygen levels to state their emotional status through visual representations. Zenta also prompts personalised notifications to help users build better habits.
