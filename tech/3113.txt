Photo messaging app Snapchat's parent company Snap has reportedly acquired a drone startup called Ctrl Me Robotics for under $1 million (about â‚¹6.45 crore). News of the acquisition, which was reportedly completed last year, was recently made public. However, reports suggest that Ctrl Me doesn't manufacture own drones, but instead fits other drones to carry cameras.
