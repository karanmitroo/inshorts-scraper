Google-owned video-sharing platform YouTube is testing a feature which allows users to change the backgrounds of their videos without using the green screen in real time. The feature is specifically for "stories" called Reels using the platform's new video format on the YouTube app. The technology is only available in a beta version and just for certain YouTube creators.
