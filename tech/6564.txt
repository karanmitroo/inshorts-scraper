California-based Turing Robotic Industries (TRI) is planning to develop 'Turing Phone Cadenza', a smartphone with 12 GB RAM, 1 TB memory, 60 MP rear and 20 MP front camera. The 5.8-inch display phone will run on 'Swordfish OS' which TRI claims will be based on Linux's Sailfish OS. The phone will also have four SIM slots and voice-powered on/off.
