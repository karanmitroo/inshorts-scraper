Japanese electronics company Sony, which stopped making vinyl records nearly 30 years ago, has said that it will resume production to meet the 'surging' demand. Japan produced nearly 200 million records a year in the mid-seventies, as per the country's recording industry association. According to estimates by Deloitte consulting firm, global vinyl revenue will top $1 billion this year.
