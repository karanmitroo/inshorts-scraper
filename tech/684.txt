Cosmetics giant L'Oreal has introduced a thumbnail-sized wearable UV sensor called 'UV Sense' at CES 2018, which can track sun exposure via an app. UV Sense, a battery-free electronic sensor, is NFC-enabled which allows users to retrieve the data collected using the app. The sensor, that comes with replaceable adhesive, can be pasted on one's fingernail or sunglasses.
