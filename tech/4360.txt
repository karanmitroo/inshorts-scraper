Michael Tompsett, the British engineer responsible for the development of digital imaging sensors, said he is proud of his contribution but is also "frustrated" by the craze surrounding selfies and "taking pictures of everything". Tompsett and three other engineers were awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in recognition of their work towards the development of digital image sensing.
