LG is testing two robot prototypes to provide assistance to travellers and clean floors respectively in South Korea's largest airport, the Incheon International Airport. The guiding robot can speak Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese and scan visitors' boarding passes to escort them to their departure gate, while the cleaning robot is equipped with a vacuum cleaner and autonomous navigation.
