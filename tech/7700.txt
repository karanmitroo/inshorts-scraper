A Swedish startup has developed a $299 smart ring called 'BioRing', that tracks the user's calorie intake, stress level, steps taken, heart rate and sleep. It uses the collected data to create personalised health and fitness plans for the user. The app-based scratch proof and waterproof ring also vibrates and sends important health notifications on a user's smartphone.
