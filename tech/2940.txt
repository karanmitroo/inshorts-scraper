US-based scientists are developing a new system that can predict if a car driver is about to have a heart attack. Researchers, in collaboration with Japanese automaker Toyota, are working on technology that can monitor and analyse the physiology of the driver. "The medical event interferes with the driver's ability to safely drive and operate the car," said a researcher.
