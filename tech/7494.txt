Facebook on Wednesday introduced a low-cost wireless access hardware and software platform, called OpenCellular, aimed at improving connectivity in remote areas. The platform will support a variety of wireless networks, from 2G and LTE to Wi-Fi access points. The company said that it will open-source the platform so that anyone can deploy their own versions of the cellular networks.
