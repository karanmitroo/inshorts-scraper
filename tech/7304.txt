A US researcher has developed 'Dreambit', a face-swapping search engine app. The app allows users to click and upload a selfie and searches for images matching the user's search term, like "curly hair". It then looks for images where the subjectâ€™s face is positioned similar to the user's face, and returns the images with the user's face swapped on.
