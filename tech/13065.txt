A Silicon Valley jury on Thursday held Samsung Electronics guilty of copying Apple's vital iPhone and iPad features and ordered it to pay $290 million to Apple. The verdict covered 13 older Samsung devices that infringed Apple patents. A next trial is scheduled for March to consider Apple's claims that Samsung's newest devices on the market also copied Apple's technology.
