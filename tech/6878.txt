A hacker group named 'Shadow Brokers' on Monday said they will put stolen surveillance tools in an online auction. Claiming that these tools were used by a cyber group linked to US' National Security Agency, the hackers released samples of programs on Tumblr which they claim could break into popular firewall software from companies like Cisco, Fortinet and Jupiter Networks.
