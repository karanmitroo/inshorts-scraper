American home appliances maker Whirlpool has developed Zera Food Recycler, a new kitchen appliance that can turn food waste into fertilizer within a week. Users need to plug in the appliance and toss all the food waste, where a carbon filter reduces odour and an additive speeds up the breakdown process. A mobile app allows operating the appliance remotely.
