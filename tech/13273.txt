Approximately 614,000 Facebook users whose personal details appeared in Sponsored Stories without their permission will each receive a $15 pay-out, ruled a US court. Around 150-million users' information was used, but only those who responded to an email from Facebook are compensated. The court also ordered Facebook to give users more information and control over how their details are used.
