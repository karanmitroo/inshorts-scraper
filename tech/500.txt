Intel on Monday said that the security patches for recently found vulnerabilities in its chips are faulty, and advised users to stop installing them. Intel Executive Vice President Navin Shenoy confirmed that the patches caused computers to reboot more often and other "unpredictable" behaviour. Earlier, Intel confirmed that the security patches also caused computers with newer chips to reboot.
