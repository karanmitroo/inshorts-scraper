Taylor Swift on Sunday announced the release of a documentary film, titled '1989 World Tour LIVE', about her concert tour exclusively on Apple Music on December 20. The tour, called '1989 World Tour', started in May and ended last Saturday. Interestingly, Swift had earlier criticised Apple Music for not paying artists for the content streamed during its three-month free trial.
