A 58-year-old Thai man has been punished with a jail term of 25 years by the military court for posting defamatory pictures on his Facebook page which were considered insulting by the Thailand's monarchy. Reportedly, Tiensutham Suttijitseranee was initially given 50 years imprisonment (10 years for each photo posted), but his punishment was halved after he pleaded guilty.
