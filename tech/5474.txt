Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owners will not be able to connect to any mobile network in New Zealand starting November 18. Users of the recalled Note 7 smartphones will be able to connect to WiFi but not make calls, send texts, or access 3G or 4G mobile internet. The move is aimed at encouraging users to exchange their now-discontinued devices.
