Tech giant Microsoft on Monday confirmed its Chinese-language AI chat bot Xiaoice filters certain topics, but did not clarify if that included politically sensitive interactions. On the mention of US President-elect Donald Trump, the chatbot reportedly says, "I don't want to talk about it." References to a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping also drew an evasive response from Xiaoice.
