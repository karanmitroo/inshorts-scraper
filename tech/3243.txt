San Francisco-based machine learning startup Numerai is offering employees the chance to be cryonically frozen after they die. The bodies will be stored in liquid nitrogen at -196 degree Celsius in aluminium containers by Alcor. Cryonics is an experimental technique that hopes to revive the frozen bodies and restore them to full health with better medical technology in the future.
