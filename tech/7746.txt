Apple on Monday announced that its voice-based personal assistant Siri will come in-built with its Mac desktops. Siri will be available at the desktop's notification centre to answer questions and perform advanced file searches. Images, music and other interactions can be dragged from Siri results to the desktop. A public beta version of the feature will launch in July.
