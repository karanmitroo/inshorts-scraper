A mobile application to trace lost children has been developed under a self-funded initiative named ''Helping Faceless.'' The app uses features like 'Face Recognition' and data analytics technology to aid volunteers in clicking pictures of the needy children and guiding them to the nearest police station. The initiative holds a strong base in Mumbai, but operates throughout the country.
