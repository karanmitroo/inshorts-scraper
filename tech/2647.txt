China-based solar energy firm Panda Green Energy Group has announced that its panda bear-shaped solar plant has been connected to the grid. The plant has an output of 50 megawatts, which is said to be enough to power more than 8,000 US households. Two different types of solar panels give the plant a monochromatic look.
