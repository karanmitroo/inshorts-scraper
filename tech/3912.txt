Hundreds of Marine soldiers are being investigated by the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service after a Facebook group was found to be hosting naked pictures of US women soldiers. The group was allegedly being used by soldiers in the US and UK. Many involved accounts have been shut and some offenders have also been fired or removed from active duty.
