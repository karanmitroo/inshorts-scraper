Dubai recently unveiled its first ever driverless bus service, which will be deployed in the city for a month-long trial period. The service includes 10-seater electric buses that can travel at a speed of 40 kmph. The bus can adapt its speed to the surrounding environment and even come to a complete halt if a pedestrian crosses its path.
