Venture capitalist and Facebook board member Marc Andreessen has said that he feels "50 pounds lighter" and "free as a bird" after announcing a break from Twitter. On being asked how his Twitter followers were taking his silence, he said, "I think they'll get by." Andreessen, known for coining the term 'Tweetstorm', deleted his old tweets abruptly earlier this week.
