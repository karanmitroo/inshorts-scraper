Flipkart on Friday shut down its e-book selling business, that was launched in 2012. Further, all existing user libraries will be migrated to Canada-based e-book seller Rakuten Kobo starting December 17. However, customers’ previous purchases will not be affected by the move. This is Flipkart’s third service to have shut down after payment service PayZippy and music streaming service Flyte.
