Microsoft has ended support for its 10-year-old operating system Windows Vista. The system, which received widespread criticism, will not get security updates or support. In 2008, Microsoft launched 'The Mojave Experiment' in which consumers tried Windows Vista under a different name. The campaign was meant to imply that negative perception about Vista was the result of preconceived notions.
