3nder, a dating app for people seeking threesomes, announced on Tuesday that it had rebranded to 'Feeld: Discover the Undiscovered' and also launched on Android. The company is currently fighting a lawsuit against Tinder over trademark infringement. Tinder had claimed that 3nder was purposely seeking to mislead Tinder users by using a similar name.
