The Twitter accounts of actor Anupam Kher and Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta were hacked on Tuesday. The hackers, who identified themselves as Turkish 'cyber army', tweeted from Kher's account, "Your DM correspondence and important data have been captured! I Love Pakistan." BJP's National General Secretary Ram Madhav and economist Kaushik Basu's accounts were also hacked by the same group.
