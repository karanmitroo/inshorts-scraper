Auto parts supplier Bosch on Wednesday launched an electric scooter-sharing service in Berlin, Germany with 200 scooters. With the new on-demand service, commuters can locate and book scooters using a connected app called 'Coup'. A management board member said, "Mobility requirements and demands are changing. Bosch wants to shape this change with their own mobility and service solutions."
