Tesla's new Model 3 car will be available soon across the USA for $35,000, but buyers can get the car for under $30,000 after incentives like tax rebates. The US government is offering a $7,500 tax credit while state governments offer an additional rebate ranging from $2,500 to $6,000. Tesla has not revealed all features in the electric car.
