Hyderabad-based entrepreneur Ayyappa Nagubandi has made 'Broadcast', a t-shirt that displays customised text and design through LEDs fixed on it. Controlled through an app, the users can customise the design or text on the t-shirt for as many times as they want. Also, the LEDs on the shirt are waterproof, making it easy for the users to wash the t-shirt.
