Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed he was dropping his legal plan to force the sale of land tracts on his seafront property that are claimed by native Hawaiians. Zuckerberg had faced criticism from islanders and local lawmakers for attempting to secure the parcels of land. "Now that I understand the issues better, it's clear we made a mistake," said Zuckerberg.
