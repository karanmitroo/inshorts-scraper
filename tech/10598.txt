Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT), a software created by Intel that allows Stephen Hawking to communicate by interpreting sensor data from the movements in his cheek muscles, is now available for free on code-sharing website GitHub. Intel hopes this move will help others suffering from similar diseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Motor Neurone Disease (MND).
