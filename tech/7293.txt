Following a report by consumer-advocacy group Consumer Reports that Samsung's Galaxy S7 Active phones are not water-resistant, Samsung has said it has found a problem in the production line. The issue has been fixed in the phones being shipped now, said the company. Samsung is also offering replacements to consumers whose under warranty phones have sustained water damage.
