Russia has directed Google and Apple to remove LinkedIn from the local Android and iOS App stores. The directive comes weeks after a Russian court blocked the networking platform for disregarding a rule which requires companies to store Russian citizens' data within the country's borders. Google and Android have complied with the order and the app is no longer available.
