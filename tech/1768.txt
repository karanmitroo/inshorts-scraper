Camera manufacturing company Nikon is working on full-frame mirrorless cameras, according to patent filed for the same earlier this month. The company's R&D manager Tetsuro Goto in an interview said, "Full frame is the trend. If Nikon will go mirrorless, it must be full frame." He also said Nikon wants high-quality glass for portrait and other shots for professional photographers.
