San Francisco-based drone manufacturing startup Lily Robotics has pulled in orders worth $34 million, equivalent to around 60,000 units, in pre-orders for their upcoming self-driving drones, according to the founder. The drone is capable of following a person or object and recording video using an attached 1080p HD camera as soon as it is tossed up in the air.
