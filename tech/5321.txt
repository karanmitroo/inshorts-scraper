Disney has partnered with technology firm Intel to host a light show with 300 drones every night of the holiday season in Florida. The Shooting Star drones, weighing 280 grams each, are controlled by a single operator and can create over four billion colour combinations in the sky. The drones can travel at 35 kmph and fly in light rain.
