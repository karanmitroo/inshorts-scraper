A French startup has developed an Air Mask named 'Wair' that has built-in fans on its sides to provide fresh breathing air to the wearer. The washable mask also comes with changeable triple-layered filters to block allergens, bacteria, and other particulates associated with pollution. The mask also has its own mobile app that gives users pollution warnings.
