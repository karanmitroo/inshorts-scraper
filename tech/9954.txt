Google is folding Songza, the free music streaming service it acquired last year, into Google Play Music starting January 31, 2016. The latter has already integrated several Songza features, including its popular Concierge feature, under which the app suggests playlists to users. Songza users will henceforth be prompted regarding the shut down and asked to migrate to Google Play Music.
