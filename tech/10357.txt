Search giant Google announced a new ad targeting service titled ‘Customer Match.’ Under this service, advertisers will be able to upload a list of e-mail addresses and consequently develop targeted ad campaigns for users on any of Google’s platforms including Gmail and YouTube. Facebook has a similar ad targeting tool called ‘Custom Audiences.’
