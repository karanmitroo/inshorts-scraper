Japan-based developers have unveiled a swimming robot to inspect the country's 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown site. The 2-kg remote-controlled robot, 13 cm in diameter to help avoid various obstacles, can withstand high levels of radiation. Notably, a clean-up mission in February using another robot was aborted within two hours as the "unimaginable" radiation levels damaged the robot's camera.
