Twitter on Tuesday launched a new iOS app called 'Twitter Engage' to let celebrities share content and have conversations with fans and other influencers in real-time through tweets. The app reviews the users' videos, GIFs, images and other Twitter activities to provide them with data and insights. It also provides demographics and live feed of fans' tweets to the users.
