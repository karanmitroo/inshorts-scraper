A new software, called Phantom Terrains, gives the deaf the ability to hear Wi-Fi signals, made audible through streaming them to a pair of hearing aids. Frank Swain (a distinguished science writer who has been losing his hearing since his 20s) along with Daniel Jones, artist and software engineer have created the software, which is still at the experimental stage.
