Microsoft on Tuesday open-sourced its Computational Networks Toolkit (CNTK), a deep learning toolkit that powers the company's speech recognition technology, and has made it available on GitHub. According to the company, by pairing CNTK with their networked GPU system, called Azure GPU Lab, they were able to train the speech recognition networks in the Cortana virtual assistant ten times faster.
