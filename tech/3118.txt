Over 100 documents obtained by The Guardian reveal how Facebook tackles controversial content like sex, revenge porn, violence, death videos and abuse on its platform. While remarks like "Someone shoot Trump" are deleted, the remark "Let's beat up fat kids" is allowed. Facebook allows livestream of self-harm attempts because it "doesn't want to censor people in distress," the documents said.
