Video game company Nintendo will launch its first game for smartphones in March, president Tatsumi Kimishima said. The mobile game, Miitomo, allows players to build their cartoon avatars that go on to develop personalities on their own and independently interact with friends. Nintendo specifically said that Miitomo is for people who do not like talking about themselves.
