US-based scientists have developed a solar-powered and stretchable mesh of power cells that can be stuck to several surfaces. It uses multiple thin lithium-ion battery tiles bonded with a rubbery material and fitted with tiny solar panels. The excessive length of interconnecting wires allows the mesh to stretch in all directions by 30% while still working perfectly, a researcher said.
