Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube on Monday announced a Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. The companies will collaborate on engineering solutions to target and remove recruiting materials posted by terror groups. In December of 2016, the same four companies created a shared industry hash database, allowing the companies to collectively identify terror accounts.
