A Paris-based artist, Christophe Guinet has launched a new project named 'Plant Your Mac!' where he turns old Apple computers into plant pots and tiny gardens. Guinet puts soil in the computer's hardware and grows exotic and unusual plants like bonsai in it. The Apple computers used by the artist include the Macintosh Classic, the iMac G3 and G5.
