Researchers at a German university have found a WhatsApp bug which lets users join group chats without invitation despite end-to-end encryption. According to them, anyone having access to WhatsApp servers could also manipulate alerts to other members of a new person joining them. A spokesperson confirmed the findings, but emphasised that "there is no secret way into WhatsApp group chats."
