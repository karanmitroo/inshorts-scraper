Japanese electronics multinational Sharp has developed a phone display with actual curves at the corners, using the company's Free-Form Display technology. The 5.2-inch 1080p panel has been developed under the concept Corner R and the company's new technology enables the LCD panels to be cut into various shapes. The product, though, is not available to markets yet.
