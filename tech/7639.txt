US-based startup Zume Pizza runs a robotic pizzeria in the Silicon Valley. The pizzeria employs both, humans and robots, where humans create the dough and robots spread the sauce and put the pizzas in the ovens. The startup has also created special delivery trucks that cook pizzas on their way to delivery.
