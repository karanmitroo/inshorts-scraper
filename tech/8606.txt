Facebook has apologized for accidentally sending Safety Check notifications for the Lahore suicide bombing on Sunday to people in unaffected locations including the US and the UK. The company said, “This kind of bug is counter to our intent”. Further confusion was created when users were asked if they were affected by the explosion via SMS, without specifying any location.
