According to the latest report of Google's self-driving project, the company is enabling its autonomous cars to detect signals and behaviour of on-road cyclists. The designed system can detect and remember cyclists' hand signals for oncoming turns. The report also mentioned unique situations that the vehicles can handle, such as a cyclist riding against the flow or suddenly changing directions.
