China's capital Beijing has deployed electric sanitation vehicles to replace existing gas-driven vehicles to cut down on high emission levels in the city. The new vehicles include 26 modes covering sanitation functions like road sweeping, garbage transportation and garbage disposal. Reports suggest each 16-tonne vehicle will cut down on carbon dioxide levels by 80 tonnes a year.
