Nike in collaboration with Los Angeles-based architect Greg Lynn has developed 'Microclimate Chair' that helps athletes recover and relax during their game breaks. With 70 thermoelectric pads, the chair heats or cools an athlete's body to help them recover from strenuous exercise. It also distributes and diffuses air across its surface to decrease humidity around an athlete.
