Media streaming service Netflix will remove movies like ‘Hunger Games: Catching Fire’, ‘World War Z’ and ‘Transformers: Age of Extinction’ from its website by the end of September. Netflix is discontinuing its partnership with Epix, a joint venture between MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment and Viacom’s Paramount production houses. The company reportedly wants to focus on providing only exclusive content.
