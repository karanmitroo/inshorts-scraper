Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has apologised for the data breaches faced by the internet company during her tenure. Mayer added that Yahoo has not been able to identify the intrusion leading to the 2013 breach. Last month, Yahoo revealed that all of its three billion users' accounts were hacked in the world's biggest data breach which occurred in 2013.
