Samsung Electronics will add two safeguards to its latest smartphone - Galaxy 5S - in an effort to deter rampant theft of the mobile devices nationwide, the company said Friday. The two features are, “Find My Mobile” and “Reactivation Lock”. The phones go on sale next week. Apple created a similar “activation lock” feature for the popular iPhone last year.
