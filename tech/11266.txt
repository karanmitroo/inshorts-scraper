Plant geneticists at the Ashoka Trust for Research and the University of Agricultural Sciences in Bengaluru and Dharward have spotted a plant in the Western Ghats that produces anti-cancer alkaloid-Camptothecine (CPT). CPT is used in several synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs to treat Ovarian and small-lung cancer. Scientists are now testing it and trying to grow it for commercial use.
