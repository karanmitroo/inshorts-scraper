Microsoft is making its Xbox Music streaming service available for free on the Web - even to those who don't use Windows 8. Xbox Music allows people to choose from 30 million tracks. Starting with its release Nov. 22, Xbox One users will also, for the first time, be able to play games while listening to Xbox Music simultaneously.
