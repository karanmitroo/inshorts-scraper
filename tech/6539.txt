The first patent applied for by Google Co-founders for their search algorithm 'PageRank' is still registered to their alma mater Stanford University. To get an exclusive long-term patent license for PageRank, Google gave Stanford 1.8 million shares in its stock, which the university reportedly sold for $336 million in 2005. Google was incorporated 18 years ago on September 4, 1998.
