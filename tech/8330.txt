Norwegian companies Eelume, Statoil and Kongsberg Maritime have jointly developed an aquatic robot to perform visual inspection, cleaning and basic repairs for undersea equipment. The flexible self-propelled robot can also enter confined areas of undersea equipment to tighten loose valves. The robot will be permanently installed on the seabed to perform on-demand inspections.
