Popular websites like Twitter, Amazon, Netflix, Reddit and others were inaccessible in the US and Europe on Friday after hackers attacked Dyn, an internet 'phonebook' connecting users to various websites including the above-mentioned sites. The hackers used internet-connected devices that were infected with a malware to overload Dyn servers with huge amounts of traffic which led to the shutdown.
