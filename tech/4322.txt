With 'Safer Internet Day' being observed on February 7, Rajesh Maurya from cybersecurity company Fortinet stated, "The internet wasn't designed with security in mind". He added, "It is vital to note that the day is named 'safer' and not 'safe' because no technology as powerful as the internet will ever be entirely safe in this present state of digital affairs."
