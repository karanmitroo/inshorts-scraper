A team of astronomers has identified possibly the coldest, faintest white dwarf star ever detected. The star, which is approximately 11 billion years old, is so cold that its carbon has crystallised, forming, in effect, an earth-sized diamond in space. The researchers calculated that the white dwarf would be no more than a comparatively cool 3,000 degrees Kelvin.
