Japanese company Konica Minolta has created a gadget called Kunkun Body that checks users' body odour for â‚¹17,000. It can test for smells near the head, behind ears, under armpits, and around feet and rate them in three levels of severity. For example, on detecting high readings of smells, the gadget's connected smartphone app would display, "Immediately care is needed."
