The cyber war between the US and North Korea escalated to a new level when North Korea experienced a mass internet crash early on Monday. This happened hours after US promised a "proportional response" to North Korea's "cybervandalism" against Sony Pictures. Pyongyang denied responsibility and proposed a "joint investigation" into the matter, while also warning strikes on "the US mainland".
