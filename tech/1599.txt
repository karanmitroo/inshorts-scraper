In 1965, Intel Co-founder Gordon Moore observed data storage abilities of computer chips double every year, later observed at 18 months. Now, an MIT study has shown magnetic particles called 'skyrmions' can store data on surfaces a few atoms wide, likely bypassing Moore's Law. The system could potentially encode data at high speeds, substituting conventional storage devices like hard disks.
