Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has almost completed her next book tentatively tilted as 'Option B'. The book, co-written with professor and author Adam Grant, includes Grant's researches and Sandberg's loss when she lost her husband last year. The book's title is a reference to a piece of advice given by a friend to Sandberg after her spouse's demise.
