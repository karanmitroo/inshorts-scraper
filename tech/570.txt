Apple's macOS has reportedly been attacked by a DNS malware dubbed OSX/MaMi which works by changing server settings on affected computers, thus accessing personal data. The malware is capable of taking screenshots, simulating mouse events, downloading and uploading files, and executing commands. It is reportedly spreading via executable files shared in the form of mails and fake security alerts.
