LinkedIn Executive Chairman and Co-founder Reid Hoffman has questioned the lack of outrage over the sexual harassment of female entrepreneurs in the venture capital eco-system.

Venture capitalists propositioning women entrepreneurs who are seeking funding is "outrageous and immoral," said Hoffman.
