Scientists at Yale University (US) have devised a dramatically faster way of identifying and characterising complex alloys known as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), a versatile type of pliable glass that is stronger than steel. Already used in watch components and sporting goods, BMGs also have likely applications in biomedical technology. About 120,000 metallic glasses have been produced till date.
