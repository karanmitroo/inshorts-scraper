A security researcher, named Dmytro "Cr4sh" Oleksiuk, claims to have uncovered a flaw in Lenovo laptops that could let attackers circumvent Windows' basic security protocols. The company later said that the code responsible for the vulnerability came from Intel. Oleksiuk added that other manufacturers might have adopted the same code, having already identified one HP Pavillion laptop with the bug.
