Apple on Friday said that iPhone 6 and 6 Plus smartphones are still available in China after Beijing's intellectual property regulators said that the designs infringed a patent held by a Chinese company. Apple had appealed an administrative order from a regional patent tribunal in Beijing. "The order has been stayed pending review by the Beijing IP Court," added Apple.
