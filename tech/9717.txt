As many as 64 professors from various Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other technology institutes in the country have slammed Facebook's 'Free Basics' program. Releasing a joint statement on Tuesday, the professors claimed that the FB program was neither free nor basic and it violated the principle of net neutrality. They further urged the TRAI to reject 'Free Basics'.
