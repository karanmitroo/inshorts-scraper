Technology giant Apple's products always display 9:41 AM time in the advertisements. Apple Keynote events are planned to unveil the product about 40 minutes into the presentation and an extra minute is added to cover for delays. Interestingly, the time used to be 9:42 AM earlier, when the first iPhone was introduced on January 9, 2007.
