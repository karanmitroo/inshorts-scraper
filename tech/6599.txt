Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview on Thursday said that European Union's demand for Apple to pay $14.5 billion tax to Ireland is "total political crap". He further added that anti-US bias was "one reason why we (Apple) could have been targeted". Cook said that Apple is committed to operations in Ireland and will try to overturn the decision.
