Bill Gates on Tuesday marked 25 years of his friendship with Berkshire Hathaway's CEO Warren Buffett through a post titled, '25 Years of Learning and Laughter.' Gates revealed that his mom persuaded him to be friends with Buffett in 1991. "Everyone should be lucky enough to have a friend who is as thoughtful and kind as Warren," the post said.
