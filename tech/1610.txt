A reusable, water-powered Mars lander that would allow humans to explore Mars from an orbiting 'base camp' by the 2030s was unveiled by US aerospace company Lockheed Martin at the International Astronautical Congress. To be made in partnership with NASA, the lander would descend on Mars for repeated missions, while liquid hydrogen and oxygen generated from water would fuel it.
