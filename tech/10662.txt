Two former employees of Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab have revealed that the security company tried to damage its rivals more than a decade ago by tricking their antivirus software into deleting or disabling important files on their customers' PCs. They said the secret campaign targeted Microsoft, AVG Technologies, and Avast Software among others. Kaspersky Lab strongly denied the allegation.
