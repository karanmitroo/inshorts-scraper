Apple is looking for software engineers “who can…help build Siri’s knowledge of all things sports related”. In addition to having experience with Artificial Intelligence, the candidates must have an “encyclopedic knowledge of sports — and wish that Siri did as well”. Apple has added team logos and player head shots in Siri to improve visual representation of sports information.
