US-based Kyle Adelman has developed a rechargeable device called 'Radius' which repels mosquitos using heatwaves up to an area of 110 square feet. The device uses heat to activate a scent-free repellent made from flowers, which the company claims does not affect user's skin or breathing. The portable device comes with a USB charger, along with a refill.
