Vodafone has been fined record $5.6 million in the UK for “serious and sustained” breaches of consumer protection rules. While it faces $4.5 million for taking money from its pay-as-you-go service customers without providing a service in return, $1.1 million were fined for flaws in its complaints handling processes. Vodafone is required to pay the fine within 20 days.
