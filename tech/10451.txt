Researchers have discovered an isotope of Berkelium (Bk, atomic number 97), Neptunium (Np, 93) and two of Americium (Am, 95), according to a paper published in 'Physics Letters B'. Hundred residual nuclei were left after a beam of Calcium 48 was projected on to a foil of Curium 248. The new neutron-deficient isotopes were confirmed by studying their decay chains.
