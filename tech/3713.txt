Conservation organisation WWF India has made a website to mark Earth Hour on March 25 that lets users calculate how much money they can save by turning off different home appliances for an hour. For example, the site shows that switching off each fan can save about ₹95, while turning off an air conditioner can save close to ₹1,850.
