Google has won a fight against US Labor Department which alleged gender pay gap and requested access to information of over 25,000 Google employees for investigation. A judge ruled that the department's demand for data is too broad and could violate the workers' privacy. Google, which denies paying women less than men, said it will provide 'limited' data.
