Apple is removing all major Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps from its App Store in China, which helped internet users overcome the censorship called the 'Great Firewall'. VPN providers on Saturday said they received a notice from Apple that its software would be removed from the China App Store "because it includes content that is illegal in China."
