The Paris Navigating Gym, a floating gym that will move along the Seine River in Paris by harnessing energy from passengers' workouts has been unveiled. Designed by Carlo Ratti Associati, the 65-foot long vessel has a transparent glass covering which can be opened. Augmented-reality screens are installed in the floating gym to show guests the energy sourced from their workout.
