General Electric (GE) has partnered with explorer and filmmaker Sam Cossman and the Nicaraguan government to install around 80 wireless sensors inside the Masaya Volcano as an early warning system. Cossman will descend 1,200 feet inside the volcano to test the Wi-Fi and install the sensors that will gather real-time data about Masaya's temperature, gravity and the diversity of gasses.
