Nintendo has announced that its Super Mario Run has become the fastest game ever to get 40 million downloads on Apple's App Store. Super Mario Run hit the milestone within four days of launch, the Japanese company said. However, Nintendo shares have lost over 10% since the game's launch as users have complained about the $9.99 in-app cost.
