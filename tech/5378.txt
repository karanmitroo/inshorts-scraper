E-commerce giant Amazon sold out the recently-launched Nintendo NES Classic Edition game consoles, seconds after making them available for sale on Saturday. However, Nintendo has assured the public via a series of tweets "there will be a steady flow" of the in-demand gadgets. Notably, units of the $60 device appeared soon after on Craigslist, with prices going up to $850.
