Database giant Oracle on Monday agreed to settle with the Foreign Trade Commission over the company's insecure Java patching. The software company was charged for not uninstalling the previous insecure Java versions while upgrading, leaving the customers vulnerable to potential attackers. Oracle will now have to notify its users of the security threat and provide tools to fight the same.
