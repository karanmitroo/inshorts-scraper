South Korean electronics major Samsung will allow Galaxy Note 7 smartphone owners in the US to exchange their devices with either Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge smartphones. The company will start exchanging the devices from next week. Just over two weeks after Galaxy Note 7's launch, Samsung on Friday stopped the smartphone's sales globally over cases of battery explosions.
