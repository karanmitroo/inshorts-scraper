Yamaha has unveiled what it claims to be the world's first piano audible from all rooms in a house, and even outdoors. The Japanese musical instrument maker has incorporated its MusicCast wireless multi-room audio system to Enspire, its latest generation of Disklavier acoustic pianos. With built-in access to more than 500 songs, the Enspire can be controlled via Yamaha's app.
