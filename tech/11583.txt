As the Mangalyaan Tuesday completed 6 months orbiting planet Mars, ISRO has decided to extend the mission by another 6 months. "...its life has been extended for another six months. About 37 kgs of fuel is available which is sufficient to last longer," ISRO spokesperson Deviprasad Karnik said. The mission aims to find methane, an indicator of life, on Mars.
