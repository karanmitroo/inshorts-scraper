A senior employee at computer technology major Oracle, George A Polisner, has quit the company after CEO Safra Catz joined US President-elect Donald Trump's advisory team. Polisner said, "Trump stokes fear, hatred and violence toward people of colour, Muslims and immigrants." He added, "I am not with President-elect Trump and I am not here to help him in any way."
