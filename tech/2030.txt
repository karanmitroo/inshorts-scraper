Owners of Samsung's ₹1.1 lakh TVs have taken to the electronic giant's online forums to complain that a firmware update left their sets with blank, unusable screens. Some users also claimed that the TVs get stuck on one channel and don’t respond to remote control commands. Samsung has reportedly acknowledged the issue and said it is working on a fix.
