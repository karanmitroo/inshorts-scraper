World's biggest automaker Toyota on Friday unveiled next-generation cars featuring self-driving technology that will enable vehicles to communicate wirelessly to avoid collisions and keep them running on road without drivers touching the wheel. Toyota, which has already introduced the pre-collision braking assist system in its Lexus luxury sedan, plans to bring such self-driving cars in next few years.
