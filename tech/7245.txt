The Semiconductor Industry Association, which includes chip makers like IBM and Intel, recently published a roadmap suggesting the size of transistors will stop shrinking after 2021. The report added it might not be financially practical to keep reducing transistor sizes. This might be interpreted as the end of Moore's Law, which suggests the transistor count in a circuit doubles every 18 months.
