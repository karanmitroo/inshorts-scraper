Under Google’s Expedition Pioneer Programme, the general public can now take a virtual reality tour of the Buckingham Palace in England, the residence of Queen Elizabeth II, in 360° format. The video for the same has been uploaded on The British Monarchy’s YouTube channel. Google’s programme aims at providing schoolchildren with virtual field trips of important landmarks.
