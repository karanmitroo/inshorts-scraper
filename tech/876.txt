Microsoft has filed a patent for a foldable dual-screen notebook similar to the company's booklet PC concept called 'Courier'. The design shows two edge-to-edge displays, positioned to touch each other without any significant gap, connected by a hinge. The company is also reportedly using gear-like cogs to create this adjustable hinge, allowing the device to hold in different positions.
