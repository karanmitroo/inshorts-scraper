Chinese smartphone brands Oppo and Vivo's Co-founder, Duan Yongping, has said he needs "a really big pocket" because he carries four devices including a heavily-used iPhone. "Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws. They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes," he added. "Apple is an extraordinary company. It's a model for us to learn from," he said further.
