Canada-based startup Kepler Communications has raised $5 million in seed funding to "establish an in-space telecommunications network for space-borne assets." With a network of small, replaceable satellites, the startup is building a real-time system for machinery and device communication. Co-founder Mina Mitry said, "Weâ€™re setting up to have our first two satellite launch at the end of 2017."
