Technology giant Microsoft's President Brad Smith on Tuesday posted a statement that the company would pay for the legal council of 39 Microsoft Dreamer employees facing deportation. He added, "If Dreamers who are our employees are in court, we will be by their side." This came after the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was ended by President Trump.
