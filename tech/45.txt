After days of external pressure, YouTube has banned a neo-Nazi channel called Atomwaffen citing "multiple or severe violations of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech". Atomwaffen was linked to five murders, including that of a gay Jewish student. The group recruited around 80 people across 23 states from which one was sentenced to five years in prison for stockpiling bomb-making materials.
