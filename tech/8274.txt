According to the US deputy defense secretary Robert Work, the country has launched its first cyber attack against the ISIS. The cyber campaign aims to disrupt ISIS' communications, recruitment and financial operations, that are executed online, and hopes that this will lead to it doubting its digital security. Work said, “We are dropping cyberbombs. We have never done that before.”
