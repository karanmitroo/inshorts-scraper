Smitha Rao, an Indian-origin researcher, and  her Taiwanese professor at University of Arlington (Texas) have designed a tiny windmill, hundreds of which when embedded in a sleeve for a cell phone would generate enough electricity to recharge a phone's battery. About 10 of these tiny windmills, made of special nickel alloy, can be accommodated on a single grain of rice.
