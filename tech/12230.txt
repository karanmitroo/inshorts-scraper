India's indigenously developed nuclear capable sub-sonic cruise missile 'Nirbhay', which can strike targets over 700 kms away, was Friday test-fired from a test range at Chandipur, Odisha. Test-fired from a mobile launcher positioned at launch pad 3 of the Integrated Test Range, the Nirbhay is very maneuverable and can fly at tree-top level making it difficult to detect on radar.
