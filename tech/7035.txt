America has received its first ever 'Pizza ATM' at Ohio's Xavier University. Built by French company Paline, the 24x7 ATM serves pizzas at just the touch of a button at $9 for a full 12-inch pizza. A touchscreen on the machine allows customers to choose pizza toppings. It takes three minutes for the ATM to deliver a pizza.
