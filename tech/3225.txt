Krishna Chinthapalli, an Indian-origin doctor in London, had warned against the type of ransomware attack which hit 99 countries on Friday. He had published an article just two days before the attack about the vulnerability of Britain's National Health Service to ransomware. "We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year," he wrote.
