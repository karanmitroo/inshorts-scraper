An Italian court has ruled that excessive mobile phone use caused a man to develop brain tumour and awarded him a pension of â‚¹35,000 per month. The man said he used his mobile for 3-4 hours every working day for 15 years. It's said to be the first time a court has recognised a link between mobiles and brain tumour.
