Software company VMWare has announced a partnership with Amazon to bring VMware’s virtualisation software to Amazon Web Services (AWS) under the ‘VMware Cloud on AWS' moniker. Starting next year, all of VMware’s infrastructure software like vSphere, VSAN and NSX will run directly on AWS, without Amazon software in between. Early customers of the service include Western Digital and Sysco.
