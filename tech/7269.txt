A Chinese startup has developed a smart self-driving suitcase called 'Cowarobot R1' that follows its user while avoiding any obstacles in its path. The suitcase comes with a bracelet to be worn by the user, so that it remains within an arm's distance from the user. It also features an automatic lock that is operated by tapping on the bracelet.
