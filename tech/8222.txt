Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched solar-powered e-boats at the Assi Ghat in Varanasi. The initiative is aimed at reducing pollution and keeping the Ganga river clean. Modi, who also rode the e-boat, said, “With e-boats, the boatmen will be able to save ₹500 a day without spending on diesel.” Earlier in the day, Modi also distributed 1,000 e-rickshaws in Varanasi.
