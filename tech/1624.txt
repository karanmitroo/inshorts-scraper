The High Court in Catalonia has ordered US tech giant Google to delete an application that it said Catalan separatists were using to spread information about the region's independence from Spain. The court said the application opposed an order from Spain's Constitutional Court to suspend the referendum. Notably, the Spanish government has termed the independence referendum as illegal.
