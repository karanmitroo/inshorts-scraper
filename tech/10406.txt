Microsoft has launched Office 2016, updating its application suite— comprising Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher and Outlook— almost after three years. The new Word lets multiple people work on the same document in real time. Users can also video chat from within their documents through Skype for Business. Office 2016 gives users a private preview of Microsoft’s collaboration tool GigJam.
