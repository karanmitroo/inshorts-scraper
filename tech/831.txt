Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has asked a US court to overturn a ban on its products in government networks. It also asked the court to declare that its products are not a security threat to US government computers. This comes after a directive was issued ordering government agencies to remove Kaspersky software from their networks amid security concerns.
