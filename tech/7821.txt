Craig Newmark, the founder of the classified advertisements portal 'Craigslist', has donated $1 million to support the free online encyclopedia 'Wikipedia'. The amount was donated to a fund set up by the Wikimedia Foundation. "Wikipedia is a record of what happened and what is happening in the world, and we need that historical record to make good decisions", Newmark said.
