The European Union on Wednesday accused Google of cheating consumers and competitors by distorting web searches to give undue advantage to its own shopping services. The EU also launched another anti-trust investigation into the android operating system. Google has been served with a statement of objections from the Union and has 10 weeks to respond to the allegations.
