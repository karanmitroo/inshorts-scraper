Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that while everyone knows Shah Rukh Khan, people started to know him only after his interview with the actor in 2014 for the film 'Happy New Year'. Pichai added, "His job is really cool, but he's cooler." He is set to appear via video conferencing on SRK's 'TED Talks India Nayi Soch' show.
