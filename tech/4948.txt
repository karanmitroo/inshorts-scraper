US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) wants video gamers to collectively develop and test strategies to control swarms of military drones. The program, called OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET), will make a physics-based, swarm tactics game, aiming to produce over a hundred tactics and manoeuvres to be used by systems of over a hundred unmanned air and ground drones.
