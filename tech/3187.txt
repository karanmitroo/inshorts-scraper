Reuben Paul, an 11-year-old Indian-origin boy, on Tuesday successfully hacked into the Bluetooth devices of cybersecurity experts at the World Forum in The Hague. Paul then controlled a Bluetooth-connected teddy bear via one of audience member's hacked phones to turn on the toy's lights and record a message. He demonstrated how Bluetooth-connected toys and devices can be hacked and "weaponised".
