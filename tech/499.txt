Researchers at a German research laboratory have developed a sensor-driven electronic 'skin' that can enable users to control objects or appliances with gestures. The thin foil, which sticks to the palm of the hand, allows users to control both virtual and physical objects using magnetic fields. Its sensors can also withstand bending, folding and stretching without losing their functionality.
