A team led by John Goodenough, co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery which is being used in home electronics and phones, has developed the first solid-electrolyte battery that could lead to safer, faster-charging batteries. The new noncombustible battery has a longer life, up to 3 times more energy density than current liquid-electrolyte Li-ion batteries and operates under 60ÂºC, researchers said.
