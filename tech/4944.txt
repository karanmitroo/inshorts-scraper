A proposed legislation in Germany would levy a ₹3.5 crore (€500,000) fine on Facebook and other social networks for failing to remove posts containing hate speech or fake news. "If, after appropriate examination, Facebook does not delete the offending message within 24 hours, it should expect individual fines of up to €500,000," said a German politician.
