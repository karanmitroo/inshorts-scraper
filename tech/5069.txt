Google has altered autocomplete suggestions in its search engine after it was alerted to sexist and racists entries. As per a recent report, Google's autocomplete suggested "evil" when searching for the phrases "are women" and "are Jews", while "are Muslims" still suggests "bad". Autocomplete predictions are generated based on users' search activity and interests, said a Google spokesperson.
