The world's first compact rotary 3D printer-cum-scanner, named Blacksmith Genesis, has been launched at the American Association Advancement of Science meeting in California (US). The $2,200 device, which was launched by Blacksmith Group start-up on Saturday, allows users to scan any item, and then edit the digitised model on the computer and print it out in 3D.
