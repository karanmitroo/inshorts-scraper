Consumer Reports, a non-profit organisation that evaluates products, has said that Samsung's Galaxy S7 Active is not actually water-resistant. Samsung had claimed that all its Galaxy S7 phones, including the S7 Active, are designed to survive in water for up to 30 minutes. Consumer Reports tested two handsets in water for 30 minutes which resulted in camera and screen damage.
