Yahoo has shut down its on-demand video streaming service Yahoo Screen, that was launched in 2013. Yahoo Screen featured 1,000 hours of content including both original programs and shows from established networks, but couldnâ€™t compete with giants like Netflix and Amazon. Its app has been removed from both the app stores, and its website now redirects users to Yahoo's homepage.
