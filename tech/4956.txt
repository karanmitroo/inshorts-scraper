US President-elect Donald Trump did not invite Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for a meeting of technology executives on Wednesday because the company is too small, said a Trump team spokesperson. Twitter's rejection of a deal with Trump's election campaign to create an emoji for 'Crooked Hillary' has also been cited as a possible reason for its exclusion from the meet.
