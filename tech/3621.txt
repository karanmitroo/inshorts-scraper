A 45-year-old Swiss man is facing defamation charges for 'liking' eight Facebook posts that accused an animal rights activist of racism and anti-Semitism. The prosecution claimed that by 'liking' the posts, he made the content visible to larger audience. Six years ago, a US prison guard was terminated for 'liking' Facebook page of the sheriff's opponent in a political race.
