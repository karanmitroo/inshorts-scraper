Mercedes-Benz is set to launch its cheapest luxury sedan, the much-awaited CLA Class, in India in January 2015. The car will be priced below Rs.30 lakhs, competing with the Audi A3 sedan, which is currently the most affordable luxury car in India. The CLA-Class will be powered by a 2.2-litre 4-cylinder, turbocharged diesel, and a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine.
