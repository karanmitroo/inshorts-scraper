In a move to bring Tweets to phones with no internet access, Twitter has tied up with Singapore based U2opia Mobile. The company, which has a similar tie-up with Facebook Inc, will start the service for Twitter in first quarter of 2014. Users would be required to dial a simple code to get a feed of Twitter's popular trending topics.
