Virgin Group Founder Richard Branson has said, "The next big thing... will be supersonic travel coming back and people travelling around the world in next to no time." Supersonic travel ended over a decade ago after Concorde, the first supersonic passenger-carrying commercial airplane, stopped operating. Branson added that the comeback will "hopefully" be relatively environment-friendly.
