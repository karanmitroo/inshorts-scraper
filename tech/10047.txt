A US court has ruled that Facebook can legally block content on its website "without any explanation". This came in response to a petition filed by a group 'Sikh for Justice' whose Facebook page was blocked for allegedly advocating Sikh separatism. The ruling stated that "internet service providers" like Facebook are protected from religiously discriminatory content posted by users.
