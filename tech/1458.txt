US-based researchers have developed an artificial pancreas system that uses a smartphone to automatically deliver insulin to the patient. The system consists of an insulin pump and a glucose monitor which is placed under a user's skin. The algorithm embedded in the Bluetooth-connected smartphone then signals how much insulin the pump should deliver based on data collected by the sensor.
