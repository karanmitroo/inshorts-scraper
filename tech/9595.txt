Fashion designer Danit Peleg has delivered a TED talk about her latest collection which she printed entirely on a home 3D printer. Peleg talked about experimenting with several filament materials before she found Filalex, which bent like real fabrics and was comfortable. Though 3D printing takes several hours currently, she anticipated the duration will reduce as technology advances.
