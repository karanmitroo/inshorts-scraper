The world’s first ever tweet was posted on March 21, 2006, by Twitter Co-founder Jack Dorsey. The tweet read, “just setting up my twttr”. Afer twelve minutes, Dorsey posted another tweet that read, “inviting coworkers”. Notably, the service was initially called Twttr, inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes.
