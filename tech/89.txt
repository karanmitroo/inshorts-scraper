Swedish scientists are working on technology to use artificial intelligence (AI) for making robot clones of dead people. They plan to use AI to reconstruct voices of people who are no longer alive which can complete tasks like answering questions about the weather. Funeral agency Fenix Begravning is looking for volunteers willing to use their dead relatives for the study.
