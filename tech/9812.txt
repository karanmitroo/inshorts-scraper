Apple is reportedly developing its own display screens to reduce its dependence on third-party suppliers like Samsung. The company has opened a “secret” laboratory in Taiwan where it is building “thinner, lighter, brighter and more energy-efficient” screens. This is expected to improve the battery life of Apple devices. Presently, the company designs its own chips for smartphones.
