Palmer Luckey, the Founder of virtual reality company Oculus VR, flew to Alaska on Saturday to personally deliver the first ever Rift VR headset. The hand-delivery was made to Ross Martin, the first person to have pre-ordered the device. Luckey also live-streamed the headset's delivery and unboxing on Facebook. Notably, the $599 device will officially start shipping on March 28.
