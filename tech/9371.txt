Japanese automotive manufacturer Mitsubishi has developed a new antenna called SeaAerial, that uses seawater instead of metallic conductors. The antenna shoots seawater aimed at the sky to transmit and receive radio-frequency waves. The setup also includes a special insulated nozzle that determines the ideal diameter of the jet of seawater which was able to achieve an efficiency of 70%.
