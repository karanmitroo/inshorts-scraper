Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has announced the launch of an e-publication, Wikitribune, in a bid to fight fake news. The site will have paid journalists working alongside voluntary contributors, who will together ensure that all news articles are supported by proper facts like full transcripts, video and audio of interviews. The free-to-access site will be crowd-funded.
