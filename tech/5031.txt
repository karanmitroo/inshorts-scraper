A new line of eating utensils, called Liftware, has been developed to help people with mobility-related disabilities. One of the products has sensors that detect unintended hand movements, balancing the tremors with complementary vibrations to keep the spoon level. The second design bends at the neck of the utensil, allowing for improved angling of the spoon.
