A man named Chris Kiley has posted a video on Facebook, showing him wearing a smoke-emitting Halloween costume made of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone boxes. "This Halloween I'm going as a fire hazard #note7 #note7recall #halloween," Kiley posted on Facebook. This comes after Samsung issued a global recall of its Note 7 smartphones over concerns of exploding batteries.
