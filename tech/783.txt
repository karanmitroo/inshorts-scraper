Chinese technology group LeEco's Founder Jia Yueting has been ordered to return to the country within a week to deal with the company's debts. The Chinese markets watchdog said LeEco's failure to repay debts is a violation of the legal rights and interests of listed companies and investors. Earlier, Yueting was placed on an official blacklist over unpaid debts.
