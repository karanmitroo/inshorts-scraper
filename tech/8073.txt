Samsung has developed 'Blind Cap', a smart cap with in-built vibration sensor that alerts paralympic swimmers when they need to turn and flip. The smart cap connects to a Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch or any Android smartphone through an app. A coach can alert the swimmer by tapping once on the smartwatch or the phone.
