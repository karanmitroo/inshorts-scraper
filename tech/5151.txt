Google Earth has launched a 'Timelapse' update that shows how the Earth has changed over the past 32 years from 1984 to 2016. To make the Timelapse, Google combined over 5 million satellite images acquired over the past three decades by five different satellites. The Timelapse may help scientists and researchers to detect changes on the planet's surface and climate.
