Apple has launched its voice-controlled wireless HomePod smart speaker, priced at $349 (about â‚¹22,200), which would rival Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant. Apple said the Siri-enabled HomePod can send messages, set a timer, play a podcast, check the news, sports, traffic, and weather. The online orders for the HomePod will begin from Friday in the US, the UK, and Australia.
