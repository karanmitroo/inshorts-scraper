NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has sent two new images of Saturn’s moon Dione in the best resolution ever, as it flew past 474 km above its surface. The images show the icy surface of the moon in the flyby that took place on August 17. This was Cassini’s fifth close encounter with Dione during its long tour at Saturn.
