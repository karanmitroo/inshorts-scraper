A collaboration between researchers from the University of Calgary, Dartmouth College and the University of Waterloo has led to the development of a working prototype of a smartwatch, named Doppio, featuring two touchscreen displays. One of the two displays can be completely detached from the wrist-bound screen and can be rearranged into multiple configurations as per the requirement.
