After receiving criticism for its newly introduced 'read receipts' feature from users around the world, WhatsApp has now updated the app with a new setting that lets users disable the 'blue ticks'. The updated WhatsApp app is not available on Google Play Store as yet. Android users can download the upgraded version of the app directly from the WhatsApp website.
