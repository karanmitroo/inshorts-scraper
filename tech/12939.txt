At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Sony Monday unveiled the Xperia Z1 Compact -- miniature version of its flagship Xperia Z1 smartphone that retains its high-end specifications. It packs the same waterproof, metal and glass design, Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB RAM and 20.7MP camera, but shrinks screen down to a much more manageable 4.3 inches with 720x1280 pixels.
