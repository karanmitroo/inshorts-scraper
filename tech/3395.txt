A BBC investigation with security researcher Scott Helme has revealed flaws in US-based startup Nomx's email service which it claims is the "world's most secure communications protocol." Helme claims the â‚¹12,800 device used by the service can be remotely hacked to take control of a user's email account. However, Nomx claimed the researcher's hack involved actions typical users wouldn't undertake.
