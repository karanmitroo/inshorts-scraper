China has banned internet users from posting user-generated audio or video, reportedly one of few sources of information outside state-controlled media. China already has one of the strictest censorship worldwide, ranking only behind countries like North Korea and Syria, according to reports. The ban comes after a draft law was passed, giving police censorship powers in case of natural disasters.
