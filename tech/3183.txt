Facebook has been fined $122 million by the European Union for providing misleading information about its purchase of messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. During WhatsApp's acquisition, Facebook said it could not automatically match user accounts on its platform. However, in 2016, Facebook updated its terms of service, raising the possibility of linking accounts from both platforms.
