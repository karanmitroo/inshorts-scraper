New York's Manhattan is testing a plan to replace outdated payphones or street phones installed on sidewalks into free of cost high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots by early next year. In the first phase of the plan, 7,500 payphones in New York will be replaced by Wi-Fi hotspots, new street phones with free calling facility and charging ports for personal mobile phones.
