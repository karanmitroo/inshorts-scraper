Dubai on Tuesday announced its plans to build the world's first office building using three-dimensional printer technology. A 2,000 square-foot office building and its furniture will be printed out layer by layer from a mixture of reinforced concrete, gypsum and plastic using a 20-foot tall 3-D printer. Neither the timeframe nor the cost has been made public.
