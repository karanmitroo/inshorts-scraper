A study by a Germany-based institute has reportedly found that the autopilot feature of Tesla Model S constitutes a "considerable traffic hazard." The study, however, was reported to be an internal one and did not represent final evaluation. Tesla CEO Musk responded by saying that reports were "not actually based on science," adding, "Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars."
