Technology giant Apple may reportedly redesign iPad in 2018 and replace the home button with Face ID introduced in iPhone X. The iPad, which will feature a display size "similar" to the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, will use the LCD instead of an OLED screen, according to the report. An Apple Pencil is also expected to launch alongside the updated tablet.
