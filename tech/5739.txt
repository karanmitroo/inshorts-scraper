Sequoia Capital-backed Indian smartphone maker Creo has completely stopped making smartphones, just six months after launching its first handset 'Mark 1'. The startup, which raised $3 million, has shifted its focus to building its operating system 'Fuel OS'. The startup reportedly sold around only 1,000 smartphones.
