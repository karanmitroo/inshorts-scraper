Scientists have developed a way to embroider circuits into fabrics with a precision of 0.1 mm, allowing clothes to gather, store and transmit digital information. Such e-textiles can lead to shirts that act as antennas for smartphones, workout clothes that monitor fitness levels, bandages that tell how well a wound is healing and caps that sense activity in the brain.
