Taiwan-based Minfort has developed MIN7, a speaker made entirely using recycled hardwood from old furniture. The $799 speaker features two four-inch woofers, a 5.25-inch subwoofer, two dome tweeters and two amplifier chips that power the 150 watt system. It also sports multiple inputs, a pair of gold-plated RCA cables and wireless connectivity through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
