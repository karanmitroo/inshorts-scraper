The US Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court ruling favouring Apple over Samsung in patent litigation and asked it to return the case to the trial court. Earlier, Samsung was ordered to pay Apple $930 million in the patent infringement case. Samsung appealed in the Supreme Court seeking a reduction in the compensation.
