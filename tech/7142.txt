Students at the National University of Singapore, including one of Indian origin, have built the world's lightest paraglider trike, weighing 49 kgs. Named 'The Delta', the one-seater paraglider trike can fly at a speed of up to 36 kmph. It can fly for 10 minutes on a single charge, enough to cover a distance of 6 km.
