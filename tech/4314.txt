A group of scientists have discovered a smiley face on a legal document dating back to 1635, which is being considered the world's oldest emoji. The document was found in a village next to the Strazov Mountains of Slovakia. Previously, the oldest known smiley face was believed to be discovered in a 1648 poem, 'To Fortune' by Robert Herrick.
