US-based developer Eight Team has designed a â‚¹65,400 smart mattress which monitors users' sleeping patterns and regulates bed temperature. The mattress contains sensors which are connected to an app called 'Eight' available both on iOS and Android. Users can create their own account on the Eight app to track sleep and manage bed side features.
