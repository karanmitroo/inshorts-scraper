French designers Philippe Starck and Jerome Olivet have created smartphone concept 'Alo' featuring a jelly-like translucent 'skin', which can repair itself automatically on being damaged. Alo, which is entirely operated by voice commands, projects messages or images in 3D holographic format instead of using a touchscreen. Further, its camera acts as an 'eye' to read texts or identify faces.
