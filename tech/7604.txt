Apple gifted rainbow-coloured Apple Watch bands to its employees who participated in San Francisco's annual LGBT-rights celebration parade on Sunday. The bands were accompanied by a note that read, "This limited-edition band is a symbol of our commitment to equality and we hope you'll wear it with pride." However, Apple didn't clarify if the bands will be sold commercially.
