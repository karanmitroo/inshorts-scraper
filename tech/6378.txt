An American woman has filed a class action lawsuit against sex toy maker Standard Innovation for tracking activity data like the intensity, mode and time of use of their 'We-Vibe 4 Plus' vibrators. The woman claims the company shows a "wholesale disregard" for privacy rights. A hacking duo had earlier revealed concerns related to the vibrator's privacy at a conference.
