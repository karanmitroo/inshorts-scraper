Google has introduced 'Reviews from the webâ€™ feature for mobile and desktop which will show user ratings from three review sites directly on the Search page. This feature will help users to view ratings given by other users without going to different websites. Previously, when users searched for local places like shops and restaurants, only critic reviews were displayed.
