Dubai Airports, which manages both the Dubai International and Al Maktoum International airports, has launched the world's fastest free Wi-Fi service across its terminals with speeds up to 100 Mbps. Called the 'WOW-Fi', the service provides Wi-Fi speed about ten times faster than many households have in the UAE. Free unlimited Wi-Fi at Dubai airports was launched in December 2016.
