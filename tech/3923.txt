MIT researchers are developing a feedback system that enables people to correct robot mistakes using just brain signals. Using EEG monitor data, that records brain activity, the system detects if a person notices an error as a robot performs an object-sorting task. The system could be developed for driverless cars, to supervise factory robots, and aid speech-impaired people, researchers said.
