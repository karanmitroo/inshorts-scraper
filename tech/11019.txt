The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will provide navigational support to Indian Railways through its indigenously developed 'GAGAN' (GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation) system. GAGAN, which was initially developed to help aircraft land accurately, will help start a train's hooter when it comes near an unmanned crossing, thereby reducing the number of accidents at such locations.
