SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Friday said that the booster Falcon 9 rocket is in good shape and is ready for another launch. The reusable rocket successfully landed back on EarthÂ last month in Cape Canaveral after putting 11 small data-relay satellites in orbit. SpaceX aims at reusing rockets to reduce the overall cost of spaceflight.
