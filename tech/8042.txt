Google on Wednesday announced Android Wear 2.0, the next version of its Android OS for smartwatches. It will come with three new messaging features â€“ a full keyboard, handwriting recognition and smart replies. The release will also have the fitness-focused 'activity recognition API', that will identify what the user's body is doing and launch appropriate apps to track their activity.
