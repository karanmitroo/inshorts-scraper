The US energy regulator has approved an application made by Apple's energy subsidiary to sell electricity in wholesale markets around the country at market rates. Apple said the renewable energy generated at its 130-megawatt solar farm in California could power 60,000 homes. Apple also owns a 20-megawatt facility in Nevada and a 50-megawatt facility in Arizona.
