Aiming to provide cities with street-level internet connectivity, Facebook has announced a project called Terragraph. It is an antenna-based Wi-Fi delivery system that equips street lights and traffic signals with antennas that can deliver transmission rates up to 7 Gbps. Terragraph will use a 60 GHz frequency to deliver connectivity and the signal can travel about 200 to 250 meters.
