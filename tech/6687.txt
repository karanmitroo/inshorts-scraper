A Belgian school headmaster Aveline Gregoire has created a Pok√©mon Go inspired online book hunting game which is played through a Facebook group called 'Chasseurs de livres' (Book hunters). Over 40,000 players post pictures and hints about where books are hidden across Belgium for others to find them. Once someone has finished reading, books are "released" back into the wild.
