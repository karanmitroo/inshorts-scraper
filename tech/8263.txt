A France-based startup has developed 'iBubble', a $1299 autonomous camera-enabled drone that lets users shoot underwater footage. Controlled through a connected bracelet, the drone combines two 1,000 lumen lights, image stabilisation system and professional grade camera movements and angles. It also comes with manual mode and lasts for one hour in single charge.
