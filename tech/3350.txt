Japanese automaker Nissan has developed an armrest compartment for its cars that will prevent distractions from smartphones. The armrest creates a 'silent zone' that blocks the phone's incoming and outgoing cellular, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connections. The compartment works on the principle of a Faraday cage which uses materials like wire mesh to shield its contents from electromagnetic fields.
