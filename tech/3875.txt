Google spinoff Waymo has formally asked a judge to block Uber from operating its autonomous vehicles while the legal case between the two is ongoing. According to the lawsuit filed last month, ex-Google employee Anthony Levandowski stole over 14,000 files from Waymo and used the stolen technology to start a new self-driving startup called Otto, which was bought by Uber.
