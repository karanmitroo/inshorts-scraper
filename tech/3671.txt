A Swedish man put his browser history on sale to protest against a bill passed in the US which allows internet service providers to sell users' browsing history without their consent. "It's now time to sell this, before anyone else does it... My browser history consists of funny, dumb, mildly interesting, smart, important and semi-NSFW pages," he wrote.
