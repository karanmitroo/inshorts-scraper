A German startup has created a hand-sized washing device 'Dolfi', that cleans clothes by using ultrasonic technology. The electricity-run device needs to be dropped in a sink filled with water between dirty clothes soaked in detergent and water. Priced at $109, the device cleans the clothes in 30-40 minutes and claims to consume 80% less energy than a washing machine.
