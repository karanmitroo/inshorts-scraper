NASA has released a video of Hurricane Patricia taken from the International Space Station. It shows the storm spread across the Pacific with no exact end in sight. Reportedly, the strongest eastern north pacific hurricane on record with wind speeds reaching up to 200 miles per hour, Patricia made a landfall with the Mexican coast on Friday.
