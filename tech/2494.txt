Twitter said it is taking action against 10 times more users for being abusive compared to a year ago. The action includes warning a user, temporarily limiting a userâ€™s reach, or suspending them altogether. "Making Twitter a safer place is our primary focus and we are now moving with more urgency than ever," tweeted Twitter's General Manager of Consumer Product.
