German researchers have developed earbuds that let users perform actions like playing/pausing music, accepting a call or opening a text simply by smiling, winking, opening their mouth or even making a "shh" sound. The earbuds are fitted with electrodes that can detect changes in the electrical fields inside users' ear canal when they make different faces.
