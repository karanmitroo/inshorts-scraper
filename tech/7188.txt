Hyperloop One on Wednesday announced the opening of its first manufacturing plant in Nevada, US. Called Hyperloop One Metalworks, the 1,05,000 square-foot building will be used to build and test components for a full-system Hyperloop prototype, for testing in 2017. Elon Musk's brainchild Hyperloop, if successful, could reduce travel time between Helsinki and Stockholm (483 km) to 30 minutes.
