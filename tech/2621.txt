Facebook on Friday unveiled plans to build 'Willow Campus', its new campus in the US which will have a grocery store, a pharmacy and 1,500 houses by 2021. More than 200 of these houses will be rented at below-market rates. All of the campus, which Facebook calls a 'mixed-use village', will be open to the public.
