H-Bots Robotics, a startup from Telangana's T-Hub incubator, is developing 'police robots' priced at about ₹3.5 lakh, while similar robots in countries like Dubai cost ₹23 lakh each. The first set of H-Bots' robots could reportedly be deployed to manage traffic by December in Hyderabad. The robots will be able to register complaints, detect bombs, and recognise missing persons.
