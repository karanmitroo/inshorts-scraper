The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the government, Facebook, WhatsApp, and telecom regulator TRAI over a plea that sought government regulation of online messaging services. The plea alleged the social networking sites compromise the privacy of interpersonal communication of over 15 crore people in the country. The court has further sought replies to these notices within two weeks.
