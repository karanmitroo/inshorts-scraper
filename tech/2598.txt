Microsoft has announced a project that will utilise unused spectrum between TV channels called 'white spaces' to offer broadband internet to rural communities in the US. Compared to WiFi, white space broadband can reach much further with lower power requirements and the frequencies can penetrate obstacles like concrete walls. Microsoft will reportedly invest $10 billion in the project.
