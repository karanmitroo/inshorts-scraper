Facebook Inc launched a new feature on Wednesday that was oriented towards business-customer interactions. The advertisements on the social network’s feed will now have a “send message” button that will allow customers to directly send a private message to the business concerned. Also, business owners will be able to privately contact the customers who post on their official Facebook page.
