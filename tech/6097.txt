The New York's public library has installed a $2.6 million delivery system or 'book train', which delivers books within five minutes once a request is placed. It consists of 24 cars that run on 950 feet-long track to bring books from a storage facility located two floors down. Earlier, it took the library 45 minutes to deliver a book.
