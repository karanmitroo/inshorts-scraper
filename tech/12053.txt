A study has revealed that teenagers are spending more time on instant messaging apps than on Facebook. The research involved 1,70,000 internet users from across 32 countries and nearly 66 percent of teenagers (aged 16-19) in the US and Britain said they were using Facebook less frequently. While the teenagers are not off the social-networking-site completely, the interactions have dropped.
