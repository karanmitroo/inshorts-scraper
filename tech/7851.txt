Russian developer VisionLabs has created an open source computer vision platform, in collaboration with Facebook and Google, that acts as a teaching machine and enables the machines to "see". For this, VisionLabs integrated two libraries â€“ OpenCV, which is a library of programming functions aimed at real-time computer vision, and Torch, which offers several algorithms for deep machine learning.
