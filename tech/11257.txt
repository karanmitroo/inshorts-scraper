To make online shopping more convenient, Google is reportedly working on a feature called 'buy buttons' that allows users to buy items right from the search results page on their mobile device. The ‘buy buttons’ will be listed alongside the ads Google puts above its normal search results. The sponsored top results will then redirect users to the purchasing page.
