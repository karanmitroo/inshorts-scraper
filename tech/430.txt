Former Google engineer Steve Yegge has cited the technology giant's inability to innovate as the main reason for quitting after 13 years. He wrote the company "fears risk-taking, protecting what they have got" while being "arrogant" and "mired in politics", which is inevitable for a large company. Yegge also alleged that Google had become "100% competitor-focussed rather than customer-focussed".
