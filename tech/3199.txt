Technology major Microsoft's President Brad Smith on Sunday blamed the US National Security Agency (NSA) for ransomware 'WannaCry' attack that hit 150 nations. "The exploits used in the attack were drawn from the exploits stolen from the NSA," he said. "This attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem," added Smith.
