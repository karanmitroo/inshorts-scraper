Microsoft has paid $10,000 in compensation to a California woman after an automatic Windows 10 update failed to install on her Windows 7 computer. The woman sued Microsoft for the failed update that made her computer unstable and often unresponsive. "I had never heard of Windows 10. Nobody ever asked me if I wanted to update," said the customer.
