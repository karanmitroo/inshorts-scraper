Nintendo had to ban Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak from submitting his Tetris score to Nintendo Power magazine in 1988, as he would top the listings every month. The company, which was founded on September 23, 1889, reportedly wanted fresh names and did not accept Wozniak's submissions. Wozniak interestingly submitted his next entry as 'Evets Kainzow', his name spelled backwards.
