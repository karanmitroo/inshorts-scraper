Swedish startup Wheelys is launching a 24x7 open self-driving store called 'Moby Mart' in China's Shanghai. The store uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to navigate streets and carries items like fresh food, sneakers and magazines. Users will need to scan the items they're taking, and an app will deduct the amount from users' account when they leave the store.
