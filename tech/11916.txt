Airtel Monday rolled back its decision to charge standard data rates for making voice calls over the internet. "In view of the news reports that a consultation paper will be issued shortly by TRAI on issues relating to services offered by OTT players, including VoIP, we have decided not to implement our proposed launch of VoIP packs," Airtel said.
