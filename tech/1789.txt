Vendors on Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao are selling face masks to prevent misuse of iPhone X's Face ID feature. The masks are being marketed as 'protective' gear to people who think somebody will unlock their iPhone X while they are asleep. While some mask styles cover just the eyes, others cover the whole face except mouth.
