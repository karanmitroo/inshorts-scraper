Apple this week removed various Iranian apps from its App Store following the US sanctions which prohibit it to do business with app developers in Iran. Notably, Apple doesn't officially offer a version of its App Store in Iran and most iPhones are believed to have been smuggled into the country. The removed apps included Snapp, an Uber-like ride-hailing app.
