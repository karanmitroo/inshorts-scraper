Chinese company KatVR has developed the Kat Walk, an omni-directional treadmill device that captures real world movement and maps it into virtual reality (VR). Priced around $9,000, the setup consists of a harness around a player's waist to keep them upright, sensor-fitted shoes and a plastic walking pad, and works with VR headsets like the Oculus Rift.
