US-based startup Impossible Foods has raised $75 million (about â‚¹478 crore) in Series E funding round led by Singapore-based venture fund Temasek to make vegetarian 'beef' burgers. Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures also participated in the round. The burgers are made with a plant-based protein called heme, which makes them look and taste 'meaty'.
