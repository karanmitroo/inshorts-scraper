US Consumer Product Safety Commission on Wednesday posted a recall notice of around 10,200 Galaxy Note 4 batteries due to fire risk. Only phones refurbished through AT&T's insurance program and handled by FedEx Supply Chain were impacted by the recall due to use of counterfeit batteries. All of these phones were distributed between December 2016 and April 2017.
