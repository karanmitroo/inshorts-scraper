Google on Thursday rejected charges by the European Union of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking advertising rivals and said that the case "lacks evidence". The technology giant's response comes six years after EU opened the investigation prompted by complaints from Google's rivals like Microsoft. If found guilty of breaching EU rules, Google might be fined $7.4 billion.
