A driverless shuttle bus made by French startup Navya crashed into a truck on first day of service in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The crash was the truck driver's fault and none of the passengers were injured, according to city officials. The 8-seater electric bus does not have a steering wheel or brake pedals and uses GPS to drive around.
