The Minnesota Court of Appeals has upheld that an order requiring a man to provide his fingerprint to unlock his smartphone was constitutional. The court ruled that the Fifth Amendment as per US' constitution that protects individuals from incriminating themselves does not apply in this case. Providing the fingerprint was likened to furnishing a blood sample or providing handwriting samples.
