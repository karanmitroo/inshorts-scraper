Japanese gaming company Nintendo has unveiled do-it-yourself (DIY) cardboard accessories which interact with the company's gaming system Switch. For example, a user can build a 13-key piano and a motion-sensing camera will detect the user's hand movements to play music. The cardboard toys can then be used as a gaming accessory for Switch's console.
