A newlywed couple has taken their wedding photos at the only Apple store in Singapore. Thirty-four-year-old Jermyn Wee and 31-year-old Chia Suat Huang visited the store on the day of their wedding. They walked down an "aisle" of display tables with Apple products on them, while people cheered and clapped.
