Paris on Monday began experimenting with two driverless electric buses called 'EZ10' to curb congestion and pollution in the city. The GPS-guided shuttle, which can carry up to six passengers, will be tested until early April between Paris' Lyon and Austerlitz stations. The city also introduced a colour-coded sticker scheme to restrict cars entering the city centre.
