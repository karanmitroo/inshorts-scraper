Dallas Police Chief David Brown revealed on Friday that the police force used a remotely controlled bomb-defusing robot to kill a suspect in the recent Dallas shooting that killed five policemen. The police attached an explosive to the robot's arm extension, in what is possibly the first example of the American police using a robot to kill a suspect.
