Microsoft has been sued by two former employees who monitored and reported content like child sexual abuse and murders over claims that they developed post-traumatic stress disorder. Apart from symptoms like anxiety and depression, one employee claims he is unable to be around computers or children. The suit accuses Microsoft of providing an unqualified therapist to treat them.
