A recently surfaced image on Twitter shows that search giant Google blurred the face of a cow in Cambridge to protect the privacy for images on its Street View in 2015. Responding to the image, a Google spokesperson said, "Our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous." The image has been retweeted over 10,000 times, followed by cow jokes.
