Researchers at the University of Central Florida have developed an anti-glare film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. The coating is inspired by the nanostructures that cover moth eyes and prevent light from reflecting off them. The flexible, self-cleaning coating increases readability by up to 10 times in different lighting conditions.
