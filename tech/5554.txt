Technology giant Apple's Chief Design Officer Jonathan Ive while talking about the possibility of a touchscreen on the Mac in a recent interview said, "We just didn’t feel that the Mac was the right place for multitouch...It wasn’t particularly useful or an appropriate application of multitouch". Notably, Apple's new MacBook Pro laps have a multitouch 'Touch Bar' on the keyboard.
