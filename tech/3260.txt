A glitch in Google Maps recently led hundreds of tourists in Norway to a random town instead of the Preikestolen cliffs they were looking for. The town was 30 kilometres away from the tourists' destination. According to reports, the glitch often keeps leading people looking for the cliff to the town. Google has said it is looking into the issue.
