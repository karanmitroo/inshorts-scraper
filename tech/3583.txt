Fast food chain McDonald's has reportedly started a "Snaplications" campaign in Australia to hire new recruits. Job seekers are required to send a 10-second video application using a McDonald's-themed filter on the photo messaging app. McDonald's then reviews the video and sends the person a link to an online application form.
