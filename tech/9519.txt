US-based Hyatt Hotels Corporation on Friday confirmed that a malware affected 318 of their hotels, allowing "unauthorised access" to the names, numbers and expiry dates of their customers' credit cards. Hyatt had previously revealed that their payment processing system was attacked by a malware last year. The company has urged its customers to review their payment card account statements closely.
