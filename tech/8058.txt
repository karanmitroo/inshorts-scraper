According to a Bloomberg report, micro-blogging platform Twitter may stop counting photos and links as part of its 140-character limit for tweets in the next two weeks. After automatically being shortened by Twitter, links currently take up 23 characters in a tweet. The company earlier this year considered raising a tweet's limit to 10,000 characters.
