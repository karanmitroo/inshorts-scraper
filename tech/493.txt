Delhi-based security researcher Karan Saini has discovered a bug in Uber app that can allow an attacker to access user accounts by bypassing its two-factor authentication. Saini filed a report with HackerOne, which administers Uber's bug bounty but it was reportedly rejected. Uber has not warranted an immediate action and reportedly said the bug "is not a particularly severe" issue.
