Airbus Group's CEO Tom Enders on Monday said that the company plans to start testing its 'Project Vahana' self-piloting flying cars by the end of the year. The single-passenger autonomous concept has been designed to decongest urban cities. The company aims to make the aircraft production-ready for short trips by 2021.
