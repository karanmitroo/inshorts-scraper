A team of astronomers Tuesday reported that they have discovered the most distant galaxy ever known, EGS-zs8-1, which is 13 billion light-years from Earth. The discovery was published in The Astrophysical Journal by Pascal Oesch of Yale University and his colleagues. Other galaxies may probably lie at further distances, but researchers are unable to measure their exact distance, Pascal said.
