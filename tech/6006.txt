Social networking giant Facebook has launched a dedicated 'Events' app on iOS for browsing and searching for events going on nearby. The app can link with calendars from the smartphone to enable users to see their plans in one place. Facebook's core app will still offer its Events feature, so users will not be forced to switch like with Messenger.
