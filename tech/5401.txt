A hedgehog owner has successfully made an iPhone to recognise his pet's paw instead of a human fingerprint to complete the unlocking process. The owner put the hedgehog's paw through an iPhone's 'Touch ID' or the fingerprint recognition process, where samples of a fingerprint are taken to unlock the device through the Home button.
