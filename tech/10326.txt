NASA has released over 8,400 ultra high-resolution images from its moon missions on Flickr, which were reportedly taken by Apollo astronauts on their lunar missions with Hasselblad cameras. These images were preserved and digitised under a project named Project Apollo Archive, and will be used as an online reference source for the moon landing program.
