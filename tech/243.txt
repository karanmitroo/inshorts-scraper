Android Co-founder Andy Rubin's smartphone manufacturing startup Essential shipped only 88,000 phones in six months since its launch, according to research firm IDC. Earlier, the startup also cut the price of its smartphone from $699 (₹44,800) to $499 (₹32,000). Last year, Essential was sued by Nest Co-founder Tony Fadell-backed startup Keyssa for stealing its wireless connector technology.
