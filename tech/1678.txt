The government has announced that people tampering with the 15-digit International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number of mobile devices will face a jail term of up to 3 years. This reportedly is expected to make tracking of lost mobile phones easier. The new rules also bar people from knowingly using mobiles with tampered IMEI numbers.
