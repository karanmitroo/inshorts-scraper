Digital currency Bitcoin has jumped to a three-year high of $1,219.24 amid speculations that the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in US will receive regulatory approval. This comes after a volatile start of the year, when Bitcoin surged over 20%. The currency then plunged 35% after China warned domestic Bitcoin exchanges that they risk being closed if they violate currency regulations.
