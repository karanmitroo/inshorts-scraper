Apple is reportedly looking to build Google Glass-like digital glasses that would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearerâ€™s field of vision, and may use Augmented Reality. Apple has also ordered small quantities of near-eye displays for testing. If Apple decides to go ahead with the new product, it would be launched in 2018.
