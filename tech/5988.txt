American multinational conglomerate General Electric has presented its new methane-sniffing helicopter drone called 'Raven', capable of detecting gas leaks from oil wells. GE created the Raven specifically to save oil and natural gas firms money and to help them assess all the data gathered from their facilities. According to the company, the drone can make gas inspections three times faster.
