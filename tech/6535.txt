Washington-based game studio Holospark has released 'The Impossible Travel Agency', a virtual reality experience that responds to music chosen by the user. The app's visuals include flowers that change colour like a music visualiser, and lightning that strikes based on the song's beat and pitch. The experience also matches the duration of the user-chosen soundtrack.
