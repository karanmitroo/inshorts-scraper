Quantum entanglement—the process by which particles, despite being away from each other, are inextricably linked– was recently achieved at room temperature by researchers from the University of Chicago. The process is usually done at extremely low temperatures. This can be used to create unbeatable encryption, building quantum computers at a lower cost as the cost of cooling systems is eradicated.
