Construction of the world's first 3D printed village began in Italy last month, with the world's largest 3D printer, the BigDelta, building a hut. The 3D printer used a mixture of straw and clay to build the house in Shamballa village. The village reportedly aims to show that 3D printing can be used to build homes in poor areas.
