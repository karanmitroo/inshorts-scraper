Qualcomm, along with NASSCOM, on Tuesday launched its ‘Design in India’ initiative aimed at encouraging indigenous hardware designs. Under this, companies will be given a year for demonstrating hardware designs in smartphone, tablet and Internet of Everything domains. Qualcomm will then give select companies a funding of $10,000 each and an opportunity to work at its Innovation Lab in Bangalore.
