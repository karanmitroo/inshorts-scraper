US-based startup Adoptly has created a smartphone app that lets prospective parents use a Tinder-like interface to swipe left or right on pictures of children up for adoption. Adoptly lets users filter adoptable children by age, race and gender among other characteristics. The startup also requires the parents to undergo background checks.
