Moto G's 16GB version, priced at Rs.13,999, was sold out in the first 15 minutes of the launch on Feb-6, said Flipkart CEO Sachin Bansal, adding that the site went down for a couple of minutes due to traffic. Experts say MotoG is getting very good response with some 20,000 units being sold out on Flipkart within hours of launch.
