Photo-sharing app Snapchat on Wednesday announced it will launch original scripted shows by the end of this year. Snapchat's Vice President Nick Bell said that the company would create short scripted Snapchat series that are three to five minutes long. Snapchat also launched a short-lived original scripted show in 2015 consisting of nine episodes of roughly five minutes.
