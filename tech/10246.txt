According to a study by NASAâ€™s Hubble Space Telescope and the Kepler Space Observatory, 92% of potentially habitable planets are yet to be born in the universe. Only 8% of such planets existed when the solar system was born 4.6 billion years ago. The study also suggests the existence of one billion Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way at present.
