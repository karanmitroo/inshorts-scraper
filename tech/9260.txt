Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Urban Development Ministry will launch a mobile app by April where citizens can complain about garbage pile-ups. Named 'Swachh City Solutions', the app will also allow citizens to view city-wise cleanliness rankings and up-vote other complaints to show support. It will be developed along with Bengaluru-based NGO Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy.
