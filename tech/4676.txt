A US-based startup has created 'Reliefband Neurowave', a wristband that claims to provide relief from nausea and vomiting caused by morning sickness and motion sickness, priced at about â‚¹10,200. The device applies pulses with specific waveforms, frequency and intensity to modulate the median nerve on the underside of the wrist to block the waves of nausea produced by the stomach.
