Indie band Drive like Maria recently released its new music video 'Deep Blue' which has been made entirely using the Prisma photo editing app. As Prisma does not support video editing yet, the band edited the video frame by frame, which resulted in 1,828 images. Three people including the band's lead singer took five hours each to edit the images.
