Following Apple's $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm for charging excessive royalties, the chipmaker is suing four manufacturers of iPhones and iPads for failing to pay the royalties. Apple has said it won't let manufacturers make payments until the dispute is resolved. Qualcomm owns patents on fundamental technology, allowing it to collect royalties even on smartphones that don't have its chips.
