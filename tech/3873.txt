California-based startup Smart Bike has created 'Hexagon', a camera that allows bicycle riders to use their smartphone as a rearview mirror. Hexagon, which also has flashing turn indicators, streams a live video of the traffic behind the bike to a connected smartphone. Further, the handlebar mount for the smartphone has a 6,000 Ah power bank.
