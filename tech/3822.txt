Google has partnered with two trekkers to capture images of an active volcano at an island off the Australian coast. The activity would allow viewers to experience the volcano and its surroundings using Google Maps. "I hope that by putting this place on the map people will realize what a beautiful world we live in", said one of the trekkers.
