Whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks' website on Thursday morning was hacked by the hacking group OurMine. The website displayed a message that read, "Wikileaks, remember when you challenged us to hack you?". The message was visible when the site was accessed from some locations. Notably, OurMine group previously hacked Twitter accounts of Mark Zuckerberg, and Wikipedia Co-founder Jimmy Wales.
