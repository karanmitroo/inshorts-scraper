Googleâ€™s first social networking site Orkut closed down Tuesday (Sept 30), as it failed to take off due to tough competition from rival services like Facebook and Twitter. Although, Orkut will preserve an archive of all its "communities" that will be available from Sept 30. The social networking site was launched in early 2004, the year when Facebook was founded.
