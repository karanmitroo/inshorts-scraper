A Florida-based startup has unveiled the 'Nervana' headphones with a generator, priced at $279, that stimulates nerves in the ear to "increase calm and reduce stress". Electric pulses are delivered through one of the headphones to trigger the release of feel-good hormones. The Nervana Generator reportedly analyses the music to synchronise the nerve stimulation with sound.
