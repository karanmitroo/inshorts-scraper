Astronomers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have used the Gemini Planet Imager to discover a planet 100 light-years away, which resembles an infant version of Jupiter. Called '51 Eridani b', the planet is only 20 million years old. It has the strongest methane signature ever detected on an alien planet. Water was also detected on 51 Eridani b.
