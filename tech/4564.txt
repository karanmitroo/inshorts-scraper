A patent application by Microsoft shows tablets that can be folded into the form of a smartphone. Diagrams in the patent detail a device with flexible hinges that can be laid flat, folded once or even be used in 'tent mode' like Lenovo's Yoga tablets. Other technology companies including Samsung and LG have also applied for similar patents.
