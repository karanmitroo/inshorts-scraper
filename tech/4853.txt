South Korean electronics company LG has announced Bluetooth-connected speakers that float in the air using electromagnets. The 'Levitating Portable Speaker' is claimed to provide 360-degree sound and a 10-hour battery life. When it runs out of battery, the water resistant floating unit will automatically descend to the base station to recharge itself.
