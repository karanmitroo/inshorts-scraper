A user in Germany has uploaded a Facebook post claiming that his Amazon Alexa smart speaker switched on automatically to play loud music at night while he was away. The neighbours had to call the police who broke into the apartment to unplug the speaker, the post read. However, Amazon has not made any comment on the incident yet.
