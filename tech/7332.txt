Brazil forward Neymar lost Mark Zuckerberg’s keepie-uppie challenge on Facebook's messenger, scoring 29. Zuckerberg, who scored 37 in the mobile game which requires the player to keep the ball in air by tapping, had challenged Neymar to beat his score. Neymar further challenged F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, besides asking Zuckerberg to “play it out for real on the field”.
