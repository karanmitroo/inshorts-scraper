The smartphone app 'Send Me to Heaven', where the goal is to throw your phone as high as possible and then catch it, was created to have people shatter iPhones, its creator Petr Svarovsky had said. The idea was to get people with "very expensive gadgets" to throw these, he added. The app is now banned from the App Store.
