Music publisher Kobalt has launched a new app called 'Kobalt App', which lets songwriters and singers get real time information about the money they're making across all types of incomes. Singers can access data on broadcast, streaming, download and other incomes of their songs individually. Further, the app also lets singers track how their music is being used on YouTube.
