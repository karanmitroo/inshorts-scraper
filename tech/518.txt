WhatsApp Co-founder Jan Koum has revealed that he was in a conference room with lawyers for "three days straight" while signing the deal with Facebook for the messaging app's acquisition. "We didn't sleep a whole lot," and ate junk food during the negotiating week, Koum highlighted. Founded in 2009, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion.
