Apple CEO Tim Cook on Sunday took to Twitter to announce his support for 'Dreamers'. "250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals," Cook tweeted. Dreamers are the undocumented young immigrants in the US who are currently protected from the threat of deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme.
