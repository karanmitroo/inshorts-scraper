Verizon on Thursday said it has "reasonable basis" to believe that the hack of 50 crore Yahoo email accounts could allow it to withdraw from its deal to buy the technology company. Verizon claimed it hadn't been informed of the breach at the time of the deal. The telco announced its acquisition of Yahoo for $4.8 billion in July 2016.
