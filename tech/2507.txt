Facebook-owned WhatsApp has been partially blocked in China following a censorship crackdown by the government. Users complained of being unable to send photos, videos, and voice notes and a few people have reportedly been blocked from sending even text messages. China operates world's largest censorship system, called the 'Great Firewall', blocking platforms like Facebook, Google, and Instagram.
