Norman Joseph Woodland, co-inventor of the barcode, got the idea for the sorting technology while sitting on Miami beach in 1949. While running his fingers through sand creating lines, the inventor realised that it would be possible to encode information using simple lines on paper, similar to Morse code. September 6 marks Woodland's 95th birth anniversary.
