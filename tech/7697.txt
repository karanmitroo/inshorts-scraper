French firm Cooltech Applications has launched what it claims as the world's first commercially available magnetic refrigeration system. It achieves refrigeration by passing a water coolant through magnetocaloric materials undergoing repeated magnetization-demagnetization cycles. The system works without any refrigerant gas, making it more environmentally efficient than conventional refrigerators.
