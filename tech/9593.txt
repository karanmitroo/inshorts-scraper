California-based MatterHackers on Friday officially launched a new 10-inch android powered tablet called MatterControl Touch T10, that can enable its users to create, edit, and prepare 3D models directly from a printer. The WiFi-enabled device will provide access to designs through a cloud-based library and will also feature a camera to monitor the progress, using a mobile device.
