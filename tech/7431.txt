Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel have developed a carbon electrode that can be placed on the skin as a temporary electronic 'tattoo' to measure facial muscle and nerve activity. The device can be used to help restore damaged tissues and also study emotional responses by tracking facial expressions through the facial muscles' electrical signals, researchers said.
