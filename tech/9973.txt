The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Google, accusing them of spying on students' online behaviour without their consent. However, a Google representative stated that their tools follow the Student Privacy Pledge. Reportedly, the firm is now working on disabling Chromebook's Chrome Sync feature which tracks browsing activities.
