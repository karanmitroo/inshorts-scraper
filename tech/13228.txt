Chaos Computing Club, a group of German-hackers, claimed to have cracked the iPhone fingerprint-scanner, only 2-days after Apple launched the technology. The group posted a video on its website that appeared to show somebody accessing an iPhone 5S with a fabricated print. Apple representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
