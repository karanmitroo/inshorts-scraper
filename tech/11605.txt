American whistleblower Edward Snowden has issued a 'call to arms' for tech companies to counter US snooping with better privacy tools. In a streamed question-and-answer session with about two dozen people from a privacy and technology background, Snowden criticised the US policies and encouraged companies to adopt more secure technology focussing on end-to-end encryption.
