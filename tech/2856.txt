Former Apple Senior Vice President of iOS Scott Forstall recently recollected an incident where he was discussing how to price an upcoming Mac computer with Steve Jobs. Jobs complained that Forstall's suggested price was too low, to which Forstall responded with "You're a billionaire, you don't understand." After a pause, Steve Jobs said, "I'm a multi-billionaire."
