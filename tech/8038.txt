A group of researchers from the University of Bristol have created a prototype of a reconfigurable Rubik's cube-like modular touchscreen display, dubbed the Cubimorph. The device features a single display built out of smaller six-sided display cubes which are connected together through turntable-mounted hinges, allowing its users to reposition the cubes to get the required configuration.
