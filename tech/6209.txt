Italy-based startup Glauco has developed a battery-powered personal flight system called 'Revolt'. The machine consists of a harness up front and four propellers in the rear, and is portable enough to fit in a small car. Launched on Kickstarter, the system is reported to deliver 90 kg of thrust, delivering performance equivalent to a 250 cc petrol engine.
