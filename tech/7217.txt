Adobe Research collaborated with Nvidia for 'Project Wetbrush' which the two companies describe as the "world's first real-time simulation-based 3D painting system". The companies developed a software that lets artists draw on 2D surfaces with virtual 3D paint. The software simulates real-world brush strokes, speed and angle, and takes into account drying time based on the thickness of the paint.
