Bengaluru-based engineers Ravi Pratap Maddimsetty and Sharath Potharaju have created an app, called ‘WiFire’, that automatically connects a smartphone to any free WiFi network present in proximity. Currently available on the Android platform, ‘WiFire’ functions in Bengaluru and is being tested in other cities. It also sends notifications whenever free WiFi-hotspots are available for connecting.
