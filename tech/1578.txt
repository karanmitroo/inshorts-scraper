US-based researchers have developed a computer security system using heart's dimensions as the identifier, which they describe as safer, more effective alternative to passwords and other biometrics. The system needs about 8 seconds to scan a heart the first time, and thereafter it can continuously recognise that heart. "No two people with identical hearts have ever been found," said researchers.
