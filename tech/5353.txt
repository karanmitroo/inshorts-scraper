The Fox Innovation Lab, along with The Virtual Reality Company, has launched 'The Martian VR Experience', an immersive experience designed for PlayStation Virtual Reality (VR) and HTC Vive headsets, based on the 2015 science fiction film 'The Martian'. Users can re-enact Matt Damon's adventures as he travels through space, explores the Mars terrain and operates survival equipment.
