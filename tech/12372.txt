Search giant Google Thursday announced that its advanced-research arm, Google X, is developing a system of airborne drones to deliver goods. These planes have much more in common with the Google self-driving car and are capable of flying pre-programmed routes. The company has been quietly developing its drone project since 2011. Amazon had recently announced a similar scheme.
