Facebook has said it removes roughly 66,000 posts identified as hate speech per week. "Our definition of hate speech is anything that directly attacks...race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation...," the company said. Facebook is exploring the possibility of using artificial intelligence to filter out hate speech, but currently relies on users reporting such posts.
