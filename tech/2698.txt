Social media platform Facebook has started rolling out its 'Find Wi-Fi' feature globally which lets mobile users find Wi-Fi networks close to their location. However, the feature requires businesses to claim their network so that Facebook can show it on a map. Facebook claims the 'Find Wi-Fi' tool will help travellers, especially in areas where cellular data is scarce.
