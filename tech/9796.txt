Online streaming media provider, Netflix has developed a new sensor-fitted pair of socks which will pause the running show on Netflix if the user falls asleep, resulting in no leg movement. The socks would be fitted with an LED indicator too which will let the user know, in cases of false positive, that the current show will be paused.
