The Canadian government is launching a pilot program for surveillance of suicide-related behaviours using social media through artificial intelligence (AI). The government will conduct market research on its citizens to identify patterns associated with users who discuss suicide-related behaviour, based on online data. The government has partnered with AI firm Advanced Symbolics for the purpose.
