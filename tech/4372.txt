Apple CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday said the company had no choice but to sue Qualcomm as it "withheld billion dollars in payments that they owed." Cook compared the situation to buying a sofa and charging customers "a different price depending on the price of the house it goes into." Apple's $1 billion lawsuit accuses Qualcomm of overcharging for royalties.
