A giant robot is helping NASA engineers build the biggest, lightweight composite rocket parts ever developed for future space vehicles to missions including Mars exploration. "This new robotic manufacturing system provides modern technology to develop low-cost and high-speed manufacturing processes for making large composite rocket structures," a senior official said.
