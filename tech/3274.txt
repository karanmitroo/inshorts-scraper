Opera Software has created a new version of its internet browser codenamed 'Reborn' with a messaging sidebar built directly into the interface. The sidebar gives users direct access to Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger apps instead of using web or desktop versions. Users will be able to pin chats next to their open tabs or pin the icons to the sidebar.
