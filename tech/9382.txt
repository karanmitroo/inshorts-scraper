A smartphone app called ‘Gyan Jyoti’ has reportedly led to a “dramatic” increase in rural Indian women using modern contraceptive methods in just a few months. At least 22% of women who were counselled with the app started using modern contraception. Further, the women who watched motivational videos on the app were 4.5 times more likely to use modern contraception.
