A US jury has agreed to count a GIF as a "deadly weapon" in a case against a man who tweeted a seizure-causing flashing image to a journalist with epilepsy. The man, John Rivello, has been charged with "aggravated assault with a deadly weapon." The tweet, sent in December, also had the text, "You deserve a seizure for your post."
