Switzerland-based virtual reality (VR) startup Imverse has developed a technology which lets users render themselves inside VR in real time. It is able to deliver the sensation of a user's real body existing in virtual reality. It also offers the ability to render other objects, including people, allowing a user in a VR headset shake hands with one who isn't.
