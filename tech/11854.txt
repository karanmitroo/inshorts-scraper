The Supreme Court on Friday quashed the CBI special court's order to make top executives Sunil Bharti Mittal and Ravikant Ruia accused in allocating additional 2G spectrum. Mr. Mittal's lawyer said he was being made "vicariously liable" for his company, without direct evidence. The SC has said that the CBI wrongly applied the legal principle in  summoning Mittal and Ruia.
