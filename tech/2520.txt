An extreme cyber attack can cause losses up to $121.4 billion globally, which is comparable to economic losses caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a report by Lloydâ€™s of London said. The report further said that losses from failure of a widely-used cloud-service provider would be $53 billion. Notably, recent ransomware cyber attacks 'Petya' and 'WannaCry' caused mass disruptions globally.
