US researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system which can train robots to interact with a human instructor and perform tasks for the army. It consists of machine learning algorithms for robots to perform tasks by viewing video streams. "The army of the future will consist of soldiers and autonomous teammates working side-by-side," army researcher Garrett Warnell said.
