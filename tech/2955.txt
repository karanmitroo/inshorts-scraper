Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday said it took him 15 years to discover his life's purpose. "After countless twists and turns, my search brought me to Apple...Steve Jobs wanted to empower the crazy ones, the misfits. I finally felt aligned," he said. "I'd never met a leader with such a clear purpose â€“ To serve the humanity," Cook added.
