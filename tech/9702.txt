Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have successfully grown the first flower plant, called zinnias, in space as part of NASA's VEG-01 investigation. Zinnias were grown in a veggie chamber with their roots soaked in one-time-use pillows. The chamber, which can theoretically grow any type of plant with customized lightings, was previously used for growing lettuce.
