Photomath, a smart calculator app which uses real-time machine vision technology to scan and solve math problems, has introduced an update allowing iOS users to scan handwritten problems through their smartphone cameras. Previously, the app could only recognise printed material. Photomath also provides step-by-step solutions to problems on topics like linear equations, decimals and fractions.
