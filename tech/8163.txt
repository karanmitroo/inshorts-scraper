A Chinese robot is set to compete with grade 12 students during the Chinaâ€™s national college entrance examination next year and get a qualifying score to enter universities. Designed to solve problems with artificial intelligence, the electronic examination paper will be loaded into the robot's program. The robot will finish the exams during designated periods like the other examinees.
