A group of investors has sued Japanese firm Toshiba for $162.3 million over a $1.3 billion accounting scandal that was uncovered last year. The conglomerate has been sued by 15 different groups since it admitted to reporting inflated profits going back to 2008. The accounting errors were blamed on Toshiba's corporate culture in which employees could not question their superiors.
