Hong Kong-based technology company Tesla has made a computer for dogs called the 'Dog PC'. The computer features a touchscreen tablet that lets dogs play games like Fruit Ninja with their paws. It also features a built-in electronic food box, a speaker, and a camera, to let the dog owners keep a watch on their pets from distant places.
