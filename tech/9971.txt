On the occasion of World Disability Day, Uber on Thursday launched uberASSIST in Delhi, a service aimed at aiding the differently-abled. Under this, Uber will send trained drivers who will assist commuters in their accessibility needs like storing wheelchairs. The service, to be soon rolled out in other cities across India, can be availed by entering the promo code 'ASSISTDEL'.
