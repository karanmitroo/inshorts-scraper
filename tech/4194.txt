AR startup Magic Leap, which is valued at $4.5 billion, has been sued by former Marketing VP Tannen Campbell for sexual discrimination. Campbell alleges the startup's corporate culture is one of "macho bullying where women's ideas...are ridiculed openly." The lawsuit alleges that the company's IT support lead once said, "We stay away from Three Os: Orientals, Old People, and Ovaries."
