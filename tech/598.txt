Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp is testing a 'Dismiss as Admin' feature that will allow one administrator to remove the other from the 'group admin' post. The feature, which is available under the Group info section, is being tested on both iOS and Android. WhatsApp is also reportedly testing a feature to allow group administrators to restrict activities of other members.
