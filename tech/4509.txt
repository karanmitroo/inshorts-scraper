A report by The Wall Street Journal shows that Google promotes its own products to the top of search results in 91% cases. Searches for "phones" and "laptops" result in ads for Google Pixel and Chromebook respectively most of the time. However, Google's spokesperson said the company has "consciously and carefully designed" its marketing programs not to affect other advertisers.
