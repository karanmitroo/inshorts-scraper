A 16-year-old American's request for free chicken nuggets for a year from fast food chain Wendy's has achieved the most retweets ever, breaking the record set by Ellen DeGeneres' 2014 Oscar selfie. Carter Wilkerson on April 5 had tweeted, "Yo @Wendys how many retweets for a year of free chicken nuggets?", to which Wendy's replied, "18 Million".
