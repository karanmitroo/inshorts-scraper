US-based startup Modobag has developed a smart rideable luggage that has a top speed of 13 kmph. The luggage, which claims to get people to their destination three times faster than walking, is GPS-enabled for tracking purposes and comes with two USB charging ports. It features a padded seat, speed control settings and dual wheel braking system.
