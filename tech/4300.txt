Technology major Apple has been granted a patent for convertible "dual mode" headphones that can be transformed into stereo speakers. Users will be able to switch between the two modes at the touch of a button or through sensors that detect the position of the device. Additional sensors prevent speakers from turning on when headphones are close to users' ears.
