The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully tested its Scramjet (Supersonic Combusting Ramjet) engine from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on Sunday. Known as the air-breathing engine, it would be used only during the atmospheric phase of the rocket's flight and will help bring down the launch cost by reducing the amount of oxidiser requiredâ€‹ along with fuel.
