Nintendo Co Ltd announced the demise of its Chief Executive Satoru Iwata on Monday. The 55-year-old died on Saturday from a tumour in his bile duct, that had kept him unwell for a long time. The announcement came only months after he had led the Japanese video game maker’s entry into mobile gaming. Iwata’s replacement has not been named yet.
