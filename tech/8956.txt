Actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscars win on Monday set a new record for the most-tweeted minute to take place during an Oscars telecast. More than 4,40,000 tweets were posted in one minute when DiCaprio accepted the Best Actor award. This unseats the previous record of 2,55,000 tweets per minute for the famous celebrity group selfie tweeted by TV host Ellen Degeneres in 2014.
