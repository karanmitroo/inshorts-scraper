Marvin Minsky, a founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Artificial Intelligence Project, died at 88 due to brain haemorrhage on Sunday. Minsky invented the first head-mounted graphical display in 1963 (modern-day Oculus Rift) and was among the first to develop artificial neural networks, a key technology in the field of deep learning. He received the Turing Award in 1969.
