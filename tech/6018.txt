Tech giant Apple has received a patent for a new screen-based fingerprint sensor, which would make it possible to "save valuable surface space." The new technology would enable users to scan fingerprint on the screen and end the need for a home button. The smartphone manufacturer, however, has not confirmed any plans of removing the home button from iPhones.
