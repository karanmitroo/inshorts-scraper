Moscow-based security company Kaspersky Lab has introduced the 'Kaspersky Cybersecurity Index' to measure current cyber-threat levels faced by internet users. Based on behavioural data collected from thousands of global users, the index shows that although 29% of users have experienced some form of cyber crime, only 60% have installed security solutions on all devices they use for internet access.
