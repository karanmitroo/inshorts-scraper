A US judge on Wednesday said that Google doesn't have a "smoking gun" to prove Uber conspired with a former Google engineer to steal its self-driving technology. The judge added that it was "undisputed" that the employee stole 14,000 documents before leaving Google. However, Google has so far not been able to prove that Uber knew he possessed the documents.
