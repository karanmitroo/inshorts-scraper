Qualcomm has sued Apple for not "utilising the full performance" of its modem chips in iPhone 7 smartphones. The chipmaker also accused Apple of "misrepresenting the performance disparity" between phones using Qualcomm's and Intel's chips adding, "Apple refuses to acknowledge the...value of those technologies." Earlier, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for royalties in a $1 billion lawsuit.
