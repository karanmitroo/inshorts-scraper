Google announced a new free security extension called Password Alert that protects users from online attackers that attempt to steal passwords and other personal information. The extension warns users about 'phishing' pages that imitate websites to steal information. The extension took three years to develop and adds to Google's safe browsing technology that warns against malicious sites.
