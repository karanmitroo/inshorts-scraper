During a five-hour standoff that ended in the death of 23-year-old Korryn Gaines, Facebook reportedly granted an emergency request from the US police to take her account offline. Gaines had barricaded herself with her five-year-old son and started posting videos of the scene online, police said. The boy was admitted to a hospital after being wounded in the arm.
