New Delhi-based robotics researcher Diwakar Vaish has developed a mind-controlled wheelchair for paralytic patients priced at â‚¹2 lakh. The wheelchair uses brain signals of the user to control its speed and sends an alert in case of any risk. Further, a user can immediately stop the wheelchair during an emergency by blinking.
