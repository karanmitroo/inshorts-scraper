The moon will get its first 4G mobile network next year to allow lunar exploration vehicles to stream high-definition data back to a base station. Vodafone Germany, Nokia, and carmaker Audi said on Tuesday that they were working in collaboration with Berlin-based space exploration scientists. The project is a part of the first privately-funded mission to the Moon.
