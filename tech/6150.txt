Swiss watchmaker MB&F has unveiled the 'Horological Machine 8', a luxury wristwatch that the company says is inspired by "Can-Am race cars". It features a display that uses prisms to project the numerals on the "front" of the HM8. Powered by a 22-carat-gold winding rotor at the "back", the $82,000 watch is available in red and white gold colour options.
