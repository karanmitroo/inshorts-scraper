Pokémon Go's maker Niantic's Founder and CEO John Hanke on Sunday said, "Beyond first generation Pokémon, there are some others that may make their way into our universe." Hanke added, "We're looking forward to finding interesting ways to make that happen in the coming months and years." He further said that the game would also let players modify PokéStops' functions.
