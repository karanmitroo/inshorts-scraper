Scientists at European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), which houses the biggest atom smasher in the world, have discovered a new kind of particle called 'Pentaquark'. The study of the particles may help scientists better understand how ordinary matter is constituted. The existence of pentaquarks was first proposed in the 1960s by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and Georg Zweig.
