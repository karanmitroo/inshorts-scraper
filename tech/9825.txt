The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched six Singaporean satellites atop its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle's (PSLV) C-29 variant on Wednesday. All six satellites were launched into their separate orbits at an altitude of 550 km from earth's surface. The launch included one earth observation satellite called TeLEOS-1, which was the main passenger for the PSLV rocket.
