On-demand video streaming service Netflix has trolled its North Korean rival Manbang on Twitter by changing its bio to "Manbang knockoff" on the micro-blogging site. Launched earlier this week by the North Korea's state broadcaster, Manbang is a set-top box that provides on-demand TV content over the internet. It was dubbed as North Korea's version of Netflix in some reports.
