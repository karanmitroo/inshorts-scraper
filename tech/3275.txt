A Malaysian startup has created a gadget filled with coloured dye which can be clipped on to handbags and be detonated with a smartphone if the bag is stolen. The dye can reportedly leave permanent marks, making it easier to catch the thieves. The GPS-enabled gadget also allows users to track the stolen handbag through a connected phone app.
