US-based organisation Exchange Initiative has launched an app called 'TraffickCam' that lets users fight human trafficking by uploading photos of their hotel rooms when they travel. Human traffickers regularly post photos of victims posed in hotel rooms in their advertisements. Investigators can locate the victims by matching images on the app with the ones posted by the human traffickers.
