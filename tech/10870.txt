Doctors at Hyderabad's Frontier Lifeline Hospital have successfully implanted a valve made from a cow's heart inside a leaking heart valve of an 81-year-old woman. â€œShe had undergone radiotherapy and this had caused tissue in her chest to get stuck", Dr Anantharaman, the cardiologist who carried out the surgery, said. The surgery, performed by a 4-member team, lasted three hours.
