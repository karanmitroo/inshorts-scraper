Google has launched a new feature called 'Destinations' which allows planning trips via smartphone using Google's search engine. A user needs to search for a state, country, or continent and add the word "vacation" or "destination" for information on spots to visit and compare prices for conveyance and accommodation. Results can also be personalised based on the budget and schedule.
