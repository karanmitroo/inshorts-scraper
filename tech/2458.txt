US-based retail giant Walmart is developing a facial recognition system to monitor customers at its checkouts for signs of dissatisfaction using video cameras. On detecting signs of an unhappy customer through facial expressions, the system will alert employees and ask them to report to the register. It will also attempt to detect changes in customers' purchase habits due to dissatisfaction.
