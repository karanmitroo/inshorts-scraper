Light communications technology startup PureLiFi on Friday raised $9.3 million (Â£7 million) in its Series B funding round led by Singapore-based investment company Temasek. The startup said that the new capital will be used to begin commercialising the light fidelity (LiFi) technology. This WiFi alternative uses modulating LED light to send data from one LiFi-equipped device to another.
