NASA’s Jupiter mission, Juno spacecraft is the fastest human made object ever. Accelerated by Jupiter’s gravity, Juno's top speed is estimated at 265,000 km/h relative to the earth. The all-time speed record was previously held by NASA's Helios 1 and Helios 2 spacecraft, launched in the mid-1970s to study the sun.
