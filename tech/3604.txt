A former Huawei engineer from China has "married" a robot named Yingying that he built last year. The 30-kg robot can read some Chinese characters and speak a few words, but the AI engineer plans to upgrade his "bride" to be able to do household chores. Although not officially recognised, the ceremony was held in accordance with local traditions.
