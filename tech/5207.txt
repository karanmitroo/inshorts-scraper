An e-cigarette exploded in the pocket of a man's pants in New York City on Wednesday, causing third-degree burns on his leg, thigh and hand. While no one else was hurt in the accident, eyewitnesses said that they were shaken up by the incident. The victim has been hospitalised where he is expected to go through a surgery.
