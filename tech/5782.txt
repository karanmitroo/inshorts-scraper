Samsung has blocked a YouTube video of GTA V gameplay in which the Galaxy Note 7 is being used as an explosive. This comes after a modder named HitmanNiko released a GTA V modification that replaces a handheld explosive called the 'sticky bomb' with a Samsung Galaxy Note 7. However, more such videos have popped up on YouTube.
