Japan's ‘Maglev’ train hit a record speed of 590 kmph in a trial run on Thursday, breaking the 12-year-old history (of 581 kmph) set by itself in 2003. Interestingly, the train travels on wheels up until around 160 kmph and then high-powered electromagnets are engaged, physically lifting the train away from the track; thus removing the friction the wheels create.
