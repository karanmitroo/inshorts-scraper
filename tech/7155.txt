French startup SeaBubbles on Thursday raised $555,000 in funding to build egg-shaped taxis flying above the river Seine to reduce traffic in Paris. The battery-driven taxis can travel for up to 80-100 km on a single charge. Expected to launch in 2017, the taxis will be available for booking through a dedicated app and will have their own docking ports.
