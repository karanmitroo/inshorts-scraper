Google on Tuesday launched its smart messaging app Allo which is the first product to have the 'Google Assistant' which will rival Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. Assistant can be used within Allo to look up movie times and local restaurants among other things. Google Allo, available for Android and iOS, also 'learns' from users' conversations and suggests 'smart' replies.
