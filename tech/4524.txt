LG will reportedly include Google Assistant, which has only appeared in Google's own smartphones Pixel and Pixel XL so far, in its upcoming G6 smartphone. LG is also said to be in talks with Amazon to include Alexa in future phones. G6, which is speculated to have a 5.7-inch screen, will be unveiled in February at the Mobile World Congress.
