The Bihar police have decided to use WhatsApp, e-mail, Twitter and Facebook applications to share information among officers. For this, Android smartphones will be provided to all police officers, ranging from Station House Officers (SHOs) to Directors General of Police (DGPs). The move is aimed at “better and efficient state-level coordination” and will cost ₹2.08 crore.
