Chipmaker Qualcomm has been asked to refund â‚¹5,200 crore to Canadian technology company BlackBerry in an arbitration settlement. The dispute was over royalties that BlackBerry had paid in advance to Qualcomm for use of its products or patents. BlackBerry argued that there should be a cap on certain royalties, while Qualcomm said the payments were supposed to be non-refundable.
