Dutch product designer Ermi van Oers' startup Living Light has created a lamp that is powered with the help of the photosynthetic process of a plant. The lamp can produce up to 0.1 mW by harvesting energy from electrons released by bacteria in the soil due to photosynthesis. Further, the longevity of light depends on the well-being of the plant.
