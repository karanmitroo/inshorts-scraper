South Korean smartphone maker Samsung recently held an event for its distributors in China where 20 company executives took to the stage and kneeled down to apologise for Galaxy Note 7 explosions. The gesture, however, was not welcomed in China, where thousands of people went angry and claimed that Samsung executives have shown disrespect for Chinese culture by kneeling.
