Voicing his support for whistleblower Edward Snowden, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak Thursday said, "He is a hero to me, but he may be a traitor to other people". Moreover, Wozniak felt that Snowden, who is charged with espionage and is hiding in Russia as a fugitive from US law, should be allowed to return to his country.
