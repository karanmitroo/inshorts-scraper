Florida-based startup PNP Robotics has created a smart crate called 'ZenCrate' that helps dogs to get rid of anxiety. The crate automatically detects when a dog comes inside and begins playing calming music and turns on the fan. Further, the crate's vibration damping technology reduces the physical vibrations from the outside thunder or heavy machinery.
