A Google Pixel smartphone was accidentally sent by a carrier to an Australian man, a week before the smartphone's official launch scheduled for October 20. The man shared the pictures, videos and unboxing shots of the phone online. He claimed that the new phone has all new ringtones and no extra Google apps are pre-installed on the device.
