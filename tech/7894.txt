A 45-year-old New York state law, which requires drivers to keep one hand on the steering wheel while driving, is preventing autonomous vehicles from running in the state. The law previously had prevented Audi from demonstrating its autonomous cars in New York in May. Earlier, USA's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration decided that autonomous vehicles are legal under federal law.
