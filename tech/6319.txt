Swedish camera maker Hasselblad has unveiled the V1D 4116, its modular 75-megapixel concept camera. Dubbed a "black box," the solid aluminium body-camera has customisation options such as displays, viewfinders, and holders for the top and back, while the sides can be fitted with controls or grips. Hasselblad declined to provide further details like launch date or pricing.
