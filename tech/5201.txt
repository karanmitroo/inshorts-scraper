Norway's highest court on Friday rejected a final appeal by former Central Intelligence Agency employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden to secure a guarantee that he would not be extradited to the US if he visited Norway. Snowden, who leaked classified US government documents in 2013, is currently living in Russia.
