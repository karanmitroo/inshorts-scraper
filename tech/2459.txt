Technology major Google has denied claims that the 'Google.com' homepage for desktops is being revamped. This comes after a report from The Guardian claimed Google will "radically" change the homepage by adding a news feed to 'Google.com'. Google said it will introduce "some version of the feed experience to Google.com on the mobile web", but not on the desktop version.
