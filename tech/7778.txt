Apple on Monday announced iOS 10, the latest operating system for iPhones and iPads. It enables the phone's lock screen to wake up when it's lifted and uses deep learning locally for facial recognition. The new Messages app features several upgrades including invisible ink for hidden messages and rich previews that will allow playing YouTube videos directly from the app.
