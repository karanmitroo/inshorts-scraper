Facebook has said in a blog post that it will demote posts which ask users for likes or shares for wider visibility of their content. "We want to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading," the company said. However, Facebook specified that posts that ask people for help, advice, or recommendations will not be adversely impacted.
