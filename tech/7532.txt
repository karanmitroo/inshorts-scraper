Switzerland-based MSC Cruises will launch its first smart ship, MSC Meraviglia, in June 2017 to sail across the western Mediterranean. The ship, which can house 4,500 guests, features an indoor promenade with a 262-foot LED sky. In addition to two F1 simulators and a 5D cinema, the technologically advanced ship will also let guests pay for items using smart bracelets.
