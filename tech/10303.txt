Popular Youtube channel AJ+ has released a one and half minute video featuring the world's first completely solar-powered airport in Kochi. The Kochi International Airport went 100% solar in August early this year with an investment of $10 million, a cost that would be recovered within 5 years. Thirty-three other Indian airports are also likely to follow suit.
