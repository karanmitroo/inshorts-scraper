Indian students Runal Jaju and Shubham Baldava have launched ‘Ticket Jugaad’, an app that enables travelers to book confirmed railway tickets. The app automatically calculates the availability of quota seats on the stations before and after the source station, thus giving users all possible permutations and combinations of alternative routes with confirmed seats, and helping them avoid wait lists.
