British surgeons have successfully performed the world’s first robotic operation inside the eye, potentially revolutionising the way such conditions are treated. The procedure was carried out at John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. “With a robotic system, we open up a whole new chapter of eye operations that currently cannot be performed,” said the Surgeon Robert MacLaren.
