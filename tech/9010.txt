Google has updated its Maps application to allow Indian users to add pit stops to their existing route without having to exit navigation. Users can now search for and add pit stops like restaurants, petrol pumps and grocery stores while they are on their way. Further, Google Maps will automatically adjust users' time of arrival once the stops are marked.
