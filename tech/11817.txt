A number of Nexus 6 users had reported a defect in the Motorola-manufactured handsets.  The phone's glued back comes off due to the phone's battery swelling up and expanding, according to the users. Acknowledging the issue, Motorola has said that it is offering replacements to affected users. The issue was first reported by the tech website Phandroid.
