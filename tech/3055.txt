Social media giant Facebook is reportedly developing a new app called 'Talk' for teenagers that would come with parent-centric features. With the new app, parents would be able to see and filter the people to whom their children are talking to. Teenagers would be able to talk to their parents over Messenger and share face masks with family and friends.
