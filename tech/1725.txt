Japanese fintech startup Valu, which is a cross between a trading platform and crowdfunding site, lets anyone from fishermen to YouTube celebrities hold a personal Initial Public Offering (IPO). Users can sell shares on its website to raise funds and attracts buyers by offering services. For example, a blogger may offer exclusive posts that can only be viewed by shareholders.
