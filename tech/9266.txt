Apple has been ordered to pay $625 million to VirnetX after a US court judged that the iPhone-maker had infringed on patents used in its iMessage and FaceTime services. VirnetX earlier settled a 2014 dispute with Microsoft over patents used in Skype, for $24 million. Notably, VirnetX makes almost all of its revenue from patent licensing and lawsuits.
