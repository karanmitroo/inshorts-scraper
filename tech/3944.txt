Chinese researchers have developed an 'artificial throat' using graphene (a carbon form) which can both generate and detect sound. The wearable electronic device can help the deaf-mute 'speak' as it detects weak vibrations when attached to the throat, converting it into sound. The graphene-based biocompatible device is expected to have a significant impact in speech recognition, scientists said.
