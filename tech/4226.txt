Considering the high levels of smog in NCR, the Haryana government is in talks with a Holland-based company to set up smog-free towers in Gurugram and Faridabad. Notably, the two districts contribute nearly one-fifth of the air pollution in the region. A smog-free tower is a seven-metre-high air purifier with an effective range of 300 m to 7 km.
