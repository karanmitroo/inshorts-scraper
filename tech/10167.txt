Google is reportedly working on the concept of "automated reply" in its Inbox app that would suggest replies to emails that require "quick responses". The user will be provided with "up to three choices" as replies before it is sent. The feature would be available for all users of Inbox app and businesses who pay for "Google's suite of applications".
