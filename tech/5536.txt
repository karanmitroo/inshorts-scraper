South Korean electronics major Samsung on Thursday said that it was reviewing options to minimise the environmental impact from the firm's recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. Environmental group Greenpeace had recently issued a statement demanding Samsung to find a way to reuse rare materials such as cobalt, gold, and tungsten from the discontinued smartphones.
