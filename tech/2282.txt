Russian entrepreneur Viacheslav Semenchuk has announced plans for an initial coin offering (ICO) of the world's first digital currency aimed specifically at Jewish communities across the globe. The BitCoen, which comes from the Hebrew word 'priest', has been created to simplify payments within Jewish communities, Semenchuk said. However, the cryptocurrency can be bought by anyone.
