Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that until now the website’s Safety Check feature was only activated for natural disasters, but going forward, it will be activated for more human disasters. This comes after a controversy erupted over Facebook activating its Safety Check feature for Paris, but not Beirut. Zuckerberg assured that the company cares “about all people equally”.
