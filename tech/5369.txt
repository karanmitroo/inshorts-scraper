A four-minute YouTube video explains how Snapchat's smart sunglasses 'Spectacles' work. The social media company's first ever hardware product has an inbuilt camera which can capture and share circular videos by clicking a button on the side. The $130 (â‚¹8,700) Spectacles come with a case which doubles as a charger and can charge the glasses about four times fully.
