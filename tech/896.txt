Talking about Android smartphones using iPhone X-like Face ID feature, Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller has said, "They all stink." Adding that he isn't surprised that other companies are attempting to replicate the feature, he said, "Because when we do things really good, others like to copy us." Schiller added that they don't work the way Face ID should work.
