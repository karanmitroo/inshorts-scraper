Google has pulled back a Chrome extension, called Coincidence Detector, that was used by racists to identify and track Jewish people online. The plugin added the digital equivalent of the gold star badge around Jewish people's surnames. Until being banned, the plugin had around 2,500 users and had a list of 8,768 names that were considered worthy of tracking.
