In its annual financial report, Mozilla has maintained that the organization's revenue from Google increased from $139 million (85% of total revenue) in 2011 to about $280 million (i.e. 90% of total revenue) in 2012, leading to its increased dependency on Google. As a matter of relief to Mozilla, its expenses have not grown as quickly as its revenue.
