After offering free battery replacements to iPhone 6s users last month, Apple has explained why some handsets are shutting down with 30% charge remaining. Such devices "contained a component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster," said Apple in a statement.
