Video-streaming service YouTube has been slammed for including "disturbing and inappropriate content" in its videos that feature children's cartoon characters. For example, a channel called 'Smile Kids TV' posted a video of a popular Disney Junior cartoon called 'Doc McStuffins Drink Sex Medicine Full Episodes'. In a statement, YouTube suggested that parents should use the YouTube Kids app.
