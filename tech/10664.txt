A mobile app titled ‘TrackTheBite’ that provides real-time tracking on mosquito infestation was launched at an event in New Delhi by North Delhi Mayor Ravinder Gupta to mark the World Mosquito Day on Thursday. It is a commemoration of British doctor Sir Ronald Ross’s discovery in 1897 that female mosquitoes transmit malaria between humans.
