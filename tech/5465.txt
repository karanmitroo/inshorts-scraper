Google operating systems are always named after a sweet, like Cupcake, Donut, KitKat or Nougat. A Google spokesperson once said, "Android powers over one billion smartphones and tablets. Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert". Moreover, Android versions are named in an alphabetic order, starting from Cupcake to Marshmallow and Nougat.
