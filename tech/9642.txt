OmSignal, a Canada-based wearable company, has developed a biometric-tracking smart bra, OmBra, that monitors a userâ€™s heart rate, breathing rate, and number of calories burnt, among others. The sports bra supports a sensor-filled black box in its lower band that captures the data and wirelessly shares it on OmSignal's mobile app. The wearable is estimated to be priced at $150.
