Researchers have developed a spray-paint can system that robotically reproduces photographs as large-scale murals, by being waved around the canvas. By tracking the can using a PC, two webcams and QR codes, the system uses spray to replicate the photograph. The method, applicable only on flat surfaces currently, could be useful for creating building-sized artwork if adapted for non-flat surfaces.
