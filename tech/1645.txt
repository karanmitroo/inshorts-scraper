Photo-sharing platform Instagram has launched a comment moderation tool that allows users to choose who can comment on their posts. The tool allows users to limit comments to specific groups of people including 'followers' even on a public account. Instagram is also updating its automated filter to block 'offensive' comments which also includes Arabic, French, and German content.
