Mozilla on Thursday launched their Firefox browser for all Apple devices- iPhones, iPads, and iPods worldwide running on iOS 8.2 or a later version. The application had been available in preview format exclusively in New Zealand since September. Earlier, Mozilla had refused to develop software for the App store due to disagreements over web engine with Apple.
