Technology company IBM has filed a patent for a drone that can act like a pet-sitter or trainer when the owner is away. The proposed drone could feed, train, and prevent pets from damaging the house. It could also play with the pet using internet-connected toys and issue a "vocalised command" in the owner's voice if the pet misbehaves.
