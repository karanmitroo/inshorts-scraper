A US-based startup has developed 'Sonic Blocks', a modular wireless music system that lets users swap the speakers, panels, lights, or expand the number of units. Priced at $199, the starter kit comes with the "brain" or computer base of the speakers which the users can customise to build a home theatre or office music system among other options.
