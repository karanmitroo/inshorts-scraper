The computers aboard Britain's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth were spotted displaying 'Microsoft Windows XP', copyright 1985 to 2001, during a tour given to journalists. Windows XP has not been supported by Microsoft since 2014, and is vulnerable to the WannaCry ransomware. The $4.5 billion carrier is the biggest and most powerful vessel ever built for the Royal Navy.
