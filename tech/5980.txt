The Cybathlon, dubbed as the world's first bionic Olympics, was held in Switzerland, featuring 66 teams of developers, technologists and competitors. The competitors used assistive technologies like robotic legs, bionic arms, powered exoskeletons and brain-controlled computer interfaces, to perform everyday tasks. Switzerland and Iceland were the best performers, winning three medals each.
