The world's first airplane flight was made by Orville Wright, the younger of the two Wright brothers, famously known as the pioneers of aviation. Decided upon a coin toss, Wilbur Wright made an unsuccessful first attempt, damaging the aircraft. Orville Wright, born 145 years ago on August 19, 1871, successfully flew the airplane for the first time three days later.
