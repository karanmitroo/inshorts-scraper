Lucy Peng, Executive Chairman of Ant Financial, an affiliate of Jack Ma's Alibaba, has apologised for a social feature in the company's wallet app Alipay that enabled a "sexually explicit dating service." The 'Circles' feature mostly lets women post photos or videos, while men are restricted to commenting or paying money in the form of 'tips' for the pictures.
