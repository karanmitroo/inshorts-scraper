Using 3D-printing, a New York-based physics student has developed a functional prosthetic hand made with plastic parts costing $15. Designed for people who retain the ability to move their wrist, the hand can be used to grip, write and also catch a ball. The hand offers an inexpensive solution for growing children in need of prosthetics.
