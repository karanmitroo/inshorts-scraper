YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki on Thursday announced that it would add 3-D support for videos that play back in its 360-degree format. The first online 360-degree ad, a commercial for Bud Light, was launched on Thursday. With the feature, wearers of headsets like Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR or Google Cardboard will be able to see images in three dimensions.
