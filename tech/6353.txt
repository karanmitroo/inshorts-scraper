An 18-year-old Austrian woman has sued her parents for posting "embarrassing" childhood photos of her on Facebook without consent. "They knew no shame and no limit," the woman said, claiming that her parents have shared over 500 "embarrassing and intimate" pictures. The woman's father has reportedly argued that he has the right to publish the images since he took them.
