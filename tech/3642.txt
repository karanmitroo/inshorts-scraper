Fast food chain KFC has teased an internet-connected smart 'Bucket' as its April Fools' prank. The Bucket lets users order fried chicken with voice control and delivers "relevant fried chicken news". The power source of the Bucket is "Herbs and Spices" and its Bluetooth connectivity offers support for "Limited Integrated Connection Kinetics (LICK)".
