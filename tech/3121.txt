ExtraTorrent, the world's second largest torrent site after The Pirate Bay, shut down permanently last week. "ExtraTorrent with all mirrors goes offline...We permanently erase all data. Stay away from fake ExtraTorrent websites and clones," read a message on the website. ExtraTorrent was best known for its massive index of entertainment content downloadable using the BitTorrent protocol.
