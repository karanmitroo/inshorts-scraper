A gaming fan revealed that the soundtrack to the latest installment of the 'Doom' franchise hides images of pentagrams and '666', which are widely considered 'sinister' and relating to witchcraft and black magic. The images are visible when the game's music frequencies are visualized through a spectrogram. Notably, 1993's maiden installment of 'Doom' also featured such imagery.
