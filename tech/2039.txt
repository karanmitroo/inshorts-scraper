Ex-Google engineer James Damore has hired Indian-origin lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, who is a representative for the Republican National Committee, as his lawyer. Damore was fired earlier this month for writing a memo against the company's diversity policies. Dhillon is representing Damore in his complaint to the US National Labor Relations Board accusing Google's upper management of shaming him.
