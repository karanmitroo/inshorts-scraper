An American man has been sentenced to life in prison after he choked a man to death following a fight on Facebook. The argument broke out after the victim shared photo of a woman jumping over penis-shaped statues with the caption, "How most girls get over ex's." The post was reportedly about his ex-girlfriend, who was then dating the attacker.
