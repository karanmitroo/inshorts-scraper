Apple has released a statement against US President Donald Trump's revocation of rules allowing transgender students to use bathrooms matching their gender identity. "We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe transgender students should be treated as equals," it read. In a message to employees, Apple CEO Tim Cook had earlier opposed Trump's immigration ban.
