Harvard and Cornell engineers have created 80-milligram "RoboBees" programmed to mimic an insect brain and behave autonomously. Instead of using traditional chips that use 0s and 1s, the team used neuromorphic chips that fire electric currents in complex combinations, like brain fires neural signals. Researchers are developing the robots to avoid crashing, or survive and still fly in other cases.
