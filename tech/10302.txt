Uber on Thursday launched a 'Help Button' in the app that connects riders in India instantly with local police authorities. Once the button is pressed, trip details are sent to the police and the rider would also be able to speak to them via phone. An automated message with current trip status would also be sent to pre-selected Emergency contacts.
