A new health app called Carrot Hunger helps in weight loss through insults put up through hideous fullscreen ads and tweets. It makes the user's avatar larger and calls them terms such as 'meat bag' and 'carcass'. If the users overeat, the app punishes them through tweets and ads that shame the user in front of all social media friends.
