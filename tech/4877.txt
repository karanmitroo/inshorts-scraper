A Virgin America flight was delayed after a passenger changed the name of their Wi-Fi hotspot to 'Samsung Galaxy Note 7'. Samsung's recalled Galaxy Note 7 phones are banned from US planes. The crew reportedly announced, "This isn't a joke. We're going to turn on the lights and search everyone's bag until we find it," before the passenger confessed.
