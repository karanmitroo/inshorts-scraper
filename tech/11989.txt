India's latest communication satellite GSAT-16 was successfully launched by the Ariane-5 rocket on Sunday from the space-port of Kourou in French Guiana, ISRO said. Soon after the launch, Bengaluru-headquartered Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said the satellite is in 'good health'. The launch was earlier deferred twice due to bad weather at the launch base.
