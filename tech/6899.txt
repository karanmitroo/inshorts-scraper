The clone of recently shut online directory for torrent files KickassTorrents, KAT.am is reportedly owned by scammers, who ask for a user's credit card details before downloading a file. Unlike the clone, the original KickassTorrents website never asked for financial data. Earlier in July, KickassTorrents was shut down and the website's alleged owner was arrested over copyright infringement.
