Keeping its growing Indian user base in mind, China’s largest search engine company Baidu on Monday introduced Hindi language support in the latest update of its third-party Android app store, MoboMarket. The update also includes smart recommendations in terms of localised content “specifically designed for Indian users”. MoboMarket reportedly has over 4.5 million monthly active users in India.
