Stanford University researchers have successfully created lithium-ion batteries with built-in fire extinguisher. The researchers added fire-extinguishing chemical 'triphenyl phosphate' to the separator that keeps the positive electrodes away from the negative in the battery. If the battery's temperature reaches 150Â°C, the chemical releases and stops the battery from blowing up within 0.4 seconds.
