Web browser developer Opera has introduced a new version of its desktop web browser with built-in ad-blocking features. "Ad-blocking technology is an opportunity and a wake-up call to the advertising industry to pay attention to what consumers are actually saying", an Opera spokeswoman said. Ad-blocking provides faster page loading, a less intrusive experience, and increases privacy and security.
