A Chinese court has ordered Samsung Electronics' mainland subsidiaries to pay ₹75 crore to technology company Huawei Technologies for patent infringement. Huawei had reportedly sought compensation for over 3 crore Samsung products that sold for ₹82,000 crore which infringed its patents, including Galaxy S7. The two companies are also engaged in legal battles over different patents in other courts.
