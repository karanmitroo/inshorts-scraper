Alibaba-owned shopping app Taobao offered users the chance to virtually date Chinese actors on May 20, China's online Valentine's Day. Users with a VR headset were allowed to date either Chinese actor Yang Yang or actress Dilraba on scanning a QR code. Actors interacted with the users over VR by making them breakfast and waking them up among other activities.
