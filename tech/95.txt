A fashion house used drones to fly its luxury handbags down the runway at the Milan Fashion Week on Sunday. Organisers ensured that all the attendees switched off the WiFi on their mobile phones as this could have affected the fleet of drones. The backdrop to the catwalk showcased the 'gates of heaven' and a sign read 'Fashion Devotion'.
