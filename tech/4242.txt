American automaker Ford has announced an investment of $1 billion in tech startup Argo AI, founded by former Google and Uber engineers. Ford will acquire a majority stake in the startup, which will focus on developing software platform for Ford's self-driving car. In August, Ford said it will mass-produce fully self-driving cars without brake pedals and steering wheels by 2021.
