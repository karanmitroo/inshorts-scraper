Samsung's latest flagship smartphone Galaxy S8's battery comes along with an 'anti-dog' symbol depicting a bar across a dog. It means the battery must be kept away from the dogs since chewing it may cause burns and damage to their digestive tract. Furthermore, if a dog chews and punctures the battery, it could swell and potentially burst into flames.
