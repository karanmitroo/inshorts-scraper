A group of researchers from three US universities including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) claimed to have developed World's first microprocessor that can be powered using light instead of electricity. The photonic processor reportedly can transfer data at a speed of 300 gigabytes per second per square millimeter, which is 10 to 15 times faster than the electrical microprocessors.
