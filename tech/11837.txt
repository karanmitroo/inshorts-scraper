A new project will see young researchers send seeds to Mars in 2018, to grow the first plant on the planet. The project was chosen by Dutch non-profit Mars One, at a competition for best experiments on Mars. The organizers found the idea unique because growing the "seed" will be the first testimony of life-supporting systems on Mars.
