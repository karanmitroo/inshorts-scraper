The Waste Management Department of the Dubai Municipality has confirmed that it plans to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles to police the city's litterers. The drones will monitor beaches, desert and waste dump sites for sanitation law violators. Currently, only one drone is in operation, with two additional drones to be added later in the year.
