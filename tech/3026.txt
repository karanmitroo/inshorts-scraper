Former Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who resigned from the technology major last week to join Uber, has said she knows what she's "walking into". John will be joining the ride-hailing startup as its first Chief Brand Officer. Her appointment comes amid an ongoing investigation into Uber's sexist work culture, in which 20 employees have been fired so far.
