Alexander Graham Bell received a patent for his invention of the telephone on March 7, 1876. Bell wanted to create a device that combined the aspects of the telegraph and the record player to allow individuals to transmit speech over wires. The first intelligible telephone message, sent from Bell to his assistant, was, “Mr. Watson, come here, I need you”.
