Apple has gained support from Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, UN’s Commissioner for Human Rights, in the legal tussle with FBI over unlocking and encrypting data from a San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. Hussein said weakening encryption protections could "endanger lives". Hussein added a successful case against Apple will make it impossible for international IT companies to safeguard their client's privacy.
