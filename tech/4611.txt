A University of California researcher has found a WhatsApp security backdoor that can allow the Facebook-owned company to intercept and read users' encrypted messages. WhatsApp has the ability to re-encrypt and resend undelivered texts when recipients reinstall WhatsApp or change devices without informing the sender. The re-encryption gives WhatsApp access to the messages, claims the report.
