The UN Human Rights Council on Friday passed a non-binding resolution which condemns violations, including arbitrary detention and torture, against anyone expressing themselves on the internet. The UNHRC also called on all nations to halt attempts to restrict access to information online. It noted that online privacy is essential to realise the right to freedom of expression.
