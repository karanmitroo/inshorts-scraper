Facebook is planning to launch two smart speakers codenamed Aloha and Fiona in July this year, according to reports. The two models might feature 15-inch touchscreens and will compete with Amazon's Echo Show smart speaker which features a 7-inch screen. Reports also suggested that Aloha will have more functionality including facial recognition feature via a wide-angle lens.
