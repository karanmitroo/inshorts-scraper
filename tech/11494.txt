India's ballistic missile interceptor, Advanced Air Defence (AAD), failed on its tenth test on Monday, as per a senior defence official. The AAD interceptor missile was fired from Wheeler Island off the coast in Odisha's Bhadrak district, but fell into the Bay of Bengal within a few seconds. The missile had last failed the test in July 2010.
