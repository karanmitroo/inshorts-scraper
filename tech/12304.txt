Apple on late Thursday released fully updated iOS 8.0.2 software to fix the problem that appeared in iOS 8 and to restore functionality to phones broken by iOS 8.0.1. Apple also apologised to users who were inconvenienced by the update and promised that iOS 8.0.2 would fix the issues. The iOS 8.0.1 was released and then pulled within hours Wednesday.
