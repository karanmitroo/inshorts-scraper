According to a video by Oxford Dictionaries, unwanted mails on the internet began to be called 'spam' on the basis of tinned meat consisting of pork. The tinned meat became popular through comedy shows that included spam in all food items. Thus, when early internet users needed a term for 'unwanted but unavoidable' messages, they chose the word spam.
