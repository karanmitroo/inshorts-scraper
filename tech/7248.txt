Hacker outfit OurMine on Tuesday briefly hacked online publisher of technology industry news TechCrunch. The website's home page read, "OurMine Team - Important Message! Hello guys, don't worry we are just testing techcrunch security, we didn't change any passwords." Notably, the same hacker outfit earlier claimed responsibility for hacking Twitter accounts of Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg.
