Google-owned navigation and traffic app Waze has launched a feature on Android to let users record directions in their own voice.  The 'Sound and Voice' option requires users to record general phrases like "Stop" or "Turn Right" first, after which they can customise the commands. However, users noted this feature could be misused through pranks like purposely recording wrong directions.
