US television maker Vizio has sued cash-strapped Chinese technology company LeEco over an unpaid buyer-termination fee of â‚¹645 crore after their intended merger fell through. The lawsuit accuses LeEco executives of misleading Vizio over the company's money problems and trying to use news of the merger to "create a widespread and dramatic public impression" about its financial well-being.
