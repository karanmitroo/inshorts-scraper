The Pinterest account of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was reportedly hacked on Tuesday for the second time after his Twitter and Pinterest accounts were compromised in June by hacker group OurMine. Zuckerberg's Pinterest bio temporarily read, "Don't worry, we are just testing your security." OurMine previously hacked social media accounts of Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Uber's Travis Kalanick.
