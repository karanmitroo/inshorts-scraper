Hiroshi Lockheimer, the head of Android and Chrome OS at Google, on Saturday teased possible names for the upcoming Android O operating system. He shared a Google Drive screenshot with names of food items starting from O such as 'Oreo' and 'Okra'. Lockheimer also said that Android releases are named after "tasty treats" and not necessarily after desserts.
