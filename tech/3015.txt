Apple on Monday unveiled a completely redesigned App Store with a whole new interface, which it called the biggest upgrade to the App Store since its launch nine years ago. The new interface features new apps in a tab called 'Today', which will be updated every day. The new App Store also puts gaming apps under a separate tab.
