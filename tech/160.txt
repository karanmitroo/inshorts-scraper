Harvard University researchers have developed a snake-inspired soft robot that uses a Japanese paper craft technique to crawl. They used a plastic sheet, embedded with centimetre-scale cuts, and wrapped it around tube-like elastomer actuator. With the actuator's expansion, the cuts popped out to form surface gripping the ground, and with contraction, they folded flat, propelling the robot forward.
