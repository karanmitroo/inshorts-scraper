Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey denied that the company planned to launch a reordered timeline based on an algorithm anytime next week. "We're going to continue to refine it to make Twitter feel more, not less, live!", he tweeted. This was in response to the '#RIPTwitter' hashtag that was trending across the world on Saturday.
