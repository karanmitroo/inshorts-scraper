UK-based startup Wayv has developed 'Adventurer', a bottle-shaped portable microwave with 900ml capacity priced at $199. It comes with a digital counter display and buttons for various functions. The microwave claims to deliver over 30 minutes of operational time in a single charge. The dishwasher-safe microwave can be charged at home, in the car or through portable solar panels.
