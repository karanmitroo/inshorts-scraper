French company Digitsole has created a shoe called 'The Active Cushioning Run Profiler' with a type of cushioning that shifts support while the user is running to decrease the impact of injuries. The shoe can track speed, distance, steps and calories burned. It also has a built-in method for diagnosing fatigue, so runners don't push themselves too far.
