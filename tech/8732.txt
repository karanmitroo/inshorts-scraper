Nike has unveiled its first self-tying shoes called ‘HyperAdapt 1.0’. Built on Nike’s adaptive lacing technology, the shoes are aimed at reducing athlete distraction and will automatically tighten as soon as the wearer steps into them. Technical lead Tiffany Beers said, “[T]here are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.”
