Director of ISRO Satellite Centre SK Shivakumar on Friday said that ISRO would launch about 10 satellites this year. “The idea is to set off launch of at least 10 satellites per year from 2015,” Shivakumar, one of the scientists behind the 'Mangalyan’ mission, added. India has launched 72 satellites on its own from 1975 till now.
