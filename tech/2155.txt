Ex-Google engineer James Damore, who was fired earlier this month for writing a memo against the company's diversity policies, has claimed Google uses employees' race or gender to decide when they will be promoted. He added that Google was "pressuring individual managers to increase 'diversity' on their team." Damore has been accused of promoting harmful gender stereotypes through the memo.
