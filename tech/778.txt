Apple has lost a lawsuit against Italian clothing company 'Steve Jobs' over the brand's name and logo. The technology giant had claimed the letter 'J' in the brand logo mimicked its logo by having a 'bitten' side and a leaf on top. The court ruled that letter 'J' isn't edible and therefore the 'bite' doesn't infringe on Apple's logo.
