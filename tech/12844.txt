Browser-maker Opera has introduced Sponsored Web Pass, which gives phone owners free mobile Internet in exchange for watching sponsored messages. The service is a variation of Opera Web Pass service that lets people use the Net with some restrictions. However, the service has not been rolled out to public. Earlier, Micromax had launched a similar campaign called 'Mad About Ads'.
