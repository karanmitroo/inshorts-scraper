Iran on Sunday launched the first phase of the country's own national internet network to provide high speed and quality connections at low costs. The government said that the network will be used to promote Islamic content and raise digital awareness among the public. Notably, Iran already blocks access to overseas social media services including Twitter and Facebook.
