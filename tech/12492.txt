Microsoft Corp is planning its biggest round of job cuts in five years, as the software giant looks to integrate Nokia Oyj's handset unit, Bloomberg reported. The restructuring may end up being the biggest in Microsoft history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, the report said. The reductions are expected to be announced as soon as this week.
