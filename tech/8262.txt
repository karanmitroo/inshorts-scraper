Former Twitter VP Michael Sippey has launched an iOS app called Talkshow that lets anyone create a show which can be viewed by others in real time. Users can find friends on the app, choose a topic for the show and invite friends as co-hosts. Audiences can also discover shows from the home screen, like individual messages and share reactions.
