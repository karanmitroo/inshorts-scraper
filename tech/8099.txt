Under its Data Center Mural Project, Google has invited artists to turn the walls of its data center facilities into art murals. The project, already executed in Oklahoma and Belgium, is aimed at making Google's data centers more interesting to look at. The company plans to next expand the project to data center buildings in Dublin and Council Buffs, Iowa.
