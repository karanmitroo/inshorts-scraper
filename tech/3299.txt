The recently launched GSAT-9 or the 'South Asia Satellite' became the first Indian spacecraft to use an electric propulsion system (EPS). It significantly reduced the payload weight as the satellite carried only 80kg of chemical fuel for its 12-year-long mission, 25% of the fuel otherwise needed. The technology would also bring down the cost of future launches, said ISRO Director.
