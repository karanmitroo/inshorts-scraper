Malaysia-based startup AppyKoins has developed an app called WorldKoins that lets travellers convert their leftover foreign currency to gift cards and vouchers to shop online. Travellers can drop off their unspent currency at any of the app's local partner. The money is then transferred to user's account on the app, from where the user can shop online.
