Researchers at Pondicherry University have claimed to identify seven new molecules which can treat blood cancer-chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Drugs using these molecules will be cheaper and much more potent as they bind the enzymes in the bone marrow which lead to an over-production of WBCs. This is a significant breakthrough as CML has started showing resistance to existing drugs.
