McDonaldâ€™s is filtering out pornographic content from its public Wi-Fi services in the majority of its locations in the US. The decision comes after pressure from internet safety activist group 'Enough is Enough', which aims at safe public Wi-Fi for family and children. Earlier fast food chains Chick-fil-A and Panera Bread also restricted porn from their Wi-Fi services.
