A robot journalist named 'Xiao Nan' made its debut in a Chinese newspaper on Wednesday with a 300-character-long article written in one second. The robot, able to write both short and long reports, also has a stronger data analysis capacity than staff reporters. The robot, however, is unable to conduct face-to-face interviews and cannot select the news angle from conversations.
