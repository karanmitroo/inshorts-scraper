Google on Wednesday announced 'Jamboard', a 55-inch whiteboard priced at $6,000 as the first hardware product under its cloud-based G Suite. It can be connected to Google's Docs, Sheets, Slides to add or share content. The 4K touchscreen, which incorporates tools like sticky notes and stencils with handwriting and shape recognition, can be wiped clean by users with their hands.
