A power outage hit the world's biggest technology show, CES 2018, in Las Vegas on Wednesday, leaving parts of the event in the dark for almost two hours. The outage was caused by "condensation from heavy rainfall" that sparked a flashover on one of the building's transformers, a CES statement read. It affected many companies, including LG, Samsung, and Sony.
