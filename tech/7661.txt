French startup Invoxia has developed a $99 device called 'Voice Bridge', that transfers the users' landline calls to their smartphones or tablets through Wi-Fi. Plugged into the landline, the device also lets users choose a contact from their smartphones and dial it through the landline. Users canÂ connect up to five of their devices to a single Voice Bridge.
