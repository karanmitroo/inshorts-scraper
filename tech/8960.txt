The digital arm of Zee Entertainment, Zee Digital Convergence, has launched its own video-on-demand service called OZEE. Available on both Android and iOS, the platform will “make content available within minutes of its television telecast” and deliver it for free. Further, the content’s shelf life will be for a lifetime and it will be delivered even on low bandwidth connections.
