French space agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales signed an agreement with ISRO for the next Mars mission that is expected to be launched in 2018. With India's Mangalyaan already orbiting Mars, the new deal would send a lander and a rover on the surface of the Red planet. Notably, the ₹450 crore Mangalyaan mission was launched in November 2013.
