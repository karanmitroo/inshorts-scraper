Samsung Electronics and Google have signed an agreement to cross-license their patents for reducing the risk of costly legal disputes over intellectual property and to foster greater collaboration. It means there is a higher possibility for Samsung to participate in Google's key projects as a hardware partner, analysts say. Samsung could join Googleâ€™s products like wearable PCs and self-driving cars.
