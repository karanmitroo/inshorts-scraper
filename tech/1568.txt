Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he feels the pain every time the company publishes fake news and views it as a "big responsibility" to get it right. Google was criticised earlier this week for failing to weed out fake news following the Las Vegas shooting. Pichai also said he thinks that Artificial Intelligence could fix problem of user privacy, "heuristically".
