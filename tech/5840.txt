Drones are being used by NASA, insurance companies and other organisations to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew and conduct recovery efforts. While NASA used drones into and around the storm to collect meteorological data, an insurance company sent a drone instead of a person to check property damage. Drone footage is also being used to carry rescue efforts.
