Apple launched its first-ever iPhone on June 29, 2007, after being introduced by Steve Jobs in January that year. The iPhone was among the world's first consumer devices with a multi-finger touch interface and was claimed to be "five years ahead of any other mobile phone". Fifteen iPhone models have been launched since then, with iPhone 7 being the latest.
