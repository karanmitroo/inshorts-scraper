Three French anti-racism associations on Sunday announced to file lawsuits against Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for failing to remove “hateful” content from their platforms. Out of the 586 examples of hateful content counted between March end and May 10, Twitter removed 4%, YouTube 7% and Facebook 34%, the associations added. Notably, French law requires websites to take down such content.
