Researchers from Cambridge have for the first time used skin cells to create primitive forms of artificial sperm and eggs. The researchers made the early-stage sex cells by culturing human embryonic stem cells under carefully-controlled conditions for a week. This medical feat can transform the understanding of age-related diseases, fertility problems and can be used in IVF therapies.
