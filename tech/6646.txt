Six scientists left the Mauna Loa dome in Hawaii on Sunday, after completing a year-long simulation of a Mars mission. The group, which was allowed to go out of the dome only after wearing spacesuits, managed limited resources while conducting research and working to avoid personal conflicts. This was the second-longest such mission after a 520-day mission by Russian scientists.
