Creating a scientific milestone, researchers have succeeded in observing and measuring neuronal transmission in a live animal for the first time, using an approach that combines genetics with the physics of light. Studying neuron transmissions will be instrumental in studying higher brain functions such as thought, behaviour, language, memory or even mental disorders.
