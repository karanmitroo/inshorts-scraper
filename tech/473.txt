Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a recent event said the company is happy to pay more tax, "whatever the world agrees to". Noting that Google's current blended global tax rate is 20%, Pichai said the question was where Google should pay. Pichai added that as Google hires more engineers globally, it would equalise distribution of tax payments across countries.
