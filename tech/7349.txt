About 5,000 people gathered at Chicago's Millennium Park on Sunday to attend an event being claimed as the first ever meet up regarding the mobile game Pokémon Go. Teenagers, artists, cosplayers, young adults and families with children spent a couple of hours at the park catching Pokémon. The event was created on Facebook by a 24-year-old computer technician in Chicago.
