NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft has reportedly captured the most detailed images of Pluto so far. The high-resolution images reveal landscapes with linear ridges and the planet’s rich colour palette. “It looks more like tree bark or dragon scales than geology. Maybe, it is some combination of internal tectonic forces and ice sublimation driven by Pluto’s faint sunlight,” a scientist said.
