Google spinoff Waymo has accused Uber of hiding a device built for developing self-driving cars. The accusations are part of Waymo's lawsuit against Uber which accuses an ex-Google employee of stealing confidential documents and using them at Uber. Waymo claims that Uber only disclosed one device in court, while hiding the one that may have been built using Google's technology.
