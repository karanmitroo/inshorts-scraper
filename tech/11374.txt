According to reports, Google has filed a patent to design a laptop that replaces the spacebar with an extended trackpad. The trackpad will have a separating line or ridge to distinguish between the space bar and the regular trackpad.  Interestingly, Google's space bar patent was rejected twice before being approved as per the Patent Office's digital system.
