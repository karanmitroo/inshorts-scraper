Electric car maker Tesla has sued the Governor of US state Michigan and other officials in a federal court after the state rejected Tesla's application to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The company has said that the 2014 Michigan law barring it from operating a showroom or repairing vehicles in the state was passed specifically to hamper Tesla's dealership application.
