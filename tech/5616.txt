A British man named Sharakat Hussain was reportedly refused a refund for an iPhone unless he could prove he was not deceased Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The man claims he received an email from Apple asking him to confirm he was not Saddam Hussein, who was on the government's 'Denied Parties' list. Apple has reportedly agreed to the refund now.
