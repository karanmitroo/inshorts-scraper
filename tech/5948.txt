American mass media conglomerate Comcast has been issued a $2.3 million (around â‚¹15 crore) fine, the 'largest civil penalty' ever issued to a cable operator, for billing customers for products they never ordered. The fine is for 'negative option billing,' in which customers are required to pay for an automatic service if they fail to specifically decline it in advance.
