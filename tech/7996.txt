A UK-based startup has created a $89 pocket-sized wearable air purifier 'Breathe', which claims to eliminate air pollutants and provide clean air around the user within seconds. It can last for over 30 hours in single charge and doesn't require any filter replacement. The purifier also claims to eliminate smoke, odour and has a range of up to 20 metres.
