Facebook on Monday suffered its second outage in less than a week wherein some users could not access the website for around an hour. The social network's website carried a message saying, “Sorry, something went wrong. We’re working on it and we’ll get it fixed as soon as we can.” The company’s shares went nearly 4% down in afternoon trading.
