Snapchat has said that it has no intention to allow users to broadcast Live on the platform, despite announcing it will pipe snippets of NBC's Live Olympics coverage. Snapchat spokesperson said users have not demanded the feature and the company doesn't see many uses for them. However, users will reportedly be able to opt for notifications of future Live broadcasts.
