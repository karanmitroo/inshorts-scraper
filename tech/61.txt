US-based digital publishing startup LittleThings has announced it will shut operations and blamed it on Facebook's News Feed changes, that came in January. LittleThings CEO Joe Speiser said Facebook's update, which put the focus on posts from friends and family, cut LittleThings' organic traffic by 75%. "No previous algorithm update ever came close to this level of decimation," he added.
