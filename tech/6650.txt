Technology giant Microsoft has released a musical style advertisement for its Surface Pro 4 convertible laptop, where it trolls Apple's MacBook and calls it "less useful like a hat for your cat." In the advertisement, Microsoft also labels MacBook "slower, heavier, and a bit square." Earlier this month, Microsoft took a jibe on Apple's iPad Pro in a commercial.
