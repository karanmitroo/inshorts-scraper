Puma has developed a four-wheeled robot, called BeatBot, that is programmed to race against athletes. Runners can pre-determine the robot’s pace via a mobile app that monitors the revolution of its wheels to know how fast it’s going. According to Puma, the self-driving, line-following robot, featuring nine built-in infrared sensors, is capable of hitting the speed levels of Usain Bolt.
