Samsung has introduced Bedtime VR Stories, an app that allows parents to read bedtime stories to their children remotely in virtual reality. The parent puts on Samsung's Gear VR headset and the child wears a Google Cardboard headset to enter the same 360Â° story-telling environment and interact with each other. The prototype app is currently being tested in the UK.
