WordPress.com, and blogs hosted by WordPress are currently inaccessible to users in Pakistan, in what seems an apparent ban by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). If confirmed, it will add to the list of websites that were temporarily blocked in Pakistan, including YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Wikipedia, because of blasphemous content. Self-hosted WordPress blogs are still working.
