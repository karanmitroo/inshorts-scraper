Google on Friday acquired New York-based video editing company Fly Labs to incorporate the latter's technology into the Google Photos app. Fly Labsâ€™ four iOS apps, to be available for next three months, lets users edit videos via simple swiping and tapping gestures. Currently, Google Photos does not support editing but it does create automatic videos of existing media.
