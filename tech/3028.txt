Apple unveiled new operating system iOS 11 on Monday, that adds a 'Do Not Disturb' mode to iPhones, meant to be used while driving a car. The mode makes the iPhone screen go completely dark until the user reaches the destination. If someone texts the user while driving, the person will get an automated text saying the user is driving.
