Elon Musk-led electric car making startup Tesla has released a video which shows how it looks like from the inside of a car when it fully drives itself. While the car's steering can be seen moving on its own, three different camera views show the car detecting lanes, people, traffic lights, other cars, signs and houses on the road.
