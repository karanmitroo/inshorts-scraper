Googleâ€™s newest smartphones, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, come with first-ever built-in eSIM technology to authenticate a user's cellular account without needing to insert a SIM card. However, eSIM functionality will be limited to subscribers on Google's Project Fi until other carriers adopt the new technology. Both devices still have a nano-SIM slot to insert physical SIM cards.
