Technology firm Oracle on Saturday said that its proposed $9.3 billion acquisition of cloud storage major NetSuite will move forward as over half of eligible NetSuite shareholders backed the bid by deadline. The deal will be completed on Monday, Oracle added. Earlier, Oracle had warned that it would terminate the proposal to buy NetSuite if it didnâ€™t get sufficient shares.
