India-born US inventor Dr Shiva Ayyadurai has claimed that he invented the full email system in 1978 and not the recently deceased Ray Tomlinson. He argued that Tomlinson's internal messaging experiment could only send text messages between computers, which is not email. He said Tomlinson's employer “rewrote history as it serves to enhance their brand in the lucrative cyber-security market”.
