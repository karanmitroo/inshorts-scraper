Facebook is facing flak for blocking a picture of a nearly 500-year-old statue of Roman god Neptune, claiming it was "explicitly sexual."

Facebook earlier said its image concentrated "unnecessarily on body parts," but later apologised for the censorship and said the image did not violate its policies.
