Cloud software company Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff on Tuesday said, "Without Twitter, I don't think you would have President-elect Trump." Benioff, who disclosed that Salesforce did not make a bid to acquire Twitter because of opposition from its shareholders, added, "I think it's a great company... As evidenced by this election, I think it's more important than ever."
