Apple on Thursday apologised to its customers for slowing down older versions of its iPhones with software updates. The company claimed the changes were meant to prevent unexpected shutdowns and that it "would never do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product." Apple is being sued for fraud and deception over the issue in several countries.
