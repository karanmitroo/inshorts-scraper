Google on Sunday paid tribute to all fathers across the world by putting out an animated doodle celebrating Father’s Day. The animated doodle is dedicated to fathers of all species, including a male penguin, a male fox, a cat, and a man with their offspring. The doodle had a similar theme to that of Mothers’ Day last May.
