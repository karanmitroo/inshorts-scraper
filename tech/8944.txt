A US startup has developed a $130 printer 'LifePrint', which lets users print videos, Apple Live Photos, Vines and GIFs in 30 seconds. Connected through an app, the printer prints normal photos as well as Augmented Reality photos from both Android and iOS smartphones. The printed pictures come alive when placed in front of the smartphone's camera.
