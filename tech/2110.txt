Anonymous feedback platform Sarahah's Founder ZainAlabdin Tawfiq in a recent interview said, if an anonymous message sender violates the rules of the app, "we may be forced to reveal the details of the sender". Previously third-party platforms claimed they could reveal usernames of anonymous Sarahah senders at the click of a button. However, the claims were found to be fake.
