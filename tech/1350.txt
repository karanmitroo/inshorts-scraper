Technology giant Apple's Co-founder Steve Wozniak has said that there is "way too much hype" around Tesla, at a recent conference in Las Vegas, US. Adding that Tesla has embedded in people's mind that its cars "will just drive themselves totally," Wozniak said, the idea is far from the truth. He further said the electric carmaker has "deceived" its customers.
