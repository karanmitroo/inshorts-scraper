The first detailed images of the asteroid UW-158, which recently passed by the Earth, have been obtained by The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The asteroid has a very odd shape, “much like an unshelled walnut,” and has a diameter of 300 by 600 meters. It "rotates very rapidly, once every 37 minutes,” on its own axis.
