US-based design firm Elago has created a smartwatch stand priced at $15 (about ₹ 1,000) that makes Apple Watches look like a miniature Macintosh computer. The silicon stand works with both, 38 mm and 42 mm versions of Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watches. It supports Apple’s nightstand mode, letting the watch be used as a bedside alarm.
