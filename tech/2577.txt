Korean startup Screw Bar has launched an iPhone app called 'Gudak' that lets users see the pictures they've taken only after three days. To simulate an old Kodak analogue camera, Gudak reduces the size of the viewfinder by 95% and provides users with a 'roll' of 24 photos. Users are made to wait 12 hours to start a fresh roll.
