A forum of IT workers is set to get itself formally registered as the first union of techies in the country. Vice President of the Forum for Information Technology Employees, Vasumathi, said the forum is expecting this to happen within next five months. The move has come following reports of "illegal termination" of employees by major IT companies in India.
