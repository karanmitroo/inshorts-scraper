A new Firefox and Google Chrome browser extension, Reaction Packs, allows users to swap Facebook's built-in ‘Reactions’ emojis with its own sets of custom emojis. These sets include themes like Pokémon, Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Facebook recently launched ‘Reactions’ as an alternative to its ‘Like’ button that lets users express emotions like love, sadness and anger.
