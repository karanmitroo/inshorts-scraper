Peder Dinkelspiel from Sweden has created a 32-inch screen for his living room wall that displays the latest tweets by US President Donald Trump. The display uses electronic ink technology to show the most recent Trump tweet on a paper-like background. Called 'Sign of the Times,' the screen automatically updates through Wi-Fi every five minutes.
