Food chain KFC has released a limited edition meal box in India called 'Watt A Box', that lets users charge their mobile phones. The box includes an Android or iOS charging cable and claims to have an in-built 6,100 mAh battery for charging a user's phone. However, the boxes aren't for sale and can only be won through a contest.
