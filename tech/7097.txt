Spaceflight company Virgin Galactic has obtained licence from the US Federal Aviation Administration for flight-testing its commercial spaceplane SpaceShipTwo. The spaceplane is designed to take passengers into the sub-orbital space. SpaceShipTwo is the second version of the original spaceplane, which suffered a crash during a test flight in October 2014.
