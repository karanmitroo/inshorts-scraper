SpaceX Founder Elon Musk on Friday proposed a travel system using interplanetary rockets to travel anywhere on Earth under an hour at around the same price of an economy airline ticket. He added that it will allow passengers to take most long-distance trips in just 30 minutes. With the new system, travelling from Tokyo to Delhi will take 30 minutes.
