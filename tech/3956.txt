A Swedish startup has built a â‚¹10,000 device called 'Titan Note' that allows taking notes by converting the speech into text in real-time. The converted text is sent to an app that allows summarising, translating, editing and sharing of text. The device also doubles up as a speaker and features a USB port allowing up to two smartphone charges.
