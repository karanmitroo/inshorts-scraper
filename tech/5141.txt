To mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, technology giant Microsoft has announced new tools for Office apps like Word and PowerPoint. Artificial intelligence will be used to recognise and describe objects in photos which the computer can then read out loud for blind users. Microsoft has said the descriptions will get better as more people use the tool.
