The Delhi High Court has said that children's rights are completely non-negotiable even if they are involved in a heinous crime. The observation came while the court expressed "pain" over the "ignorant" way in which a sessions court handled a juvenile's rights in a murder case. Acquitting the minor, the court suggested training trial court judges regarding juvenile laws.
