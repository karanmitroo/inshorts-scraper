Facebook's board has proposed removing founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's majority voting control in the event of him resigning from the leadership position. Currently, his shares collectively represent about 53.8% of total outstanding voting power. The proposed move, to be voted on June 20, is designed to make sure a future Facebook chief's management powers aren't limited, the board said.
