Banibrata Mukherjee, Associate Professor (Dept. of Physics) and his student Indrani Banerjee from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore have successfully applied Einstein's gravity theory to unravel the mysteries of black holes. Their research, published in the International Journal Physics Review Letters, proves that the mass and spin of a black hole are interdependent rather than independent as earlier believed.
