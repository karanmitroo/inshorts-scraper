The Japanese government is set to begin testing a system that would allow foreign tourists to verify their identities and purchase goods and services using a fingerprint. The experiment would feature fingerprint scanners at popular tourist centers including souvenir shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments. The government aims to launch it by the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.
