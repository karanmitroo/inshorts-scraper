Since the launch of the 'Delhi Police Lost Report' app on Feb-28, more than 5.5 lakh people have used the application to report the loss or theft of items like mobile phones, passports and PAN cards. The app spares people the trouble of physically going to police stations. Delhi Police will also be launching an app for reporting vehicle theft.
