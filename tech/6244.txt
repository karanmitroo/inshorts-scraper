Mobile operating system Android was initially created and developed by a startup Android Inc., which was later acquired by tech giant Google in 2005 for a reported $50 million. The first version of Android was launched 8 years ago on September 23, 2008, and the operating system presently accounts for nearly 80% of the mobile OS market share globally.
