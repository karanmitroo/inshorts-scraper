A satellite launched by NASA earlier this year has found the new coldest place on earth. The lowest recorded temperature in the desolate and remote ice plateau in East Antarctica is -93.2 degree Celsius (-135 degree Fahrenheit). This beats the previous record of -89.2 degrees Celsius measured at the Vostok Research Station in East Antarctica on July 21, 1983.
