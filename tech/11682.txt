Facebook has announced an aggressive expansion of its internet.org program that aims to provide free web access to 100 developing countries of the world this year. The project is similar to Google's Project Loon and Titan, and partners with internet, mobile and data providers to bring "core areas" of the internet to people in developing countries.
