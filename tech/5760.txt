A new $25 iPhone case called 'Explo-Sung' makes Apple smartphones look like exploded Samsung Note 7 handsets. It fits all the iPhone 5 and above models and features the Samsung logo on the back. Made by company UniqFind, which has previously made black and white marble-like covers for MacBooks, the iPhone case will start shipping in November.
