American media company ZeniMax has doubled the damages it is asking for from Facebook's Oculus VR to $4 billion, $2 billion in compensation and $2 billion in punitive damages. ZeniMax claims that Oculus VR and its founder Palmer Luckey stole fundamental virtual reality technologies from it. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had earlier defended Oculus in court against its VR rival.
