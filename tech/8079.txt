Apple has removed an app titled System and Security Info, from its App Store that informed users if their phone software was authentic and if their phones have been jailbroken without consent. Apple told developer Stefan Esser that the app provided “potentially inaccurate and misleading diagnostic functionality for iOS devices.” In response, Esser termed the app removal as “selective punishment”.
