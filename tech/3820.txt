Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco, which fired nearly 80% of its workforce in India earlier this month, is reportedly selling its 49-acre Silicon Valley property to ride out a cash crunch. LeEco had bought the property from Yahoo less than a year ago to house about 12,000 employees. The US site will reportedly be sold to a developer for $260 million.
