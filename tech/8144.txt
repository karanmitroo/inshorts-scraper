Apple on Tuesday received a patent for a flexible display spread across the folding panels of an iPad cover. The panels will display various notifications or reminders and let users play, pause, fast forward, rewind media through a touch-sensitive area. It would also let users input handwritten notes and drawings to the tablet through a stylus.
