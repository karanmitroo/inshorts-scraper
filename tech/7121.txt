A hacker has put information of 200 million alleged Yahoo user accounts on the dark web for sale. Yahoo said it is "aware" of the hacker's claims, but did not confirm or deny the legitimacy of the data. The hacker named 'Peace', who had previously sold Myspace and LinkedIn's account information, is selling the data for three Bitcoins (roughly $1,800).
