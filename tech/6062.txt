Google, which unveiled its Pixel smartphone on Tuesday, has trolled rival Apple's latest smartphone iPhone 7 in its advertisement for the handset. While showing the features of the Pixel phone, the advertisement read, "3.5mm jack satisfyingly not new" followed by an "ahem ahem" voice. Notably, the newly-launched iPhone 7 does not have a headphone jack.
