Japanese scientists Tuesday unveiled what they said was the world's first news-reading android. The scientists unveiled two androids-  "Kodomoroid" and "Otonaroid" - who will work at Tokyo's National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, interacting with visitors. "You can take my androids on planes -- the torso in the suitcase and the head in carry-on," said android expert Hiroshi Ishiguro.
