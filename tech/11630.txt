Facebook Wednesday removed the 'feeling fat' status update option, after 16,000 people criticized it by signing the 'Remove the "Feeling Fat" Emoticon Option' petition on change.org. "Fat is not a feeling. Fat is a natural part of our bodies...", the petition read. The chubby cheeked 'feeling fat' emoji is now used to represent 'feeling stuffed' option on Facebook.
