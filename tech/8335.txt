Taiwanese company Acer on Thursday unveiled Xplova X5, the latest version of its cycling computer series. Apart from displaying important metrics like cycling speed and heart rate, the device features a wide-screen camera that can start recording when the rider's heart rate increases. It also lets cyclists automatically capture three-second video clips based on certain pre-determined parameters.
