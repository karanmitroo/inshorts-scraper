A Netherlands-based court has allowed technology major Microsoft to keep the â‚¹20 crore license fee mistakenly paid to it by the Dutch police. In 2008, the police accidentally ordered 13,656 licenses for a special edition of MS Office, but later sued Microsoft to cancel the purchase. The court deemed it irrelevant that police hasn't activated most of the licenses.
