YouTube on Thursday launched a custom blurring tool that allows users to blur out any object in their videos. The desktop tool also works on moving items and keeps them blurred as they travel around. The feature is aimed at letting people protect sensitive information like license plates and credit card numbers. Notably, YouTube already offers users a face-blurring tool.
