Elon Musk-led space exploration startup SpaceX on Sunday successfully launched its Dragon spacecraft which will deliver nearly 2,500 kg of cargo to International Space Station for NASA. Dragon spacecraft is also carrying strains of the MRSA superbug to study its behaviour in microgravity. The launch was conducted from the same pad used for NASA's first manned mission to the moon.
