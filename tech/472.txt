Microblogging site Twitter has introduced an 'India Gate' emoji ahead of the nation's Republic Day on January 26, and it will reportedly remain live on the platform until January 29. The emoji appears when a user types hashtags including '#RepublicDay' and '#HappyRepublicDay' while composing a tweet, and is available for posts in nine languages.
