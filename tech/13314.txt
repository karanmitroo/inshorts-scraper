The USB Promoter Group, consisting of 6 leading technology companies- HP, Intel, Microsoft, Renesas Electronics, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments, has released the new USB 3.1 specification, which will double the existing 5Gbps-speed of USB 3.0 which itself is ten times faster than USB 2.0. Notably, USB 3.0 ports have been slow at gaining popularity despite being backward compatible.
