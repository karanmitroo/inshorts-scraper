Less than a week after the torrent search website 'Torrentz' shut down after 13 years of service, a clone website has surfaced online. The clone, 'Torrentz2.eu' temporarily displayed "We will always love you Torrentz. Goodbye." on its homepage. In July, torrent files provider KickassTorrents was shut down and its alleged founder was arrested by the US.
