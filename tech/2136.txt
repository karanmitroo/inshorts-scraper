Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday posted that Facebook "will take down threats of physical harm" in response to the recent violence at a white nationalists rally in Virginia. Adding that the last few days have been "hard to process" for him, Zuckerberg said, "It's a disgrace that we still need to say that neo-Nazis and white supremacists are wrong."
