Starting from Tuesday, Twitter's iOS application would be able to auto play Periscope live streams on its timeline and would go full screen when clicked. Earlier, users had to click through to another window on the phones to view such videos. Periscope is a live video streaming smartphone application that was acquired by Twitter in 2015 before its public launch.
