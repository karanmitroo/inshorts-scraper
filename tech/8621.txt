MIT researchers have recently developed a system that can help eliminate traffic lights, thus reducing waiting time and emissions. The proposed system functions like the one used by air-traffic control, as every vehicle that approaches an intersection automatically requests access from the traffic system. The vehicle then receives its assigned 'time slot' to pass through that intersection.
