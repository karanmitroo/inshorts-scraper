Apple has sent an application to the government, seeking its approval to import and sell refurbished iPhones in India. It also plans to set up a facility in India to renew used iPhones shipped from China. The government last year turned down Apple's request to sell refurbished iPhones and iPads, saying that it will add to the country's electronic waste.
