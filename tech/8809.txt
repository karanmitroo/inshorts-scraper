Kodak has launched ‘Kodak Moments’, an iOS app that aims at becoming a visual storytelling platform rather than a standard image sharing service. The ad-free app allows users to not only store personal pictures, but also write stories associated with them. Further, users can also print pictures directly from within the app. Kodak Moments is currently available in the US.
