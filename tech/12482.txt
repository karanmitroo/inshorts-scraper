Indian tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have found a new hub in Canada. It is mainly because of the Canadian policies which make it easier to get a permanent residence in the country. More than 1,30,000 visitor visas for Canada were issued to Indians in 2013. Tech firms like Amazon, FB and Microsoft have also set up campuses in Canada.
