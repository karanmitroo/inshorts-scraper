Software firm SplashData released the annual 2013 edition of "Worst Passwords" list, and for the first time, '123456' has reached the top spot replacing 'password'. It was in second place for the past two years. Some other worst ones are 'qwerty', 'abc123', '111111', 'iloveyou' etc. The list was compiled after combing through millions of passwords leaked online.
