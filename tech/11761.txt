Google has introduced a new feature in the UK which allows people to transfer money to others, over email. Google account holders can transfer money from their own Wallet to a contact's Wallet, in the form of a normal attachment. This service was started in the US in 2013. The recipient needn't have a Gmail account for the money transfer.
