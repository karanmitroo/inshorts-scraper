South Korean electronics major Samsung on Monday revealed that two issues in the battery, deflections in the negative electrode and internal short circuit, caused the explosions in Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. To avoid such issues in its future devices, Samsung has introduced an 8-point battery safety check. Samsung killed its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device last year due to explosions.
