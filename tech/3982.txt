Melbourne-based art auction house Mossgreen has accused Facebook of "living in the 1950s" after it banned a nude painting called 'Women Lovers' by an Australian artist. Facebook said that the gallery's attempt to promote a collection of works to be auctioned was violating guidelines by advertising "adult products or services including toys, videos or sexualising enhancement products."
