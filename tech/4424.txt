Google's short film Pearl has become the first Virtual Reality-compatible film to be nominated for an Oscar. A specially-made theatrical version of the film has qualified for an Academy Award in the best animated short film category. The 6-minute-long film is set entirely inside a hatchback car and revolves around the lives of a travelling musician and his daughter.
