Researchers have combined muscles from a sea slug's mouth with flexible 3D printed body parts to build 'biohybrid' robots. The benefits of using slug muscles is that they are adaptable to saline environments and can perform lengthier tasks than traditional robots that use batteries. Swarms of such 'biohybrids' could potentially be released to search the ocean floor for black boxes.
