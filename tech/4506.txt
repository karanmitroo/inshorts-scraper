Y Combinator President Sam Altman and his team have developed a website called Track Trump to monitor whether Donald Trump delivers on his campaign promises in the first 100 days of presidency. The website tracks Trump's progress in eight categories including immigration, trade, and health care that the US President had outlined in "Donald Trump's Contract with the American Voter."
