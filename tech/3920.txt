Costa Rican film distributor Romaly has built a clone website of torrent platform KickassTorrents to troll people who illegally download movies. Named 'LegalTorrents', the website contains images, screenshots, IMDb rating and download links to movies. However, on clicking the download link, it plays a trailer of the movie accompanied by a message warning against the negative effects of piracy.
