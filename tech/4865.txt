California Attorney General has filed charges of pimping and money laundering against the CEO and Co-founders of classifieds website Backpage, reviving a case that was dismissed earlier this month. The complaint alleges the defendants created other sites to increase the company's prostitution-related revenue and used photographs of victims without their knowledge.
