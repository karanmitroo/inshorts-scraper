Japanese designers 'The Hoshinchu Team' have created a floating bonsai tree whose magnetic base allows it to levitate. The 'Air Bonsai', consists of two partsâ€“an 'energy base' and a mossy ball called 'little star'. Both halves have installed magnets, allowing the little star with the bonsai on top to float. Interestingly, the bonsai can be replaced with any plant.
