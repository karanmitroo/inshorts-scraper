A Canada-based designer has created the 'Aumi Mini' USB-powered nightlight that can be connected to Wi-Fi to inform users of notifications on their smartphones. The light can be programmed to show 16 million colours to indicate notifications like emails, text messages, and social media mentions. Priced at about â‚¹1,500, the light can also flash red when the Wi-Fi is down.
