The GPS navigation of a woman reportedly directed her car down a boat ramp into the Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada on Thursday. The woman, depending upon her GPS for the right directions, was navigating through dense fog at the night. The woman escaped unhurt after she rolled down a window and left the car before it started sinking.
