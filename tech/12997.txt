Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has sold a private island in northwestern Washington state to undisclosed buyers for $8 million, his real estate agent said. The 292-acre (118 hectare) Allan Island had been on the market for nine years and sold on Friday for well below its original asking price of $20 million. Allen had bought the island in 1992.
