Google's Waymo recently received patent for technology that would soften a car's body in the event of a collision. The sensors change the rigidity of body panels, bumpers and the hood using underlying cables, rods or springs, called "tension members." During a human impact, the sensors would loosen those underpinnings and create a relatively gentle car surface that reduces injuries.
