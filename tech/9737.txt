Telecom operators including Airtel, Idea, and Reliance Jio have asked the TRAI to hold the auction of the premium 700Mhz spectrum band until “a strong device ecosystem” is developed for it. Airtel said that an immediate auction "will lead to under utilization of the spectrum...and block industry’s fund”. However, Telenor and Tata Teleservices are in the favour of the auction.
