A minor planet has been named after Vishwanathan Anand, Indiaâ€™s first chess grandmaster. The minor planet, now named as Vishyanand, was previously identified as planet 4538 and is located between Mars and Jupiter. Anand now joins former world chess champions Alexander Alekhine and Anatoly Karpov, who too had received the same honour.
