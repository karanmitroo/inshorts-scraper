US-based startup Andromium has developed a $99 accessory called 'The Superbook' that claims to turn any Android smartphone into a laptop. The accessory, a laptop shell, provides a screen, keyboard, multi-touch trackpad, phone charging capabilities and eight hours of battery on a single charge. It allows users to create and edit documents, run apps installed on phone and write programs.
