An artificial intelligence robot called 'AI-MATHS' took a college entrance exam in China this week and scored a 'below average' grade despite finishing faster than humans. The robot scored 105 points out of 150 in 22 minutes without internet, while humans take two hours to complete it. Beijing students who took the maths exam last year scored 109 on average.
