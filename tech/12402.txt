To help farmers combat drought, NASA scientists including one of Indian-origin, have developed Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, which will predict extremity of droughts and help farmers to maximize crop production. There is no ground-based or satellite-based global network for monitoring soil moisture at a local level at present.
