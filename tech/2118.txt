E-commerce giant Amazon filed a patent earlier this week for its delivery drones to drop off packages without having to land. The patent describes a chute extending from the drone to a drop-off point such as a porch that would let the package slide through it. The system could also make it easier to deliver packages during unfavourable weather.
