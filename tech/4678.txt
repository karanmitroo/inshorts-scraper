Irish startup FoodMarble has made a digestive tracker called 'Aire' which claims to tell users which food is incompatible with their body and gives them gas. Aire analyses a user's breath after eating simple carbohydrates to check how their body responds. Using the results, Aire can tell users which food to avoid to prevent problems like bloating, diarrhoea and constipation.
