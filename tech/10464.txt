Sony’s support page has claimed its smartphones cannot be used underwater. The page claimed that the phones were tested in a laboratory in 1.5 meter-deep fresh-water for 30 minutes in the standby mode, without assessing the possible environmental factors. Waterproofing is the Xperia line’s key selling point, with the Z5 claiming the highest possible IP68 water and dust resistance rating.
