US-based startup Doppler Labs has sued audio equipment major Bose for copying technology used in the startup's sound-isolating 'Here Buds'. The lawsuit claims that a senior Bose executive backed Doppler’s Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign "to gain early access to a competitor’s technology”. The suit also alleges that Bose's earphones named 'Hearphones' infringe on Doppler’s 'Here Buds' trademark.
