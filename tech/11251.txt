Google and Twitter announced a partnership to display tweets in search results, renewing a tie-up that ended in 2011 on Tuesday. The move is expected to help Twitter boost user engagement after a period of slack growth and Google get real-time results in its search queries. The deal will start with search results within the Google app and mobile Web.
