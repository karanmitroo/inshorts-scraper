A team of English engineers have developed a drone defence gun 'SkyWall 100' which captures unwanted drones in a range of 100 metres by firing nets at them. The gun weighs around 10 kilogram and uses a smart scope that automatically calibrates the droneâ€™s speed and distance to fire net. Once trapped, a parachute brings the drone to the ground.
