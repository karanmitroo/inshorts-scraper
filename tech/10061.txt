Facebook on Monday launched 'Instant Articles' on Android in India to allow users to access feature-rich content from local publishers. Content from India Today, The Quint, Aaj Tak, Hindustan Times, and The Indian Express will be hosted by Facebook and will load in the application itself. Until now, Instant Articles was available on iOS in the US and Western Europe.
