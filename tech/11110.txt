Copies of Islamic State's English-language propaganda magazine, Dabiq, were found available for sale on the website of online retailer Amazon. Four different volumes of the magazine were being sold in paperback form on the site in the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.  The company, however, removed the product from its listings on Saturday.
