Facebook has censored Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Matthew Caruana Galizia for publishing a series of posts alleging corruption by Malta's PM Joseph Muscat and his associates. Galizia, who was a member of the team that published 'Panama Papers', was temporarily locked out of his Facebook account over four posts, which were deleted for violating the social network's community standards.
