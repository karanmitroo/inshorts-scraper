Researchers at the MIT and Eni, the Italian energy company, have used genetically engineered virus that significantly increases the efficiency of solar cells by improving its light-harvesting capabilities. Using an effect known as Quantum Goldilocks Effect, the genetically engineered viruses were made to mimic the process of photosynthesis. The viral strain that mimicked the best was selected.
