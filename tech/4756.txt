A US-based startup has created 'GeniCan', a smart accessory that can be attached to a garbage can to scan barcodes on products thrown and add them to a shopping list on a connected smartphone app. Products without barcodes can be added by using voice recognition. GeniCan operates on AA batteries and has been priced at $125 (about â‚¹8,500).
