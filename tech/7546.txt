A US-based startup has developed a $599 personal health robot for home called 'Pillo'. The artificial intelligence-based robot recognises family members and manages their medicines by storing, dispensing, and ordering refills. While it can wirelessly connect with other smart devices, the robot also answers health and wellness questions and connects users to healthcare professionals.
