Samsung is wrongly recalling old Galaxy smartphones instead of Galaxy Note 7, according to a new report. The confusion came to light after the owner of a three-year-old Galaxy Note 4 device received a Samsung safety warning asking him to surrender his device over exploding battery issue. The Note 4 owner was using Note 7 ROM on his older device.
