Twitter users panicked after an internet hoax was started by a YouTuber who claimed to have single-handedly convinced Twitter to shut down in 2017 because of abuse and cyberbullying. Users reacted with tweets like, "I use Twitter more than...the toilet. Don't shut it down. Please", and "Twitter is everything. I'll die without it", following which #SaveTwitter was a global trend.
