Facebook has discontinued its location-sharing feature in Italy after a court ruled that the social networking giant had violated copyright laws by copying local startup Business Competence's app. The Italian software developer filed a lawsuit in 2013, accusing Facebook's Nearby feature which helps users locate Facebook friends close to their area, of being copied from its Faround application.
