Instagram is set to launch 'Highlights' wherein users will receive a feed via email of the best photos from the people they follow. The four and a half-year-old venture is looking to re-engage its long-time users. The feature would also enable its users to filter their content enabling them to see more of their 'real' friends' posts.
