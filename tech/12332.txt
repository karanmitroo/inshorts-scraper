Following the recent celebrity photo leak disaster, Apple has tightened its technological security so that not even the company can pry into a password-protected iPhone or iPad. The additional security is a part of Apple's latest mobile software, iOS 8, which was released Wednesday. Earlier this month, personal photos of many celebrities stored on the company's iCloud service, were leaked.
