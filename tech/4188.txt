Microsoft Co-founder and world's richest person Bill Gates in 2015 sponsored a machine that turns human waste into drinking water and electricity. The project, called the Omniprocessor, was later installed as a pilot project in Senegal in West Africa. Gates undertook the initiative to be able to 'reinvent the sewage treatment plant'.
