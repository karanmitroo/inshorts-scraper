Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota on Monday unveiled a $400 palm-sized robot baby called 'Kirobo Mini', which aims to give company to childless women in the country. The 10 cm-long robot blinks its eyes and speaks with a baby-like high-pitched voice. It comes with a cradle that doubles as a baby seat designed to fit in a car's cup holder.
