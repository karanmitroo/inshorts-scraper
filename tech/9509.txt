The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has criticised Facebook for turning the regulatory body's public consultation on the validity of the zero-rating platform ‘Free Basics’ into a “majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll.” TRAI asked FB whether its users responding to TRAI were making "informed decisions.” Earlier, TRAI banned the service over differential pricing for data usage.
