German mobile operator T-Mobile's CEO John Legere in a tweet claimed to send a person to Mars through Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket, if he gets one million retweets by his birthday on October 11. In case a trip to Mars is not commercially available, the person will get $200,000. Notably, Musk estimates a ticket to Mars will cost $200,000.
