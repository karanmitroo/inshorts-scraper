National Geographic Channel will premiere a documentary on Indiaâ€™s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) on the second anniversary of its launch. The documentary, a Miditech production, will reportedly trace the 650 million kilometer-long journey of MOM, also known as Mangalyaan, as it became the cheapest project to the red planet ever. ISRO launched the probe from Sriharikota on November 5, 2013.
