Technology giant Google has announced that it has agreed to a patent cross-licensing deal with China's Tencent Holdings amid its push to enter the Chinese market. Google also said the tie-in with Tencent is "long-term" and covers "a broad range of products and technologies". This comes in the light of Google's Search, Play Store, and services remaining blocked in China.
