To express solidarity with Paris after Friday's terrorist attack, YouTube has replaced the red background in its logo with the colours of the French flag. The changed homepage icon redirects users to a dedicated video section titled 'We Stand with Paris', which the website's landing page also displays. Further, Google's France homepage commemorates the victims by sporting the black ribbon.
