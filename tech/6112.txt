A US court on Friday ordered Apple to pay $302.4 million to US-based VirnetX for infringing two patents related to its internet security technology. In the case that originally began in 2010, Apple was found to have used the patented technology for its FaceTime video-conferencing feature. The technology giant will face another trial over whether it wilfully infringed the patents.
