Google is releasing a new version of Chrome browser that would allow users to right-click and permanently mute websites that autoplay audio and video while scrolling. This replaces the previous "mute tab" feature that was released temporarily in beta versions. Google is also adding HDR support to Chrome for Windows-running PCs that have an HDR compatible monitor and graphics card.
