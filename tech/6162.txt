SpaceX Founder Elon Musk on Tuesday said the company was working to reduce the cost of a Mars trip from $10 billion per person to around $200,000, which is the median house price in US. To improve the costs by "five million percent", Musk has suggested methods like reusable ships, refilling in orbit, and using inexpensive methane as fuel.
