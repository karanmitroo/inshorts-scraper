Researchers at MalwareHunterTeam have discovered a ransomware called 'nRansomware' that demands nude pictures from the users to unlock their devices. The ransomware asks the users to create an account using '@protonmail.com' domain name and send at least 10 nude pictures. The ransomware then sends a code to unlock the device only after verifying that the pictures belong to the user.
