Sydney-based architect Alex Symes has created a $65,000 one-bedroom home that comes packed in a flat package. With the help of a drill, a hammer and a wrench, two persons can build the home within a few days. It comes with bed, running water and a plumbed bathroom. Fitted with solar panels, the home creates more energy than it uses.
