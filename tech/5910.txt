Twitter has announced a new feature on its live video-sharing platform Periscope, called Periscope Producer, aiming to enable brands and companies to share ‘professional, produced live video.’ Currently, Periscope only streams from consumer camera devices, most of which are smartphones. Twitter has reportedly partnered with brands like Disney, Louis Vuitton, and Sky News for the same.
