An Israeli man Oded Ben-Dov has created a touch-free smartphone 'Sesame' for the specially abled, that operates by recognising the user's head motions and voice. While the head movements control the cursor, the voice turns the smartphone on or off, as commanded. The technology has been combined with Google's Android-powered Nexus 5 smartphone.
