WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange has threatened to release a set of documents every week until November 7, which claim to expose US Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the military, the oil industry, and Google. In his 2014 book 'When Google Met WikiLeaks', Assange accused ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt of having ties to the State Department when Clinton was Secretary of State.
