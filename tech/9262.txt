Samsung has unveiled the first prototype of its 'safety truck', a technology for trucks that prevents road accidents during overtaking. The truck's back has been installed with four Samsung OH46D video walls that display the road ahead through two built-in front cameras. Specially-designed Ingematica transportation software platform transmits the video of the road ahead to the video walls.
