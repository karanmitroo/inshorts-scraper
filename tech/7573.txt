Virgin Group-owned chain of health clubs 'Virgin Active' has developed what it claims to be the first drone that helps in tennis training. Called the 'Drone-ovic', the drone is capable of dropping balls from angles and heights which are not achievable by ball machines. It also features a 4K camera that allows players to analyse technical aspects of their game.
