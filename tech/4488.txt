Social media platform Reddit's CEO and Co-founder Steve Huffman has said that he got corrective laser eye surgery to survive the world's end. "If the world ends...getting contacts or glasses is going to be a huge pain in the ass...Without them, I'm f**ked," he said. The 33-year-old also admits to stocking guns and food to prepare for such a scenario.
