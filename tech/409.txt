E-commerce giant Amazon has opened a rainforest-like office called 'The Spheres' in Seattle, US. The structure is reportedly made of three connected spheres constructed from glass and steel, and can accommodate up to 800 people. The Spheres feature walls which are vertical gardens with over 25,000 plants woven into 4,000 square feet of mesh.
