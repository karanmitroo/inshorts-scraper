After the launch of the OnePlus3 last month, the company opened its offline popup stores to let customers experience the OnePlus3 in person. People reportedly waited for 8-10 hours to experience the device, particularly the latest "Dash Charge" technology which charges 60% of the battery in 30 minutes. The stores, opened in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, witnessed over 800 attendees.
