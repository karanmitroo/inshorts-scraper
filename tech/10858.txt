Motorola has reportedly sent out invitations for a possible launch event of the third-generation Moto G and Moto X, that will be held on July 28. The Delhi event is expected to be followed by those in London, Sao Paulo and New York. A recent accidental listing of the 3rd-gen Moto G on Flipkart also hinted at an expected launch.
