Korean electronics companies, LG and Samsung, are launching TVs in the US this week priced around $15000(expected) that have concave screens, where the middle bends away from the viewer; opposite of the convex bulge of the old cathode-ray tube TVs. The idea, the companies say, is to have the viewer see the screen straight on, even at the edges.
