A German court has ruled against a 19-year-old Syrian refugee who sued Facebook for failing to remove posts linking him to terrorism. The posts used a picture of the refugee taking a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel at a refugee shelter. The court ruled that Facebook is neither a "perpetrator nor a participant" in the "undisputable defamation" by its users.
