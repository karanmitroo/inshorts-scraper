Chinese company 90Fun has developed a self-balancing suitcase called the 'Puppy 1' that follows its user around. The suitcase can either constantly follow a person around or be summoned by easily setting up the auto-following mode through remote control. The suitcase has been developed in partnership with two-wheel scooter maker Segway.
