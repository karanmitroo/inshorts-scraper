American smartphone maker Motorola in its new advertisement for modular phone Moto Z has taken a jibe at no headphone jack in rival Apple's iPhone 7. Motorola claims in the advertisement that smartphones haven't changed since 2007 and says, "The camera got a little better, the headphone jack moved". Notably, the iPhone 7 does not have a headphone jack.
