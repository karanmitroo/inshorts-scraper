Facebook on Tuesday launched the beta version of a social virtual reality app called 'Facebook Spaces' that lets users hang out with friends in an interactive virtual environment. It allows to draw, watch 360Â° videos, make video calls on Messenger and take selfies in the virtual environment. Currently launched on Oculus, the app will soon launch on other VR platforms.
