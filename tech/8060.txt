Stanford researchers have demonstrated that telephone metadata – information about calls and text messages, including time and length – can reveal sensitive personal information. For this, the team developed a smartphone application that retrieved the phone's metadata, helping the researchers to infer users' sensitive information such as their health details or whether the user owns a gun or not.
