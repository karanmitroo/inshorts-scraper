A student of the IIT Delhi, Ambar Srivastava, has developed a mobile phone-size haemoglobin metre dubbed the ‘TrueHb Hemometer’ - the first case of an innovation from the institute's biomedical engineering department actually getting "productized". The device, which has been validated by AIIMS for its efficacy, is expected to help identify and tackle anaemia effectively.
