Japanese company Emonster has sued Apple in the US, alleging that it stole the term 'Animoji' for its newly launched iPhone X. In the lawsuit, Emonster said that Apple has wilfully and deliberately infringed on its trademark. Apple announced the Animoji feature in iPhone X in September which uses face-scanning feature to create customised 3D versions of emoji.
