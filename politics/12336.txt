An Indian Express investigation claims that several top politicians across the political spectrum have failed to declare the actual value of their immovable assets. For example, UPA Chairperson, Sonia Gandhi mentioned in 2004 and 2009 declarations that the value of her land in Mehrauli (Delhi) was Rs 2.19 lakh, whereas its real value was estimated to be 8.37 crore.
