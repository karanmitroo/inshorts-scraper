While campaigning for AAP's Amethi candidate Kumar Vishwas, party leader Arvind Kejriwal advised Amethi residents to accept bribes given to them by political parties but vote for 'jhaadu' (AAP's election symbol). "They will offer you cash, take it. It's your own hard earned money that they looted in 2G and the CWG scam. But don't vote for them," Kejriwal said.
