Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee "is not fighting with political parties, but rather with the Election Commission (EC)". "On the brink of defeat, the Trinamool has lost its senses, Mamata and her party have accepted defeat," Modi asserted. He was referring to Mamata's comments after the EC issued her a show-cause notice.
