BJP leader Subramanian Swamy slammed Rajinikanth for hinting to join politics, saying that the political situation in Tamil Nadu does not demand 'uneducated' candidates. "He has no idea about the constitution, fundamental rights or any such matter. It is better he sticks to cinema, since he can deliver dialogues well and entertain people," Swamy said.
