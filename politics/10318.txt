In a move to win Muslim votes, BJP chief Amit Shah stopped midway in his speech in Kolkata on Sunday, as the muezzin's call for prayers came from a mosque close by. "Let me stop for a while. Let it (the muezzin's call for azan) be completed. We don't want to give Mamata Banerjee an excuse against us," Shah said.
