Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Saturday that the BJP will not contest against the Shiv Sena for the Mayor or Deputy Mayor post in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Council (BMC). "We will not be in the opposition, we will support the ruling party but will not compromise on transparency," Fadnavis added.
