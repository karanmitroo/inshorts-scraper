After being sacked as AIADMK's Treasurer, Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam on Wednesday wrote to the bank asking it not to let anyone operate the party's account without his written consent. He referred to the party's bylaws stating that since the General Secretary was yet to be formally appointed, all previous office bearers continue to hold their posts.
