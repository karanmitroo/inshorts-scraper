The Madras High Court on Friday issued a notice to the Election Commission on petitions challenging the election of a DMK and AINRC candidate in the 2016 Tamil Nadu and Puducherry polls. While a voter has accused DMK MLA R Sakkarapani from Oddanchatram of bribing the voters, AINRC Puducherry MLA SV Sugumaran's election has been challenged by a DMK leader.
