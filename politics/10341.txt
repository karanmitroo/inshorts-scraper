The Congress, on Tuesday, bitterly opposed the decision of the Union Govt to rename a part of the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, as the NT Rama Rao Domestic Terminal, after the politician who founded the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Telangana CM Chandrashekhar Rao has also said that there is no sense for one airport to have differently-named sections.
