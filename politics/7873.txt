After CPI(M) leader Gautam Deb referred to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as a "thief", Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali said, "chop off the tongue and rip off the limbs" of those who said so. Meanwhile, TMC MP Derek O'Brien called Idris' comments "crass and unhealthy" and said, "Party does not endorse such views... Party will take appropriate action."
