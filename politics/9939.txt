Congress Friday issued a show-cause notice to former Union minister P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram, for praising PM Narendra Modi. The party has asked why he should not be expelled for his anti-party remarks at a meeting with his supporters in Chennai Thursday. This comes at a time when Congress functionary Janardhan Dwivedi is facing flak for hailing Modi.
