Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'notebandi' (demonetisation) decision has resulted in 'nasbandi' (vasectomy) of anti-national elements and black money hoarders. The decision was taken to "control the menace of terrorism, separatism and Naxalism," he said. The Minister added that PM Modi had asked for 50 days and after that, the situation would improve.
