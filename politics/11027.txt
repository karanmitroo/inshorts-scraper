Shiv Sena on Saturday expressed its opposition to the ambitious nuclear power project at Jaitapur in coastal Maharashtra, and said the party would continue with its stand on the issue. The project with six reactors, each with a capacity of 1650 MW, is coming up in the coastal district of Ratnagiri and has faced a stiff resistance from locals.
