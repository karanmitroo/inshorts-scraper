The Lok Sabha was adjourned till 2 pm on Tuesday afternoon after the Congress, Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party continued to protest heavily against issues like black money and FDI in the insurance sector, in an attempt to corner the NDA. TMC members took out black umbrellas with "bring back black money" written on them, and even blocked the entrance.
