Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has announced plans to host a lunch for Dalit families at his residence on August 28. He has invited families whom he had visited during his pre-election campaign in May. CM Siddaramaiah slammed the initiative, stating that it is a publicity stunt by the BJP to win Dalit votes in the upcoming Assembly elections.
