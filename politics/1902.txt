Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Tuesday the country's growth has slowed down primarily due to demonetisation announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 last year. "Private sector investment has collapsed and the economy is running on just one engine of public spending," Manmohan further said at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meet.
