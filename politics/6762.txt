The Centre on Wednesday lifted President's Rule from Uttarakhand after the Supreme Court earlier declared that Congress party's Harish Rawat had proved his majority in Tuesday's floor test. Rawat said that Centre's assistance is essential for development in the state and rejected the possibility of a mid-term election. Earlier, President's Rule had been imposed in Uttarakhand on March 27.
