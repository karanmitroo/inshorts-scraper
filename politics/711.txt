The Congress on Friday instructed all of its spokespersons not to comment on Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his public addresses. This comes after suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar had triggered outrage over his reference to PM Modi as "neech". Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had said that he did not appreciate Aiyar's language and expected him to apologise.
