The opposition has attacked Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar for attending a book release function in Goa, hours after a major terrorist strike in J&K. The congress has claimed that if a defence minister can spare two days a week "chilling" in Goa, there was something seriously amiss. Also, the NCP and the congress have asked Parrikar to safeguard India's border.
