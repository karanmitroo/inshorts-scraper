Following Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav's remark on Gujarat donkeys, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said SP's partner Congress had released postal stamps on Gujarat's donkeys in 2013. Yadav has applied his mentality of casteism among animals by detesting donkeys, he added. PM Modi further said that a donkey was loyal to his master and fulfilled all its responsibilities.
