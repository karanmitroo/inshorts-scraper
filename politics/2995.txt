Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday clarified he had not said that he will turn Delhi into London, but to make the city as clean as London while keeping its unique cultural ethos intact. "When we go to western countries including London, we see a high level of cleanliness there. Delhi will be made as clean as London," he added.
