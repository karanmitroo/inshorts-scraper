After his wife Rabri Devi said she wanted "well-cultured" brides for her sons, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday clarified, "Sanskari bahu doesn't mean veiled, home bound, dependent lady." Rabri had said, "I don't want cinema hall and mall-going girls. She should be one who can look after the house, respect elders and manage outside work, just like me."
