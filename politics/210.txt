BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate and former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa on Wednesday called Rahul Gandhi a 'baccha' (kid). "By bringing that baccha (Rahul Gandhi) in Karnataka, we now know that we will win more than 150 seats here," Yeddyurappa claimed. Elections to the 224-member Karnataka Legislative Assembly are scheduled for 2018.
