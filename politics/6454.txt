Amid speculations of dropping several Karnataka Cabinet ministers for their alleged 'non-performance', Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday announced a Cabinet reshuffle likely to occur next week. However, he did not reveal the names or number of the ministers he intends to drop. The decision to make these changes in the Cabinet comes after the government completed three years in office.
