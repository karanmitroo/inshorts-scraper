The Supreme Court, while hearing an AAP government's petition on Wednesday over the Delhi's statehood issue, said that an elected government should have some power to run, otherwise the government cannot function. CM Arvind Kejriwal had challenged the Delhi HC's order that stated the administrative head of the city is the Lieutenant Governor.
