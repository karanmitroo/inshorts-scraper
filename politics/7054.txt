Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday said the Congress was ready to work with JD(U) Chief Nitish Kumar to "keep BJP out of power after 2019 polls". "We want this country to be secular... responsible to the whole population and not to certain categories only," he said. Kumar recently called for a "largest possible unity" to defeat BJP in 2019.
