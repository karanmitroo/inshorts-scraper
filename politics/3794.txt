Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Friday slammed private schools for "selling nursery class seats", stating sell "Jalebis" (sweets) instead of education to earn profits. "Everybody knows that many private schools built on government lands sell nursery class seats for 10-15 lakhs," he said. "I'm fighting for the parents who are victims of these teaching shops," he added.
