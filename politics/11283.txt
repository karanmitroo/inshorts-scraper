The BJP on Monday declared that the Rajasthan government will begin its probe into the controversial Robert Vadra's land deals once the Lok Sabha polls end on May 16. The party added that the silence of Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi only added to suspicions that the "family" had something to hide on the land deals.
