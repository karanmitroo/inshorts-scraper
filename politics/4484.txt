Reacting to the adjournments in the Parliament's Winter Session majorly over the Centre's demonetisation move, senior BJP leader LK Advani on Thursday said, "I just feel like quitting...right now." Advani further said, "For once, for one day at least, run the House properly. Whether anyone wins or loses, the real loser in this whole mess is the Parliament itself."
