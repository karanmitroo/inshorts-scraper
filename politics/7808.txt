Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday criticised Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's visit to meet Hyderabad's deceased dalit scholar Rohith Vemula's mother and the University students. "When it's time to nurse the wounds, Gandhi is trying to sprinkle salt on them," Naqvi said. Earlier, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal asked PM Narendra Modi to sack ministers responsible for the incident.
