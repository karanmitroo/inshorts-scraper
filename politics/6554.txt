Responding to Shiv Sena's constant criticism of the Central government, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday said, "staying in alliance and constantly criticising cannot go hand in hand". "There are some Shiv Sena leaders who are not able to digest the success of the BJP," he added. Notably, Shiv Sena is BJP's alliance partner both in Maharastra and the Centre.
