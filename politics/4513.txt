Criticising the Centre's demonetisation move, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said, "It is a case of 'khoda pahaad, nikli chuhiya' (much ado about nothing)." He further said, "It is an illusion that demonetisation is intended to hurt the rich and benefit poor. I don't see any rich man getting affected."
