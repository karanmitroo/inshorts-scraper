The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Wednesday organised a rally in New Delhi against "anti-nationals". Several ABVP members marched from Ramlila Maidan to Jantar Mantar, demanding action against JNU students, who allegedly raised "anti-national" slogans. "We can't tolerate anyone raising slogans that threaten the unity of the country," ABVP National General Secretary Vinay Bidre said.
