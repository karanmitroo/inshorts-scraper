Claiming that those who can threaten a Chief Minister can threaten anybody, Tamil Nadu Opposition leader MK Stalin on Tuesday called for action against all those who allegedly forced CM O Pannerselvam to resign. "There is no proper govt in Tamil Nadu," he added. Panneerselvam had said he was continuously insulted after being appointed CM and forced to resign.
