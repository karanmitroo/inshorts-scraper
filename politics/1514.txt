An amendment to the Representation of the People Act had changed the manner of Rajya Sabha election to the Open Ballot System. According to the new rules, electors belonging to a political party have to show their slip to the party agent before putting it in the ballot box. Two Congress MLAs instead showed it to BJP President Amit Shah.
