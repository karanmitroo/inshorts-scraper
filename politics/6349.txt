Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday called for including a chapter on the 1975 Emergency in textbooks, saying the "atrocities" committed during the period needed to be told. "Around 75% of the population is unaware why and how emergency was imposed in the country," he claimed. Naqvi said he would take up the matter with the concerned ministry.
