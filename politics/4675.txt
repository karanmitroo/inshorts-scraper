Expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa on Monday said that people want to know whether Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa is alive or not. She further asked PM Narendra Modi to intervene into the matter and requested him to shift Jayalalithaa to AIIMS in Delhi. "She should be under the control of the government and not a private hospital," she added.
