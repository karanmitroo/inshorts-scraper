Calling PM Narendra Modi an expert in giving false statements, Congress on Thursday said he should introspect his policies rather than quoting dialogues from Hindi movies. "He has only been giving speeches in the last two and a half years," Congress leader BK Hariprasad said. He should talk about government's policies instead of criticising former PM Manmohan Singh, he added.
