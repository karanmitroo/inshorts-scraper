Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said India has the capability to conduct more surgical strikes and should regain control of the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). "We should praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the surgical strikes. But this should not be the last one but beginning of (more) such strikes against Pakistan," he added.
