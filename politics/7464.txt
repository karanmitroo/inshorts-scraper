Congress leader Manish Tewari on Monday asked if the BJP and SP are 'in cahoots' to absolve each other of responsibility for the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Contending that the riots happened "on the watch of the state government", he said the government should take responsibility. Earlier, the Justice Vishnu Sahai Commission's report exonerated the government of any direct responsibility.
