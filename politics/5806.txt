Being 'tired' of ABVP's stand on the attacks against Dalits, BJP student wing's JNU unit Vice President Jatin Goraya has resigned from the post. â€œI resign from the post of vice president of ABVP, and disassociate myself from the casteist, farcical and patriarchal organisation," Goraya said. He is the fourth such ABVP member to have resigned this year citing differences.
