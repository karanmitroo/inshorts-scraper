BJP MPs on Monday demanded in the Lok Sabha that President's Rule be imposed in Bihar, alleging that crime has increased since the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance was elected. "Democracy is in danger. Six crore people are insecure," the MPs said. The MPs also cited several cases linked to alliance's legislators including the recent killing of a youth in a road-rage incident.
