The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the BJP of circulating a "fake" letter that shows party convener Arvind Kejriwal thanking politician Mukhtar Ansari for supporting his candidature from Varanasi. "BJP people are so afraid of losing Varanasi that they are spreading fake pics of AAP thanking M. Ansari for support," said a tweet from the AAP's official Twitter account.
