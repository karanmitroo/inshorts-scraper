Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik said on Wednesday that the phrase "His Excellency" should be replaced by the word "Honourable" while addressing him. He expressed the need to do away with practices being followed since the colonial era, and said that 'Mananiya Rajyapal' or 'Rajyapal Mahodaya' must be used in place of 'Mahamahim'.
