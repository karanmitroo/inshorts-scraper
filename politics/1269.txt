Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah on Saturday targeted Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, asking him to give the 'hisab' (account) of performance of four generations of his family which ruled the country for 50 years. While addressing a 'Garib Kalayan Mela' in Jharkhand, he further said that the BJP had ended the dynasty, caste and appeasement politics in the country.
