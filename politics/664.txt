Outgoing Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said personal attacks on her son and new party President Rahul Gandhi have made him a "fearless person". Adding that unprecedented challenges were present before the country with an atmosphere of fear prevailing since 2014, she said it was time for the Congress to introspect and make sacrifices to protect India's democratic values.
