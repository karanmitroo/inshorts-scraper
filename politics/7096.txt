Uttar Pradesh BJP Chief Keshav Prasad Maurya on Tuesday said the Ram temple is a "matter of faith" and not a plank for the 2017 UP elections. The party will contest elections on the development agenda, he said. “Our first target is to rid the state of SP and BSP and win 265-plus seats in the 403-member Assembly,” Maurya asserted.
