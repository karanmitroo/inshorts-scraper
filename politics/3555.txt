Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday accused the Centre of deliberately delaying senior parliamentarian E Ahamed's death announcement over the advanced Union Budget announcement and termed it as an 'inhuman act'. "The government already knew that he had passed away...It's not March 31, there's a lot of time to present the Budget. The government can postpone it," Kharge further said.
