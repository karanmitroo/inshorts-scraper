Reacting to the poor performance of SP-Congress alliance in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leader Rajeev Shukla on Saturday said that though the party respects the mandate, development has lost and vote bank politics has won. While the BJP has crossed the 290 mark as the counting is underway, the SP-Congress alliance has been leading in only 69 seats.
