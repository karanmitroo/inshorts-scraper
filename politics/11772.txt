In a significant political move, MNS chief Raj Thackeray Sunday announced candidates for the Lok Sabha polls and also declared his party's support for BJP's PM nominee Narendra Modi. The announcement comes days after former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari had met him at a five-star hotel, requesting him not to field candidates to avoid division in vote against Congress.
