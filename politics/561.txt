BJP MP Hema Malini on Friday blamed the rising population of Mumbai for the fire at a restaurant in Kamala Mills Compound, which killed 14 people. "Each city should have a limit on population. After that, they should not be allowed...let them go to another city," she said. She further added that authorities should introduce restrictions to control the population.
