Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar Monday defended Fabindia in the hidden camera episode by saying that the company cannot be blamed for some mischief played by some of its employees at its store. "I personally feel that it must not be the company's fault but mischief played by its staff members. Some womanisers must have done that," Parsekar said.
