Congress and Trinamool Congress on Tuesday blocked the proceedings of the Parliament, demanding PM Narendra Modi's clarification on the Land Acquisition Bill. They argued that the Bill should be withdrawn as the ordinance had been allowed to lapse. However, the BJP and its ally Shiv Sena countered that a Bill can only be withdrawn with the approval of the House.
