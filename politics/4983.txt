Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat on Monday said WB CM Mamata Banerjee's request to join hands with CPM comes out of desperation to hide several scams including the Saradha chit-fund case. TMC is against demonetisation because Bengal is neck deep in corruption, Karat claimed. Banerjee had earlier called CPM leader Sitaram Yechury to unite against demonetisation.
