Congress has denied a ticket to Suresh Kalmadi, ending the long suspense on the fate of the leader who is an accused in the Commonwealth Games scandal. Also, the ticket has not gone to anyone in Kalmadi's family or group. Instead, the ruling party on Tuesday announced Vishwajeet Kadam from Pune which Kalmadi won in 2009.
