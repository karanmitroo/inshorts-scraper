The Congress has alleged that the BJP is “brainwashing” students, after the Rajasthan University's MA final-year exam paper carried a question, asking to explain the "ideology and programmes of the BJP”. Two of the 20 students, who took the exam, opposed the question, said the exam invigilator, who claimed that "the present political party is included in the course work”.
