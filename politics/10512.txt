Clinching 47 of the 90 assembly seats in Haryana and 122 out of 288 seats in Maharashtra, BJP on Sunday recorded historic wins in both the states. In Haryana, it has a clear mandate, so the party will form government on its own. In Maharashtra, it emerged as the single largest party, and is ready to form a coalition government.
