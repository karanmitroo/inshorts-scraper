RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav took to Twitter on Wednesday to ask PM Narendra Modi when his election promise of giving all Indians â‚¹15 lakh each will be fulfilled. "Kahe janta ko budbak bana rahe ho? (Why are you befooling the people?)" he said. "I always stand for the people...and don't spare those who give them pain," he added.
