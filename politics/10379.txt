The Bombay High Court on Wednesday refused to grant relief to Ashok Chavan, Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, in the Adarsh scam. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed an application before the court seeking permission to delete Ashok Chavan's name from the Adarsh scam charge sheet. The high court has rejected the application.
