Congress' Sachin Pilot on Thursday claimed the BJP is fighting the West Bengal elections to help the TMC by splitting anti-TMC votes. "And TMC in return is helping BJP inside Parliament," he added. "We have forged a seat sharing adjustment against the undemocratic TMC and in order to stop them," Pilot said, responding to BJP's criticism of the CPI(M)-Congress alliance.
