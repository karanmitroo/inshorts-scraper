After a meeting involving the RSS and BJP on Friday, the Kerala BJP accused the CPI(M) of intimidating the CBI over investigations related to murders in Kannur and Kozhikode, allegedly committed by CPI (M) members. "They don't want to see peace and prevalence of rule of law in the state. They are involved in bloodshed and killing," the BJP said.
