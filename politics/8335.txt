Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung's office on Friday revealed that Aam Aadmi Party's Satyendra Jain had asked Jung to drop criminal cases against its leaders and he had refused to do so. Ajay Chaudhary, officer on special duty to Jung, reportedly said that AAP's accusation that L-G was pushing for jailed ex-CM Om Prakash Chautala's parole, stems from this refusal.
