Former Karnataka CM BS Yeddyurappa, in a letter, has asked NDA chairman LK Advani to consider his Karnataka Janata Paksha(KJP) as an NDA ally. He supported his claim saying KJP won six seats in assembly elections, securing 10% votes and the Election Commission has recognized it as a regional party. The BJP sources said the letter only showed Yeddyurappa's desperation.
