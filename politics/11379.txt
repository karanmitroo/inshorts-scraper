The Election Commission on Tuesday banned BJPâ€™s Giriraj Singh, from campaigning in Bihar and Jharkhand. Singh last week kicked up a storm by stating that those opposing Modi would have to shift base to Pakistan. Notably, this is for the first time in these Lok Sabha polls that a candidate has been restrained from campaigning.
