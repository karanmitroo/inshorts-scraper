The Election Commission on Monday acknowledged Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav as the Samajwadi Party's national president and allotted the party's cycle symbol to the Akhilesh-led SP faction. The EC also said the group led by Akhilesh is the Samajwadi Party. This ends weeks of infighting within SP between factions led by Akhilesh and his father Mulayam Singh Yadav.
