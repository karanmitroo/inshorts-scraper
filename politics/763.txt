If there is only one presidential nomination for the Indian National Congress, s/he is elected without contest. If there are multiple candidates, voting takes place and the winner needs over 50% votes. Otherwise, members of Pradesh Congress Committees vote by listing down preferences. If there is no clear majority, candidates with least votes are eliminated and second preferences are counted.
