A woman has filed a complaint with the National Commission for Women (NCW), alleging that Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu and two others drugged and raped her at a circuit house in 2008. She claimed that Khandu, who was not the CM then, had introduced himself as an Army officer. CM Khandu called the allegations false and politically motivated.
