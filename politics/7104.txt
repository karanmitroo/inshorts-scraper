The Congress on Thursday said that they hoped that the NDA government learnt a lesson and will refrain from "unthought, unconsulted" diplomatic moves with regard to the policy on Pakistan. It also slammed the "unilateral suspension" of peace talks by Pakistan and said, "It is also a grim reminder of how Pakistan time and again has betrayed the peace process."
