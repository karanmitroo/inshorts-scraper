TMC Chief Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said that voters in certain parts of West Bengal were not able to cast their votes freely because of the imposition of Section 144. "An unprecedented terror has been launched during the poll(s)...to stop people from voting," she claimed. "But don't be afraid. Don't get intimidated by all those tricks," Banerjee added.
