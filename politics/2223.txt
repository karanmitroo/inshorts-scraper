With the BJP leading in MCD poll results, party leader Shazia Ilmi on Wednesday termed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal as 'drama queen' and said the AAP convener should leave politics as a career. She further said, "He is very good at making baseless stories, conspiracy theories. He should not fool the people and blame others for his sins and omissions."
