Indicating that AAP is in favour of separate Telangana state, its senior leader Prashant Bhushan Saturday said the outfit supported smaller states as it believes in decentralization of power. Bhushan also said AAP was averse to having any pre-poll alliance with any political party. He, however, said like-minded parties like Lok Satta in Andhra Pradesh was welcome to AAP fold.
