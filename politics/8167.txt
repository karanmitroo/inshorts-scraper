Congress member and former Health Minister of Mizoram, Lal Thanzara, on Tuesday won the by-polls and got elected to the Aizawl North-III Assembly seat. The state held the by-polls after he resigned from the ministerial position in August citing a ‘conflict of interests’. He is the youngest brother of the state’s Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla.
