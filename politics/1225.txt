In an editorial in a Hindi daily, BJP MP Varun Gandhi has opposed the government's decision to deport nearly 40,000 Rohingyas, who are fleeing from religious persecution in Myanmar. Asking the government to keep in mind the "rich Indian tradition" of helping refugees, he said India must give asylum to Rohingyas after vetting each of them for national security concerns.
