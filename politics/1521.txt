Reacting to the Chandigarh stalking case, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Kirron Kher on Wednesday said, "Every boy should be kept inside the house at night since that is when problems are being created." She further said, "Why is there danger at night and not during the day? They (politicians) should tell boys not to go out at night too."
