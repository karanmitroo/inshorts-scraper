AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan on Monday resigned from the party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC), after accusing AAP leader Kumar Vishwas of trying to split the party. "I stand by what I said about Vishwas. He's working at the behest of BJP and RSS," Khan said. "Vishwas ate cake with Ajit Doval and Bassi when AAP MLAs were arrested," he added.
