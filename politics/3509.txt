Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has expelled its 33 Uttarakhand leaders from the party for six years due to alleged anti-party activities. The action was taken after the leaders, who were denied the party tickets, chose to contest the elections as independent candidates. The expulsion comes just 10 days before the state Assembly elections, scheduled for February 15.
