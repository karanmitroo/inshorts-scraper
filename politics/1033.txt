In a dig at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav said, "Palturam is almost non-existent in the ruling dispensation in Bihar." It is Sushil Modi and the BJP who are calling the shots in Bihar, Lalu claimed. He also announced anti-demonetisation rallies in 38 districts across Bihar, urging the Congress and the TMC to hold similar agitations.
