Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray has said that a digital revolution is not going to solve people's daily bread and butter issues. Reacting to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu's comments on demonetisation, Thackeray said that while Naidu was earlier telling people to use digital payments, he has understood that people are suffering, and so has taken a U-turn.
