Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Friday tweeted, "In Parliamentary language, the Sensex just placed a solid 800 point No Confidence Motion against Modi's budget." The BSE benchmark index fell by nearly 840 points a day after the government presented the Union Budget. Earlier, Gandhi accused the Centre of not making necessary budgetary allocations for the proposed "fancy schemes".
