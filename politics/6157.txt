Ramesh Sarvaiya, a 23-year-old Dalit beaten by the public, was re-admitted to a hospital in Gujarat's Rajkot on Thursday, hours before Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's scheduled visit. Reportedly, Sarvaiya was earlier discharged on July 18 and reportedly re-admitted under 'political pressure'. However, he claimed that his injuries and pain had recurred which resulted in his re-admission.
