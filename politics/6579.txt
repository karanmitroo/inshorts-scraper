Shiv Sena, an ally in PM Narendra Modi's government, in its mouthpiece Saamana, on Thursday claimed that the Centre has failed on many fronts. The editorial said the government failed to tackle inflation and cross-border terrorism while its schemes failed to reach the masses. Sena also targeted Modi for his foreign trips and failure to retrieve black money stashed abroad.
