Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday sought President Pranab Mukherjee’s intervention in the issue of “increasing attacks on Dalits and minorities” since BJP came to power at the Centre. This comes after North Delhi Municipal councillor Rakesh Kumar, belonging to a Dalit family, was allegedly beaten up by BJP councillors during a joint session of the municipal corporations in the city.
