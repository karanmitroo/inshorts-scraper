BJP leader Sidharth Nath Singh on Monday termed West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee as the "cheerleader of all anti-social elements", for opposing the demonetisation move. "Mamata is a mirror image of the Left. The Left, under their rule, felicitated and sheltered chit fund companies like rose-valley, Saradha (scam) and fake currency racket was going rampant under its regime," Singh added.
