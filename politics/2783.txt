Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, during the Indian Express Idea Exchange, said his only complaint against party Vice-President Rahul Gandhi is that he is not acting decisively. "I have told him a number of times...Sometimes, he gets angry when I keep repeating the same thing," said Digvijaya. There's no other person who can rebuild Congress better than Rahul, he added.
