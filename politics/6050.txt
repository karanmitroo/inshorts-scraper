JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Friday said, "Pakistan has no issue to raise, it has been playing the Kashmir card in order to cover its failures." He added that Pakistan was doing so to keep itself unified and pacify its citizens facing an internal turmoil. Yadav's remarks came after Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif said that Kashmir wasn't India's internal matter.
