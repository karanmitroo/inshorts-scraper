After winning the Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat Assembly elections, the BJP and its allies now control governments in 19 of the 29 states in India. The BJP runs a coalition with People's Democratic Party in J&K, Janata Dal (United) in Bihar, and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. The party had ended Congress' 15-year rule in Assam in 2016.
