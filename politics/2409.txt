Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday inducted two former Congress leaders as cabinet ministers. Vishwajit Rane had switched over to the BJP only last week after resigning as a Congress MLA on the day of the floor test on March 16. Mauvin Godinho had left the Congress to join BJP shortly before the assembly polls, held on February 4.
