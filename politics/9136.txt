An editorial in Shiv Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana' said on Friday that PM Narendra Modi-led BJP government came to power only on the backing of Hindu voters. "But, the idea of making Hindus come together to vote as Hindus was first mooted by Balasaheb Thackeray. The spark ignited then has made Modi come to power in Delhi today," Sena added.
