Suspended Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal has said Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav are manipulating party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. "If a father can expel his son, how is my suspension a big deal," he added. Further, Agarwal said it would also be better if Mulayam praised his son Akhilesh Yadav and urged him to stop praising PM Narendra Modi.
