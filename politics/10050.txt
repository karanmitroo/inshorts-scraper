In a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner, NGO 'Maulik Bharat Trust' has challenged AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal's application for a change of address ahead of assembly elections, saying that he is not a Delhi resident. "We have got an RTI reply from Ghaziabad Police in which it has stated that he lives in Kaushambi (Ghaziabad)," the NGO said.
