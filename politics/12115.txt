Delhi Friday got an easy to remember 1031 anti-corruption helpline number from CM Arvind Kejriwal, two days after he gave out a normal eight-digit landline. On Wednesday, he had shared the spirit behind the helpline, saying this number makes every Delhiite an anti-corruption inspector. Moreover, Kejriwal also informed that one government official was caught following a complaint to the helpline.
