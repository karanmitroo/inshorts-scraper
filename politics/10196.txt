Chandrakant Khaire and Arvind Sawant, both Shiv Sena MPs, said on Monday that the construction of the Ram Temple should be undertaken as a birthday gift to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They also pushed for executing the Uniform Civil Code. They said that these measures should be implemented by the NDA, now that they enjoy full majority.
