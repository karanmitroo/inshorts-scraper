Amid controversy over the appointment of Shakuntala Gamlin as the acting chief secretary, the Kejriwal-led Delhi government on Saturday ordered the removal of Principal Secretary Anindo Majumdar from his position. Kejriwal has accused Gamlin of using her post against public interest. Earlier, Majumdar had issued orders for the appointment of Gamlin as acting chief secretary on the directions of Jung.
