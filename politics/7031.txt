BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma on Friday called the Congress "undemocratic and opportunist," after ex-UPA Law Minister Hansraj Bhardwaj claimed the UPA-I wanted to dissolve the Samajwadi Party-led UP government in 2007. "This is the same Congress Party, which to promote corruption has been taking the support of Mulayam Singh and simultaneously planning to dissolve its government," he said.
