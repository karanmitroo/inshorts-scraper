Tamil Nadu BJP leader H Raja tweeted a photo of students kissing during a protest against moral policing in Delhi, claiming it that it was students at IIT Madras. "(DMK leader) Stalin, look at how IIT Chennai students keep up Tamil culture," he captioned the photo. This comes while IIT Madras students have been protesting the "Sanskritisation" of Dravidian culture.
