Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday called Nitish Kumar a "mahanayak" meaning superhero. On the day the Grand Alliance won a majority in Bihar, he said, "If elections are held in Maharashtra now, same results will come". Pointing out that BJP fought the elections under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, Raut said that defeat denoted the leader's decline.
