After Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal alleged that EVMs across Delhi were tampered for Sunday's MCD polls, BJP leader Vijay Goel took a jibe at the CM by terming it as 'EVM fever'. "Oh no not again! Jao jao jaldi jao doctor ko bulao, nabs dikhao #Kejriwal ka haal batao. His #EVM fever seems to have started again #MCDpolls," Goel tweeted.
