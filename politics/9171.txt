Union Law Minister DV Sadananda Gowda on Thursday said that the BJP was not embarrassed by the recent revelation that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj helped scam-tainted ex-IPL chief Lalit Modi. "As far as Sushma is concerned... Doing something for a person who is suffering from cancer (Modi's wife) is not an issue to be discussed," he said.
