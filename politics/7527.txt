AAP on Wednesday defended party MLA Amanatullah Khan, after a video surfaced showing him using "derogatory" language against the Narendra Modi government. The party said the comments by Okhla MLA were "not a personal attack" on the PM but a "justified complaint" against the Centre. The video was recorded on February 16 while addressing a mushaira at the Red Fort.
