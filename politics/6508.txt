Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi has floated a new party and asked the people to suggest a name for it. Last week, Jogi said that he had no other option but to quit the Congress for the sake of Chhattisgarh. He added that he was under pressure to quit Congress because he wanted to defeat Chief Minister Raman Singh.
