A day after Delhi govt ordered an inquiry into the case, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday joined the 'Justice for Pavitra' movement in support of Pavitra Bhardwaj (a lab-assistant at BR Ambedkar College), who committed suicide after sexual harassment by two colleagues. Despite Bhardwaj's dying declaration, police had not taken action against the man she had accused.
