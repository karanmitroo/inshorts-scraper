Accused of raping a 14-year-old girl twice, Meghalaya MLA Julius Dorphang has been absconding after a non-bailable warrant was issued against him. The guest house where the rape took place reportedly belonged to state Home Minister HDR Lyngdoh and his son. Dorphang, known to be a militant and the chairman of the banned outfit HNLC, had surrendered in 2007.
