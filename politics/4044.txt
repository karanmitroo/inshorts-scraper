Talking about the prospects of Shiromani Akali Dal’s victory in Punjab, state’s Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal reiterated that their fight is with Congress, adding that AAP is "Made in China". "...they do not know the culture of Punjab…God forbid, if AAP comes to power, they will create chaos here. It believes in agitation, not in governance," he added.
