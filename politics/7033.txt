The BJP on Sunday accused the ruling AIADMK government of labelling Centrally-sponsored schemes as state-sponsored schemes in Tamil Nadu. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar claimed, "In giving free rice to poor, 90% is central government subsidy. 10% is what state government gives. But they are...calling it as Amma Free Arisi scheme." He added that AIADMK and DMK were "fooling voters."
