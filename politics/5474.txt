AAP Convenor and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday praised Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj for her speech at UNGA while the Congress called it disappointing. “Sushma ji presented India's viewpoint very well at UNGA. Congratulations to her,” Kejriwal tweeted. On the other hand, the Congress asked, “Why is EAM Sushmaji shy of calling 'a spade a spade' in U.N?"
