The CBI on Monday summoned top Trinamool Congress leader and former railway minister Mukul Roy for questioning in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam. Roy is also a very close aide of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. He was believed to be at the helm of affairs of both Tara news and Saradha news business.
