Defending his controversial comment, in which he had asked people to accept money from political parties but not to vote for them, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said it would ultimately lead to cleansing politics. " ...in a few days these parties will realise there is no point in giving money, votes cannot be bought anymore," Kejriwal added.
