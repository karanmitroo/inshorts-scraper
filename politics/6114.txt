Accusing Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh and Renuka Chowdhury of humiliating her in the House, Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has written to the Rajya Sabha Chairman seeking "stern action" against them. She claims that before adjournment of the House on July 22, the duo used "derogatory language" against her and "violated her dignity both as a woman and a minister".
