Following Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav's suspension, SP leader Amar Singh on Saturday said going against party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav was unconstitutional and immoral. "Ram chandra keh gaye siya se aisa kalyug aayega, beta karega raj bechara baap jungal ko jayega," he said. Mulayam is not only the father of the party but also of the CM, Singh added.
