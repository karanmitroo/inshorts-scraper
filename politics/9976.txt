In a major embarrassment, the Delhi Congress lost its official website www(.)DPCC(.)co(.)in, as the site administrator Sanjay Puri decided to quit from his post. The website now displays a message saying that Puri has withdrawn his services after his resignation from his primary membership of Congress on January 19, 2015. The site was developed and maintained by Puri since 2008.
