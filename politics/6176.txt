A video that allegedly shows Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi sleeping in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday while Dalit protests in Gujarat were being discussed has surfaced online. Congress leader Renuka Choudhary later rejected the allegations and asked, "How can anyone sleep amid so much uproar?" Rahul had been recorded allegedly sleeping in the Parliament earlier as well.
