Commenting on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's tongue surgery, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said, his tongue had to be trimmed as it had grown too long. "In Delhi, he speaks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and here (in Goa) he speaks against me. Due to this, his tongue has grown big," he said. Parrikar, however, sympathised with Kejriwal.
