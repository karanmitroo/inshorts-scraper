West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said that the Centre has rolled back nearly 15 decisions since it announced the demonetisation of old high-value currency notes on November 8. Banerjee, who has been opposing the move and leading protests to demand the decision's rollback, added, "This (rollback of decisions) means they (Centre) are confused."
