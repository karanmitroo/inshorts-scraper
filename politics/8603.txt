Hardik Patel on Wednesday announced the launch of the Akhil Bhartiya Patel Navnirman Sena (ABPNS) across India to redress the grievances of Patels, Gujjars and Kurmis. Maintaining the ABPNS to be a "non-political entity", Hardik said, "whatever land that is available and where no work is happening should be given back to our Gujjar brothers."
