Former India captain and current Lok Sabha MP Mohammed Azharuddin, in all likelihood, would contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from a constituency in West Bengal. The 50-year-old, who formally joined Congress in February 2009, had contested from Moradabad (UP) in the last general elections, defeating his nearest rival Sarvesh Singh by a margin of over 50,000 votes.
