Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will be missing the budget session of the parliament, which began Monday, as he has taken a few weeks' leave to "reflect upon recent events and the future course of the party". The move comes ahead of the AICC meet to be held in April, which Rahul believes to be crucial in shaping the party's future.
