Congress may hire poll strategist Prashant Kishor for the upcoming Uttarakhand elections, reports said. Kishor had helped PM Narendra Modi win the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and a year later, guided Nitish Kumar to a victory in Bihar elections. Kishor was also hired by Congress for Uttar Pradesh elections but was later reportedly sidelined by the state party unit.
