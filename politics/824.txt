Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign in poll-bound Gujarat is about himself, his past and has no answer to question of joblessness and price rise. Adding that the Gujarat election is about "the promised achhe din that hasn't come in 42 months", he said that PM Modi has no answer to the hard reality.
