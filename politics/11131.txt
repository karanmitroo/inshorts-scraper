In a setback to RJD chief Lalu Prasad, three rebel MLAs - Samrat Chaudhary, Ram Lakhan Raman and Javed Iqbal - Sunday resigned from the party to extend their support to JDU's Nitish Kumar. “When Nitish Kumar left such a big post of Chief Minister can’t we make a small sacrifice like resigning from Assembly,” Samrat Chaudhary said.
