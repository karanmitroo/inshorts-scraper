The Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday asserted that it doesn't want to change the eating habits of people citing that two-thirds of the population is non-vegetarian. "What we want is a complete ban on eating of beef, as mother cow is the centre of faith for Hindus and it should not be hurt," VHP's joint general secretary Surendra Jain said.
