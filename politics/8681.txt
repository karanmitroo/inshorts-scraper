The Bharatiya Janata Party has reportedly allotted 20 seats to Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha party for the Bihar assembly elections next month. It was earlier allotted 13-15 seats after which Manjhi’s associates had threatened to reconsider continuing in the alliance. BJP president Amit Shah reportedly oversaw the negotiations on Sunday.
