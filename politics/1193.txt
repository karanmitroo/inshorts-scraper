Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said, "I suspect Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is a Christian and has a Church inside his residence '10 Janpath'." Swamy was taking a jibe at Rahul for wrapping up his three-day visit to poll-bound Gujarat after offering prayers at four temples. "He should first declare he is Hindu," Swamy further said.
