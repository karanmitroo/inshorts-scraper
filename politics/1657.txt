After submitting his resignation, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said that several allegations were levelled against him when he had supported demonetisation. Kumar resigned earlier today citing a crisis in the ruling Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance. "It's not possible to work in this environment; I tried. Tried to find out a solution," Kumar added.
