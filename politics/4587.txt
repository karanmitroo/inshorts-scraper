AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal on Friday alleged that the SAD-BJP alliance and the Congress have reached a secret 'seat-sharing' pact to contest the 2017 Assembly polls in Punjab. Both SAD-BJP and Congress knew "very well" that they would not be able to form the government, so they have decided to field the candidates "with mutual understanding", he added.
