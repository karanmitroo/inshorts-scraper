The Congress on Tuesday expelled six of its MLAs in Uttar Pradesh, party leader Janardan Dwivedi confirmed. The MLAs were expelled for cross-voting during the recently-held Rajya Sabha elections in the state, he said. Notably, the Samajwadi Party had won seven seats in the elections, while former Union Minister Kapil Sibal got elected from Congress.
