Strongly opposing the demand for new state for the Vidarbha region, the Shiv Sena Wednesday said, "Whether it is BJP or any other party dreaming of dividing Maharashtra, we will not let it happen." Former Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan on Monday had alleged that the BJP is trying to split Maharashtra and create a separate state of Virdarbha.
