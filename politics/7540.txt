The ruling AIADMK and opposition corporators from the DMK clashed with each other in Coimbatore on Friday during the tabling of the city's annual budget. Following this scuffle, six DMK and two Congress corporators were arrested. However, DMK corporators alleged that AIADMK corporators, when charged with 'looting' the funds, assaulted them and shoved them out of the office.
