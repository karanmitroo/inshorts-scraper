BJP President Amit Shah on Tuesday said the upcoming Gujarat Assembly polls are a battle between casteism and dynastic rule supported by the Congress, and development politics endorsed by PM Narendra Modi. Alleging that the Congress had tried to create a caste divide in the state during 1985-1995, Shah said the party was resorting to casteism this year as well.
