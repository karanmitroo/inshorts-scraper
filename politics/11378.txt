Speaking at a Mumbai rally Monday, BJP's ally Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam made strong anti-minority statements from the same stage where Narendra Modi was seated. Referring to the 2012 Azad Maidan attack, Kadam said "Muslims", who damaged public property and attacked police, "will not be spared".  Kadam also said Modi would destroy Pakistan in six months of assuming power.
