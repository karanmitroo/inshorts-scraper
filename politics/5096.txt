CPI(M) stands for Indian nationalism and not Hindu nationalism, party's General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Tuesday as he launched a veiled attack on RSS over its alleged efforts to implement Hindutva agenda in an intensified manner. The comment follows his attack on RSS in Thiruvananthapuram, where he launched year-long celebrations marking the centenary of Great October Revolution.
