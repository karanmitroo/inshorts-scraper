After BJP supporters controversial attempt to equate Narendra Modi with Lord Shiva, the Samajwadi Party hit back at them Sunday with posters showing Modi shivering at the sight of Mulayam Singh Yadav, with slogan: "Tharr tharr Modi, darr darr Modi". BJP's UP spokesman dismissed this as stunt saying that all parties fear Modi as his popularity is rising.
