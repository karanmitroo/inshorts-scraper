Responding to a question posted on Twitter, former IPL chairman Lalit Modi on Saturday called PM Narendra Modi the 'most savvy man'. "What wud be your advice to our PM who is struggling to manage media," a Twitter user asked Lalit. "When he (PM) bats he will hit the ball out of the park. #respect only", he replied.
