Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas has challenged BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi and BJP senior leaders Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari to contest election against him. Taking a swipe at Modi, Vishwas said he had done nothing to end dynastic politics. Notably, Vishwas has said that he would contest Lok Sabha election against Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi.
