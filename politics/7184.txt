Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said an "ideological reaction" was expected after the incidents in JNU and Hyderabad University. He said, "If you openly raised slogans for those who bombed Mumbai or attacked Parliament… surely you expect some ideological reaction from those who don’t agree". The people supporting the JNU protests were the ones who supported emergency, he claimed.
