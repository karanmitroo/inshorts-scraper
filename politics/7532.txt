The BJP has put up a poster in Amritsar, of Pakistan-based Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, accusing Rahul of speaking the language of Pakistan. The Congress countered this with a poster where PM Narendra Modi's 'patriotism' has been questioned as his picture features alongside Afzal Guru, Hafiz Saeed and Peoples Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti.
