BJP President Amit Shah Saturday said a private Hindi TV channel is helping AAP to win Delhi Assembly elections. Referring to his statement, Shah said there cannot be a bigger example of yellow journalism than this. Shah's remarks came in response to a question by the channel reporter as to why the party has "borrowed" Kiran Bedi for Delhi elections.
