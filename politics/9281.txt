Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung on Wednesday cancelled all the transfers and appointments done by the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government in the last one week. In a written order sent to the govt, Jung claimed that it had no jurisdiction for such appointments. Earlier on Wednesday, Kejriwal wrote to PM Narendra Modi, asking him to allow his government to function independently.
