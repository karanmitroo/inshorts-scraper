Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal on Sunday called Rahul Gandhi the "biggest enemy" of Punjab for "branding" Punjab's youth as drug addicts. Rahul has given enough proof of being "anti-Punjab and anti-Sikh", Badal added. "If Congress scion really believes about the presence of drugs in Punjab, then he should conduct dope tests on youth Congress leaders," he said.
