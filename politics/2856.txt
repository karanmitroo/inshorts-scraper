Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said, "Because of the triple talaq issue, Muslim women, especially younger women, voted for us." Adding that there will be Muslim representatives in the BJP-led UP government, Naidu said, "If MLA is not there, an MLC will be there." He said, "It was a weakness... We could not find suitable candidates confident of winning".
