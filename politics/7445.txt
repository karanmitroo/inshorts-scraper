Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said the Congress had no right to speak on issues of black money and corruption. They should consider their track record before speaking, he said, referring to a similar scheme introduced in 1997 by then Finance Minister P Chidambaram. Rahul Gandhi had earlier called the government's black money policy a "Fair & Lovely" scheme.
