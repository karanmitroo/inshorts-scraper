Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit on Tuesday dubbed the AAP government's Odd-Even scheme a "gimmick". She further accused the government of paying money to the AAP workers acting as volunteers during the scheme. The first phase of the scheme failed to control pollution, they need to look for long-term solutions rather than schemes causing inconvenience to people, Dikshit added.
