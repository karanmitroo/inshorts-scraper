#Bihar was one of the top Twitter trends in Pakistan on Sunday. As the Grand Alliance emerged with a clear majority in the Bihar assembly elections, twitterati, including J&K CM Omar Abdullah, started making jokes about Pakistan celebrating BJPâ€™s defeat. BJP president Amit Shah had earlier said that if BJP loses in Bihar, fire crackers will go off in Pakistan.
