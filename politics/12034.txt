The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday expelled rebel legislator Vinod Kumar Binny less than two weeks after he called Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal a "liar" and a "dictator" and also accused the party of straying from its principles and poll promises. However, the AAP government will continue to be in majority in Delhi with support from the Congress.
