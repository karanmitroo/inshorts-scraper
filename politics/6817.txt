Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Monday released a document regarding the allotment of land for a 'Sainik Colony' in Srinagar. He further dared Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti to file a case against him if she thought the document was fake. Meanwhile, Mufti had earlier denied any such allotment and asked Omar to stop spreading rumours.
