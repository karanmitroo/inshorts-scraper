Assam CM Tarun Gogoi on Friday blamed the Asom Gana Parishad, which was in power at the time, and the then Central BJP-led NDA government, for the "secret killings" in Assam between 1998 and 2001. He was referring to the killing of ULFA militants' relatives and friends by assailants. Gogoi was criticising the rule of former CM Prafulla Kumar Mahanta.
