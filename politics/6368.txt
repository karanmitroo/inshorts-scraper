An article published in Maharashtraâ€™s BJP unit's fortnightly publication 'Manogat' has dared ally Shiv Sena to take "divorce" and walk out of the alliance. Written by BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, the article attacked Sena MP Sanjay Raut for his 'Nizam' remarks. Raut had recently said the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra were worse than the Nizam government.
