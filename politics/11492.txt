The Aam Aadmi Party on Friday welcomed Quami Ekta Dal MLA Mukhtar Ansari withdrawing from the electoral contest in UP's Varanasi. "Congress and BJP have to be removed from the country to corruption. And for this, all the forces must join hands," Arvind Kejriwal said. Notably, Ansari, a gangster-turned-politician and four-time MLA, is currently lodged in Agra jail.
