Shiv Sena today slammed the BJP in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' by holding it responsible for giving free publicity to JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar. Questioning how Kanhaiya got bail in a short span of time, Sena said, "Was it that keeping him behind bars was becoming a problem for the government and that it had to answer too many questions?".
