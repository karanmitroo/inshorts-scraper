Rajasthan BJP MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari on Sunday blamed his own government over deaths of cows in the Hingonia Goushala, and alleged that cow smuggling has "increased 7-8 times during the present government". He said cow deaths are associated with a “racket” involving “smuggling skin and horns of dead animals” and demanded that an enquiry should be ordered for the same.
