As many as 55 MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party have signed a letter written to Delhi CM and party convenor Arvind Kejriwal and demanded removal of Prashant Bhushan, his father Shanti Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav from the party. These leaders have been accused of carrying out anti-party activities. The signature campaign was led by Karawal Nagar MLA Kapil Mishra.
