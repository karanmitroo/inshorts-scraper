Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav, in an interview to journalist Barkha Dutt, admitted that Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi needs his party’s support more than his party needs him in poll-bound UP. "It's true in UP since their party workers didn’t do any ground work…it’s the opportunity for them as in politics one doesn't get opportunities daily," he added.
