Senior Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Sudhindra Bhadoria has said that the two wheels of UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's poll symbol 'cycle' represent 'Gundaraj' and 'Dangaraj'. Alleging that Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh is against Muslims, Bhadoria said that under SP's rule a Muslim has never occupied any significant police officer's rank. Muslims have been exploited under SP, he added.
