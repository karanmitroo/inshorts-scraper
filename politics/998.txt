Congress leader and former Union Minister Manish Tewari on Friday slammed the Centre over cow vigilantism and said, "Cows are going to take the country to the dogs." Targeting PM Narendra Modi, Tewari said, "The PM has not understood that social disharmony and economic progress cannot go hand in hand. When you have social turbulence, economic development will suffer."
