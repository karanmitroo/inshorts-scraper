The Centre on Sunday imposed President's Rule in Uttarakhand on grounds of "breakdown of governance". Earlier, the Uttarakhand Assembly Speaker GS Gunjwal directed the police to impose a curfew under CrPC Section 144 to prevent clashes between Congress and BJP workers. This comes a day before CM Harish Rawat is to take floor test in the Assembly on March 28.
