Speaking about Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday said she was able to fill the gap of her mentor Marudur Gopalan Ramachandran (MGR) and became bigger than him in one sense. "She was far more intelligent, had much more educationâ€¦but she is more feared. MGR was generally loved never feared," he added.
