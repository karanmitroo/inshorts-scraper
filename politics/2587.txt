Can nominated members of the Rajya Sabha like cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and actor Rekha remain absent in the House, Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Agarwal asked on Thursday. "If they are not coming, does it mean they are not interested...shouldn't they resign?" he added. Agarwal added that he had not seen the nominated MPs during this parliamentary session.
