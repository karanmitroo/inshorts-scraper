Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday reshuffled the Cabinet for the 8th time since 2012, allocating the Transport department to Gayatri Prasad Prajapati while relieving Shivpal Yadav of two departments. After the latest expansion, UP government now has 32 Cabinet ministers. Notably, Prajapati was sacked last month from the post of Mining Minister over the alleged charges of corruption.
