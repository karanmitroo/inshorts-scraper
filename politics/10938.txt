Jammu & Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Thursday said he would not be part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's security meeting in Srinagar during his two-day visit starting on Friday. â€œI have no scheduled meeting with the PM during this visit. I met him in Delhi a few weeks ago and discussed issues regarding the state then," Omar said.
