Congress has said out of the total ₹92, 241 crore of farmer loans, only ₹36,000 crore is waived off in UP.  This means even now ₹56,000 crore is still to be waived off, said Congress  Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. "When Modi government could waive off ₹1,40,000 crore loan of big businessmen then can't they do it for the farmers," he added.
