Congress' Delhi unit has claimed that the AAP government "shut down" its official website on its second anniversary so as to prevent people from checking their claims of development. The official website of Delhi government was down from the morning of February 14, and it became accessible only after Congress raised an alarm, Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken alleged.
