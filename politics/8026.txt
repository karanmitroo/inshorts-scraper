Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday he will not let PM Narendra Modi get success in achieving 'Congress Mukt Bharat.' Gandhi claimed that PM Modi is untruly accusing him and the Opposition of things not committed by them. "I want to tell the people of India that myself and the Congress party will never bow down," he added.
