Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday alleged that NGOs and black-marketeers are trying to "defame" him and his government. Modi said that "some people" cannot digest that a "chai wala" (tea seller) has become the PM. He also added that the NGOs are conspiring against him as his government sought the details of the source of foreign funds they receive.
