BJP member Rita Bahuguna Joshi on Saturday said the Yadav family feud within the Samajwadi Party (SP) would be beneficial for BJP in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. "BJP is currently ruling and the Prime Minster has (a) good image... That is why it is highly possible for BJP to form (the) majority in the state," Joshi added.
