The Supreme Court has dismissed a PIL challenging the income tax exemptions granted to donations made to political parties. The court said the decision to grant exemptions is an "executive" action and it didn't violate the Constitution. Further, the bench said the action wasn't against the Income Tax Act or Representation of People Act, and hence the court cannot intervene.
