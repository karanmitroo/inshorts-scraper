Claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot do Yoga, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said, "I notice things. The PM has done a lot of Yoga but he hasn't done Padmasan." "My Yoga guru had said that a person who does Yoga can do Padmasan. But a person who does not do Yoga, cannot do Padmasan," he added.
