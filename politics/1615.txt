Gujarat Congress MLAs Balwantsinh Rajput, PI Patel, and Tejashree Patel on Thursday resigned from the political party and joined the BJP within a few hours. The resignations come days after former leader of Opposition Shankersinh Vaghela quit Congress and the post of MLA. Notably, Gujarat Assembly elections for the 182-member House will be held by the end of this year.
