Congress leader Pema Khandu, son of late Chief Minister Dorjee Khandu, was on Sunday sworn-in as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh. The 36-year-old leader replaces Nabam Tuki, who stepped down from the post on Saturday. This comes after the Supreme Court annulled the Centre's imposition of Presidentâ€™s rule in the state and reinstated the former Tuki-led Congress government.
