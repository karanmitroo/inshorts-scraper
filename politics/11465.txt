AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday arrived in Varanasi for a month-long campaign and was greeted with posters that accused him of being a 'deserter' ('bhagoda'), a reference to his resignation as Delhi CM. AAP supporters removed many posters, but tight police security ensured that there was no untoward action. During his last visit black ink was thrown at him.
