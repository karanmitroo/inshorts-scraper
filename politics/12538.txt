Tension surged in Meerut's Khera village on Sunday at Mahapanchayat organised to protest slapping of National Security Act against BJP MLA Sangeet Som in connection with Muzaffarnagar riots. The tension led to clashes between villagers and police leaving 20-people injured. The panchayat, convened at Janata Inter College, defied prohibitory orders for allegedly circulating inflammatory videos later found to be fakes.
