"It is not in our culture to drink beer instead of water", the Shiv Sena said in mouthpiece 'Saamana', days after demanding shutdown of water supply to breweries in the drought-hit Marathwada region. It said that the government should understand that at present, water should only be used to save human lives. However, the BJP-led government has opposed the demand.
