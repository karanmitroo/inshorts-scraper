BJP MPs Shobha Karandlaje and Nalin Kumar Kateel have asked the Karnataka government to not send them invitations for Tipu Jayanti celebrations scheduled on November 10. This comes after Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde slammed the state-sponsored celebrations and termed Tipu Sultan as a brutal killer and a mass rapist. CM Siddaramaiah accused the BJP of politicising Tipu Jayanti.
