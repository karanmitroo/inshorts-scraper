After BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi invited Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to join BJP, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav’s wife Rabri Devi asked Sushil to take Nitish and get him married to his sister. However, she later explained that there’s nothing controversial and it was a light-hearted statement. Notably, Nitish has supported demonetisation while his ally Lalu has criticised it.
