Former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg, who had released an audiotape alleging Arvind Kejriwal of indulging in horse-trading, was suspended from the party on Monday. The reason for his suspension is said to be his 'anti-party activities'. According to AAP, Garg was a 'serial offender', which led the party to take the decision.
