The government has renamed the Matritva Sahyog Yojana, a scheme launched in 2010 by the Congress for pregnant and lactating mothers, as 'Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana'. While the Centre dropped 'Indira Gandhi' prefix from the scheme after coming to power in 2014, it added 'Pradhan Mantri' to it now, claiming that the earlier name did not ring a bell.
