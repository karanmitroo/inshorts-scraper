After joining the People's Party of Arunachal, Chief Minister Pema Khandu said there was no point sticking to a party that doesn't have time for its own CM. After being sworn-in, he was asked to wait for three days to meet Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, but got an appointment with PM Modi in 15 minutes, Khandu said.
