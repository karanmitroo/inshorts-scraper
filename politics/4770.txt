West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday termed demonetisation as "black emergency" and claimed that people will not re-elect PM Narendra Modi due to the note ban. Asserting that demonetisation was not aimed at curbing black money, Banerjee said, "Economy is down. The GDP has suffered huge losses." Farmers, traders, and poor people are suffering due to demonetisation, she added.
