AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said, "In the battle of Kabristan and Shamshaan in Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, Shamshaan won over Kabristan." His statement was in reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remark made during poll campaign that if the Samajwadi Party gives money to construct graveyards (Kabristan) they should also do so for cremation grounds (Shamshaan).
