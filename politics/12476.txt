LN Sharma, the AAP candidate from Ghonda assembly constituency in Delhi, and his brother Chakresh were injured after two persons attacked them with wooden baton Thursday. The attackers, who fled when Sharma brothers called police, allegedly warned them against contesting elections from the area. However, it couldn't be ascertained if the police filed an FIR on Sharma's complaint or not.
