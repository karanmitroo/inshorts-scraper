West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday told people of Jangalmahal that the region will witness Maoist violence again if CPI(M) comes to power. "The area had hit the headlines for bloodshed during Left Front rule," she asserted. The CPI(M) responded to her statement saying Mamata is asking people not to vote for the opposition as she is afraid.
