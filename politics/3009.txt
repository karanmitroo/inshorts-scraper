Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha on Saturday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not have held a roadshow in Varanasi as it was only a state Assembly election. This comes after the Congress party urged the Election Commission to file an FIR against Prime Minister Modi for holding the Saturday's roadshow in Varanasi, allegedly without permissions from the authorities.
