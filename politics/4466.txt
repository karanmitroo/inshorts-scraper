Demonetisation has affected over 40 crore workers in the organised and unorganised sectors across the country, AAP claimed on Friday. Asserting that developed nations had stayed away from demonetisation, the party accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of driving "the world's largest economy into a mess". After demonetisation, even big companies had started laying off people, AAP further claimed.
