Reacting to BJP leader Vinay Katiyar's remark against Priyanka Gandhi, Robert Vadra said, "Such statements expose shameful mindset of some politicians. Katiyar should publically apologise for his remarks." This comes after Katiyar termed Priyanka as "not so pretty" and the daughter of Congress President Sonia Gandhi termed his remarks as laughable while he refused to apologise for the same.
