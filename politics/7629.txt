The Bharatiya Janata Party will be running a campaign named 'Swabhiman Abhiyan', from February 18 to 20 to instill a sense of ‘nationalism’ among the citizens. The party said that it wants to alert people about the threat of separatism and political conspiracy. The BJP has also sent letters to its state units to organise events during the three days.
