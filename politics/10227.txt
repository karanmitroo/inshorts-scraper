Congress MP Sanjay Singh's son, Anant Vikram Singh, joined BJP along with his supporters on Sunday. State party president Laxmi Kant Bajpai welcomed Anant in the BJP fold and gave him membership of the party in Lucknow (UP). Notably, Anant has an uneasy relationship with his father Sanjay Singh, who is currently a Rajya Sabha MP from Assam.
