BJP's state unit President in Kerala, V Muraleedharan, has said the party will not oppose consumption of beef in the state. "The BJP does not interfere with what kind of food people should eat and what dresses they wear. Our party Constitution does not speak about regulating food habit of the people or about imposing any dress code," Muraleedharan said.
