Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said that Lt Governor Najeeb Jung is speaking the language of the ex-British PM Winston Churchill who had opposed granting Independence to India. Jung doesnâ€™t have faith in democracy, Jain added. His remarks came a day after Jung ordered the review of all decisions by Delhi government which were not cleared by him.
