Shiv Sena MPs have said in the Parliament that they will not let any aircraft fly from Mumbai if the airlines do not revoke their ban on Ravindra Gaikwad. "If you want to diffuse the situation, we can do it. If you want to aggravate it...do that. But aircraft safety won't be compromised," Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said.
