The coffin maker of former AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, who was buried with full state honours on Tuesday, also reportedly made caskets for former PM Narasimha Rao and veteran actor Sivaji Ganesan. Jayalalithaa's coffin was made of sandalwood, with 'Puratchi Thalaivi Selvi' (Revolutionary Leader) engraved on it, and built with a freezer box to keep the body fresh, the company said.
