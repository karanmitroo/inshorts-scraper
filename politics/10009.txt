Responding to AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's challenge for a public debate, Kiran Bedi said she is ready for a debate, but will debate only on the floor of the House. "I believe in delivery of goals, programmes, vision, services while Kejriwal believes in debates," said the BJP's CM candidate for Delhi assembly elections on Tuesday.
