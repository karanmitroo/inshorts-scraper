A delegation of 15 Opposition parties led by Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Friday met President Ram Nath Kovind and demanded a Supreme Court-monitored SIT probe into the allegedly suspicious death of Justice BH Loya. Gandhi also submitted a memorandum signed by 114 parliamentarians to Kovind. Justice Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case when he died in 2014.
