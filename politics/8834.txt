Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday accused PM Narendra Modi of "blocking" the AAP's growth. He said, "in six months they have arrested three of our MLAs. But we have 64 more... at this pace they won't be able to arrest all of us even in 10 years." Kejriwal added, "all of us will surrender and work from Tihar."
