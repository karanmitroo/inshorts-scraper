Dissenting Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav are holding a 'Swaraj Samwad' convention on Tuesday, despite the party's warning of action against those who attend the event. AAP has said that the meeting is unauthorised, while Yadav said that they didnâ€™t need any prior approval to hold a meeting as they were party members.
