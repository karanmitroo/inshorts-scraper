Social activist Anna Hazare Thursday challenged PM Narendra Modi for an open debate on the amended Land Acquisition Bill. Responding to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's willingness to have a debate with all those who opposed the bill, Hazare said, "Gadkari's homework is weak. We are ready to have an open debate with PM on camera to discuss the issue threadbare."
