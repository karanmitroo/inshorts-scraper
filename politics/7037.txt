A BJP poster showing its Uttar Pradesh Chief Keshav Prasad Maurya as Lord Krishna has sparked a controversy. The poster also depicted CM Akhilesh Yadav, Congress' Rahul Gandhi, BSP Chief Mayawati, Azam Khan and AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi as Kauravas taking away the clothes of 'Draupadi' (Uttar Pradesh). The Samajwadi Party has accused the BJP of tarnishing the CMâ€™s image.
