A forensic report has revealed that the voice samples in an audio clip where alleged payments made to the BJP’s central leadership were being discussed matched with that of party’s senior leaders BS Yeddyurappa and Ananth Kumar. The audio clip was shared by senior Congress leader VS Ugrappa in February, following which the BJP alleged that the tapes were fabricated.
