Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday drew a parallel between the RSS and the ISIS, evoking sharp responses from the BJP and RSS, which demanded an apology. "We oppose organisations like ISIS, the way we oppose RSS," Azad said. The BJP demanded an apology from the Congress, while the RSS said such comparisons show “intellectual bankruptcy” of the Congress.
