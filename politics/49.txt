After Russian communist revolutionary Lenin's statue was brought down in Tripura, BJP spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said citizens have wanted to erect statues of national heroes like Swami Vivekananda instead of Lenin for a long time. This comes days after the BJP defeated the CPI(M), which had ruled the state for 25 years, to form the Tripura government.
