After banning liquor in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday demanded Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to "ensure total prohibition" of alcohol. "When liquor was banned in Bihar, people had problems for a few days. But, subsequently there was no problem," he said. Nitish also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ban alcohol in all the BJP-ruled states.
