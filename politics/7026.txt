Responding to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's call for a "BJP/RSS-mukt Bharat", BJP on Sunday said the JD(U) leader was "daydreaming". “What is Nitish Kumar’s credibility to call for a 'BJP-mukt Bharat' when he himself had been ‘BJP-yukt’ (associated with BJP) for 17 long years?” BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain questioned. He further called it Kumar's "desperate bid" to hog limelight.
