The Delhi police on Saturday received a complaint of molestation against Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas. The woman, who had earlier accused the supporters of Vishwas of posting malicious post on social media, has alleged that the AAP leader molested her in five-star hotels. As the matter is pending in the court, police have sought legal opinion.
