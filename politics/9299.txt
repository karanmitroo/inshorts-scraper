Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked the government over land laws. "We took two years to bring the land bill, but the NDA government has murdered it in just a few days," he said. Further, referring to the government as "suit-boot ki Sarkar", Rahul warned if farmers are "robbed", his party will take to the streets to protest.
