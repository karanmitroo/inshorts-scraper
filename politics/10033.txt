A day after Kiran Bedi joined BJP, former AAP leader Shazia Ilmi also joined the party on Friday after meeting party chief Amit Shah in Delhi. Shazia, however, said, "I have no interest to contest the Delhi assembly election, but just want to serve the people." Taking potshots at AAP, the former TV anchor said Delhi shouldn't face chaotic confrontation.
