Delhi CM and AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that the charges levelled against him by Kapil Mishra are baseless, unless he would have been in jail. “I would have not been here. Centre would had ensured that I am in jail even if there was an iota of truth in the charges levelled against me,” he said.
