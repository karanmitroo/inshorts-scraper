Senior Samajwadi Party leader Ramgopal Yadav, reacting strongly to Centre seeking a report from the state on the suspension of IAS officer Durga Nagpal, said that the state would ask the Centre to withdraw all IAS officers. The UP government justified its decision once again on Monday and served a chargesheet to Nagpal giving her 15 days' time to reply.
