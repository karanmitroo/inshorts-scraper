After the BJP government renamed Teacher's Day as Guru Utsav last week, DMK chief M Karunanidhi slammed the government for doing so, deeming it an imposition and a plot to defeat Tamil by using Hindi. "This is an apt example of hatching a conspiracy to downgrade Tamil language and those who made sacrifices for it's welfare", he said on Monday.
