After Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray directed party MLAs to visit drought-hit villages in their constituencies in Maharashtra, party MLA Gautam Chabukswar allegedly sent his impersonator to address the farmers. Chabukswar sent former Mumbai corporator Yashodhar Phanse to a drought-hit village where he posed as Chabukswar. Sena has called the incident "one person's mistake".
