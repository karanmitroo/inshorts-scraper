AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday said, "If Taslima Nasreen can stay here, why can’t Rohingyas? If Taslima can be the PM’s sister, can’t Rohingyas become his brothers?" This comes a day after the central government said in the Supreme Court that Rohingyas cannot be allowed to stay in India as refugees as they are a threat to national security.
