With BJP and AAP failing to get a majority in Delhi Assembly, President's rule appears imminent in Delhi. Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will be forced to recommend President's rule, if BJP or AAP fails to form the government by Dec-18. And in that case, the re-election may take place along with Lok Sabha polls.
