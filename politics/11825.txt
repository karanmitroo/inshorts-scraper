Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday launched a scathing attack on Narendra Modi, blaming him for the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat. He alleged that despite Modi’s warning that he might get killed if he visited Gujarat during the violence, he went. Yadav claimed that Modi's charisma wouldn’t work in UP and hit out at Gujarat’s so-called model of development.
