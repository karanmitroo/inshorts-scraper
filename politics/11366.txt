In a bid to woo Muslims, Mulayam Singh Yadav Sunday said - "Muslamano ne desh ko banaya hai aur musalamano ke liye sanvidhan mein sanshodhan karke arakshan diya jayega (Muslims have made this country, and amendments would be made in the constitution for their reservation)." He also claimed that SP enjoys the support of 80% muslims in the state.
