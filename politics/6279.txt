Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje on Saturday alleged that the previous Congress-led government left the state debt-ridden by ₹2.50 lakh crore with ₹80,000 crore in the power sector. She said "no bank from Delhi was ready to lend any loan" because of the state's indebtedness. However, she added that there is no fund crunch for the developmental work at present.
