Union Cabinet Minister Nitin Gadkari has defended Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the opposition's demand of the PM's intervention on the Dadri lynching issue, saying he need not speak on every issue. "Is it the PM's job to speak about every incident? There's the home minister and other ministers. Did Manmohan Singh speak on all issues?" Gadkari said.
