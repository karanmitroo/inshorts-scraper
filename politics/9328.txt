NCP Chief Sharad Pawar Monday sparked a row by saying that the Shiv Sena-BJP tie up, which is the ruling alliance in Maharashtra, would break before the 2017 Mumbai civic polls. "I have been told this by someone in the government itself," Pawar said. In the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, the BJP has 122 seats while Shiv Sena has 63.
