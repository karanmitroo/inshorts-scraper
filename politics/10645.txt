Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa has opposed the UGC's circular for compulsory Hindi in colleges. "The UGC circular is unacceptable and illegal. The circular wouldn't apply for Tamil Nadu universities", she said. Earlier, the DMK and the NDA allies PMK and MDMK also opposed the circular which asks universities to teach Hindi and English as main subjects at the graduation level.
