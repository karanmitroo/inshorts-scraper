The Telangana Rashtra Samithi party supports its "Andhra brothers" demanding special status for the state, MP Kavitha Kalvakuntla told the Lok Sabha on Thursday. She urged the Centre to honour the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. The Telugu Desam Party's decision of remaining a BJP-ally while protesting against the Centre was sending a "wrong message", she added.
