Condemning the suspension of BSF soldier Tej Bahadur Yadav, Congress on Thursday asserted that he should have been treated like a whistleblower. "It is extremely unfortunate and regrettable," Congress leader Manish Tewari said about his suspension. By pointing out the poor quality of food being served to the soldiers, he was doing a national service, Tewari added.
