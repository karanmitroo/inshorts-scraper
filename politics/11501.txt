All four people, including state minister Sabitri Mitra's son-in-law Samadip Sarkar, accused of beating up Election Commission personnel in Malda (WB) were arrested Friday. On Thursday, a four-member team of EC personnel were videographing a motorcycle rally of TMC workers when they were thrashed by the activists, provoking the EC to ask the district administration to take stern action.
