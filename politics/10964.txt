"I know we shouldn't have resigned and I apologize for it. But this time, I promise I will not resign," said AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal during a rally on Sunday. Kejriwal also asked the e-rickshaw owners - the party's crucial vote bank - not to be charmed by BJP, which, he claimed, confiscated their rickshaws and challaned them.
