Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has urged for a change in leadership to rejuvenate the party, saying that it is high time for Rahul Gandhi to take over the reins from his mother and party president Sonia  Gandhi. "The slump takes place in all parties. It has nothing to do with the leadership issue," he added further.
