Rajiv Gandhi had asked former West Bengal CM Jyoti Basu to become Prime Minister twice during times of political tumult in 1990 and 1991, according to the newly released autobiography of former CBI director and Bengal DGP, Arun Prosad Mukherjee. The book, which is based on Mukherjee's diary entries, says that both times, the request was vetoed by CPM leaders.
