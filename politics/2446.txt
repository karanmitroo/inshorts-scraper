The Air India Cabin Crew Association has demanded an unconditional apology from Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad for beating up a 60-year-old staffer, stating he poses a risk to flight safety. "Unless he tenders an unconditional apology to AI employeesâ€¦we mustn't let him on board," said the association. If he's let off, it would be a crying shame, it added.
