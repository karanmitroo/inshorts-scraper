Tamil Nadu's interim CM O Panneerselvam on Sunday claimed he was subjected to harassment and torture all these years, and it was only late CM Jayalalithaa who had stood by him. He also questioned why was Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa Jayakumar not even allowed to see Amma's body. Further, he said many party cadres have been voicing their opinion against Sasikala.
