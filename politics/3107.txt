Former Nagaland Chief Minister TR Zeliang was on Saturday appointed as Finance Advisor to the state government by Governor PB Acharya. Zeliang will receive the pay, allowances and all other facilities admissible to a cabinet minister. Zeliang resigned from the CM post on February 19 amid protests in the state against reservation for women in the local body elections.
