RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday said they have come to Uttar Pradesh to strengthen the Samajwadi Party and "chase away" BJP like they had done in Bihar. JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said they have come to attend the SP function as they have "old relations". However, there are no talks of a coalition as of now, he added.
