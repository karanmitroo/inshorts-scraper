CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Tuesday alleged that corruption, black money and terrorism have flourished post demonetisation. "Six months on, still no data on how much money in old currency notes has returned to the system," he said. "Government has let the big fish — bank loan defaulters — off and ruined India's informal economy," he added.
