BJP has slammed Congress spokesperson Al-Nasser Zakaria for criticising the outfit of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amruta in an upcoming album, featuring her and actor Amitabh Bachchan. "The trend continues, making us believe that the party has a tradition of undermining women and treating them like animals," BJP spokesman Keshav Upadhye said.
