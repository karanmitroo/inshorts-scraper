BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao must take a decision on the ongoing political crisis in the state by Monday, else a case on "charges of abatement of horse trading" can be filed. Swamy had earlier maintained that AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala will become CM as she has the numbers in her favour.
