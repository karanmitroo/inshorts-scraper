The Delhi HC Monday issued a notice to AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, Election Commission, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer and five others on plea seeking cancellation of his candidature from contesting Delhi polls. The plea had been filed by Congress leader Kiran Walia, questioning the legality of Kejriwal's candidature from the New Delhi seat as he is a UP resident.
