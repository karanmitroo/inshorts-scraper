Former Home Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said the recent Nagrota attack is as "shameful" as the 2008 Mumbai carnage and has "disproved" the belief that surgical strikes can end cross-border terrorism. Chidambaram added that there is no "unified command" at the level of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
