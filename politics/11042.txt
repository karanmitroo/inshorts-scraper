BJP leader Yashwant Sinha and 54 others were remanded in judicial custody by a Jharkhand court for 14 days Tuesday, after they refused to seek bail in a case of alleged assault of a JSEB official. The official had filed an FIR, accusing them of tying him up during a demonstration on electricity crisis by the BJP's Hazaribagh unit.
