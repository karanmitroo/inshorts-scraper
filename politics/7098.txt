The Congress on Saturday criticised the Pakistani High Commissioner to India, Abdul Basit, and demanded his repatriation for unilaterally calling the bilateral peace talks suspended. "If Government of India really wants to take any action they should order the Pakistani High Commissioner out," Congress leader Manish Tewari said. "This Government has no policy towards Pakistan," he further alleged.
