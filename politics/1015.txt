MNS Chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday said that PM Narendra Modi has lost popularity in his home state Gujarat and has failed to live up to the hype. The PM should behave like a PM and not as Gujarat CM, Thackeray said. He added that the PM should live up to the huge mandate given to him by the people.
