Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday pitched for a second term for President Pranab Mukherjee, while Congress said the party high command will take a call on it. Insisting Mukherjee has proved to be the "best President", Raut said nobody can doubt his capabilities. "Uddhav Thackeray too has a lot of respect and affection for Pranab Mukherjee," he said.
