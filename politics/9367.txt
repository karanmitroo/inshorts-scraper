BJP leader Sakshi Maharaj, while addressing a meeting at Amroli Ratanpur village (UP), called Rahul Gandhi "mad". "He doesn’t know the ABCD of politics. He is talking of farmers but does not know the difference between wheat and maize," Maharaj said. He compared PM Narendra Modi with Lord Krishna, saying like Krishna saved ‘draupadi’, PM Modi came to rescue Nepal.
