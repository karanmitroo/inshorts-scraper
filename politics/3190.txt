Bihar Deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav has dared PM Narendra Modi to address the alleged BJP links with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI. "Beware, the country is in danger. Self proclaimed and so called patriotic PM is totally mum on sponsorship of ISI agents by his party," he added. Notably, certain ISI operatives arrested in Madhya Pradesh allegedly had links with BJP.
