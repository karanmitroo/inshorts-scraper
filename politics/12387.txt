In retaliation to MPCC's (Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee) alleged defamatory publication in newspapers and internet, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his wife Sadhna Singh on Sunday sent a legal notice for defamation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. With the help of an advertisement, MPCC had accused Chouhan of keeping a currency counting machine at their official residence.
