Alleging that BJP is trying to "hijack" Indian history for political purposes, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said his party would not let BJP reduce India to a "Hindu Pakistan". "They, instead of accepting that at one time they were on the wrong side of the history, want us to believe that they are the true nationalists," he added.
