RJD leader Bhai Birendra on Monday refused to remove red beacon atop his car and said that he won't do so as the order is not by the Bihar government. "Which cabinet decided this? Why Bihar will follow any decision by the Delhi Cabinet. If our government will pass this order then only we will follow the rule," he said.
