The BJP has said that Pakistan Army Chief General Raheel Sharif’s allegation that India is creating instability through ceasefire violations and supporting militancy in Pakistan is ludicrous. “To say such things to others is laughable. Pakistan should first think of how to tackle terrorism in their own country. They are nurturing terrorists in their country,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said.
