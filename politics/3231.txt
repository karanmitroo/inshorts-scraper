Home Minister Rajnath on Saturday took a jibe at Congress' alliance with the Samajwadi Party, saying that it took bicycle (SP's poll symbol) ride after khaat sabha failure. "When Congress realised that the party would not be able to muster votes through khaat sabha, it immediately took a bicycle ride. However, the bicycle they are riding is punctured," Rajnath added.
