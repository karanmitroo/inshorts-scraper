Samajwadi Party state chief Shivpal Yadav, who was recently sacked from the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet, on Thursday said that he never aimed to become the Chief Minister and will always remain Mulayam Singh Yadav's "disciplined soldier". "Had I wanted, I could have been [CM] in 2003 but I supported Mulayam Singh Yadav and he became the CM," Yadav added.
