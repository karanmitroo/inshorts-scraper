The Congress on Monday distanced itself from Chidambaram's opinion that banning Salman Rushdie's book Satanic Verses 'was a mistake' by Rajiv Gandhi government, calling it his "individual opinion". The party was divided over the issue with leaders Manish Tewari backing Chidambaram and Sandeep Dikshit arguing that if Chidambaram had thought that the ban was incorrect, he could have rectified it.
