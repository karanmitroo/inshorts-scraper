Describing the decision as 'shocking', West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today sharply criticized Centre’s move to raise LS poll expenditure limit from 40 lakhs to 70 lakhs. “It would only help large political parties with enough cash and encourage corruption and black money,” she said. Furthermore, this decision would put poor parties like Trinamool Congress at disadvantage, she added.
