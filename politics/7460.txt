Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday criticised Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for voicing "sympathies" for "those who raised slogans for breaking up India". It was Rahul Gandhi's "ideological hollowness" that he did something that the likes of Indira and Rajiv Gandhi never did, Jaitley said. Congress has always been against those wanting to break-up the country, Jaitley asserted.
