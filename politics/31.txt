Drawing references from Hindu epic Ramayana, Uttar Pradesh Minister Nand Gopal Gupta on Monday said Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav is "Ravana of Kalyug" and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati is Ravana's sister Surpanakha. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is Ravana's maternal uncle Maricha, Gupta added. This comes after the BSP extended support to SP in the upcoming by-polls.
