Former Union Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram on Saturday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have the courage to accept that note ban was a wrong decision. He further alleged that demonetisation had resulted in the loss of 1.5 lakh jobs. "Only the BJP version of economics says demonetisation was good," he added.
