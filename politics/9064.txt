Shiv Sena on Tuesday slammed NCP chief Sharad Pawar for his admission that Dawood Ibrahim had offered to surrender while he was the Maharashtra CM. Sena said that American commandos didn't wait for Osama bin Laden to surrender, they went to Pakistan and killed him. "If there is a will, he can still be dragged back to India," Sena added.
