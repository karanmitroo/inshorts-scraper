National Panthers Party (NPP) leader Bhim Singh has said that Governor’s rule must be imposed in Kashmir “to restore normalcy” in the Valley. He criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his delayed observations on the unrest during his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme. “Kashmir is bleeding and Mehbooba Mufti is making loud statements without realising the depth of the problem,” Singh added.
