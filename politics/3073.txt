BJP has accused the Congress-led Uttarakhand government of using funds meant for disaster victims to make payments to cricketer Virat Kohli and musician Kailash Kher for a promotional video for the state. "CM Harish Rawat has not only insulted the disaster victims, but also these celebrities who were not aware out of what fund they were being paid," BJP said.
