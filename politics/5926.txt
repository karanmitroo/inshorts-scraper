Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia has condemned PM Narendra Modi’s remarks against cow vigilantes, stating he has insulted the ‘gau rakshaks’ (cow protectors). Instead of praising their efforts to save cows, Modi had termed 80% of them as anti-social, he added. Meanwhile, activist Tehseen Poonawala has moved the Supreme Court seeking ban on ‘Gau Rakshak Dals’.
