Addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh's Kangra, PM Narendra Modi said, "I haven't come here to ask you to make BJP win. I have come here to ask you to give it a 3/4th majority." He further said that no senior Congress leader came here to campaign, which showed that the party already left the field leaving everything on fate.
