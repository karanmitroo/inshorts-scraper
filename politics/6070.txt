The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea challenging the acquittal of BJP National President Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin 'fake encounter case'. The court held that activist Harish Mander had no locus standi to challenge Amit Shah's discharge in the case. Earlier, the Mumbai Sessions court had given Shah a clean chit in the case in 2014.
