Congress leader Rashid Masood (66) was formally disqualified as a Rajya Sabha member on Monday, thereby becoming the first MP to get suspended after the Supreme Court ruled for immediate disqualification of convicted legislators. A CBI court had held him guilty in a case of corruption and other offences on charges of fraudulently nominating undeserving candidates to MBBS seats.
