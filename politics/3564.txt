Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, TMC MP Derek O’Brien alleged the government is mainstreaming hate and PM Narendra Modi follows 26 Twitter handles that "routinely give rape, death and communal threats". "Two handles suspended by Twitter for abuse, but still followed by PM," he further stated. "They are invited to PM’s house for digital social party," he added.
