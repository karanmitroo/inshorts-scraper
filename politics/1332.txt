Claiming that there was no difference between 'Taanashahi' (dictatorship) and 'Amitshahi', Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Saturday said, "The shehnai of democracy is being silenced while a cannon of 'ek-tantra' (one-man rule) is being fired." Referring to PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, Ramesh said only two people were holding this cannon of one-man rule.
