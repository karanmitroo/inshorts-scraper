The Election Commission on Wednesday slapped a notice on Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal for distributing pamphlets seeking votes from Muslims on religious grounds. Meanwhile, Kejriwal expressed grief over a video showing Anna Hazare purportedly expressing disappointment over the alleged misuse of funds collected during the Jan Lokpal Bill drive. However, Hazare said there was no "tiff" between them.
