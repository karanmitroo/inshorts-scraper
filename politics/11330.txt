The Delhi High Court has agreed to hear a PIL filed against Robert Vadra. It was filed by an advocate seeking criminal investigation against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law in connection with his alleged land deals and other corruption related charges. This comes on a day when Priyanka Gandhi said that the charges against her husband are politicaly motivated.
