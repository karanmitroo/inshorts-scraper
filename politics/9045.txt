Terming Emergency imposed in 1975 by former PM Indira Gandhi as a 'right decision', Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Monday said the party need not apologise for the same. "After that (Emergency), people voted Indira Gandhi as the PM. So, if we have to apologise, then the people will also have to apologise (for electing her again)," Khurshid said.
