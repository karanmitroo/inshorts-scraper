Claiming that the Assam government had paid to ferry nearly half of the over 500 people who attended Governor Jagdish Mukhi's swearing-in ceremony, the Congress party criticised the event for being "lavish". The cash-strapped state government booked top-end hotels and government guesthouses for the attendees, it added. The guests reportedly included 223 people from Sohna village in Haryana.
