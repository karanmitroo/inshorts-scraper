After saying that the BJP had gained from split with the Shiv Sena before the Maharashtra Assembly elections, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has clarified that he did not mean that the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance would break up. “We will contest elections with our allies. Although the split helped us, it doesn’t mean the saffron alliance will break,’’ he said.
