Protesting against Maharashtra government's decision not to announce farm loan waivers in the state budget on Saturday, Opposition MLAs burnt copies of the budget outside the Legislature. Several members tried to disrupt the budget presentation in the Assembly. The leader of Opposition, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, called the state government's decision to not announce the loan waiver a "betrayal".
