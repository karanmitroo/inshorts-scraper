Referring to the recent Dadri lynching, BJP MP Satyapal Singh on Tuesday said that it's a "small incident" and India's democratic atmosphere is fully competent to deal with such incidents. Congress spokesperson Ajoy Kumar called the remark “shameful” and said, “I am absolutely dismayed at the remarks of the BJP MP, who was also a former police commissioner of Mumbai.”
