Criticising the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, Congress leader Manish Tewari has accused the BJP-led Central government of paying lip service to farmers and other marginalised sections. He termed the Budget as a "classic case of too less and at the inappropriate time." Jaitley announced a 10% increase in institutional credit for agricultural activities.
