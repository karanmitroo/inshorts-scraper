Expelled AIADMK leader Sasikala Pushpa claimed that Sasikala Natrajan is the wrong person to be nominated as party's general secretary as she had tried to kill late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa. "She (Jayalalithaa) has not even given her (Natrajan) a councillor or an MLA seat. It shows that political life is not fit for her," Pushpa said.
