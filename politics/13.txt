A video showing a bulldozer razing Communist icon Lenin's statue in the state's Belonia area recently surfaced online. The incident took place nearly two days after the BJP won the Tripura Assembly elections, ending 25 years of Communist Party of India (Marxist)'s rule. Reports said some right-wing workers also played football with the statue's head.
