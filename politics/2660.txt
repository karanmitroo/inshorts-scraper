A video showing Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad allegedly trying to beat up an Air India staffer has surfaced. Gaikwad appeared to throw the staffer off the plane and a lady was seen telling Gaikwad that a murder case might be lodged over his actions. However, Gaikwad replied that he doesn't bother as he already had several cases against him.
