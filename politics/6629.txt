In response to his statements against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, RJD on Sunday issued a show-cause notice to party MP Mohammed Taslimuddin. This comes after JD(U) requested RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav to take action against Taslimuddin for speaking against the Bihar CM. Taslimuddin had recently criticised Nitish Kumar and urged Yadav to end the RJD-JD(U) alliance in Bihar.
