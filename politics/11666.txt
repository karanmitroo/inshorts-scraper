Stung by his party's stand on not giving him a ticket of his choice, Jaswant Singh filed his nomination from Barmer (Rajasthan) as an independent candidate against BJPâ€™s candidate Colonel Sonaram. A BJP worker for over three decades, Singh wanted to contest from Barmer but BJP fielded the colonel saying that he was more likely to win from the constituency.
