A day after an AAP delegation met deceased farmer Gajendra Singh's family, the party-led Delhi government announced to name the farmer's compensation scheme after Singh. Gajendra's family also demanded martyr's status for him, and a government job for a relative; both demands were met by the government. The Rajasthan farmer had publicly committed suicide during CM Arvind Kejriwal's rally.
