BJP leader Nitin Gadkari Saturday alleged a deal was brokered between AAP and Congress by a reputed industrialist in a hotel to "stop BJP at any cost" from coming to power in Delhi. Training his guns at AAP which formed the government in Delhi, Gadkari also termed it as a "right-wing Maoist party" which wants to "destroy" the democratic system.
