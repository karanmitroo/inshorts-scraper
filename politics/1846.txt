The Public Works Department of Delhi government has reportedly slapped a fine of â‚¹27 lakh on AAP for the "unauthorised occupation" of its Rouse Avenue party office. The Delhi government had allotted the bungalow to AAP after the party approved a land allotment policy for state parties in 2015. However, PWD directed AAP to vacate the office in April 2017.
