Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday called BJP the "most anti-national of all" and alleged that it was shielding those who raised anti-national slogans at JNU. This follows the finding of a JNU panel that the controversial slogans on JNU campus were raised by outsiders. BJP did not arrest the "real traitors" to not upset Mehbooba Mufti, Kejriwal alleged.
