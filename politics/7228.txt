AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said that he was a loyal Indian and does not need a certificate of patriotism from anyone. "My political party is not of Muslims but of Indians... We have given our blood to this nation," Owaisi added. He made the statement after receiving flak for saying, "I won't say Bharat Mata Ki Jai".
