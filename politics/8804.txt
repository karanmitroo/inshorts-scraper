The Congress on Tuesday attacked the Narendra Modi-led government for allegedly showing weakness in dealing with Pakistan. “Civilians are being attacked, heavy shelling is going on... India has always been on the receiving end as far as the relationship with Pakistan is concerned,” said Congress leader PC Chacko. He further alleged that Pakistan was ignoring India and taking it lightly.
