A Shiv Sena corporator and a BJP worker have filed complaints against each other over a scuffle that started over dustbin distribution. While Shiv Sena's Sandhya Doshi claimed that a BJP worker tried to tear off her clothes and filed a molestation complaint, the BJP worker filed a criminal intimidation case against Doshi claiming she pointed a revolver at him.
