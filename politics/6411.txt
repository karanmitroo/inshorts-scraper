BJP leader Kailash Vijaywargiya on Thursday claimed that he used social media to create a "public outcry" over Kamal Nath's role in 1984 anti-Sikh riots, forcing him to resign as Congress' in-charge of Punjab. He further claimed that BJP had taken its membership to 10 crore by using mobile phones, making it the "largest organisation" in the world.
