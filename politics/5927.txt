Referring to actor Shah Rukh Khan’s detention at a US airport, Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan has said that Muslims are “disturbed a lot” and don’t know where to go. “Modiji is not permitting us to lead a peaceful life here and in America, PM’s friend Barack Obama would not allow us to live,” Khan added.
