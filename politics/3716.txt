Historian Ramchandra Guha has said Congress cannot revive as a major national party in the shape it was at one point of time. He further said he can even bet his smartphone on the 231-year-old party's non-revival. "He (Rahul Gandhi) is the first member of the (Gandhi) family who isn't liked even by a large section in Congress," Guha added.
