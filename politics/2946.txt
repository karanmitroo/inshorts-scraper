BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday said that the former PM Jawaharlal Nehru's sole contribution to the Constitution was the controversial Article 370. Taking potshots at JNU, Swamy further said that Nehru has left students of JNU as his political successors. "They (JNU students) encourage people who throw stones at our soldiers in Kashmir," he added.
