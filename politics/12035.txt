Within only a few hour, Vinod Kumar Binny on Monday ended his hunger strike. Reportedly, the expelled AAP MLA ended the strike on the advice on veteran Gandhian Anna Hazare and the Delhi lieutenant governor. Binny, who was expelled due to his alleged indiscipline, said he would continue to raise public-related issues even if it amounted to indiscipline.
