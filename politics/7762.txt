The release of ‘Nathuram Godse – The Story of an Assassin’, a book on Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse by Anup Ashok Sardesai has faced opposition from the newly formed 'Goa Forward' party. Calling the event a "veiled celebration of a murder", the party said that the release scheduled on January 30, Gandhi's death anniversary, will disturb peace and harmony.
