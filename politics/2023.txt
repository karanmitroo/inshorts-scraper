Congress President Sonia Gandhi was admitted to New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Tuesday to receive treatment for food poisoning. Gandhi is well now and will be discharged soon, the hospital said in a statement. The 70-year-old leader was admitted to the hospital in August last year as well, after being taken ill during a roadshow in Varanasi.
