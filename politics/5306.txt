Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Monday alleged that during UPA regime, the poor couldn't obtain bank loans and even opening bank accounts was not easy for them. Furthermore, without taking former PM Manmohan Singh's name, she said that though he was an expert in economics, his expertise was “not visible”. Congress did not pay attention to development, she added.
