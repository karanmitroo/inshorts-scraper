Congress on Wednesday took to the streets to protest against Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan's decision to suspend its 25 MPs. Scores of party workers, led by Indian Youth Congress President Amrinder Raja Brar, marched towards the Speaker's official residence at Akbar Road. A few protesters received minor injuries when police used water cannons to disperse them.
