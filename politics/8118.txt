Former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member and Swaraj Abhiyan leader Prashant Bhushan on Tuesday said that the Delhi government's Janlokpal Bill is the ''biggest betrayal'' to India's anti-corruption movement. "These people (AAP) think that just because they have a social media team and propaganda budget of â‚¹523 crore they can get away with any kind of lies," Bhushan added.
