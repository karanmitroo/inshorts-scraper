Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said that the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance in the state has shaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi's confidence. The Bharatiya Janata Party is insecure because of our alliance which is youth-oriented, he added. "Several times people say 'Mann ki Baat' but not 'Kaam ki Baat'," Akhilesh said slamming the PM for his radio show.
