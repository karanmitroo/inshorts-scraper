The Election Commission has announced that it will make the voting system watertight by introducing Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) by the 2019 General Elections. "EVMs are not temperable and the integrity of the electoral process is preserved," the poll panel said. The EC has asked for an additional fund of â‚¹3,174 crore for the purchase of VVPAT machines.
