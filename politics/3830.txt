BJP's legislator in Uttar Pradesh Assembly Sangeet Som was on Wednesday charged for allegedly instigating communal hatred in his constituency, after his supporters screened a documentary to polarise voters. The video reportedly contained clippings of incidents that eventually led to the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013. The police have booked two others over the matter and seized the video clips.
