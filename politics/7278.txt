Responding to the recent debate over chanting of "Bharat Mata ki Jai", Veteran BJP leader LK Advani on Wednesday refused to comment on the issue, calling it a "meaningless controversy". Advani's comments come amid BJP and Shiv Sena leaders slamming AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi for refusing to chant 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' as it was not constitutionally mandatory.
