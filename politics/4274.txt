Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh on Wednesday challenged AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal to fight against him in the upcoming state Assembly polls. "Tell us, why are you (Kejriwal) so scared of fighting me?" Singh tweeted. The Congress leader had earlier alleged that AAP and SAD had an "underhand deal" after AAP fielded Jarnail Singh against Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal.
