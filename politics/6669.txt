BJP leader Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said the Samajwadi Party is a "sinking ship" and added that it is good that all those destined to sink would sink together. This comes after the SP nominated Amar Singh to the Rajya Sabha. Earlier, SP leader and Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan said the party's decision to nominate Amar Singh was "unfortunate".
