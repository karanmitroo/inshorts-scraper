After AAP faced defeat in Rajouri Garden by-poll, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said people were angry after AAP MLA Jarnail Singh left the seat to fight Punjab Assembly election. "We tried to calm them down but couldn't. The anger was more," he added. He, however, maintained the by-poll defeat would not have an impact on the MCD polls.
