The Election Commission (EC) on Friday cleared PM Narendra Modi's 'Mann ki Baat' radio broadcast for Sunday. The EC, however, instructed that it should adhere to the Model Code of Conduct in force due to the upcoming assembly elections. Notably, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry had approached the EC to obtain clearance for the broadcast due to the upcoming polls.
