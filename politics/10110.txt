Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said his government cannot ensure 24-hour electricity supply in the state in the present situation. The statement has displeased the people who feel cheated because the Narendra Modi-led government had assured them 24-hour power supply in their election rallies prior to the Lok Sabha and state assembly polls last year.
