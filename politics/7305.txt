Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday wrote to PM Narendra Modi over the "growing attacks" on minorities, including the Latehar killings. Azad said, "Ministers, MPs and MLAs, leaders of the ruling party and affiliates of Sangh Parivar have been persistently making.... offensive statements to divide and polarise the communities." Two cattle traders were recently murdered in Latehar, Jharkhand.
