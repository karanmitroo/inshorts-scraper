BJP MLA Alok Sanjar took to the streets of Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal on Friday to clean the litters of Diwali celebrations. "Even during a feast, we first perform a cleanliness drive and then consume our food. We want Bhopal- the second cleanest city in India to reach number one position and we are putting efforts in this direction," Sanjar said.
