Former PM Manmohan Singh's ex-media advisor, Sanjaya Baru, has alleged that the Congress mistreated ex-PM PV Narasimha Rao and when the latter died, the party didn’t allow his funeral in Delhi. “Narasimha Rao brought major economic changes because the BJP under Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership supported him,” he added. Baru also held ex-PM Rajiv Gandhi responsible for 1991 economic crisis.
