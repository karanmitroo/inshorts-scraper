Reacting to the election results of five legislative assemblies, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Thursday said that the political party was not defeatist. "We'll work hard with people and win back their confidence," Singh further said. Terming the verdict 'not very encouraging', Singh added that the defeat cannot be blamed on central leadership and state units must look into it.
