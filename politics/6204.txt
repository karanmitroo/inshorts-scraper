Addressing the 11th Inter-State Council meeting, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the President's Rule should be imposed in a state only if the government loses its majority in the assembly. Further, he added that the Centre should avoid the imposition of the President's rule on "frivolous" grounds and thus, the 'misuse' of the office of the Governor.
