After PM Narendra Modi alleged that Indira Gandhi snubbed demonetisation recommendation in 1971, Congress MP Ahmed Patel asked why Atal Bihari Vajpayee didn't reimplement it if it was a success in 1978. Saying that Vajpayee was part of the 1978 demonetisation yet didn't reimplement it as PM, Patel questioned the coincidence of both ₹1,000 and ₹2,000 note being NDA's legacy.
