BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday said that Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has lost his mental balance after his second marriage. His remarks came in response to Singh’s allegations that ‘someone’ was behind the escape of SIMI members from Bhopal jail. “He (Singh) had also said something about Hemant Karkare (IPS officer) being killed by the RSS,” Swamy added.
