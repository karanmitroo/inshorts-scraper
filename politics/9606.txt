The Bombay HC Tuesday rejected Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's plea to squash a defamation case against him for blaming RSS for Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. Rahul, who gave the controversial statement at a rally during 2014 general elections, was directed to appear before the magistrate's court. Later, he approached the HC seeking exemption from appearance and quashing of the complaint.
