The CPI(M) on Thursday termed the execution of Yakub Memon a “miscarriage of justice”. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the government was “going slow in Hindutva terrorism cases like Malegaon or Samjhauta Express blasts or in the case of Maya Kodnani." Kodnani is a former Gujarat Minister convicted in the 2002 Gujarat riots case.
