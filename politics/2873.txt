Winning 56 seats in Uttarakhand elections, the BJP on Saturday became the first ever political party to win over 50 seats in the 70-member assembly. Ever since the state's formation in 2000, the highest number of seats won by any party in Uttarakhand was 36 by the Congress in 2002. Notably, a repoll has been ordered in the Lohaghat constituency.
