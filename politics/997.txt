Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut on Thursday said the Narendra Modi wave has faded and added that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is capable of leading the country. Further, referring to the nickname used to mock Rahul on social media, Raut said, "It's wrong to call him 'Pappu'...People (the biggest political power in India) can make anyone 'Pappu'."
