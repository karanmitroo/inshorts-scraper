Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti has sold her soul to stay in power, said National Conference leader Omar Abdullah. His reaction came after the Cabinet approved the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) for Jammu. “Jammu gets the IIT & gets the IIM also. Where have all those voices that called for balanced regional development in J&K disappeared?” he tweeted.
