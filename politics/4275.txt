SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday praised PM Narendra Modi and said that he is a man of humble background, who faced a lot of trouble to become the Prime Minister. However, Mulayam criticised BJP and said the party has not fulfilled its promises to people. The public will give a befitting reply to BJP over demonetisation, he added.
