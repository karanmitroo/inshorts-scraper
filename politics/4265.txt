The Centre has decided to launch a campaign to inform people about benefits of demonetisation. According to reports, all central ministers have been asked to hold rallies and take part in mass-contact events to inform people about demonetisation. Also, a 60-page dossier describing the need, the action plan, and the impact of demonetisation has been issued to ministers, reports said.
