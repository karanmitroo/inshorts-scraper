Former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said at the party's national convention that the BJP government is the best event manager known to the Indian history. "When PM Narendra Modi talks of cashless society he talks about something that never happened anywhere. He has no right, it's my choice to use cash or card," Chidambaram added.
