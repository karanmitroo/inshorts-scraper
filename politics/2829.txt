Goa Convenor of AAP Elvis Gomes on Monday said the Election Commission should just "auction" every seat to the highest bidder instead of going through the entire process of contesting an election. "Money plays a big role in deciding who is elected, because the EC machinery has failed. Sometimes I wonder why we should have elections at all?" he added.
