After the bodies of two Indian soldiers were mutilated by Pakistan Army, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said the Indian Army should be ordered to annihilate the Pakistani forces, taking the march right up to Islamabad. "They did it in the past. They'll do it again. The only solution before India is to launch an unrelenting campaign against Pakistan," he added.
