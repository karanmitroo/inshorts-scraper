Commenting on P Chidambaram’s performance, former finance minister (during NDA regime) Yashwant Sinha on Monday said - "He reduced planned expenditure by Rs 80K crore, which is mindless. He has transferred Rs.60K crore to oil companies. He has done financial terrorism. Chidambaram will have to be born again to match my record as finance minister of the country.”
