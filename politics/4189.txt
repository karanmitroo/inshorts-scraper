The Supreme Court on Monday ordered that no politician can seek votes in the name of caste, language or religion. Elections are a secular exercise and religion has no role in it, a seven-judge bench of the court said. Man's relationship with God is an individual's choice and the state is forbidden to interfere in such an activity, it added.
