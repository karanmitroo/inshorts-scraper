Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra on Saturday criticised the exemption for VIPs in the odd-even formula initiative of the AAP-led Delhi government, terming it 'complete hypocrisy.' Vadra via a Facebook post said, "If a law is implemented in the interest of the people, we all must adhere, and not be VIPs." Meanwhile, the BJP termed Vadra's criticism 'ironical.'
