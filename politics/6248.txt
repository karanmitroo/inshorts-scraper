The Mumbai Congress will hold a 'potholes exhibition' on July 12 wherein it will display pictures of potholes and the area they are situated in. Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and other BJP leaders are also invited to the event. The idea behind organising the exhibition is to bust government authorities' recent claims that Mumbai has "only 66 potholes", Congress said.
