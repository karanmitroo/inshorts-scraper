Assam Congress MLA Rumi Nath was on Tuesday arrested for her alleged connection with a car theft racket. Reportedly, the leader of the gang, Anil Chauhan, was issued State Assembly car passes on the recommendation of Nath. However, denying the charges, she said, "I have no connection with Chauhan... This is just a political conspiracy to defame me."
