MNS Chitrapat Sena leader Amey Khopkar on Wednesday criticised Pakistani artistes, who work in India, stating they “tweet sympathy” when there’s an attack in Paris and Syria, but not when there is an attack in Uri. “We don’t have anything against individual actors, but you can't separate art and the nation. Country comes first,” he added.
