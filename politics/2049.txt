Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Monday shared an email ID, 'letscleanaap@gmail.com', asking all the party volunteers across India, Canada and the US to send evidence of corruption in the Aam Aadmi Party. Stating that he will never join BJP, Mishra added, "If there is one man who spoke against Modi, then that is me."
