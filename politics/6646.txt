In a letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice Rajinder Sachar has said that General (Retired) VK Singh’s suggestion to rename Akbar Road as Maharana Pratap Road is a product of a “warped communal mind”. Justice Sachar added that to “avoid further communal passions” the government should publicly announce its opposition to the move.
