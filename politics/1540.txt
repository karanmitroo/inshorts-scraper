The Ghaziabad Police has booked 14 people including 3 Congress workers for resorting to violence during protests in front of the Ala Hazrat Haj House on Monday. Nearly 500 protesters had pelted stones at the police during the protest demanding that the facility be opened to pilgrims immediately. The facility has remained sealed since its inauguration last year.
