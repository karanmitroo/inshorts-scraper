Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday blamed Congress for the rise of terrorism in Punjab during the 1980s. It fought the 1984 elections on the plank of communalism, pitting the Punjabi people against each other, he alleged. Jaitley asserted that it was the Akali-BJP coalition that worked towards healing the wounds of the people and brought back normalcy to Punjab.
