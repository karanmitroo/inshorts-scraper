The Election Commission on Monday ordered that no newspaper advertisements shall be published on December 8 and 9 in Gujarat without prior clearance. The policy comes after instances of "advertisements of offending and misleading nature" were reported to the EC. The commission also directed newspapers to be informed against bringing out advertisements that were not cleared by it.
