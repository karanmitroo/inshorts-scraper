If BJPâ€™s Narendra Modi becomes PM then it would act as a "catalyst" for a long-term advance in the rupee toward 40 to 45 per dollar, from 61.19 on March 14, according to Citigroup's head of Asia-Pacific currency and derivatives sales. This would represent a 35% rally in India's currency from the end of last week, strongest since April 2008.
