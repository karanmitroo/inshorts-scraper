After Bihar CM Nitish Kumar won floor test, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tejashwi said, "If it was about corruption, JD(U) shouldn't have allied with my father, who was facing cases." Notably, Nitish had resigned as the CM and split from the Grand Alliance while taking a stand on fighting against corruption following graft charges against alliance partner RJD.
