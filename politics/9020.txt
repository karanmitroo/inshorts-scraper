Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday undertook 8-km long 'padyatra' or foot march in Rajasthan over the land acquisition bill issue. "I want to assure you that Congress will not let the NDA government have a single inch of land. We will not let them move forward," Gandhi told the farmers.
