Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Friday said that the NDA government has messed up the Pathankot attack probe while dealing with Pakistan. "There cannot be a bigger mess-up. Pakistanis are to blame... there is no doubt, but the Indian government, unfortunately, is playing into their hands," he added. "Pakistan will continue to be a rogue state," Singhvi further said.
