Congress President Sonia Gandhi, on Monday, blamed the government of "muzzling" the voice of the Opposition, students and civil society. At the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, she said, "Government seems hell-bent on destroying the spirit of inquiry, questioning, debate, and dissent". The CWC also passed a resolution accusing the RSS of imposing its ideology on universities and colleges.
