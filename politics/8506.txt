The Akhilesh Yadav government on Wednesday dismissed UPPSC chairperson Anil Yadav, after the Allahabad High Court demanded his dismissal while entertaining a suit filed by Bhrashtachar Mukti Morcha. The HC deemed the former Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission chairman to be unfit for the job. Appointed in 2013, his tenure was affected by alleged caste-based favouritism toward Yadavs.
