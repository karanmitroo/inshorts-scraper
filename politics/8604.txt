BJP President Amit Shah has told his party workers to start door-to-door campaign and explain to the voters that the BJP is in favour of reservation. "Lalu and Nitishji are trying to mislead the people on reservation policy. We are supporters of reservation," Shah said while addressing the workers in Bihar's Begusarai district on Wednesday.
