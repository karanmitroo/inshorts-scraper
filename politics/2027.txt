Sacked AAP Minister Kapil Mishra on Wednesday sat on hunger strike seeking details of the travel expenses of five AAP leaders during their foreign trips. "Sitting on a Satyagraha till I get a clarification on details of their international travel expenses," Mishra said. "I got a threat from an international number. But I am not afraid of anything," he added.
