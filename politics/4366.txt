Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam on Saturday claimed that he had been placed under house arrest. The police, however, denied the allegation stating that police deployment outside Nirupam's house was a part of the security arrangements for PM Narendra Modi's visit. Notably, Nirupam had planned a 'silent' march to the venue of PM Modi's public meeting in the city.
