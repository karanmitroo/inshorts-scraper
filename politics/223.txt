The ruling Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh has announced that it will exit the NDA alliance if the Centre fails to fulfill the 19 promises made by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley by March 5. This comes after the party accused the Centre of not allocating the funds promised during the separation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the Budget.
