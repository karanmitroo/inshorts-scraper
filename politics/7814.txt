Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Hyderabad University on Thursday and demanded the dismissal of the Vice Chancellor over Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula's suicide. Addressing the students, he asked HRD Minister Smriti Irani to apologise for "playing caste politics" over the issue. He also offered to stage a sit-in at Vice Chancellor's office but was dissuaded by the students.
