Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Wednesday suggested that Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath must reinstate 'sati pratha', where widows were burned with their husband's pyre, before banning triple talaq. "Who is stopping him to legislate laws on triple talaq? But first, tell me which Muslim opposed 'sati pratha'? 'Sati pratha' is a part of the Hindu culture," he asserted.
