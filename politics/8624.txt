Senior BJP leader and former External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha has attacked the Narendra Modi-led government for using G4 (India, Germany, Japan and Brazil) in its pursuit to get the permanent membership of UN Security Council. "We need not have pursued the G4 with the vigour with which we are doing," Sinha added, calling it a continuation of UPA's policies.
