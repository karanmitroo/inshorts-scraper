A Madras High Court judge on Thursday expressed doubts over the demise of former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa as the death was sudden and no medical report was submitted. "Media has raised a lot of doubts. Personally, I also have doubts in Jayalalithaa's death," Justice Vaidyalingam said. The court was hearing a PIL seeking a judicial probe into Jayalalithaa's death.
