BJP's controversial MP Yogi Adityanath has sparked a fresh row by saying that he will install idols of Gauri, Ganesh and Nandini in every mosque, if given a chance. Adityanath was speaking at VHP's 'Virat Hindu Sammelan' organised as part of its 50th anniversary in Varanasi. The MP also said "Aryavart created Aryans; will make Hindus in Hindustan."
