YSR Congress chief Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, who recently got bail in disproportionate assets case, has praised Narendra Modi for his administrative skills. Calling the 'assets-case' as a conspiracy against him, Reddy blamed Congress for dividing Andhra Pradesh for vote-bank politics. He also met the Governor ESL Narsimhan to demand a special session of legislature to collate opinion against the division.
