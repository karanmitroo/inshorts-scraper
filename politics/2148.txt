Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday was removed as the in-charge of the party's affairs in Goa and Karnataka. This comes after Congress failed to form a government in Goa despite emerging as the single largest party in the recent Assembly polls. KC Venugopal and A Chella Kumar were made Congress' Karnataka and Goa in-charge respectively.
