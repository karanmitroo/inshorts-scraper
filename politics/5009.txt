The CPI(M) on Sunday proposed to bring adjournment motion in Parliament over the government’s demonetisation policy. Government’s sudden announcement had resulted in day-to-day transactions of traders coming to a halt, stoppage of movement of goods and lorry transport, said CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury. Black money hoarders have kept their currency and gold in foreign banks, he added.
