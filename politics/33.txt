Two days after BJP's win in the Tripura Assembly elections, a statue of Lenin located in Belonia was brought down by a crowd. The statue was reportedly built during the 21st year of CPI(M)'s rule in Tripura five years ago. The CPI(M) has called the incident an example of "Communist phobia" and blamed other incidents of vandalism on BJP.
