Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday began his indefinite fast in Bhopal for peace in the state amid the farmers' agitation. This comes days after five farmers were killed in police firing. Notably, several Congress MLAs have been caught on camera inciting violence among MP farmers, following which the BJP has reportedly also filed complaints against the accused.
