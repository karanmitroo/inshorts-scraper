The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan Tuesday altered his plan to "shut down" the country on Dec 16. His decision was being criticised as the protest date coincided with the formal surrender of the army in Bangladesh. He had threatened to shut-down Pak if PM Nawaz Sharif failed to initiate probe into the alleged rigging in 2013 general elections.
