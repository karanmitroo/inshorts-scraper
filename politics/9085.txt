In an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', Shiv Sena on Monday said that the government should strictly impose family planning on all religions and the PM should tell Muslims to obey the law. Sena further added that Muslims should understand the necessity of family planning as increasing population of their community will cause linguistic and geographical imbalance in the country.
