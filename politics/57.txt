After the CPI(M) conceded defeat to the BJP in Tripura elections, BJP President Amit Shah said it has been established that the Left is not right for any Indian region. He attributed the party's victory to PM Narendra Modi's 'Act East Policy'. BJP's victory in various states has boosted the party's confidence for the 2019 General Elections, he added.
