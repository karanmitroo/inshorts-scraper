Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi shared a funny video on Twitter to mock the NDA government's pro-poor policies. In the video, the boy can be seen giving money to the waiter but the girl takes the money back from the waiter, pays the bill herself and puts the boy's money into her purse instead of giving it back to him.
