The ruling AIADMK on Thursday expelled 44 members for allegedly supporting sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran, after it lost the RK Nagar bypoll. AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and EK Palaniswami announced 44 functionaries from the party's primary membership were 'removed' as they went against the party's principles and brought "disrepute" to the AIADMK.
