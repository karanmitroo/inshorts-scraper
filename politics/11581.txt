Arrested for threatening BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi with his hate speech, Congress candidate Imran Masood from Saharanpur was granted bail Wednesday. He was booked on March 29 for threatening "to chop Modi into pieces." However, Congress wrote to the Election Commission saying that the purported anti-Modi speech was made in September 2013 when Masood was a Samajwadi Party member.
