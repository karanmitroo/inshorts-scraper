Roohi Nazki, wife of PDP leader and J&K Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu, on Friday asked Mehbooba Mufti-led government to step down over handling of recent protests in the Valley. On Facebook, Nazki termed the government’s response to the protests “immoral, unethical, tragic and wrong”. “They need to step down…to uphold truth if not justice,” she wrote.
