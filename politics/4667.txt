Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asked the opposition parties to clear  their stand on the Centre's demonetisation move. "I'm not able to understand the logic behind the Congress and other parties raising the issue," Naidu said. "Are you against black money; are you ready to support government's stand on black money; where do you stand," he asked.
