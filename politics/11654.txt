RJD president Lalu Prasad's brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav on Tuesday announced that he would contest the Lok Sabha election from Bihar's Saran as an independent against his sister Rabri Devi. When asked if it was not a surprising decision to have a political battle within the family, Yadav said "siyasat me sab chalta hai (in politics it's a common feature)."
