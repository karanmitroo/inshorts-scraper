The Congress and the JMM on Tuesday alleged the BJP used unfair means to win Jharkhand Rajya Sabha elections on June 11. The Opposition has now demanded setting up of a House Committee to probe the matter. JMM's Sanjiv Kumar said that two opposition MLAs were harassed before polling while one was arrested to prevent him from casting his vote.
