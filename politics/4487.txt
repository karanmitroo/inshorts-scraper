Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said PM Narendra Modi should show his academic degree to him if it is not fake. "Earlier, Modiji said he didn't go to college. Later, he showed correspondence course degrees which were found to be fake," Kejriwal said. "India hasn't been able to comprehend how a scam of this proportion took place," he added.
