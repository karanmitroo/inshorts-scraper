Ousted AAP minister Kapil Mishra released a sting operation on Monday alleging that the Kejriwal government is involved in a CNG kit scam. Aam Aadmi Sena members reportedly took a leaking cylinder to four CNG checking centres across Delhi and got it cleared. Mishra has given an ultimatum of 4 days for the Delhi government to respond.
