On the completion of two years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government in office, Congress leader Manish Tewari on Thursday claimed the PM only gave 'bhashan' (speech) and did no 'shasan' (rule). "If you see in totality, PM Modi has done nothing on the front of foreign policy and has just been paying trips to various nations," he added.
