Delhi CM and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has said that Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung is a good man but his political bosses are bad. Kejriwal added it was strange that both the BJP and Congress were demanding Jung's removal. "Removing him will not help. His successor wud also do same if PMO kept interfering," Kejriwal further said in a tweet.
