The Ministry of Home Affairs has upgraded the security cover of BJP poll candidate from Lucknow Brajesh Pathak. The former BSP leader, who had joined BJP in August last year, already had 'Y' category security cover. Pathak will now be entitled to an escort vehicle with at least four security guards. Notably, there are currently over 450 Central protectees.
