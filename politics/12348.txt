Attacking Arvind Kejriwal for the first time, Narendra Modi on Saturday accused him of back-stabbing Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement for his personal political ends. Without naming Kejriwal or AAP, Modi cautioned the people against voting for the "newcomers". The statement came during a BJP poll rally in Seemapuri. Delhi. Modi also had two other rallies in Delhi on Saturday.
