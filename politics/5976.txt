The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday cancelled the 2012 election of Samajwadi Party MLA Ram Singh from Patti Assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh's Pratapgarh district. The court was hearing an election petition filed by BJP's Moti Singh, who lost to Ram Singh by 156 votes. He claimed the result was affected due to the refusal to open 955 postal ballots.
