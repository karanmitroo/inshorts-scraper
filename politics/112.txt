Former Bihar CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha founder Jitan Ram Manjhi has quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Manjhi had demanded one Rajya Sabha seat for his party, failing which the party has decided to not support the BJP-led coalition in the next Lok Sabha elections. The announcement comes after his meeting with RJD leader Rabri Devi in Patna.
