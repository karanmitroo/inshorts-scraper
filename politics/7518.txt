Senior Congress leader V Hanumantha Rao on Wednesday accused former Finance Minister P Chidambaram's son Karti for the party's defeat in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. "Today, we (Congress) are on the road because of Chidambaram's son Karti," he said. Rao alleged that Karti exercised his influence in the selection of a CM candidate who ultimately went against party decisions.
