Daljit Singh, who was an Aam Aadmi Party candidate in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, joined the Congress party on Saturday in the presence of state president Captain Amarinder Singh. Daljit Singh was earlier expelled by the AAP in July 2015 for being allegedly involved in anti-party activities. Daljit had contested against BJP's Arun Jaitley and Amarinder Singh in 2014.
