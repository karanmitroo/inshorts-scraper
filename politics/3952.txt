AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has demanded that Haj subsidy should be abolished and the money should rather be allocated for the education of Muslim girls. "The Haj is obligatory on Muslims who have their own financial wherewithal. As a Muslim, I am of the opinion that I do not need any government subsidy to go on Haj," he said.
