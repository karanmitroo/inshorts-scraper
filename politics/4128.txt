Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said that there is no scope for a change in the date of the Budget and that it shall be presented on February 1. Earlier, several opposition parties demanded the postponing of the Budget to a date after March 8, when polling for the upcoming Assembly elections ends, to ensure just and fair elections.
