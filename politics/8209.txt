Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday claimed the present government was "systematically working" to negate the contributions of Congress leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru as well as "dismantle" Congress' legacy. She also said the government was "following policies that favour the few and the powerful at the expense of the weak and the many" and "pursuing communal and divisive politics".
