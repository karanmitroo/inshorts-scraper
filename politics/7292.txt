The BJP and the newly formed Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) on Monday reached a seat-sharing agreement for the May 16 Kerala Assembly elections. According to the agreement, BDJS, floated recently by Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP),  will contest 37 out of the total 140 seats. SNDP represents the numerically stronger backward Ezhava community in the state.
