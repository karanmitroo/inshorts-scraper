RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife Rabri Devi on Tuesday said, "The media is saying that Sushil Modi thinks CM Nitish Kumar should dump RJD and join hands with the BJP. I invite Modiji to take Nitishji away on his lap." When her remark was called 'inappropriate' by some, Rabri said, "What's wrong in having some fun? Everybody does it."
