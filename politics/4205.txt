BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday said the ongoing feud in the Samajwadi Party reminds him of Mahabharata. However, he expressed hope that the conflict within the family will be resolved at the earliest. "Mulayam Singh is very dear to me and I know Akhilesh since the time he was a young boy... what has happened is unfortunate," he said.
