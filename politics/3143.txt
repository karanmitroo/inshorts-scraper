DMK working president MK Stalin on Wednesday said that Sasikala Natarajan will be awarded lifetime imprisonment if a proper probe took place into late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's death, without naming the AIADMK leader. This came during a hunger strike staged by Stalin and DMK over the trust vote in which CM Edappadi K Palaniswami proved his majority.
