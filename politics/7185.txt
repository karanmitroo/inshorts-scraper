A Division Bench of the Uttarakhand High Court on Wednesday stayed the floor-test in the state Assembly till April 7. The order was passed on a petition filed by the Centre, challenging an earlier order of the court scheduling the floor-test on March 31. The earlier order had also stayed the Centre's imposition of President's rule in the state.
