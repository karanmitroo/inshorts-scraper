Amid seat-sharing talks for the Oct-15 Maharashtra polls, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday warned its ally BJP, saying, “Excessive lust leads to divorce." BJP has been demanding greater share of the state’s 288 seat, after winning more seats than Sena in national elections. BJP also wants the Sena to accommodate other allies from its share of seats.
