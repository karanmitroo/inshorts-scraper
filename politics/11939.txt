Following ugly and embarrassing scenes in Parliament over the Telangana issue, PM Manmohan Singh Wednesday said, "My heart bleeds to see what is happening in the House. This is bad for democracy." The statement came shortly after two MPs nearly attacked each other. Since the beginning of this session about a week ago, Parliament has been paralyzed with angry disruptions.
