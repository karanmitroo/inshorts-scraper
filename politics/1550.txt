The Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee organised a march on Saturday, protesting against the attack on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's convoy on his visit to flood-affected Gujarat. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that BJP goons pelted heavy stones at Rahul's car. Gandhi further said that obstacles like raising black flags, throwing stones won't stop them from helping people.
