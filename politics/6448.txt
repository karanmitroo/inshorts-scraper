Former Haryana CM and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda has alleged BJP's involvement in the defeat of a Congress-backed candidate in the recently held Rajya Sabha elections in the state assembly. This comes after the votes of 14 Congress MLAs, reportedly owing allegiance to Hooda, were declared invalid. Hooda also pitched for an Election Commission probe into the matter.
