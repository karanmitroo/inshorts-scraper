In a letter to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the IAS associations were like "khap panchayats" issuing "fatwas" to bureaucrats against attending AAP government meetings. Reports said junior officers have been boycotting the meetings after AAP MLAs allegedly attacked Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash during a meeting at CM Arvind Kejriwal's residence.
