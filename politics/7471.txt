Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu Singh on Friday said that the state government had "failed to anticipate" the Jat agitation, which led to widespread violence. He added that the government has taken "collective responsibility" for the absence of an immediate administrative response to prevent the agitation. However, he lauded the government's "promptness" in compensating victims' losses.
