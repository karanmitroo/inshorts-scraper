Senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi has denied calling PM Narendra Modi a symbol of Indianness. His denial comes soon after the party said it'll take disciplinary action against him for making such statement. "Who said Modiji is the symbol of Indianness? I never said that... I can't be expected to make such a foolish statement," Dwivedi said.
