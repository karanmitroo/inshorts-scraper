BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday slammed actor Rajinikanth's decision to enter politics and called him an illiterate. "One more film star is entering politics, so what is the fuss about?" he questioned. Swamy further claimed that Rajinikanth will "run away" after forming his party and starting a discourse on anti-corruption issues.
