Haridwar-based All World Gayatri Pariwar's head Dr Pranav Pandya has declined the membership of the Rajya Sabha, saying he would not “fit in” the way the Upper House "is conducted these days". "I believe my stature is bigger than the membership of RS," Pandya said. President Pranab Mukherjee had nominated Pandya on Wednesday based on the government’s recommendation.
