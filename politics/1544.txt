The Income Tax (I-T) department search at Karnataka Energy Minister DK Shivakumar's Bengaluru residence on August 2 has reportedly yielded nothing. A copy of the Panchanama of the I-T raid showed that no money or jewellery was found at his residence. Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah backed Shivakumar and called the raids aimed at the minister as 'undemocratic' and a 'political conspiracy'.
