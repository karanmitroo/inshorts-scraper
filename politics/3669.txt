The Shiv Sena on Saturday said that BJP would not even hesitate to label Chhatrapati Shivaji and Lokmanya Tilak as "anti-nationals" to prove its secular credentials. The party also regretted its 25-year-old alliance with the BJP, stating "We have been experiencing this for the last 25 years for the sake of Hindutvaâ€¦But these 25 years have been wasted and rusted".
