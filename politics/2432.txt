The Uttar Pradesh government led by CM Yogi Adityanath has started work on setting up six AIIMS and 25 new medical colleges. This was one of the promises the BJP had made for the Assembly polls. "Once we shortlist areas for setting up these institutions, we will send a proposal to the Centre," Medical Education Minister Ashutosh Tondon Gopalji said.
