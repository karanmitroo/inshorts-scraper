Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday accused the Congress of failing to stop infiltration from Bangladesh into Assam. "What is the reason, why didn't you (Congress) stop them? Why didn't you completely seal the Indo-Bangladesh border?", Singh asked, at an election rally in Assam. He added, "We just need some time and we will seal the Indo-Bangladesh border completely".
