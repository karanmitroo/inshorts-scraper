Vice President Hamid Ansari's wife Salma Ansari on Saturday said, "There can be no talaq just because someone says 'talaq, talaq, talaq' three times." She further said, "Whatever the maulana said you think it's true...Read the Quran's translations. Women should read the Quran, ponder on it, gain knowledge what the Shariat says and not just follow anyone blindly."
