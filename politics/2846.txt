Goa Governor Mridula Sinha today appointed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar as the Chief Minister of Goa. Parrikar has been asked to prove majority within 15 days after taking oath with the swearing in ceremony likely to be held on Tuesday. Notably, BJP was the second largest party behind Congress in a fractured mandate in the Goa assembly elections.
