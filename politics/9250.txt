Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday said he has no idea why PM Narendra Modi has not included him in the Union Cabinet despite having seniority, experience and popularity. Sinha, who had served as Union Minister during NDA's previous regime in early 2000s, said, "Hopefully four more years of the government is left and 'achche din' might come for me too."
