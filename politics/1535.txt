Several private schools in Haryana's Rohtak were forced to declare Wednesday a holiday as their buses were taken over for a rally organised to welcome BJP President Amit Shah. "The administration had asked for our buses for the rally," officials from one of the schools said. Notably, Haryana had recently banned the use of school buses for political rallies.
