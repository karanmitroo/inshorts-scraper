Sacked AAP minister Kapil Mishra on Monday said that he will not say anything against Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal, as she is unaware of the truth. Mishra was responding to tweets by Sunita wherein she had accused him of 'sowing seeds of betrayal'. Mishra said Sunita was worried about her husband's downfall, so he would take all her curses.
