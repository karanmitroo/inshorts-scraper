Rajput group Karni Sena on Friday claimed that the ruling-BJP had lost all three Rajasthan bypoll seats to Congress as it did not ban the release of the film 'Padmaavat'. "I would suggest PM to ban it (Padmaavat), it's the only solution," Karni Sena Chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi said. The group called Congress' victory as the victory of their struggle.
