The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice to the Election Commission over a petition on the alleged tampering of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the recently held Assembly elections. The petition, filed by lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, demanded that the EVMs be thoroughly checked by American computer scientists. This comes after several politicians openly voiced the issue post polls.
