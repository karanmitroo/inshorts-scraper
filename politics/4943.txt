Congress leader Anand Sharma said in the Parliament on Wednesday that "the newly introduced â‚¹2,000 note, which leaves its colour, is similar to the 'churan wali pudiya' that he used to get when he was a child". Sharma further said that "everyone (from the government) has become a surgeon without doing any surgery and are terming everything as surgical strike".
