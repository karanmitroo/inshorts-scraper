Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday alleged a "nexus between the BSF and Pakistan Rangers personnel to facilitate drug smuggling". As Chief Minister, he had requested then Home Minister LK Advani to reduce the period of stay of BSF platoons to one year from two, to prevent smuggling. Advani, however, refused saying it was too expensive, he added.
