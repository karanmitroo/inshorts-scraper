The DMK on Friday suspended its chief M Karunanidhiâ€™s son and former Union minister MK Alagiri from the party for anti-party activities. DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan said in a statement that Alagiri was creating confusion by urging party cadres not to work and criticising the disciplinary action taken by the party against some members for their anti-party activities.
