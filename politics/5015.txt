The Diwakar faction of the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal on Friday merged with the BJP ahead of the 2017 state Assembly elections. The faction is led by Diwakar Bhatt, who was among the frontline leaders of the Uttarakhand statehood movement. Diwakar wields considerable influence in the state's Garhwal region and the BJP said the merger will help in expanding support base.
