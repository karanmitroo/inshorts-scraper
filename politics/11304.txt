National Investigation Agency, which submitted a chargesheet in the Patna High Court, has said that SIMI terrorists, in complicity with Pakistan's ISI, had tried to kill BJP's PM nominee Narendra Modi during his rally in Patna last year. However, in view of the heavy security, they ended up exploding bombs at his Hunkar rally to create maximum damage.
