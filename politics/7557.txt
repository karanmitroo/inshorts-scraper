While discussing the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) row and Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula's suicide during the budget session, Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia on Wednesday asked how BJP leaders could demand to shut down JNU. Scindia also said that it was unacceptable to blacklist a university of 8,000 students for the actions of only eight students.
