Expelled Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh on Sunday alleged that UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's uncle and mentor Ram Gopal Yadav has openly issued murder threats against him. I am on Ram Gopal's target, Singh added. Speaking over his expulsion from the party, Singh said, "I used to call myself 'Mulayamwadi'...but, Mulayam has now become 'Akhileshwadi'. He has left me alone."
