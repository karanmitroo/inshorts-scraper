Hurriyat Conference leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani on Thursday called for a rally titled “Srinagar Million March” on November 7, the day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a rally in Srinagar. Hurriyat (G) spokesman Ayaz Akbar reportedly said that the authorities should allow both rallies and termed the Hurriyat's rally as “Kashmir’s referendum against India.”
