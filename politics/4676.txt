Right-wing group Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'anti-Hindu' and added that the demonetisation move will be the beginning of the end of his rule. Senior Hindu Mahasabha leaders also claimed that the demonetisation decision was taken right before the season of Hindu marriages and accused the BJP ministers of promoting Islamic banks in the country.
