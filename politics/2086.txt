The Bombay High Court has questioned the BJP-led Maharashtra government if 600 acres of land in Nagpur was allotted to Patanjali at a "throwaway price". "We want to know if any farmers' land was taken and allotted to the company," the court said. Notably, the petition over the matter was filed by the Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam.
