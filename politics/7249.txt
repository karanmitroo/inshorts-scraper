The BJP on Friday slammed Congress for criticising BJP-RSS ideologue VD Savarkar, saying soon even Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel would "appear anti-national" to the Congress. BJP MP Ravindra Kushwaha accused Congress of openly siding with anti-national elements. Earlier, Congress said Savarkar had "begged" the British for his release while Bhagat Singh "waged war for freedom from British Raj".
