Ahead of the election for Maharashtra speaker's post, the Shiv Sena & Congress Wednesday withdrew their candidates. The move paved way for the Bharatiya Janata Party's Haribhau Bagde to be elected unopposed. Bagde is a five-time MLA from Aurangabad district. Even after candidate's withdrawal, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has told his MLAs to vote against the BJP government.
