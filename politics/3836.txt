At least two people were killed while many were wounded after hundreds of villagers protesting against a power grid project clashed in West Bengal's Bhangar on Tuesday, reports said. The victims died of bullet injuries, but villagers said police did not fire at them and alleged the involvement of supporters of the ruling TMC, reports added.
