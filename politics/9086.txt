The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday suspended its two MLAs - Seuli Saha and Silbhadra Dutta - for alleged anti-party activities. Both the suspended MLAs are reportedly close to the party's Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy, whom the party has sidelined. The suspension came a day after both the MLAs attended an iftar party hosted by Roy.
