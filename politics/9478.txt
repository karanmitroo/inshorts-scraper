Nigerian envoy to India OB Okongor Wednesday criticised Union Minister Giriraj Singh's racial remarks on Congress President Sonia Gandhi. "....given that the minister is at the highest levels of government, the remarks made are unfortunate", Okongor said. Singh had sparked a controversy by saying if Rajiv Gandhi had married a "Nigerian woman... would Congress have accepted her as its president?"
