MDMK leader Vaiko today said he is hopeful that the DMDK and Tamil Maanila Congress will join the People's Welfare Association (PWA). PWA leaders had in December met DMDK leader Vijaykanth to convince him to join the front. The PWA, comprising of MDMK, CPI, CPM, and VCK, is trying to be a third alternate front to the DMK and AIADMK.
