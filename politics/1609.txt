Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said that those who used to talk about DNA have now joined the NDA (National Democratic Alliance). The remarks were in reference to PM Narendra Modi allegedly questioning the DNA of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in 2015. However, Modi had later clarified that he was instead talking about the "DNA of democracy".
