Communist Party of India (Marxist) has authorised a scout to look for alliance options "from all democratic forces" ahead of State Assembly elections in West Bengal this April. A committee will look for possible alliances against the Trinamool and the BJP, the party's General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said. A Trinamool leader alleged that CPI(M) "is sending signals to the Congress".
