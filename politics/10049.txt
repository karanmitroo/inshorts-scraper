For the 2014 Delhi polls, Congress has decided to field Kiran Walia against Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency. Walia was initially reluctant to contest from New Delhi but later agreed, revealed sources. Walia, who was Minister for Health and Education in Sheila Dikshit's Cabinet, was defeated by AAP's Somnath Bharti in Malviya Nagar constituency in the 2013 polls.
