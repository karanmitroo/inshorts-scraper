Ahead of the 2017 Gujarat Assembly polls, AAP Convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday slammed BJP President Amit Shah, equating him with "General Dyer" and calling him a "traitor". Kejriwal further called Patel quota agitation leader Hardik Patel a "patriot". The General Dyer remark comes with reference to the violent clashes between the Patel community and the police in 2015.
