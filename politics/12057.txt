One of the African women, who was reportedly assaulted in the Delhiâ€™s midnight raid, has accused Delhi law minister Somnath Bharti of having led the group that barged into her house. The woman said she identified Bharti because "he came in the night and the next day I saw him on television. The Police came in time and saved us."
