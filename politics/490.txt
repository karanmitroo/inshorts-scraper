Eight Meghalaya MLAs, who had quit the state Assembly last week, have joined BJP ally National People's Party (NPP), an NPP spokesperson has said. Of the eight MLAs, five were from the ruling Congress party. Following the resignations of a total of six Congress MLAs recently, Congress' strength in the 60-member Assembly has now come down to 23.
