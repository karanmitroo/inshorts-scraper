Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah Saturday said that he has declined PM Narendra Modi's offer to head the task force to implement the Swachh Bharat campaign. "I have written a letter to PM Narendra Modi saying I would prefer to be a member, not convenor...", he said. "Please make someone else, not me... I don't have time," he added.
