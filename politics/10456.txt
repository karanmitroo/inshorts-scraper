Goa congress spokesman Durgadas Kamat has apologized on "behalf" of his party for Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra snapping at a TV reporter after being questioned over land deals. The congress organizing secretary took twitter to say sorry, even as other Congress leaders have defended Vadra's reaction and criticised the media for encroaching on his personal space.
