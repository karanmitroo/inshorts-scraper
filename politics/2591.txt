While attending an event alongside Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Yoga guru Ramdev said on Wednesday that India has been built by saints, yogis, and fakirs, not by any king or emperor. "It is a matter of pride for us that (our) PM is a yogi, and the CM of the most populous state is also a yogi,” he said.
