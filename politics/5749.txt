Referring to the Supreme Court judgement quashing the 2006 Singur land deal, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said it was something she "dreamt of for long" and now she could "die in peace". Hailing it as a "landmark victory", she termed the forceful acquisition of land from the Singur farmers as "historical suicide" by the then CPI(M) government.
