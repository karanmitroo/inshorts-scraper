The police on Thursday detained at least three Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leaders as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National President Amit Shah landed in Surat to participate in a felicitation programme by Patidar businessmen. Earlier, PAAS members urged people to come out in large numbers to protest the felicitation and also vandalised posters welcoming Shah in the city.
