Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Thursday night, visited Delhiâ€™s Rangpuri Pahadi slums, where demolition of about 900 housing units has left thousands homeless. Warning the central govt against further such demolition drive, Rahul said, "If they want to use the bulldozer again, let them drive it over my body". He spent around half-an-hour with the residents and listened to their woes.
