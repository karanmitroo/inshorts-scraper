Senior advocate and activist Prashant Bhushan on Sunday tweeted that “corrupt cronies like Ambani/Adani” are untouched, BJP was "forewarned" and small people are queuing up for days to get money for food. He also shared some complaints filed against businessmen Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani in connection with money laundering. “No action on cronies. But new Jumla,” he added.
