Arunachal Pradesh acting Governor Tathagata Roy on Thursday asked the newly-reinstated CM Nabam Tuki to take a floor test and prove his majority by July 16. The assembly proceedings will be recorded throughout and the majority will be proved by division and not voice vote, the acting Governor said. However, CM Tuki reportedly sought more time for the floor test.
