CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat on Thursday accused the Narendra Modi-led central government of trying to change the Constitution and said any effort to "weaken" it must be resisted. Stating that the "Hindutva ideology" of BJP and RSS is harmful to the basic values of the Constitution, Karat alleged that the RSS has never hidden its contempt for the Constitution.
