AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has raised question over conferring Padma Vibhushan on BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi. "Joshi gets Padma Vibhushan despite being an accused in Babri Masjid demolition case. It shows Modi governmentâ€™s commitment to Hindutva,"  he tweeted. "Meghalaya Governor Shanmuganathan resigns on molestation charges but Joshi who's facing criminal charges gets an award," he added.
