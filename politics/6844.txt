The Opposition Congress on Saturday urged Odisha Governor SC Jamir to recommend dissolution of the Assembly and imposition of President's rule in the state. The Congress further demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik over the issue of the "chit fund scam". It also alleged that the state government prevented the Opposition Leader from speaking in the assembly.
