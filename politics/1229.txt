In a meeting with party members, Samajwadi Party (SP) President Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said, "Beware of ‘banawti’ (fake) samajwadis. They have tried to stop the samajwadi movement many times in the past." Without taking any names, Yadav added, "They succeeded in one conspiracy as a result of which we could not form government in the state."
