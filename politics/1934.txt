The Election Commission on Saturday held a demonstration on working of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) System to prove that the machines are tamper-proof. Ruling out manipulation of EVMs at manufacturing stage citing tight security, Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi added that chip on EVM is one-time programmable and doesn't have a Wi-fi chip.
