Outgoing J&K CM Omar Abdullah made it clear on Thursday that neither deal nor any discussion was going on between his National Conference (NC) and BJP for government formation in the state. Omar made the assertion using Twitter. He also hoped that someone from the PDP, BJP or Congress would step up and form a government quickly.
