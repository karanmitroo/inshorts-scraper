Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose tenure has been under constant attack from BJP, on Wednesday hit back saying the opposition party thought he was "weak" and would run away on being targeted but he has proved them wrong. Singh contended that the country had seen a much faster growth during UPA than what was witnessed during the NDA regime.
