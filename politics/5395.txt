Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said that further discussion on the surgical strikes would be an insult to Indian Army. “I don’t think any Indian citizen has got any doubt. Nobody is doubting the credentials and commitment of the Indian Army,” he added. He also said that both the Congress and AAP have also clarified their stands.
