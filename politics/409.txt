Criticising the government over the violent protests against 'Padmaavat', AIMIM President and MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday said PM Narendra Modi's "56-inch chest" was only for the Muslims and not for the Rajputs. Alleging that the BJP was helping groups like Karni Sena become mainstream parties, Owaisi said there is no rule of law in the country.
