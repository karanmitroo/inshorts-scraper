NCP chief Sharad Pawar has emphasized on PM Narendra Modi's presence in the House. "If you look at Indira Gandhi, Narasimha Rao, Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, they were all in the House... He (Modi) should spend more time in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha as MPs feel they barely get an opportunity to see the PM," Pawar said.
