Congress on Sunday clarified that it has not called for a 'Bharat bandh' on Monday, but will hold protests against demonetisation. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh alleged that PM Narendra Modi believes in "dhamaka" politics, and demonetisation was introduced to influence the 2017 UP elections. "It is a political move which is being sold as a fight against corruption," Ramesh added.
