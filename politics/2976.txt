BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday said that the fishermen issue is being blown out of proportion by some extremist elements in Tamil Nadu to separate the state from India. He also urged the Centre to collaborate with the Sri Lankan government for allowing fishing in their region till the time the Indian side is re-populated with export quality sea-food.
