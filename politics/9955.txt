Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh Saturday called Aam Aadmi Party 'a bunch of pseudo civil society activists'. Furthermore, he said, "AAP and Kejriwal are B Team of BJP. If you ask why then (in 2013 Delhi elections) we supported AAP, we had to choose between BJP and its B-Team, we chose lesser evil."
