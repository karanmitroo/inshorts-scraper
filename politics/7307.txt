Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Monday questioned PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti's hesitation over the continuation of the PDP's alliance with the BJP to form the government in the state. Asserting that his party does not believe in horse-trading, Abdullah added that the Governor should announce fresh polls if there is any further delay in government formation.
