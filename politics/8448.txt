The Shiv Sena on Wednesday said that the political party will always welcome Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousufzai in India. Sena added Malala's visit would send a great message to Indians that terrorism should be dealt with harshly. The statement given by Sanjay Raut came after the party protested against BCCI President Shashank Manohar meeting PCB Chief Shahryar Khan.
