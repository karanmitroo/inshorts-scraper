A Telangana bandh called by opposition parties against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government began across the state on Saturday. Leaders of the Congress, BJP and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) demanded that the government waive farm loans worth ₹8,500 crore in one go rather than in a phased manner in order to alleviate farmers’ distress over crop failure.
