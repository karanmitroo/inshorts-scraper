In an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Wednesday, the Shiv Sena said 'love jihad' is part of a "global conspiracy" to destroy Hindu culture. "If Hindus are not going to wake up and if the governments are not going to act against those behind 'love jihad', it won't be long before the jihadis' plans succeed," the editorial said.
