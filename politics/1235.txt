Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said that he was ashamed of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi defending the dynasty culture in a lecture in the United States last week. "Some parties may think that being centered around dynasty is an asset, but in the long run, it becomes a burden," Jaitley added.
