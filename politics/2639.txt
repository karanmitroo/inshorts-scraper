All five BJP members in the Telangana Assembly were suspended on Friday for two days for disrupting the proceedings over the state government's move to increase the reservation for Muslims from 4% to 12%. Wearing black scarves and raising slogans, the BJP members demanded the TRS government to drop the proposal to raise Muslim quota.
