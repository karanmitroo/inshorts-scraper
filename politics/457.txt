Rebel AAP leader Kapil Mishra on Saturday claimed the party's internal survey shows that AAP will not win any of the 20 seats if by-elections are held. As per the survey, the party is surely losing 11 seats and surely winning none, Mishra said. This comes after EC recommended that 20 AAP MLAs be disqualified for holding 'office of profit'.
