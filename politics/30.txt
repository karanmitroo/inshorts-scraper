The BJP and its ally Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) won from six out of the seven constituencies where Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath campaigned for the Tripura Assembly elections. Reports suggested that CM Yogi was able to appeal to nearly two-fifths of the electoral population which has links to the Nath sect, of which he is the head.
