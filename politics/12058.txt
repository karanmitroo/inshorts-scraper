Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Saturday suspended 14 engineers against whom CBI had registered cases of alleged cheating and forgery in supply of sewerage equipment. Top sources said the suspensions were made following instructions by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who is also the chairperson of DJB. Earlier this week, CBI had registered five cases of corruption related with the DJB.
