Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, who was the first female Dalit Chief Minister in India, turned 60 years old on Friday. Also known as the Iron Lady Mayawati, she served as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh four times and was also the first CM to complete five years in UP (2007-2012). However, her first three terms were short-lived.
