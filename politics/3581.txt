A survey by the India Today-Axis has predicted a hung Assembly in Uttar Pradesh and has stated that BJP along with its allies would win 180-191 seats in 403-member Assembly. The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, which was formed recently, is expected to win up to 168-178 seats. The survey, however, stated that Mayawati-led BSP would manage to bag only 39-43 seats.
