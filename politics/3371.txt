Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move and said that he might join BJP in the near future. "PM Modi may be an RSS 'pracharak' but the fact is, he won elections by a huge majority," he added. Singh also compared Modi and SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav for their 'non-political' legacy.
