Goa govt has once again banned the Hindu right-wing organisation Sri Ram Sena from entering the state for a period of 60 days. Both the north and south Goa district collectors issued the ban on Jan-16, stopping the entry of Pramod Mutalik and any of his associates in the state. The ban on the Hindu outfit had lapsed on Dec-18.
