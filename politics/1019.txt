Patidar leader Hardik Patel has said that while there is a need to bring down the BJP, he will not join the Congress party. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his greed for power, has instilled fear in the people," Patel said. He added that he will meet Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi to discuss what the party can do once elected.
