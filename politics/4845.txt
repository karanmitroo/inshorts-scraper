Former Punjab Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday officially resigned as the Lok Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) over the Sutlej Yamuna link canal row. Notably, the Supreme Court had directed Punjab to give water to Haryana and discarded a bill passed by Punjab in 2004 when Singh was the CM of the state.
