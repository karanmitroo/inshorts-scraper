The BJP on Saturday criticised former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah over a video of him speaking on the phone during the national anthem at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's swearing-in ceremony. "I almost question whether he was talking to separatists to figure out what their national anthem is", BJP leader Shaina NC said.
