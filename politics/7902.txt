Senior BJP leader and Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Friday said that the party will contest the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh "on its own." He seemed assured of the BJP forming its government there. Naqvi also attacked the Congress calling it "the mother of corruption," as he blamed the party for stalling India's development plans.
