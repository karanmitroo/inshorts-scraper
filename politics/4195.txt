A shoe was hurled at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday while he was addressing AAP's 'Tijori Tod Bhanda Fod' rally against the demonetisation move at Rohtak in Haryana. Reacting to it, Kejriwal tweeted, "I once said Modiji is a coward...whether you throw shoe at me or conduct CBI raid, I will keep exposing scams," he said.
