The CBI questioned Trinamool Congress (TMC) general secretary and former railway minister Mukul Roy on Friday in connection with the multi-crore rupee Saradha scam. "I have been asked by the CBI to appear before it to face interrogation. Thus I came here to help in the investigation process," the Rajya Sabha MP said.
