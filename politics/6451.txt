In an effort to ensure faster grievance redressal in her RK Nagar constituency, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Monday announced that a special officer will visit the constituency every week to receive petitions from people. Earlier, in January, Jayalalithaa had also launched round the clock ‘Amma call centres’ to receive grievance calls from citizens across the state.
