Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Wednesday said in the Parliament that BJP's Uttar Pradesh Vice President Dayashankar Singh, who compared her to a prostitute while criticising her ticket distribution policy, should be arrested. If Dayashankar is not arrested and people take the route of violence in response to his comment, it would not be on my conscience, Mayawati added.
