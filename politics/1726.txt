In a money laundering case probe, the Enforcement Directorate on Saturday raided Lalu Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti's three Delhi farmhouses. It's investigating a 'benami' land deals and tax evasion case involving Bharti, her husband Shailesh and a firm linked to them. It found that the firm M/s Mishail Printers and Packers Private Limited's 1,20,000 shares were bought by shell companies.
