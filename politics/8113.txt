Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Saturday said CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was "directly responsible" for the attacks across the state. Abdullah referred to the Udhampur and Rajouri incidents, and said Mufti had "bartered everything to save his chair". He added that apprehensions regarding the BJP and the RSS being allowed into the state had been "proved correct".
