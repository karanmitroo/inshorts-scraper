Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over the Rafale deal, saying that it was shameful her "boss" was "silencing" her. Gandhi further questioned her about each jet's final price and if the PM took permission before announcing purchase in Paris. This comes after Sitharaman called Congress "shameful" for "bickering" over the jets' price.
