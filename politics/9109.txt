Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje is reportedly ready to resign from her post only if other ministers accused in the Lalit Modi row quit. Notably, Union Minister Sushma Swaraj is also involved in helping the scam-tainted ex-IPL chief procure UK travel documents. The opposition parties have been demanding the resignation of Raje and Swaraj since the matter came up.
