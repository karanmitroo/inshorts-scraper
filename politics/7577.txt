Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Chief Mayawati on Wednesday alleged that the RSS is suppressing the voice of Dalits with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government. Mayawati, who held the RSS and BJP responsible for the suicide of Dalit student Rohith Vemula, also requested the government to include a Dalit in the panel constituted to probe the issue.
