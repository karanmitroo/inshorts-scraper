During his three-day visit to poll-bound Gujarat, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday claimed that Gujarat witnessed more corruption than the entire nation. Policemen visit Surat's businessmen every two minutes to demand a bribe, Gandhi added. He further slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his silence on the alleged 16,000 times turnover increase in Jay Shah's company.
