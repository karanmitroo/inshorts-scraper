Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Sunday announced that he has refused BJP chief Amit Shah's offer to merge his Hindustani Awami Morcha (HAM) with BJP ahead of Bihar's assembly polls. Manjhi, however, said, "HAM would be a part of NDA". "We will go to polls under Modi's leadership to defeat the combine of Nitish-Lalu and Congress," he added.
