BJP's Kashmir unit wants the police personnel posted at Srinagar and Jammu airports to be dressed up smartly so that it conveys a "semblance of normalcy" in the state to the travellers. BJP urged CM Mehbooba Mufti to change the dress code of the security personnel deployed inside at airports and also set up hi-tech women police stations.
