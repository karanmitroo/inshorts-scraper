Terming the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Janata Dal-United coalition as "impractical", Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Saturday that the BJP would win the upcoming Bihar Assembly election. "An impractical coalition is set to try and stop us. I am sure we, along with our allies, will come to power in Bihar," Jaitley said during a press conference.
