National Conference (NC) leader Mustafa Kamal on Tuesday supported Pakistan on the issue of awarding death sentence to Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, saying that it is not correct for India to point fingers at another nation's legal proceedings. "Pakistan has obeyed the law. Not correct for India to point fingers, being the largest democracy," Kamal stated.
