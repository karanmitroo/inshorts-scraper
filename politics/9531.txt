Actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar attacked PM Narendra Modi Tuesday over increasing cases of suicide among farmers because of natural calamities saying that the PM should hear farmers' 'Mann Ki Baat' instead of being busy with his radio show. Babbar also said, "If the farms get destroyed in a natural calamity, the farmer needs aid, not the Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat."
