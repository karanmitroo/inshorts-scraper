In a comical situation at a press conference, yoga guru Ramdev was found trying to hush BJP's Alwar candidate Mahant Chandnath as the latter was talking to Ramdev about problems in raising funds. Chandnath was whispering, "Kisi se bhi paise len-den mein dikkat pesh aati hai." To this Ramdev admonished saying, "Ye baat yaha mat kijiye, mike lage hue hai.”
