Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry Kiran Bedi on Tuesday said the state government wants her to be just a "figurehead" though the rules assign her responsibilities of an administrator. Bedi had earlier said she would quit the post on completion of two years in office. "Puducherry is in a debt trap. We have to check its further decline," she had said.
