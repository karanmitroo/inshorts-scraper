Slamming the RSS, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said, "One says this country is mine, other says I belong to the country. That's the difference between RSS and us." "The RSS says 'this country is ours and you don't belong in it'. It beat up Dalits in Gujarat and showed them that they don't belong here," he added.
