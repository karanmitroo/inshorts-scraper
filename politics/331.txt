BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Sunday said he was hopeful the Sunni Muslims will support the construction of a Ram Mandir in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya, just like the Shias. In November 2017, the state Shia Waqf Board had submitted a proposal to the Supreme Court seeking the construction of Ram Mandir and a mosque in Lucknow.
