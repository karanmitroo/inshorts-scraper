BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday said that the Muslim delegation on the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhumi issue should accept a masjid across the river Sarayu, or the BJP will enact a law for the temple's construction once it gets a Rajya Sabha majority in 2018. The Supreme Court had earlier asked the aggrieved parties to settle the issue outside court.
