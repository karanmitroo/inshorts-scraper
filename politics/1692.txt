BJP leader Sushil Modi on Tuesday said that he had proof that Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav had acquired at least 13 benami properties after growing a 'moustache and beard'. This comes after Yadav had earlier denied corruption charges against him claiming that he didn't even have a 'moustache' when the alleged land-for-hotels deals took place in 2005.
