JD(U) President Sharad Yadav said Friday that the Padma awards are conferred only upon people who are 'dishonest' and belonging to the higher strata of the society. "Samajwadi people (Socialists) should spurn Padmashri and Padmabhushan", he said while honouring a senior socialist leader. He complained that not a single dalit, adivasi or farmer was given the award this year.
