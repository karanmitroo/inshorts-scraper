Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said that Narendra Modi and Amit Shah alone cannot be held responsible for BJP's poor performance in Bihar assembly elections. He also called for "stringent action against those making irresponsible statements and causing damage to the party’s image”. Gadkari added that the loss in Bihar assembly polls was the collective responsibility of the party.
