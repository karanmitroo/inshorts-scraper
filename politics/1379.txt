BJP Chief Amit Shah lauded the Centre for raising creamy layer income bar for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from ₹6 lakh to ₹8 lakh for central government jobs. Shah stated this provision will prioritise OBCs who require reservation and facilities due to economic backwardness. Notably, central government employees in OBC category earning up to ₹8 lakh would get reservation benefits.
