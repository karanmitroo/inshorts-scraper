Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday sat on a 'dharna' in Patna demanding that the Nitish Kumar government withdraw its decision to ban toddy. He claimed the ban would adversely impact the Pasi community, numbering 20 lakh, who are traditionally involved in toddy trade. Paswan added that toddy could not be classified as alcohol as it was just "juice".
