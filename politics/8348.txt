Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi will reportedly lead a party delegation to the Rashtrapati Bhavan on November 3 to discuss the issue of "growing intoleranceâ€™' in the country with President Pranab Mukherjee. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the party for lecturing the Centre on tolerance by reminding them of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.
