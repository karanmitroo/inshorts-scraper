The Central Information Commission on Tuesday directed the Central Board of Secondary Examination to allow inspection of class 10th and 12th school records of Union Minister Smriti Irani. The Commission rejected CBSE's argument that the information was "personal information" and thus cannot be disclosed. The CIC has given 60 days time to the CBSE to facilitate inspection.
