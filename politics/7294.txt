Amid the Uttarakhand Assembly row, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday accused BJP of using money power to sabotage Congress' rule. "Toppling elected governments by indulging in horse trading and blatant misuse of money and muscle, seems to be BJP's new model", he said. The BJP earlier proposed to form the Uttarakhand government, after nine Congress MLAs switched sides.
