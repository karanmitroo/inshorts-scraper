Mumbai Police has served a notice to Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam over planning a march to actor Amitabh Bachchan's residence. The march was to demand support for the ongoing film workers strike and ask Bachchan to stop shooting. However, Nirupam did not take prior permission from police, which led to the notice warning him against causing "law and order problem".
