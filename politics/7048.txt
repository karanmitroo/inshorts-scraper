Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who visited Rajasthan's Barmer on Wednesday, said that the ruling BJP was insensitive to Dalits and continued to exclude them from the development discourse. He also demanded a CBI probe into the alleged rape and "mysterious" death of a minor Dalit girl in Barmer last month.
