Sri Ram Sena leader Pramod Muthalik and his associates have been banned from entering poll-bound Goa for 60 days beginning Tuesday. Authorities feared "serious law and order problems" if they were allowed to enter the state. "The aggressive statements of Muthalik will certainly affect peace, harmony and will create fear in the minds of public and tourists," authorities added.
