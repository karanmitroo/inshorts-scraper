The Congress has accused Mehul Choksi-owned Gitanjali Gems of an additional â‚¹5,000-crore fraud, calling it "Jan Dhan Loot". It alleged that Gitanjali floated three jewellery investment schemes and said that invested amount could be used for jewellery purchases with additional bonuses after the scheme's maturity. However, in most cases, neither the jewellery was given nor the amount was returned.
