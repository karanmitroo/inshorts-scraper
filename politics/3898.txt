AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday alleged that the Indian soldiers pay for their Republic Day parade uniform themselves and the government doesn't help them. Irrespective of whether they are from Army, paramilitary force, CISF or police, soldiers face a lot of problems, he further said. The country is safe only because of soldiers, he added.
