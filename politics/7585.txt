Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar has accused the BJP-led government of pursuing double standards in categorising violent incidents. "[T]he government today, as a matter of policy, categorises the violent act of a Hindu as 'goondagiri' while the same of a Muslim as an act of terrorism, and this is a dangerous trend," he said.
