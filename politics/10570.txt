Outgoing Goa congress chief John Fernandes on Wednesday blamed some party leaders of colluding with CM Manohar Parrikar for his ouster.  "Parrikar was panicky after the state Congress unit started a tirade against corruption in the state," said Fernandes. He was removed from the post Tuesday evening by All India Congress Committee and replaced with former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro.
