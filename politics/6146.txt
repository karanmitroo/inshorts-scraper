AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday met victims of Una incident at Gujarat's civil hospital, demanding action against the culprits. Calling the state government 'anti-Dalit', Kejriwal said the BJP government in Gujarat is trying to suppress Dalits and demanded that such incidents must stop. ”Why is the police not taking action? It indicates that govt is involved,” he added.
