Criticising the current regime over demonetisation, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said he would have resigned on November 8 (the date when demonetisation was announced) had he been holding the Finance Minister portfolio. "This was a terrible decision, ill-conceived, terribly implemented and with horrendous consequences," he added. He also shared his suggestions for the upcoming Budget.
