To ensure that state leaders contest the polls unitedly, Congress has reportedly decided not to announce a Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2017 Gujarat Assembly polls. Notably, the party has not been able to form the government in the state since 1989. Congress, however, had earlier announced former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit as its face for the Uttar Pradesh polls.
