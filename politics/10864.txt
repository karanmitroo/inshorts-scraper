Rajya Sabha was adjourned twice on Monday during Question Hour, as AIADMK members protested against a “derogatory” article against Jayalalithaa on Sri Lankan website. AIADMK members trooped into the Well shouting slogans, which made Chairman to observe that their behavior was inappropriate of members of parliament. Sri Lanka has already apologised for the article and removed it from their website.
