Narendra Modi on Sunday resigned from the post of election campaign committee chief and proposed the name of party-president Rajnath Singh in the BJP parliamentary-board meeting for this post, which was accepted unanimously by all the parliamentary board-members. Since 20-subcommittees, headed by various senior-leaders have already been formed under the election-campaign committee, appointing Singh was an expected and proper decision.
