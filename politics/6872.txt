Denying Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's claim that RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav hugged him forcefully during Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's swearing-in, Yadav on Monday asked, "Is he a heroine from Mumbai that I would forcefully want to hug him". Yadav also supported Congress President Sonia Gandhi in the AgustaWestland row, saying, "No one is more honest than Sonia Gandhi".
