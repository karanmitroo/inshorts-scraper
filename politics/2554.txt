Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said, "I have never put my faith in EVMs. You never know where the vote goes once the button is pressed." He further said, "When elections are being conducted across the world with ballots, why not in India? I stand with Advaniji, Mayawati and Arvind Kejriwal that polls with EVMs shouldn't be held."
