Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Sunday alleged that the Central government was creating an atmosphere of war with Pakistan to win the 2019 General elections. "BJP government is not fulfilling the promises it made to the people. So, there is no alternative left...to win the election," he said. Singh had earlier accused BJP of "stealing" people's mandate in Goa.
