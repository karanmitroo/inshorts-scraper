"I disapprove any such irresponsible statement & appeal to those making them to kindly refrain from doing so. Petty statements by those claiming to be BJP's well-wishers are deviating the campaign from the issues of development & good governance," BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi today tweeted, following the controversial statements made by VHP's Pravin Togadia and party leader Giriraj Singh.
