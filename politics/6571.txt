Vishva Hindu Parishad President Praveen Togadia on Saturday termed Bajrang Dal's self-defence camps as "social responsibility", adding that such camps make the youth healthier. He further said these camps are being held under the ambit of the constitution. Earlier this week, an FIR was filed against Bajrang Dal's activists for participating in a camp where volunteers were seen brandishing swords.
