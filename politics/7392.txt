BJP MLA from Agra Jagan Prasad Garg on Saturday advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in order to save the nation. Garg, who was reportedly protesting against the Union Budget, said Jaitley was not chosen by the people but entered the Parliament through a 'backdoor'. "He is not even a trader," Garg remarked.
