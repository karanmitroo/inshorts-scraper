Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said it's the common man and not the rich people who are having sleepless nights, standing outside the ATMs due to the demonetisation of old high-value currency notes. His statement comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed the rich are having sleeping pills while the poor are sleeping peacefully after the government's move.
