The "success" of Delhi's odd-even rule has proved that the AAP can "govern properly", said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday. He said, "if you provide proper leadership, the people will act in a disciplined way." The scheme's successful implementation proved that AAP could provide leadership, "contrary to what critics used to say that we can only demonstrate," he added.
