Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi Thursday accused PM Narendra Modi of practicing the politics of revenge and not of change, as promised during the campaign of 2014 general elections. Gandhi slammed the PM and the Centre for its decision to cancel a proposed food park in his constituency Amethi (UP), which was meant to benefit the farmers.
