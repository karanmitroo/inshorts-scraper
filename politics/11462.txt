The disgruntled family of beheaded Indian soldier Hemraj Singh(27) has hit out at the Central and UP government, blaming them for not keeping promises. "Akhilesh promised jobs for my son. A gas agency was also promised, but nothing was given. I will not vote for him," said Hemraj's mother. The family now says it'll vote for the BJP this time.
