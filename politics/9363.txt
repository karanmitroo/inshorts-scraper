An FIR was registered against Tilak Nagar's AAP MLA Jarnail Singh for assaulting an MCD engineer and obstructing him from demolishing an illegal construction in Krishna Nagar, West Delhi. Singh allegedly "thrashed" the engineer and his team and tore the document authorising the demolition. The MLA has rejected these claims saying that the property owner never received a notice.
