Addressing the business community in poll-bound Gujarat, former PM Manmohan Singh on Saturday said PM Narendra Modi should find "more dignified ways" to seek votes. Terming demonetisation as an "uninformed, half-baked crusade", Singh accused PM Modi of not paying heed to the effect that his decisions have on the poor. The hopes of 'achhe din' have been shattered, he added.
