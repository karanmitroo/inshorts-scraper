Jammu and Kashmir National Conference President Farooq Abdullah on Friday said he wouldn't acknowledge the NIA raids in connection with a terror-funding case until it brings out some results. "If they are being conducted to threaten people and to torture them, then I would like to tell the Centre and the NIA that...nobody will bow down before them," he added.
