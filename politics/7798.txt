Shiv Sena on Monday mocked Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and said India is a "100% tolerant nation" as it gives "red carpet welcome" to Pakistanis despite infiltrations on the border. The Saamna editorial referred to the Ghulam Ali concert and the Pathankot attack to make its point. Fadnavis on Saturday had said that India will always be a tolerant nation.
