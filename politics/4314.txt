The JD(U) on Wednesday said the party supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move and would not comment on the issue before the completion of 50 days. "JD(U) has supported demonetisation drive in national interest," party MLA Sunil Kumar said. Notably, this follows an anti-demonetisation meeting that was attended by all opposition parties except the Left, JD(U) and NCP.
