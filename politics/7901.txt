Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali on Wednesday alleged that PM Narendra Modi has 'ties with terrorists' and this was a reason for the recent attack in Pathankot. He added that Modi visited Pakistan as he "wants to make minorities happy" and the attack happened after the visit. TMC spokesperson Derek O'Brien said Ali's comments did not reflect the party's views.
