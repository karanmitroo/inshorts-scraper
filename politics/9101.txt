The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) told the Delhi High Court on Wednesday that the commission had closed the case against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas on June 23. The DCW added that it would now refer the case to the Delhi Police. However, AAP has alleged that Vishwas is still being summoned due to ‘political vendetta.’
