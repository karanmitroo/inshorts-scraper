Union Minister Uma Bharti said on Friday that the men who raped two women off a national highway in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr last year be punished publicly. The minister for water resources also questioned the Samajwadi Party government for allowing bail to the accused. "Salt should be applied to their (accused) wounds to make them feel the pain," she added.
