Shiv Sena on Tuesday asked Maharashtra forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar to take "moral responsibility" for the death of four tiger cubs in Chandrapur who allegedly starved to death after their mother went missing. The editorial in the party mouthpiece Saamna also questioned the government's tiger conservation scheme. â€œThe government should start a nutritious food scheme for tigresses", it said.
