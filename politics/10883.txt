West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday called for a 'movement' against the Narendra Modi government in view of rising prices and said BJP would not be able to emerge a major political force in the Trinamool Congress-ruled state. In an attack on BJP, the TMC supremo said West Bengal has no place for the 'communal party'.
