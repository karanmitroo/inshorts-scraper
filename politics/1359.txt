Chhattisgarh BJP leader Harish Verma who was arrested after the death of nearly 300 cows at his cow shelters routinely sold dead cattle to butchers and traded in their skin and bones, the police said. Chhattisgarhâ€™s Gau Sewa Ayog, an official body for bovine welfare, levelled this allegation against Verma in its police complaint which turned out to be true.
