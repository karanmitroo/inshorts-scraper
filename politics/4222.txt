Christian Missionaries in India "lack strength" to convert Hindus to Christianity, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said. "They should keep it in mind, notwithstanding their strong push over 300 years, only 6% of Indian population could be converted to Christianity," he added. Further, Bhagwat asked Hindus to remember "who they are" and that their culture is "superior".
