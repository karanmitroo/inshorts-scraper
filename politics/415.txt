After RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was given a 5-year jail term in the third fodder scam case, his son Tejashwi said the BJP, the RSS, and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar had conspired against Lalu. "We will approach higher courts against all these verdicts," he added. Earlier this month, Lalu was awarded a 3.5-year term in another fodder scam case.
