Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq on Thursday criticised Army Chief Bipin Rawat's statement on tough action against Kashmiris hampering counter-militancy operations, saying it showed his ignorance about ground realities. "Kashmiri youth have not taken to arms for fun nor are they made to hit streets in protest but they have been forced...as their space has been squeezed," he said.
