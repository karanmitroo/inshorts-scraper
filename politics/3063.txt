Senior BJP leader Rajnath Singh, in an interview, has revealed that in 2007 he had objected to giving a ticket to his son Pankaj Singh. "Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji had finalised his ticket. However, I objected to it as I believed that politicians' sons should first work in the party for at least 10 years," he stated.
