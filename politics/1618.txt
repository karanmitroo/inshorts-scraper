The Delhi High Court imposed a fine of ₹10,000 on CM Arvind Kejriwal for not filing a response in the new ₹10-crore defamation suit filed against him by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Jaitley had filed a case after Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani called him a 'crook' in court, during the previous case's hearing.
