Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Praveen Togadia Thursday was not allowed to address a meeting in Guwahati as the police had imposed the prohibitory order Section 144 CrPC. Assam CM Tarun Gogoi said that the step was taken so that Togadia's provocative speech doesn't disturb the communal harmony in the state. He was also banned from entering Bengaluru last week.
