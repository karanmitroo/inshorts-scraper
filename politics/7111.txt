BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Friday said that Pakistan's "so-called elected government is a dummy government", while alleging that "it cannot keep its word" and always finds "excuses". He also called Pakistan "an incurable liar". Swamy said this as he criticised Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit over his statements that the peace process between India and Pakistan has been "suspended".
