Amid the ongoing fake degree row surrounding MLA Jitendra Singh Tomar, the AAP on Friday demanded a probe against Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani's alleged fake degrees. In 2014, it was alleged that Irani was not a graduate as she had declared. Further, AAP said that an internal Lokpal would probe the issue of Tomar's forged degrees.
