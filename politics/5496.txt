BJP President Amit Shah has said the Uri attack was a part of a "long war" forced on India by Pakistan. It was a result of Pakistan's frustration after its 17 infiltration attempts were foiled by Indiaâ€™s security forces, he added. Shah asserted that it is no less than a war crime if terrorism becomes part of a government's policy.
