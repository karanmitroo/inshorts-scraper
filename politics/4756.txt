Yoga guru Ramdev on Tuesday termed demonetisation as a 'bitter pill' that will have a 'healthy impact' on the Indian economy. "Demonetisation is posing some problems to commoners. It's an issue which will wither in a few more days," he added. Alleging that Opposition's call for a Bharat Bandh on Monday was a failure, Ramdev claimed people are supporting demonetisation.
