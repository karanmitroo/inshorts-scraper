The Shiv Sena on Monday said veteran BJP leader LK Advani's 'emergency' remark cannot be ignored. "LK Advani is the biggest leader of the country who has seen all seasons and has gone through all ups and downs... when he said that an emergency-like situation cannot be ruled out again, discussions have once again focused on him," the party said.
