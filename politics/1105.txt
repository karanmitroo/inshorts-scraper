External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday claimed that BJP could not be called 'anti-women' since it has given four women Chief Ministers, four women Governors and six women Cabinet Ministers. Calling Rahul Gandhi's remark over the lack of women in the RSS unbecoming of a politician of his stature, Swaraj said she would not dignify it with a response.
