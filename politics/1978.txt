Sacked Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra has claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been to the office only twice in the last one year. "New corruption cases are coming to light every day...but the CM seems to be unaffected by all this. Kejriwal, who is completely cut off from public life, has time to watch (movie) Sarkar 3," Mishra added.
