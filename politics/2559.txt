Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh Yadav has slammed his son Akhilesh Yadav, stating, "One who betrays his father, can't be a friend of others". "No father made his son the CM during his own lifetime. And, what did Akhilesh do? He sacked his own uncle from his Cabinet," Mulayam said. "I've never been insulted so much," he added.
