Former PM Manmohan Singh has criticised demonetisation saying that the faith and confidence of "hundreds of millions" of Indians have been "shattered" with this decision. He further termed it as a â€˜mere rap on the knuckles of the dishonest black money hoarder'. Demonetisation has thrown away the lives of poor people in disarray, which is a "mammoth tragedy," Singh added.
