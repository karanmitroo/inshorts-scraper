In a bid to attract voters for the November assembly-elections, Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit inaugurated more than 40 projects, including community-centers and Aapki Rasoi, over the past two weeks. Aware of the code of conduct which restricts politicians from engaging in inaugurations and other social engagements, Dikshit has 6 more projects planned for coming days, before the code is enforced.
