The tweet saying former IPS officer Kiran Bedi could be the BJP's CM candidate for Delhi, has turned out to fabricated, as BJP leader Nitin Gadkari has vehemently denied tweeting it. "The purported tweet is the handy work of a Parody account and has got nothing to do with me or my Twitter account or the BJP," Gadkari clarified.
