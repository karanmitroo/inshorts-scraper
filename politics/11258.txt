While campaigning for Kumar Vishwas in Muslim-dominated localities of Aurangabad and Musafirkhana in Amethi, Kejriwal said - “It is the duty of everyone to defeat the Congress and BJP. Please don't take it to heart and forgive me if I you think I am exaggerating, but for me voting for BJP and Congress amounts to betraying God and the country.”
