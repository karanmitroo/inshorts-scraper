Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday said that she was once rejected from a job at Jet Airways for not having a "good personality". "[O]ne of the first jobs... I lined up for, was cabin crew at Jet... Thank God for your rejection," Irani said. I later got a job at McDonald's and "the rest is history", she added.
