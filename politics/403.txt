Responding to the BJP's claims that he wore an over â‚¹63,000-worth jacket, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said the Burberry jacket was a gift from someone in Shillong. Gandhi wore the jacket at a concert during his two-day visit to poll-bound Meghalaya. Earlier in 2015, Gandhi had criticised PM Narendra Modi for wearing a monogrammed suit bearing his own name.
