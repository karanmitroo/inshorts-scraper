Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the RBI has more than adequate cash to last not just till December 30 but even beyond it. "We were prepared. There has been no day when RBI did not dispense adequate cash to banks," Jaitley said. "Anyone who has old currency notes can only go and deposit them in banks," he added.
