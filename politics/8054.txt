Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal claimed on Twitter on Tuesday that his office was raided by CBI officials at the behest of PM Narendra Modi, and called the PM a "coward and a psychopath." Kejriwal added that since Modi couldn't handle him "politically", he resorted "to this cowardice". However, CBI has clarified that Kejriwal's secretary's office was raided with adequate warrants.
