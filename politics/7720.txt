According to reports, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday said that Rohith Vemula, the PhD scholar from Hyderabad Central University (HCU) who committed suicide, did not belong to the Dalit community. "When someone wants to blame it on someone else, then he can say anything. Rohith Vemula's suicide has been made a big issue", she added.
