Speaking on the issue of alleged deaths due to demonetisation, Mumbai North BJP MP Gopal Shetty on Wednesday said that "for gaining something, you have to lose something". "Every year, 3,500 commuters die on railway tracks, five lakh people are killed in road accidents... but nobody speaks about them," Shetty added. The Opposition has termed Shetty's remarks "insensitive".
