BJP President Amit Shah on Wednesday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and other opposition members should clarify in Parliament if "anti-national" slogans should be allowed under freedom of speech. He also asked Rahul Gandhi not to "stoop so low for vote bank politics", saying he was supporting the "forces dividing the country in the name of freedom of speech".
