BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said the first thing his party did after coming into power was to give a “bolne wala PM” to the nation. He was referring to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi’s alleged remark in which he asked people what has the PM done for them. "What have you done during UPA regime Rahul baba," Shah asked.
