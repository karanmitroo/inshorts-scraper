In connection to a 'paid news' case (during the 2009 Maharashtra assembly polls), the EC has issued a show-cause notice to former Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan. He "failed to lodge his account of election expenses in the manner required by the Representation of the People Act and rules", said the commission, giving him a 20-day deadline to respond.
