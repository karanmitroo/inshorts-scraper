Alleging that in 2016, 2078 cases of communal violence were reported in the country, Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday
questioned PM Narendra Modi’s assurance that communalism will not be tolerated. “What is the value of his promises from the ramparts of the Red Fort,” he said. He further criticised Modi over farmers suicides and incidents of violence against women.
