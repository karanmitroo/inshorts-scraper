Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi indicated on Sunday that he would ally with rebel RJD MLA Pappu Yadav’s Jan Adhikar Party if the NDA did not give him a 'respectable' seat-sharing offer. “Everyone has a right to respect. If I do not get a respectable offer from NDA, I will have my options open,” Manjhi said.
