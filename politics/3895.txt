AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday said that it is the only party that belongs to the Muslim community. He claimed that "no one in the SP cared for the blood of his Muslim brothers during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots". "No one has the courage the stop me from coming to Uttar Pradesh. UP is not anyone's property," Owaisi added.
