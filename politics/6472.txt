The opposition party in the state Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), on Saturday, alleged that the ruling party BJP is "adopting all illegal and immoral methods" to influence the Rajya Sabha elections. The allegation came after JMM MLA Chamra Linda was arrested in connection with a 2013 case, ahead of the polls for two Rajya Sabha seats allotted to Jharkhand.
