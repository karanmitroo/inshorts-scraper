Shiv Sena Founder Bal Thackeray was banned by the Election Commission in 1999 from voting and contesting in any election for six years. The ban was imposed as the leader was found to be guilty of election malpractices that included seeking votes in the name of religion. Bal Thackeray died four years ago on November 17, 2012.
