The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has claimed the man who hurled a shoe at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday was in touch with a Delhi BJP leader, while demanding a police probe into his call records. The party further alleged that the BJP is trying to "divert attention from the real pro-people agenda" of the AAP government.
