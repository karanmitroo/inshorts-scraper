Sacked AAP minister Kapil Mishra on Monday asserted that he was getting death threats from people close to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for exposing his corruption. Mishra said his number was being circulated on Twitter and WhatsApp for this purpose. He further challenged Kejriwal that he was not scared of his "puppets" as he was fighting a war against corruption.
