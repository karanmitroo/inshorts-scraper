Jailed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala's brother Divakaran said late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa had "utilised (his sister) fully but (died) without giving her any protection". He suggested that Sasikala did everything Jayalalithaa told her to but was later pushed to an "unsafe situation". This comes after properties linked to Sasikala and her kin were raided by the Income Tax Department.
