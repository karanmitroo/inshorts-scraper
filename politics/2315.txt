Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit on Tuesday criticised Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee President Ajay Maken after ex-Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely joined the BJP. "The Delhi Congress chief is not able to reach out to leaders as needed, that is also a reason for people leaving the party," she said. No member had quit when I was in-charge, Dikshit added.
