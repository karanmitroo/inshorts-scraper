Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a jibe at the Grand Alliance, saying that “a fourth partner too has joined them, a tantrik.” Resuming campaigning for the on-going Bihar assembly elections, he also said, “Lalu Prasad Yadav should name his party as Rashtriya Jadu-Tona Dal.” Modi will reportedly address 17 poll meetings in Bihar in the next six days.
