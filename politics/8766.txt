Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Sunday sparked a controversy by indirectly saying whether Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh has any experience of rape. â€œHe believes gangrape is not possible. Since he is an elderly person. We can't even ask him whether he has any experience of rape", Giriraj said. Mulayam had last week said a gangrape is not "practically" possible.
