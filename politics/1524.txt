Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday visited the family of RSS worker E Rajesh who was murdered allegedly by CPI (M) workers last week. Condemning the incident, Jaitley said such incidents will not suppress the ideology in Kerala. "It will only increase the determination of the workers to work harder against those who are perpetuating this operation," he added.
