The Opposition Congress was Tuesday denied permission by the police to carry out its protest march towards Rashtrapati Bhawan against the Land Acquisition Bill. The Delhi Police had set up barricades and water cannons to prevent the protestors from reaching the President's House. Congress president Sonia Gandhi was supposed to lead the protest march.
