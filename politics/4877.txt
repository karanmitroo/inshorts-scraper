Former JNU President Kanhaiya Kumar has explained why questioning the government is necessary, stating had questions not been raised, offices of ex-Karnataka minister Gali Janardhan Reddy wouldn’t have been raided. “Questioning the government is in the national interest,” he added. Reddy had drawn flak for reportedly organising ₹500 crore wedding ceremony of his daughter.
