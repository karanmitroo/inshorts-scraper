Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday cited “collateral reasons” for the delay in passing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill and indicated that the bill may not get passed in the Parliament's ongoing session. He added, "It is politics that determines policy." However, the government has planned to table three bills including one to introduce bankruptcy law in Parliament.
