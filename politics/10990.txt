Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will be vacating the government accommodation on Tilak Lane early next week, party sources said Saturday. "As soon as we finalise on a new house, we will vacate this," said the source. Kejriwal has continued to stay there even after resigning from the post of Delhi CM due to his daughter's Class XII exams.
