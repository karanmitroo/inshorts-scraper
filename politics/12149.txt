MNS leader Raj Thackeray, once considered close to Narendra Modi, said on Thursday - "The day Narendra Modi was nominated BJP's PM candidate, he should have quit as CM. The prime minister is of the entire country and not of a state." Thackeray added he has not yet decided about supporting Modi in his bid to become prime minister.
