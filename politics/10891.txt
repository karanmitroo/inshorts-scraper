Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah was seen in a video footage on TV channels apparently dozing off during a debate on sexual offences against women in the Legislative Assembly. The House was debating over a spate of recent sexual offences- the alleged rape of a 6-year-old in a prominent public school, rape of a 22-year-old in moving car and 16-year-old nun's rape.
