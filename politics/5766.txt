Ex-BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu’s wife and party’s Punjab MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu on Monday said that Punjab wants an alternative to come out of the present chaos, but Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh is not that alternative. He has been facing corruption allegations and Punjab needs good leaders over a good political party, she added.
