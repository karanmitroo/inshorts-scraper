According to a new rule, the word 'Godse' was added to the list of unparliamentary words, on Tuesday, implying that no one in the House can refer to anyone as a 'Godse'. Sakshi Maharaj's comment, calling Godse a patriot, came to an end with the rule. The list, more than 900 pages long, has words like 'Ravan', 'Hitler' and 'Mussolini'.
