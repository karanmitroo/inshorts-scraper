Uttar Pradesh Minister Suresh Khanna said, "Ours is a huge state, we never claimed that we will ensure zero crime. But I assure you criminals won't go unpunished." This comes after recent murder and gangrape incidents and Opposition Congress' comment, "Uttam Pradesh is turning into Crime Pradesh. Such incidents never happened before. This all happened at the behest of government."
