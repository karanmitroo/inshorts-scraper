Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was on Wednesday detained while he was on his way to meet the family of the ex-serviceman who committed suicide at Jantar Mantar during a protest over OROP. "My vehicle surrounded by police. Not allowing me to leave...formally detained by the police. No idea where they are taking me," Kejriwal posted in a series of tweets.
