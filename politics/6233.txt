Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav has been receiving marriage proposals from women across the state ever since he advertised his Road Construction Ministry's WhatsApp number for filing complaints. Tejaswi laughed at the hundreds of 'marry me' messages saying the texts could have landed him inâ€‹ deep trouble if he had been married, ministry officials said.
