The Supreme Court Monday agreed to hear the bail plea of former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case on Friday, Oct 17. Her plea for bail was earlier rejected by Karnataka High Court on October 7. She had sought for bail on health grounds shortly after she was sentenced for four years by the court.
