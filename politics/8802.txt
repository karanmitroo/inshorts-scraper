Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday rejected the conditions put forth by Congress for supporting the passage of long-delayed Goods and Services Taxes Bill. Jaitley said that the conditions were "after-thought" and were not part of the bill that Congress had itself introduced. He was replying to a question about pre-conditions put by P Chidambaram for Congress to support GST.
