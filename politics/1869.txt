The Youth Congress activists in Odisha on Saturday hurled eggs at Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh's vehicle in protest against the death of five farmers in Madhya Pradesh's Mandsaur district. The incident took place when the Union Minister left the state guest house and was on his way to attend a programme on 'Sabka Sath Sabka Bikas' in Jatani.
