The Central Information Commission on Wednesday ruled that Delhi's Lieutenant Governor (LG) is a ''public office'' and any recommendation made by the LG to the Centre can be made public under the Right to Information Act. This comes after an RTI enquiry sought details of LG Najeeb Jung's report that had recommended dissolving the Delhi Assembly in November 2014.
