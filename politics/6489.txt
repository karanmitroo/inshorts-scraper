Congress leader Pramod Tiwari on Wednesday said BJP President Amit Shah should stop two-faced talks on Ayodhya Ram Temple issue, accusing BJP of keeping the issue alive for political gains. Tiwari's comment came a day after Shah said in Lucknow that "Ram temple should be built on the site either after a consensus or by the directions of the court".
