Shiv Sena has criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam for their remarks that raised questions on India's recent surgical strikes along the Line of Control. In its mouthpiece 'Saamana', Shiv Sena said that such attempts affect the morale of the soldiers and added that the strikes were the best medicine for Pakistan.
