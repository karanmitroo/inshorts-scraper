Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Kapil Mishra was Wednesday named as Delhi's new Law Minister. Mishra will be replacing Jitender Singh Tomar, who had resigned from the post on Tuesday after his arrest on charges of possessing fake degrees. Mishra is known to be a loyalist of Arvind Kejriwal and has been associated with him since the India Against Corruption days.
