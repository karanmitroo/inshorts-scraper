The Congress party on Thursday suspended Mani Shankar Aiyar from primary membership of the party after he called PM Narendra Modi "neech" (despicable) and uncultured. Condemning Aiyar's remark, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said he and the party expected him to apologise to PM Modi. Aiyar had clarified that he only meant "low-minded" by the remark.
