CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat  has said that her party is working very closely and unitedly with all the Left parties, particularly with CPI, but merging with the latter is not on the agenda right now. Her statement came after CPI General Secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy had said, "The issues on which Communists were divided in 1964 have become irrelevant now".
