Former BJP MP Ram Vilas Vedanti on Friday claimed that it was him, and not BJP leader LK Advani, who incited the mob to demolish Babri Masjid in 1992. "He had no role in this incident...I brought it down and ensured that it went down," he added. Advani and other senior leaders were trying to calm the mob, Vedanti claimed.
