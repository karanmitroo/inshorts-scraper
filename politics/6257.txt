RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday said all “secular parties” should come together to contest the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, slated to be held next year. Prasad added that he would "try to convince" Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on this. Further, he said that secular parties should together check RSS-led “fundamentalist forces" and "other right-wing organisations".
