Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh on Friday faced flak after he was caught on camera clicking a selfie with Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor at a UNICEF child rights event in the state capital of Raipur. State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel questioned Singh's motive and said instead of "expressing concern" for drought affected farmers, CM was busy clicking selfie with a star.
