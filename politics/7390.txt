AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday asserted he would not chant slogans of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'. "I won't utter that even if you put a knife on my throat. Nowhere has it been mentioned in the Constitution," Owaisi added. Notably, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had recently said the new generation should be taught to chant "Bharat Mata Ki Jai".
