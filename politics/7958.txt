The BJP on Monday staged a protest outside the residence of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and demanded his resignation over the alleged auto-rickshaw permit scam. Claiming that the AAP government robbed the permits from actual auto drivers and gave them to auto mafias, the BJP held Kejriwal and Transport Minister Gopal Rai accountable for the scam.
