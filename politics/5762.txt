The Delhi Police on Thursday started a probe in the "objectionable" CD case that showcased former AAP minister Sandeep Kumar in a ‘compromising position’ with a woman. This comes after a BJP delegation met Commissioner Alok Kumar and lodged a complaint against Sandeep for "misusing... public authority against women". Following the incident, Sandeep was sacked from the party.
