Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal has accused the AAP of selling tickets to its candidates for 2017 Punjab Assembly Election. “AAP has bid goodbye to all the democratic norms,” he said. Terming AAP a ‘ragtag bunch of so called leaders’, he further said that these leaders are devoid of roots and don’t have any standing amongst the common people.
