Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said that he had not received any information about the Cabinet reshuffle from the Centre. Speaking at a meeting about the recent Mumbai rains, Thackeray said, "Today, everybody's attention is focussed on it (Cabinet reshuffle), but the Shiv Sena's attention is on the health of Mumbai's citizens."
