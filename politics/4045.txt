CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said that "PM Narendra Modi behaves like a pickpocket who has picked the pockets of the people first, and now says he will come out with welfare schemes". "PM has helped the black money hoarders to exchange it as white money... Modi had said 90% of the black money is parked abroad," he added.
