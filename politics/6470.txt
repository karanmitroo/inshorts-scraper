Uttarakhand Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal on Thursday disqualified two legislators from Congress and BJP for cross-voting in the Supreme Court-monitored floor test. During the vote, BJP's Bhim Lal Arya switched over to the Congress side, while Congress MLA Rekha Arya voted for the BJP. Under the anti-defection law, a legislator can be disqualified for voting against one's party orders.
