Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is trying to implement its "fundamentalist agenda through the BJP governments, which could put the secular character of the country at risk". "BJP has no plan for the development of Uttar Pradesh...a new form of corrupt politics has come before us," he added.
