Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav will move the Election Commission on Monday to stake a claim to fight the 2017 Assembly elections using Samajwadi Party's 'cycle' symbol, reports said. This comes after Akhilesh was declared as the new SP chief at its national convention. However, the party's incumbent chief and founder Mulayam Singh Yadav has termed Akhilesh's appointment as "unconstitutional".
