AAP's former Punjab convenor Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi quit the party on Wednesday, two days after national convenor Arvind Kejriwal handed-over his post to Bhagwant Mann. "I canâ€™t work under the leadership of a person who has been appointed on the condition that he will not drink (alcohol)", he said adding that he was upset by the way he was removed.
