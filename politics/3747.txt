BJP leader and Punjab Minister Anil Joshi has pleaded with voters that he shouldn't be punished for demonetisation as he isn't responsible for it. "My tenure is over. Now, one month is yours. Go out, convince people to vote for me," he told the people. "My fight was for merit, truth and justice and I fought for people," he added.
