A section within Congress is against extending support to AAP for forming government in Delhi, senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi said Tuesday. "It was not our duty whether somebody forms the government or not," Dwivedi added. Ever since AAP decided to form government, Congress leaders have been repeatedly emphasising that their support to AAP is not unconditional.
