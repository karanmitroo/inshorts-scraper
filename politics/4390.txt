While addressing a rally in Uttarakhand's Almora district, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that the Centre's demonetisation move is like an economic robbery. "The aim of demonetisation policy is to draw money from the innocent and help the corrupt," Gandhi said. "All cash is not black money, all black money is not cash," Gandhi added.
