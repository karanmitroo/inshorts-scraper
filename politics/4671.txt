Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's office on Sunday rubbished the media reports claiming that 50 chartered flights will ferry VIPs for his daughter's wedding. The office termed the news reports as "mischievous and incorrect". Notably, the reports had claimed that the planes would be used to fly over 10,000 guests to Nagpur, the venue of the wedding.
