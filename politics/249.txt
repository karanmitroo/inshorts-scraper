Nagaland BJP spokesperson James Vizo has said the party is planning to send senior Christian citizens on a free trip to Jerusalem if it comes to power. Reacting to this, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted, "I was right BJP continues with Subsidy if it suits its electoral needs." This comes a month after the government withdrew Haj subsidy for pilgrims.
