The nine rebel Uttarakhand MLAs have moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to participate in the upcoming state Assembly sessions. The rebel MLAs, who belonged to the Congress party, were disqualified from the Assembly under anti-defection laws after they supported BJP and later joined the party. The apex court will reportedly hear their plea on Wednesday.
