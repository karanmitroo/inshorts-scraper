BJP leader and Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Saturday that the Congress has imposed President's rule in states 88 times and is "cribbing" about the Uttarakhand issue. "We haven't imposed President's rule by dismissing the present government. Rather, it has been done to stop horse trading," Naqvi said.
