The Congress on Tuesday extended support to the JD(U) government in Bihar, a day after Jitan Ram Manjhi was named the new chief minister by Nitish Kumar. "We have handed a letter to governor DY Patil supporting the government," state Congress president Ashok Choudhary said. Currently, JD(U) has 117 legislators and enjoys support of one CPI member and two Independents.
