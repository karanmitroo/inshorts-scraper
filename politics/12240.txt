Students of the Government Arts and Commerce College (Gujarat) were reportedly asked to pay Rs.100 as fine, since they did not attended Modi's 'Run For Unity'. As many as 259 students had skipped the Dec-15 run organised by the BJP-led Gujarat government to rally support for Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity. However, the college withdrew the order after protests.
