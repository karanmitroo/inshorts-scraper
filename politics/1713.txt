A Delhi court on Friday scheduled a hearing for July 28 in a case against sacked AAP minister Kapil Mishra for allegedly defaming Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain by accusing him of corruption. Jain's lawyer argued that Mishra had made defamatory statements about Jain before national media instead of going to any probe agency.
