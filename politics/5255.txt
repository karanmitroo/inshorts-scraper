Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Saturday said he doesn't see an imminent war happening between India and Pakistan. While there's tension along the Line of Control, both governments are "a lot more careful" about war prospects, he added. "No state more than J&K suffers on account of a downturn in relations between India and Pakistan," Abdullah said.
