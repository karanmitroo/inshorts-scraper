Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant on Tuesday demanded the removal of the word 'Sindh' from the national anthem. To back his demand, Sawant cited that there was no state by that name in the country ever. He further suggested that a correct word with appropriate pronunciation should replace the word ‘Sindh’ from the national anthem, which was written in 1911.
