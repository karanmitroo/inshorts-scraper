Slamming BJP and Congress for not visiting mosques during the election campaign, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi accused the parties of ignoring the minority Muslim community. "They have ensured that they get enough eyeballs in temples. Couldn't they have clicked a single photo with Muslims?" questioned Owaisi. He had earlier said that the Gujarat poll campaign seemed like a "religious yatra".
