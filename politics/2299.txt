BJP MP Vinay Katiyar on Thursday said that there may be some truth to RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's allegations that PM Narendra Modi has conspired against Advani. "There were rumours that Advani would become President. The CBI is in PM's hands and it said the case against Advani should take place," Lalu had added.
