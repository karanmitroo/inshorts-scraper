National Conference leader and former J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Tuesday slammed PM Narendra Modi for breaching security protocol by travelling in a single engine seaplane. "No Z+ protectee is allowed to fly in a single engine aircraft, much less the PM of our country," he said. Abdullah further questioned the decision to have a foreign pilot fly the seaplane.
