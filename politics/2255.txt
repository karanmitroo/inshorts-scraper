Condemning the Naxal attack on CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh's Sukma, the BJP on Tuesday slammed the West Bengal government for not controlling the rampant 'Maoist activities' prevalent in Jadavpur University. "The government should take harsh measures to finish Naxalism in India," BJP National Secretary Rahul Sinha said. At least 25 CRPF personnel were martyred in the Naxalite ambush on Monday.
