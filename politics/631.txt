BJP candidate and Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, who was initially trailing behind Congress' Indranil Rajguru, has won from Rajkot West by 53,755 votes on Monday. Parties need at least 92 seats to form the government in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly. Notably, the BJP has not announced its Chief Ministerial candidate for Gujarat.
