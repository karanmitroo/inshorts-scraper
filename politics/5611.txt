PM Narendra Modi's election slogan of 'acche din', which was coined by his predecessor Dr Manmohan Singh, has become a bone stuck in NDA government's throat, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday. Manmohan Singh had said 'acche din' will come 'in the future', but when Modiji said the same thing, it became "the millstone around our neck", he added.
