Opposition parties in Karnataka on Saturday asked the government not to release "at any cost" 6,000 cusecs of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu as directed by the Supreme Court. They further asked the government to oppose the formation of the Cauvery Water Management Board. Notably, the Supreme Court recently warned the state government for repeated "defiance" by flouting its orders.
