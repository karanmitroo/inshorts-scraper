Senior Congress leader Sheila Dikshit on Tuesday dared PM Narendra Modi to order an independent probe in the Sahara list. The list mentions the names of politicians including PM Modi and Sheila Dikshit who allegedly got payments from the Sahara Group during 2013-14. "The ball is now in PM Modi's court. Will he respond and come out clean?" Dikshit asked.
