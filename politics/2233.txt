After PM Narendra Modi appealed to all the states to reach out to Kashmiri students who are staying outside Jammu and Kashmir, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said that Prime Minister's appeal is only on paper. "Kashmiri students are beaten up many times. This government needs to implement laws and provide security," he added.
