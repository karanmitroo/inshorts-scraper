The Samajwadi Party on Saturday suspended Member of Legislative Council (MLC) Udayveer Singh from the party for six years. This comes after Udayveer, who is said to be a close aide of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, had recently accused party chief Mulayam Singh's wife of conspiring against Akhilesh.
