Congress leader Randeep Surjewala on Monday questioned an ISI officer's inclusion in the Pakistan Joint Investigation Team (JIT) probing the Pathankot attack. "Pakistan has not provided a letter rogatory for the visit of the JIT team, without it there is no guarantee of prosecution," he said. Surjewala further questioned why Jaish-e-Mohammad Chief Maulana Masood Azhar was not arrested by Pakistan.
