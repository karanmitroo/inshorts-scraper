A group of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteers have started a campaign to get anti-corruption activist Anjali Damania back in the party. Damania had exposed corruption cases including the â‚¹1,000-crore irrigation scam and the Maharashtra Sadan scam which led to the arrest of NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal. She has not yet taken a decision regarding rejoining AAP.
