Stating that the Congress had failed to hide its contempt towards his 'poor origins', Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said he used to sell tea but he has not sold the nation. He further urged Congress to not mock the poor. This comes after Congress' youth wing shared a meme mocking Prime Minister Modi's past as a tea seller.
