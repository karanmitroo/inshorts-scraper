Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar on Monday claimed that the people distressed by demonetisation will teach BJP a lesson in the upcoming polls. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken the decision to "benefit a few of his friends", he alleged. "Prime Minister is changing rules on demonetisation as if he is changing clothes," Babbar further said.
