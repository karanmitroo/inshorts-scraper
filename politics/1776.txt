The BJP has urged the Centre to impose the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in Tripura following clashes between workers of BJP and the ruling Left Front coalition's Communist Party of India (Marxist). The CPI(M) claimed the BJP's demand was part of a conspiracy against the Left Front government ahead of the assembly elections next year.
