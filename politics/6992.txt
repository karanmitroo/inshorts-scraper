BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday hailed the "noble efforts" of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to resolve the Ayodhya dispute. Swamy said, "Had he become Prime Minister once again, he would have definitely constructed the Ram Temple at the same place." Rajiv Gandhi started “upholding the concept of Ram Rajya” but things changed after his untimely demise, Swamy claimed.
