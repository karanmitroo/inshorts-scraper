Saying that the TMC government stood for "Terror, Maut (Death) and Corruption", Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had boycotted meetings called by the Centre to discuss states' development. "What kind of Chief Minister is she?... She did not attend those meetings only because Modi convened it," he claimed during a campaign rally.
