Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday at the Rajya Sabha called PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation move a "monumental mismanagement". Though Singh agreed with the government's objective behind the move, he warned that the way the decision has been implemented will shrink the country's GDP by at least 2%. "It's important to take note of the people's suffering," added Singh.
