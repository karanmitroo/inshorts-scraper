A group of people Sunday staged protest outside Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwalâ€™s residence over demolition of few jhuggis in Shahdara area on Saturday. Protesters alleged that police also smashed up their household things, abused them and manhandled them which left many of them injured. Kejriwal had, reportedly, promised in his pre-poll rallies not to erase any jhuggi across Delhi.
