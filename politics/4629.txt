BJP spokesman Suresh Kumar has claimed that they have evidence that a minister in Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's government masterminded a ₹152-crore scam. The scam was recently revealed after the Income Tax Department raided offices and residences of two senior officials and found over ₹4 crore in new denominations along with other assets worth ₹152 crore in their possession.
