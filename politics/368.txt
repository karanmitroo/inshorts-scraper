A Goa court has issued a notice to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in connection with the case filed against him by the Election Commission for his 'bribery' remarks during 2017 Goa elections campaign. During his rallies in January 2017, CM Kejriwal had appealed to voters to "accept money from the Congress and BJP candidates, but vote for the AAP".
