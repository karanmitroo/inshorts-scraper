Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday said that if elected to power, he would jail those guilty of drug smuggling and â€œpatronising" drug mafias in the state. "From transport to drugs to sand, cable TV, liquor, there was nothing the Akalis had not seized control of to promote their interests," he added.
