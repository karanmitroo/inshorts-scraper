The BJP's defeat in the recent bypolls in Rajasthan is a "wake-up call", party leader and CM Vasundhara Raje said while addressing party legislators. "We are reviewing why such a situation arose despite so much development," Raje added. Congress had won the bypolls for the two Lok Sabha seats and one Assembly constituency in Rajasthan.
