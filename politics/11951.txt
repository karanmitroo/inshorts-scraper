Responding to Finance Minister P Chidamabaram's comment on khaps, Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda Friday said, "I have stated many times about the khap panchayats that these are NGOs... like you go to Gurgaon, where RWAs have been formed". Earlier, Chidambaram had described khap panchayats as "retrograde organizations", which are not part of the Indian culture.
