After Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the Centre of selectively leaking the demonetisation decision to some people, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that the former is standing with the black money hoarders. "Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party also seem to have become a victim of the surgical strike on corruption and black money," he added.
