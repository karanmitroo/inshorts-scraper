Yoga guru Ramdev has opposed the Supreme Court's order to ban firecrackers' sale in Delhi and NCR, saying, "Hindus are being targeted." Ramdev further said, "Is it right to take legal move for everything? I run schools, universities... we permit only hand-held firework that burns slowly... we don't support firecrackers with high decibels. Ban should be imposed on big firecrackers."
