CPI(M) on Sunday termed the appointment of Yogi Adityanath as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister as a shocking decision by the BJP. "Adityanath is a known Hindutva fanatic who has a record of inciting communal violence having a number of criminal cases pending against him," it said. It makes a mockery of its own slogan 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas', CPI(M) added.
