Two jailed Nationalist Congress Party MLAs, Chhagan Bhujbal and Ramesh Kadam, cast their votes in the Presidential elections on Monday, a Vidhan Bhawan official said. While Bhujbal had received permission from a Special Court to vote in the elections, the Bombay High Court had allowed Kadam to vote.
