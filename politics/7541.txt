Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has called 2015 as "perhaps the most polarised year in India’s history after the Partition in 1947". “The year... ended with the narrative of intolerance, of confrontation, with more and more people apprehensive and insecure," said Chidambaram. He made the comments while launching his book, 'Standing Guard- A Year in Opposition' at an event.
