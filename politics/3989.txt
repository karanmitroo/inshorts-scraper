Speaking ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday said people are looking for an opportunity to vent out their anger against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "The farmer is angry, poor is angry, small traders are troubled," he added. PM Modi's expectations that he is going to get backing from the people was wrong, Kharge said.
