Shiv Sena Monday challenged Modi govt to capture Dawood Ibrahim the way US forces undertook the operations to eliminate Osama Bin Laden. Shiv Sena, a part of ruling party NDA, questioned govt's point of following Dawood's movements without initiating action against him. The govt on Saturday had asked Pakistan to hand over Dawood to India.
