RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday slammed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after two BJP leaders, including Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, blamed rats for the floods in the state. "When thousands of ton of liquor vanished, they blamed rats, and when thousands of people died, they blamed rats. As if these rats are Nitish's 'sarkaari' scapegoats," Lalu tweeted.
