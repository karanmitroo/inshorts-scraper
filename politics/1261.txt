The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the BJP had misled India by "rehashing, repackaging and renaming" 23 schemes launched by the previous Congress governments. Stating that the BJP government inherited the schemes while they were on different stages of implementation, Congress leader Rajeev Shukla said they have now failed. BJP has brought India to a "grave economic situation", he added.
