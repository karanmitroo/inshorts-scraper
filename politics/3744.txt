BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday claimed the sudden violence at Chennai's Marina Beach during the ongoing Jallikattu protests was triggered by Pakistan's spy agency - Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). This comes after violence broke out on Marina Beach and police used tear gas and water cannons to contain the mob. The organisers and genuine agitators had already dispersed, Swamy claimed.
