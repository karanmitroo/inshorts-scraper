The Ethics Committee of Delhi Assembly on Wednesday unanimously recommended revoking membership of BJP MLA OP Sharma in connection with making derogatory remarks against AAP MLA Alka Lamba. Accusing him of being "unrepentant", committee called Sharma a "habitual offender". Sharma, however, has trashed the report as "biased and politically motivated", accusing the AAP of "misusing" its majority.
