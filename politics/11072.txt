Expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh met party president Rajnath Singh and Lal Krishna Advani in New Delhi on Friday, leading to speculations that he could return to the party fold. The meetings were, though, described as courtesy calls. Notably, Advani had played a key role in Jaswant's return to BJP, when he was expelled from the party in 2009.
