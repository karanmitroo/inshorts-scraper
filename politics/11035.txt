BJP leader, Shatrughan Sinha, has slammed the party leadership's decision to impose an informal age bar (of 75 yrs) to exclude veterans from the NDA government. "Today LK Advani (86) is sharper than people who are 30 to 40 years younger to him, ... I do not agree that 75-plus should not be in active politics," Sinha said.
