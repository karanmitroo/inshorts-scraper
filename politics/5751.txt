Shiv Sena on Friday supported sacked Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar and criticised Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar over the medium of instruction issue in the state. Parrikar had earlier launched the movementÂ favouring regional languages as MoI in Goa schools with Velingkar, but after becoming the CM, he granted permission to the missionary schools, the party alleged.
