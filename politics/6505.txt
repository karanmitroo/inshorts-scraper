In a letter to the PM, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the Special Investigation Team constituted by the Centre in 2015 to probe the 1984 anti-Sikh riots had been "ineffective". Kejriwal said the SIT "failed to reopen" a single case and urged the Centre to allow the Delhi government to form a new SIT to probe the matter.
