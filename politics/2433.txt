Congress MP and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor has categorically denied the rumours of him joining BJP. "For 40+ years I have spoken and written in defence of a pluralist India with equal rights...On this, no compromise," he said. This comes after CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said four Congress leaders, including Tharoor, were planning to join BJP.
