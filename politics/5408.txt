BJP leader Kirit Somaiya on Wednesday said the party will contest alone in 227 wards in the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls. The BJP "will end the corruption of Shiv Sena", he added. Taking a dig at the Shiv Sena, Somaiya had earlier called BMC a ‘den of corruption’, stating one has to bribe godfather to get the work done.
