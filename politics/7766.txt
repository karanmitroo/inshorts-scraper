Addressing party workers on Sunday, Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh claimed that in spite of his advice, half of UP ministers haven't mended their ways and are minting money. "If earning money is your priority, then you should rather do business. Even I would have helped you," Mulayam said. Mulayam also warned CM Akhilesh Yadav to beware of back stabbers.
