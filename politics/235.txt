BJP MP Yashodhara Raje Scindia on Saturday said that those who vote for Congress would not get the benefits of a centrally-funded scheme which provides LPG connections to poor households. Speaking at a public meeting during the campaign ahead of Kolaras Assembly bypolls, Raje added, "Why will we give you gas through the hands of Congress?"
