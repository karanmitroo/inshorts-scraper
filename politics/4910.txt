Reacting to demonetisation and the problems being faced by people amid wedding season, Yoga guru Ramdev said, "Many in the BJP are bachelors and that they didn't realise it was wedding season." Saying that if this was done some time later then the weddings wouldn't have been badly affected, Ramdev added that the good thing is "people cannot demand dowry".
