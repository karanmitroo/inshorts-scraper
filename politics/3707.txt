The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex body of Hindu saints in the country, has said that it will not support the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on the construction of Ram Temple. The ABAP said that both the organisations are no longer trustworthy and they used the sensitive issue only to attract votes.
