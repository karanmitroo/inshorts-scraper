The Election Commission ordered police protection for all Congress MLAs in Gujarat over reports of the BJP trying to bribe them to join the party. All of the nine MLAs in Gujarat were given security, in addition to the 42 that the party took to Bengaluru. This comes after six of the party's MLAs resigned and joined the BJP.
