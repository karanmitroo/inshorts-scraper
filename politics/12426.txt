Congress on Monday complained the Election Commission against BJP's CM candidate Harsh Vardhan accusing him of making false and distorted claims about his role in making Delhi polio free as the State Health Minister. The party said Dr. Vardhan was Health Minister before 1998 and there were 47 polio-cases in 1998 and 73 in 1999, thus proving his claims untrue.
