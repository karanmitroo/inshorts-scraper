Communal tension broke out in Uttarakhand's Satpuli town after a minor allegedly posted an "offensive" photo of the Kedarnath Temple on Facebook. Reportedly, a shop belonging to the boy's family was vandalised by some members of Hindu group Bajrang Dal and other right-wing organisations over the controversial picture. The police is trying to catch the minor and normalise the situation.
