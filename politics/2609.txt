Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh mistakenly wrote 'Rajiv Gandhi Cabinet' as 'Rahul Gandhi Cabinet' in a tweet on March 27. "Rajkumari Ratna Singh ex-MP is the daughter of Raja Dinesh Singh ji who was a Cabinet Minister in Indira Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi Cabinet," Singh tweeted. After being trolled by Twitter users, Singh deleted the post and published correct tweet.
