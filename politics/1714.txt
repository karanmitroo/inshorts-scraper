RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday said, "Our society has found an able and competent contractor (PM Narendra Modi) for social welfare." He added, "But the danger is that we might put the entire onus on the contractor's head and sleep. This shouldn't happen. The people who work for public welfare have a feeling of worship for the country."
