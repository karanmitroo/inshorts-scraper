Citing examples of Andhra, Telangana, West Bengal and Kerala, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Thursday demanded 80% reservation for local youths in Bihar's government jobs and admission in educational institutions. Shortage of higher education institutions in Bihar forces students to migrate to other states, but due to local reservation in those states they donâ€™t get employment, he explained.
