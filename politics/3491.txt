Tamil Nadu's next Chief Minister Sasikala Natarajan was a close aide of late CM J Jayalalithaa for around three decades. Sasikala's extended family, known as 'Mannargudi Mafia', is believed to have run Tamil Nadu during AIADMK's rule. Sasikala was once expelled from the party, but later reinstated within 100 days. Sasikala has also been arrested twice with Jayalalithaa over graft.
