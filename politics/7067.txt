Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, has said that he does not need his wife Priyanka Gandhi to enhance his life and that he has always had enough. On being asked about his land deal probe, Vadra said, "I am born and brought up here. I would never leave my country even if I am humiliated."
