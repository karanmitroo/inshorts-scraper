Congress' social media head Divya Spandana has said that the video circulated by a BJP leader, showing her asking party workers to create fake social media accounts has been edited out of context. In the video, Divya can be seen saying, "So today, you'll create three accounts in the names of others...One...can have multiple accounts...nothing wrong with that."
