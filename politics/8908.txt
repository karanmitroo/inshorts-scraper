Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Monday suspended 25 Congress MPs for five days for disrupting the House. Earlier, the opposition had rejected the government's proposal of debate and stuck to its demand of ‘resignations first, debate later’. It's demanding resignations of Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan over various controversies.
