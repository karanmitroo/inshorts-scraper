Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit has alleged that Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken is running party's city unit as a "business house". "The high command should take note of this fact and also that one person is taking all the decisions," he said. "Though Maken is indulging in condemnable acts, Congress leaders shouldn't quit the party," he added.
