Members of about 57 Muslim families were "re-converted" into Hinduism, in a huge ceremony organised by Dharma Jagran Samanvay Vibhag, an offshoot of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and Bajrang Dal in Agra on Monday. The ceremony was named "Purkhon ki Ghar Wapasi". RSS Regional Head Rajeshwari Singh claimed that 5000 Muslims and Christians will be re-converted in Christmas.
