BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said that construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya will start before the end of 2016, adding that a favourable Supreme Court verdict would make it possible. Swamy said the cases related to Krishna mandir in Mathura and Kashi Vishwanath can be won easily when compared to the "more difficult" Ram temple dispute in Ayodhya.
