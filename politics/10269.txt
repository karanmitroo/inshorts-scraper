Former AAP legislator, Ashok Kumar Chauhan, who was elected on the party ticket in the December 2013 assembly polls from Ambedkar Nagar, Saturday joined the BJP. "I was feeling suffocated in the party and therefore decided to leave. I think the BJP will better utilize my talents as the AAP has lost focus," Chauhan said.
