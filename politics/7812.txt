Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the West Bengal government could not deny responsibility for the recent violence that erupted in Malda. He claimed it to be the duty of the state government and the Chief Minister to find the culprits of the violence. Singh said, "Aaj West Bengal mein koi surakshit nahi, na maa, na maati na manush."
