Shiv Sena on Monday asked the courts not to interfere in matters of faith and religion. The comments have come in the backdrop of a ban imposed by the Bombay High Court on constructing mandaps (marquees) in congested areas. The order would hamper the celebration of festivals like Ganeshotsav, Navratri and Dahi-Handi, the party said in an editorial in Saamna.
