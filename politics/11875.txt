AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday extended an invitation to CPM veteran VS Achuthanandan to join his party. Furthermore, Kejriwal said that his key enemies at the moment were not any individuals but "corruption and communalism." The move reportedly comes at a time when Achuthanandan is frequently embarrassing his party (CPM) through his statements on various issues.
