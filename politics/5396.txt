Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje on Thursday attended a 'yagna' which was held at the Tanot Mata temple near Jaisalmer for national safety and security of soldiers deployed on the border. The 'Rashtra Raksha Yagya' was organised by the Rajasthan Sanskrit Academy and performed by 21 priests. Raje had reportedly directed the academy to organise a 'yagna' amid Indo-Pak tensions.
