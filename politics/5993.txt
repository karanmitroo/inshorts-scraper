Former JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav today termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's love for Kashmir as one-sided. A mere reference to Kashmir in his speech is not enough and the Centre must take political measures for Kashmiris to reciprocate that affection, he said. This comes in response to PM Modi's first statement on Kashmir after violence erupted there last month.
