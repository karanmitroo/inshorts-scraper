Shiv Sena Monday said that there's nothing wrong with reverse conversions. "Till yesterday, Hindus were converted to Muslims. Then, nobody said those were done forcibly or through enticement. But now when the Ganga has started flowing in reverse, the pseudo secularists are saying the conversions are not right," an editorial in Shiv Sena owned newspaper 'Saamana' said.
