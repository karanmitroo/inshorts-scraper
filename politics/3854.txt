Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Tuesday that communal incidents have declined significantly since Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in May 2014. Claiming that no such major episode occurred in the nearly 32-month period, Naqvi hailed the Modi government for creating an atmosphere wherein minorities are becoming part of the country's development process.
