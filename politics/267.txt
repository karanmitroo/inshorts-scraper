Reacting to JD(S) supremo and former PM HD Deve Gowda calling him "neech", Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said he "takes these names as medals, and not as insults". Gowda's remark came after he allegedly wasn't allowed to speak at a function last week, despite his name being printed on the invitation. Gowda had also said it was a mistake "grooming" Siddaramaiah.
