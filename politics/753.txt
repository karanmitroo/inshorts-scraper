Inaugurating Dr Ambedkar International Centre, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said Congress was more interested in Baba Bhole (Lord Shiva) than Baba (BR) Ambedkar. This was in reference to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who claimed his family members were devotees of Lord Shiva. PM Modi suggested the Nehru-Gandhi family had attempted to erase Ambedkar's contributions towards nation-building.
