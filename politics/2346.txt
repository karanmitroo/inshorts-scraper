Two Punjabi men shared a video in which they are seen dancing to the tune of 'Kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi', which had featured Union Minister Smriti Irani as Tulsi. They captioned the video, "Punjabis can dance on any music.....because they're born with their own rhythm". Replying to the tweet, Irani said, "Agreed!!! Paajis pao Bhangra."
