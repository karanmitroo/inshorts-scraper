Former Union Minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has said that his party will support the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill if the government accepts four amendments. "It was the BJP, on behalf of Narendra Modi, as Gujarat chief minister, who opposed the bill when it was tabled in 2011," Ramesh added.
