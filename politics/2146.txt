Asking BJP to withdraw support to the Jammu and Kashmir government, Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal on Monday alleged that the Mehbooba Mufti-led regime in the state is collaborating with terrorists. The Rajya Sabha MP further took a dig at BJP, stating that the Modi government "could not act tough against them (Maoists) due to vote bank politics."
