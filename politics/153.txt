Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday likened the National People's Party (NPP), which has allied with the BJP in poll-bound Meghalaya, to a "tail that wags whenever the dog barks". Terming the NPP a "masked party", he accused it of pretending to stand for local interests. The BJP has demanded an apology from Tharoor for his "indecent remark".
