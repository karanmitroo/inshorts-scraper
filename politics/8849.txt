As many as 20 Rajya Sabha MPs, including leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, have moved a notice against VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi urging the Chair to initiate proceedings against her for breach of privilege. Prachi had said on Thursday that there were "one or two terrorists" in Parliament who were disobeying court’s judgment on Yakub Memon’s hanging.
