The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) will take up the issue of 'fake babas' at its three-day gathering of religious figures to be held in Karnataka in November. This comes after the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad released a list of 14 fake godmen in India, including Ram Rahim, Nirmal Baba, Radhe Maa, and Asaram, accusing them of maligning saints and ascetics.
