Congress leaders gave notices in the Rajya Sabha to suspend question hour to discuss the Uttarakhand row and to adopt a resolution condemning President's rule in the state. The resolution reads "this House deplores the destabilisation of the democratically elected government in Uttarakhand and disapproves the unjustified imposition of President's Rule there under Article 356 of the Constitution."
