BJP's Sakshi Maharaj on Saturday claimed women in Islam were "no better than footwear," and sought judicial intervention so they could enter mosques. He added, "The country should be run by the constitution and not Fatwas." Last year, Maharaj called for Hindus to have four children, so Hinduism may be protected. He had also termed Madrasas a source of terrorism.
