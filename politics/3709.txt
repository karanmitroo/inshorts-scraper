After the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance was announced for the elections in UP, Sheila Dikshit on Monday said she withdrew as the Congress' CM candidate and added she would continue to campaign if the party leadership wants. "The poll outcome for Congress will be better than what it would have done while contesting the polls alone," the three-time Delhi CM added.
