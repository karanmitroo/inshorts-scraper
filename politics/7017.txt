Former Law Minister Hansraj Bhardwaj on Friday claimed that the UPA-I wanted to dissolve the Samajwadi Party-led Uttar Pradesh government in 2007. He said, "the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh used to brief Congress about the crippled law and order" in the state. Bhardwaj claimed he advised the UPA that the government could not be dismissed on corruption grounds alone.
