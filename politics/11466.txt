Demanding Bharat Ratna for Jashodaben (Narendra Modi's wife), Assam CM and Congress leader Tarun Gogoi said Sunday - â€œJashodaben is a symbol of womanhood. I will propose within 10 days to confer Bharat Ratna on her... She has taken so much pain and insults. However, she never uttered a single word or had any ill feeling for Modi."
