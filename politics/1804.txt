West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has designed flags to be displayed on the state's IAS officers' cars after the central government banned beacons. The flags for chief secretary and additional chief secretaries will be rectangular, while those of secretaries will be swallow-tailed and junior administrative grade or selection grade officers will get triangular flags.
