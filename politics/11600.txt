"We believe in 'Vasudevaka-kutumbakam' (Universal brotherhood). However, I admit there might have been some flaws on our part by failing to reach out to Muslims," BJP president Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday. On the other hand, he also accused Congress of depriving educational facilities to Muslims during its several years of governance as part of a "conspiracy".
