BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday tweeted, "People giving me unasked for advice of discipline and restraint donâ€™t realise that if I disregard discipline there would be a bloodbath." Swamy earlier said Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian should be sacked, following which FM Arun Jaitley discussed the "discipline of Indian politicians" and said the BJP does not share Swamy's view.
