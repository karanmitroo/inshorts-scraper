Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday accused PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government of neglecting veteran party leaders. "All those who are above the age of 75 were declared brain dead on May 26, 2014," the former Union Finance and Foreign Minister said. Notably, senior leaders like LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are not a part of the cabinet.
