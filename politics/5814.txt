Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi on Sunday slammed Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit’s remarks on underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s presence in Islamabad and advised the Centre to talk “seriously” with Pakistan in this regard. Azmi said Pakistan is taking India “very lightly” and treating a serious issue like this as a “joke”. “Pakistan should give an authentic answer,” Azmi added.
