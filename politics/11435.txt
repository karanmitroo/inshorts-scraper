In a stunning incident, voters at a polling booth at Shamrao Kalmadi School in Pune Thursday found that an electronic voting machine (EVM) reportedly "transferred" all votes to the Congress, irrespective of the button pressed. When officials came to know about it, they reportedly ordered a new machine for this particular polling booth and have decided to conduct fresh voting.
