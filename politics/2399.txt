Following the large-scale violence ahead of by-polls, the Election Commission on Monday postponed the by-poll to the Anantnag Lok Sabha seat by over a month to May 25. It was earlier scheduled to be held on April 12. This comes after Srinagar by-polls registered only 6.5% polling due to the violence that killed 8 civilians and injured 100 security personnel.
