Amid reports of cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu joining Congress soon, BJP on Wednesday said the former Rajya Sabha MP has completely lost his direction in politics. "He started hopping from one party to another and now desperately clinging to Congress party," BJP's S Prakash said. Notably, Congress has offered Amritsar (East) Assembly seat and the Deputy CM post to Sidhu.
