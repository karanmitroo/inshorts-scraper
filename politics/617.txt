Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said the Congress worshipped Tipu Sultan and not Lord Hanuman, calling it a "difference in mentality". He further alleged BJP workers were being "brutally killed" in Karnataka and it's in a "state of anarchy" under the Congress rule. This comes ahead of Assembly elections in the state.
