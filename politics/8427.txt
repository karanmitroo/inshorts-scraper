Accusing Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung of threatening bureaucrats with “dire consequences” if they "refuse to partake in... obstructing the functioning of Delhi government", the AAP on Friday formed a special GoM (Group of Ministers), led by Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, to tackle political victimisation. The L-G's office dismissed the allegations and accused AAP of ill-treating its bureaucrats.
