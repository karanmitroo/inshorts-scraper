BJP Uttar Pradesh chief KP Maurya on Tuesday said the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya will be constructed after elections if BJP wins a majority in the state. This comes ahead of the first of the seven-phase elections in UP. Adding that Ram Mandir is a subject of faith, Maurya said, "It is not going to be built in two months."
