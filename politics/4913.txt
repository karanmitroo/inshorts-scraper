BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday said that PM Modi was very kind to former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan or else, "he would have been prosecuted for a number of corruption charges". Moreover, Swamy also criticised the Finance Ministry for demonetisation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes saying that the Ministry is answerable for the move's "poor execution".
