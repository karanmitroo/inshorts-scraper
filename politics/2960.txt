A day after Shiv Sena's Mahadeshwar was elected as the new mayor of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the NCP said that the BJP extended support to 'extortionist' Shiv Sena to save its government in Maharashtra. "The BJP was claiming mafia raj in Mumbai... The people have voted against mafia raj," NCP leader Nawab Malik said.
