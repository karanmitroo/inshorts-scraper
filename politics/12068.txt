In response to a claim by Narendra Modi that Atal Behari Vajpayee despite years in public life, has no house of his own, AAP member Dinesh Vaghela said, "This is the big lie spoken by Modiji. Vajpayee owns a house in New Delhi according to his pre-election affidavit. He also has a share in his ancestral home."
