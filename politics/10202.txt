Security has been beefed up considerably in Jammu and Kashmir for the fifth and final phase of voting on Saturday, for 20 seats spread over three districts of Jammu. A multi-tier security system has been put in place, along with troops on high-alert along the Indo-Pak border. High-profile candidates, like Deputy CM Tara Chand, will contest in this phase.
