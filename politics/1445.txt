Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, in a meeting with opposition leaders on Thursday, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi insists on Swachh Bharat while “we want sach Bharat." Gandhi added, "Wherever Modi goes, he lies. If we unite, he won’t stand a chance." He also slammed BJP's ideological parent Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for following a divisive agenda.
