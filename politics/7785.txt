The BJP on Friday accused the AAP of shielding Congress leaders "whose names must be in" a 1984 riots case file which has allegedly gone missing. It also accused the AAP of having no concern for important files. However, the AAP reportedly claimed that the file was not missing, and said that the "rumour" was aimed at creating confusion.
