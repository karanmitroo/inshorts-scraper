Trinamool Congress President from West Bengal's Birbhum district, Anubrata Mandal, on Sunday sparked a controversy by asking the local workers of the party to beat up the CPM members of the Ausgram area and throw them in canal water. "If you (CPM workers) want to do politics, do it honestly. Don't throw bricks from the back", Mandal said.
