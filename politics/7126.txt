Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday said he was now a "CBI certified honest" person and that the CBI "bothered" him a lot. â€œThe person who progresses from poor section of the society has to face such problems," he added. The CBI in 2013 cleared Yadav of misusing the Chief Minister's office to accumulate vast amounts of wealth.
