Following the resignation of Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, the Congress on Saturday demanded a high-level judiciary investigation into allegations against him. The party also demanded to register a criminal case against Khadse for the misuse of public office. Former AAP leader Anjali Damania said she will continue her hunger strike till a time-bound inquiry is ordered against Khadse.
