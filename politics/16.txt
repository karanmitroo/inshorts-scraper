Unidentified bike-borne men threw petrol bombs at a BJP office in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore on Wednesday, hours after late social activist EV Ramasamy's, popularly known as Periyar, statue was vandalised in Vellore. The incidents follow BJP leader H Raja's Facebook post, "Today it is Lenin's statue in Tripura, tomorrow it will be the statue of caste fanatic EV Ramasamy."
