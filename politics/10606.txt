Union Heavy Industries minister Anant Geete will resign after PM Modi returns from his US trip, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said on Monday, adding that his party will exit National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The decision comes four days after Shiv Sena ended its 25-year-old alliance with the BJP. Notably, Geete is Shiv Sena’s lone member in Narendra Modi’s cabinet.
