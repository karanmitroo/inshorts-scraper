Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said the government’s move to demonetise ₹500, ₹1000 currency notes would only affect the common man. People are facing difficulties in purchasing medicines, buying bus and train tickets and paying for auto-rickshaws, he said. "Just to destroy ₹400-crore fake currencies, why the circulation of ₹17 lakh crore was needed to be blocked," he asked.
