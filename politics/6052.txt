The AAP government on Thursday said it will challenge the Delhi High Court order holding Lieutenant Governor as the administrative head of the National Capital Territory. "We will move the Supreme Court against the HC verdict," Delhi Home Minister Satyendra Jain said. A Delhi government spokesperson said the verdict has "undermined powers of council of ministers mentioned in the Constitution".
