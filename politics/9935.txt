The Congress on Thursday flagged off as many as 45 mobile vans in Delhi to broaden its poll campaign for the upcoming assembly elections. These mobile vans will tour all the 70 constituencies of Delhi and will inform voters about the party's achievements during its 15-yr-long rule. The vans will also highlight Congress' achievements through detailed photo feature.
