In a stinging attack on the AAP, its ousted rebel Yogendra Yadav on Monday termed the Delhi government's latest TV advertisement as an example of "political corruption". The government is using public money in glorifying one person despite SC restrictions against such ads, Yadav said. "With these ads, it is getting into the league of Mayawati and Jayalalithaa," he added.
