Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has said he is in the process of overturning AAP government’s ‘illegal decisions’. “Unfortunately illegal decisions were taken without my knowledge…I have received around 250 files till date,” he said. Jung further added that for Delhi’s complex governing pattern, the L-G should restrict his interventions to the bare minimum and he was doing just that.
