Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said PM Narendra Modi cannot be “gagged” for speaking on corruption as he is "entitled to speak" about it inside and outside the Parliament. This comes after a Congress MP said he moved a breach of privilege motion against PM Modi and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar over their remarks on the AgustaWestland issue.
