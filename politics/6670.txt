Reacting to Rishi Kapoor's comments against the Gandhi family, Congress on Wednesday held a protest outside his residence alleging he had links with BJP and RSS. "He has earned money by dancing and drama whereas Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi have given their lives for the nation,” protesters said. Kapoor had earlier criticised naming of public assets after the Gandhis.
