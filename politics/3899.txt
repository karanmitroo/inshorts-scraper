Patidar leader Hardik Patel has said that the only difference between the Anandiben and the current Vijay Rupani governments is that the former "was a rubber stamp of PM Modi and the latter is of Amit Shah". He further said that though he's underage to contest polls in Gujarat, he will support those who are well-wishers of the Patidar community.
