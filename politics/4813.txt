A criminal complaint was filed on Friday before a Delhi court against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee seeking an FIR against them for their recent protest against demonetisation. The complainant claimed that the protest created law and order situation by provoking masses against demonetisation, which is "aimed at strengthening India's economy".
