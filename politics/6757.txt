BJP Uttarakhand chief Ajay Bhatt on Wednesday said that Chief Minister Harish Rawat's victory in the Supreme Court-ordered floor test was a mere technicality and does not absolve him of graft charges. Bhatt noted that the 10 MLAs deserting Rawat was no less important and showed that he had become an "autocrat and people felt suffocated under him".
