BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has stated that he is satisfied with the work of Modi government, but not with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s work. The way the economy was heading, the income-tax department should be closed and all taxmen be engaged in projects like building roads, he added. Earlier, Swamy had said that he would’ve made a better FM.
