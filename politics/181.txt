BJP minister Pradipsinh Jadeja on Thursday said that butchers and bootleggers didn't vote for the party in the Gujarat Assembly elections. The butchers didn't vote as the party introduced an anti-cow slaughter law, while the bootleggers were angry because of tough prohibition laws, Jadeja explained. He added that some were angry with BJP for introducing Triple Talaq bill.
