Congress President Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari saying that Congress will never support Modi government's land bill. "I urge you to rise above the realm of narrow partisan politics and bring back the 2013 law in totality," Sonia has written in the letter. Further, she has slammed the bill as "unabashed display of half-truths".
