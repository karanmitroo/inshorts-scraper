The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that it is not ‘feasible’ to conduct general and assembly elections simultaneously across the country. The court’s observation came after a PIL urged it to direct the authorities to conduct national and state elections together. “Sorry, it is not a matter in which court’s intervention is needed,” the court stated.
