Karnataka's Janata Dal (Secular) unit slammed PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation move on Friday, terming it "absurd" and asked "like-minded" parties to join hands in countering the "anti-democratic" ruling BJP-led NDA on all fronts. The party further alleged that demonetisation has paralysed the lives of crores of people belonging to the lowest and middle classes for over a month.
