Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai on Saturday claimed that the Election Commission's recommendation to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs was Chief Election Commissioner AK Joti's "gift" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Rai further questioned why the decision was taken ahead of Joti's retirement scheduled for this month. The MLAs have been accused of holding offices of profit as Parliamentary Secretaries.
