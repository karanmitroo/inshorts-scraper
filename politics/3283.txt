Ahead of the commencement of her four-year jail term in the disproportionate assets case, AIADMK leader VK Sasikala appointed her nephew TTV Dhinakaran as the party's Deputy General Secretary. Notably, Dhinakaran was among Sasikala's family members who were expelled by former CM Jayalalithaa in 2011. Along with Dhinakaran, her nephew Dr S Venkatesh was also reinducted into AIADMK.
