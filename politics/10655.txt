In a function, BJP President Amit Shah on Wednesday said, “…even today a big part of Kashmir is under Pakistan…if Kashmir issue was also given to Sardar Patel instead of Jawaharlal Nehru....the part of Kashmir would not have gone under Pakistan; Article 370 also wouldn’t have been there and it would have remained as any other territory of India.”
