The Uttarakhand unit of the Congress party will reportedly conduct 'arhar pe charcha’ starting October 19. This is being done keeping in mind the rise in prices of essential commodities like pulses, with arhar prices crossing ₹200 in some districts of the state. The name of the campaign bears similarity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'chai pe charcha' discussions.
