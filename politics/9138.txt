Gujarat's newly appointed Congress President Baratsinh Solanki on Monday accused CM Anandiben Patel of misgovernance. Questioning her abilities to govern the state, Solanki took a jibe on her by urging PM Narendra Modi to shift her to Delhi. "The state was proud to have a first woman chief minister. But she is making mistake after mistake in governance," he said.
