BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy called for a replacement of books written by the British in the pre-independence era, claiming that they have "distorted" facts about the country. He also advocated for making Sanskrit compulsory in schools. "Other than the mother tongue, Sanskrit should be made compulsory as the secondary language," he said while addressing students at the Banaras Hindu University.
