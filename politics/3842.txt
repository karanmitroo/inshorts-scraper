AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala's husband M Natarajan on Monday accused the BJP of trying to destabilise the Tamil Nadu government. "There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask," he said. "I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere," he added.
