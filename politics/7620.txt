The Congress on Wednesday demanded the immediate sacking of Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi, who is set to retire on February 29. “The violence at Patiala House Court clearly indicates that the Delhi Police has been taken over by the goondas of BJP,” Congress leader Ajay Maken said. The Congress further opposed Bassi’s candidature for the post of Information Commissioner.
