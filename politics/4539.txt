A Bihar-based filmmaker has made a full-length feature film, titled "Modi Ka Gaon", on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda and his vision for transforming India. Reportedly, the filmmaker is trying to get Modi to attend the premiere of the movie, which he says is not a biopic. The film was shot at several locations in Patna, Darbhanga, and Mumbai.
