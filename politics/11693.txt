NCP president Sharad Pawar on Sunday sparked controversy by allegedly advising Mathadi workers from the APMC market in Navi Mumbai to cast their votes twice. He asked them to first vote in Satara (where they hail from) on Apr-17, and then to wipe the indelible ink on their fingers and vote again for the party in Navi Mumbai on Apr-24.
