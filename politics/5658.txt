Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee President Amarinder Singh on Friday dismissed Navjot Singh Sidhu’s new political party ‘Awaaz-e-Punjab’ as “too insignificant and too inconsequential” to have any impact on the political scenario of the state. “Three MLAs don’t make a political party,” he said. Amarinder also clarified that he had never sent any emissaries to invite Sidhu to join the Congress.
