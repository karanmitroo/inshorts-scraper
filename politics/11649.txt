Abbas Ali (95), who is among the last living members of Subhas Chandra Bose’s INA, pins his hopes on AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal in his "struggle for a corruption-free India". Supporting Kejriwal’s ‘pertinent questions about widespread corruption’, Ali added that had ‘Bose been alive, he would have encouraged Kejriwal’. For Ali, AAP’s win could change the face of India.
