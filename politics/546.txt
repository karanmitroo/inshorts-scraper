Sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran on Friday took oath as an independent MLA in the Tamil Nadu Assembly after winning the bypolls from late CM Jayalalithaa's RK Nagar constituency. Fourteen former AIADMK MLAs, disqualified for supporting TTV Dhinakaran, were also present at the ceremony. The election was earlier scheduled for April but was cancelled over bribery and corruption.
