Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Saturday claimed that the BJP would not come to power if the 2019 Lok Sabha polls were held using ballot paper instead of electronic voting machines (EVMs). She alleged that government machinery was "misused" in the urban local body polls. The BJP won 14 mayoral seats in the civic polls, while BSP won two.
