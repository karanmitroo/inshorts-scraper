Stating that the entire northeast seems to support the BJP, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said the party's efforts will now create a "Vaampanth Mukt Bharat" (leftism-free India). This comes after early trends showed BJP leading in Tripura. Crediting BJP President Amit Shah for the party's performance, Prasad said Kerala remained the only state ruled by the Left.
