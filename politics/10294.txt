Led by party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Friday protested outside Parliament House against Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti's derogatory remark. Wearing black mask along with other Congress MPs, Rahul said, "The attitude of govt is not to allow democratic process in the House." "The opposition is not being allowed to speak. We are being stopped," he added.
