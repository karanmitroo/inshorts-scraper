Right-wing organisation Hindu Janajagruti Samiti on Wednesday held an â€˜All India Hindu Convention' and demanded to ban convent schools in Goa, as they do not allow Hindu students to follow religious traditions. It also called for a nation-wide ban on cow slaughter. The convention was attended by representatives of Hindu organisations from 22 states and also from Bangladesh and Nepal.
