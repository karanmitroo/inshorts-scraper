The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused urgent hearing for a petition which seeks a CBI case against Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi over his citizenship row. “There is no urgency in the matter,” stated a bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy earlier accused Gandhi of declaring himself a British citizen in a company's paperwork.
