BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma has termed Samajwadi Party's infighting a "scripted drama" to divert people's attention from the state government's "all-round failures". Adding that UP government has not fulfilled its promises, Sharma blamed UP CM Akhilesh Yadav for the "deteriorating law and order" in the state. People voted SP to power as they were angry with Mayawati, Sharma alleged.
