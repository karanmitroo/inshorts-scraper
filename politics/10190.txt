Shiv Sena on Wednesday demanded Bharat Ratna for its founder Bal Thackeray, after the govt announced the country's highest civilian award for ex-PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and freedom fighter Madan Mohan Malaviya. Sena, a BJP ally, said, while it was heartening to see that Vajpayee would be conferred with Bharat Ratna, Bal Thackeray should also be given the same award.
