Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asked the BJP why it was "searching for beef-eaters in every house" instead of declaring India a Hindu nation and implementing a Uniform Civil Code. Thackeray cited the killing of two Dalit children in Faridabad, saying, "after such an incident, one of our BJP ministers makes a statement that equates Dalits with dogs.”
