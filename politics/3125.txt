The Manipur Police on Friday recovered a hand grenade and a bomb in the state where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be addressing an election rally on Saturday. The recovery comes even as an apex body of six rebel groups in Manipur has given a call for a "complete shutdown" in the state tomorrow to protest against Modi's visit.
