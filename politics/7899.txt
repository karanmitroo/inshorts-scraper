Former Chhattisgarh CM Ajit Jogi on Monday wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking permission to file a defamation case against his party's state President Bhupesh Baghel. Baghel had threatened to expel Jogi's son if he cannot explain the 2014 poll-fixing phone recordings that were found recently. "He has defamed my character without any investigation of the tapes", Jogi wrote.
