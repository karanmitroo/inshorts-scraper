In a security review of 327 VIPs, the government has removed the cover of several former UPA ministers and downgraded many others. 'Z' category security provided to former information and broadcasting minister Manish Tewari and former coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal has been removed. However, none from the NDA has suffered such a consequence.
