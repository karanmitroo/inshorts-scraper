Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, during a pre-election tour of Assam, on Monday 
claimed that the BJP lost the Bihar elections despite instigating “Hindus against Muslims” and trying "so many tricks", and would "meet the same fate" in Assam. He accused the BJP of playing divisive politics on religious lines rather that having “issues of development and peace in mind".
