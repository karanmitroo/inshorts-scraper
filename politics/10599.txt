Senior BJP leader LK Advani in Ahmedabad on Thursday praised Narendra Modi as PM but said there has been no other Prime Minister like Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the history of India.  Notably, Advani had opposed Modi's elevation as the BJP campaign committee chief and declaration as the PM candidate. However, he praised Modi on many occasions later.
