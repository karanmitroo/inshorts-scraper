Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has denied claims by Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia that his upcoming film Indu Sarkar, set in the backdrop of the Emergency in India, is "fully sponsored" by a certain organisation and individual. Madhur added, "I don't know how he (Scindia) made such a comment without knowing the facts. I am known to make movies which are topical."
