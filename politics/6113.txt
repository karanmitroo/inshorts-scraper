Goa-based former Chennai Super Kings spinner Shadab Jakati has joined Goa Forward, a regional political party in the poll-bound state. Announcing the decision on Twitter, Jakati said he plans to bring the ethos of the "gentleman's game" to the field of politics. The spinner will reportedly contest the polls from South Goa's Dabolim legislative assembly constituency in 2017.
