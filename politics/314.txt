BJP leaders must practice what they preach and drink cow urine every day, former Uttarakhand Chief Minister and Congress leader Harish Rawat has said. Accusing the BJP of spreading communal tension across India in the name of cow protection, the former CM said, "All BJP workers should take a pledge that they will start consuming 'gau mutra' (cow urine) everyday."
