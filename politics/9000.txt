An article in RSS mouthpiece 'Organiser' on Sunday alleged that prestigious institutes like IITs were being turned into places for 'anti-India' and 'anti-Hindu' activities. Citing incidents like serving non-vegetarian food at IIT Roorkee "in the holy city of Haridwar" and stopping NIT Rourkela students from holding Puja in the community hall, RSS blamed the Left and Congress for the same.
