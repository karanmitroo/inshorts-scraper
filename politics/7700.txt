Criticising the Bihar government, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan on Saturday said that the only option left for Bihar is President's rule as the government has failed at every step. Citing the recent murder of the LJP leader Brijnath Singh in Patna, Paswan said that the CM and Deputy CM are unable to provide a sense of security.
