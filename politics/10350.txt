On the occasion of his birthday, German ambassador Michael Steiner is organizing a satsang on Friday, and has invited HRD Minister Smriti Irani. However, he denied there being any connection between his satsang invite, and the Sanskrit-language debate raging on in the country. The ‘satsang’ on the occasion will be delivered by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.
