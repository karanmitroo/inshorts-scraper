The BJP is likely to release the list of candidates for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections on Monday, after a meeting of the party's Central Election Committee. Leaving some seats for its ally Akali Dal, the party is likely to contest for majority of the seats. Also, it is likely to go without a CM candidate this time.
