Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday rejected the opposition charges of "jungle raj" in the state and claimed that "rule of law" prevailed in Bihar. He was referring to the action taken against JD(U) MLA Sarfaraz Alam for abusing a couple in a train. He said his government believes in equality before law, and that no lawbreakers will be spared.
