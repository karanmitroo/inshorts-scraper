CCTV footage from Gujarat's The Ummed Hotel reportedly shows Patidar leader Hardik Patel walking outside Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's room. This comes after Patel denied reports about meeting Gandhi in the poll-bound state. Terming the release of the footage as an "infringement of Right to Privacy", Patel accused the BJP of "snooping" on him.
