The YSR Congress on Sunday suffered a huge blow after two of its elected MPs - SPY Reddy and Butta Renuka - decided to go over to Jaganmohan Reddy's political rival, the Telugu Desam Party. However, they won't formally resign from the YSR Congress since formal admission into the TDP would attract automatic disqualification, and they will have to re-contest.
