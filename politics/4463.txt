PM Narendra Modi on Friday addressed BJP MPs at the party's parliamentary meeting and said, "For Congress, the party is above the country but for the BJP, India's interests are supreme." Modi further said, "Earlier, the opposition would unite against the government over 2G and Coalgate scams, but now it's up against government's steps to curb black money and corruption."
