BSP chief Mayawati on Sunday dared Akhilesh Yadav-led UP government to go for mid-term elections if it was so confident of its performance in the state. Attacking the Chief Minister, Mayawati said that Uttar Pradesh has become 'Crime Pradesh' ever since Akhilesh became the head of the government. Speaking at a press conference, she also criticised NDA government's Land Bill.
