Surendra Jain, joint general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, on Wednesday asked music composer AR Rahman to do 'ghar-wapsi' and re-convert to Hinduism. "The Hindu society is waiting for its son. We will... ensure that no harm is done to him", Jain said. Recently, a fatwa was issued against Rahman for composing music for a film on Prophet Muhammed.
