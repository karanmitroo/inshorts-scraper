Trinamool Congress (TMC) has released a statement saying that the party's MPs will not attend the first two days of the Parliament's upcoming Budget Session as a protest against the demonetisation decision. Further, TMC said it will take up the "illegal" arrest of its MPs, Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Tapas Paul, over the Rose Valley chit fund scam in the session.
