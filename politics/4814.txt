Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi on Saturday said the idea of holding General and Assembly elections simultaneously is a "beautiful concept", but a variety of issues need to be addressed before implementing it. Stressing on bringing transparency in elections, Quraishi also claimed that money required to fight polls leads to corruption as 80% of the funding is in cash.
