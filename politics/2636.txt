Former Cong MP Hanumantha Rao was detained on Saturday for protesting over the FIR lodged against him. "This is a conspiracy against me. I am from a backward class and, therefore, they are trying to put pressure on me. I did not say anything wrong," Rao claimed. Rao was allegedly caught on video misbehaving with a policeman.
