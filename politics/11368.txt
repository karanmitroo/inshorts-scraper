A sting operation by Cobrapost allegedly exposes how police refused to act against rioters during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, partly because they wanted to be on the right side of the Congress government of the day. Among the more shocking revelations is that messages were broadcast directing police not to take action against rioters shouting slogans of "Indira Gandhi zindabad".
