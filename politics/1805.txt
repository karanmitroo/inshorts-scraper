Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday called the NDA-promoted International Yoga Day a "publicity stunt", saying the Bihar government would not participate in it. "I am not against Yoga Day but I don't like publicity stunts. I also do yoga but have never advertised it," said Nitish. International Yoga Day will be celebrated on June 21 for the third time.
