Actor Prakash Raj, while clarifying his earlier statement that actors becoming political leaders is a disaster, tweeted, "This is what I said...Actors should not enter into politics only because they are popular." His note further read, "(Actors) should come with a clear perception of the issues facing the country...And we should not vote as fans. But as responsible citizens."
