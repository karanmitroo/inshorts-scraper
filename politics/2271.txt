RSS ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said Muslims in India have realised that even Allah doesn't want an "impure" mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya. The 15th-century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshipped one God, he said. Allah never accepted the structure, he added.
