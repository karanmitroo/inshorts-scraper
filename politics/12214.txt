In an appeal to the honest officers, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said, "We would give such officers good position in our government, and take their help to make strategies. I also appeal to those honest officers (to contact me) who have been suspended, and their pension, medical and other dues have not been cleared so far."
