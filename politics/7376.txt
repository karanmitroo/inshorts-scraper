BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Sunday escaped unhurt after a makeshift stage collapsed at a welcome function organised by local MP Sarvesh Kumar in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. The collapse was reportedly due to overcrowding of Varun's followers on the stage. Varun, who also turned 36 today, had halted at the function before moving on to interact with farmers in Chhajlet.
