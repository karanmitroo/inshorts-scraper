Reacting to his party's defeat in Punjab, ex-Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal said, "It's like if someone eats too much, he ends up vomiting. So we actually gave people too much to eat". "Our value will be known when there will be a drought for five years. The difference between good and bad isn't known until acknowledged," he added.
