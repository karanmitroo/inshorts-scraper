Urging voters to vote in favour of AAP, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that even ex-CM Sheila Dikshit's 15-year rule cannot match the work done by his government in the last two years. He further said that the power and water departments will be "snatched" from the Delhi government if BJP is voted to power again.
