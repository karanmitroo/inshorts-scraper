Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said, "PM Narendra Modi has said that the government was taking steps to double farmers' income by 2022, and if we fail to do so then you can kick the BJP out of power." He added that farmers comprise more than 50% of India's population and unless they prosper the country cannot become prosperous.
