CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Thursday said that the sting operation, which showed TMC members allegedly taking bribes, was 'political' "match-fixing" between the BJP and TMC. "Why are they avoiding the investigation? That is why we said in the Parliament yesterday that the central leadership is doing match fixing with the TMC in Bengal," Yechury said.
