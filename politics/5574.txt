BSP supremo Mayawati on Sunday said Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Yadav was being made a "sacrificial" goat" by SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav. "Shivpal has been made SP state president... to save son Akhilesh's image after 2017 defeat, which is certain," she added. "The entire family drama ended in such a way that it appeared it was scripted," Mayawati said.
