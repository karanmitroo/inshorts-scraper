Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Thursday said that the Dayashankar Singh episode, wherein the latter had compared the former to a prostitute, was pre-planned by the BJP. She alleged that it was BJP's conspiracy to "divert the attention of Dalits from the Una episode in Gujarat where youths were mercilessly beaten up in the name of Gau-Raksha (cow-protection)".
