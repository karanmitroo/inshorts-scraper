According to sources, the holy city of Varanasi, which Narendra Modi said would assume the status of Rashtra Guru, is likely to house a "mini PMO". "In days to come, the city will have a mini-PMO to look after the works and plans in the PM's constituency," said mayor Ramgopal Mohale, a day after Modi's thanksgiving visit.
