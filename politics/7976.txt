Congress spokesperson Sukhpal Singh Khaira joined AAP's Punjab unit on Friday and criticised Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for handing over the "reins of the party" to party leader Captain Amarinder Singh. Khaira said that Rahul "compromised on party principles" and called Amarinder Singh as “tired, corrupt and feudal”. He alleged that Congress and the Akalis have a "secret understanding".
