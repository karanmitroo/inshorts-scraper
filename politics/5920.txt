The Trinamool Congress (TMC) trade union on Monday came under fire for allegedly organising a 'vulgar' dance programme during an Independence Day celebration in Kolkata. The incident came to light after the event got aired by several TV channels. In response, the TMC leadership slammed the organisers of the programme and said they will be shunted out of the party.
