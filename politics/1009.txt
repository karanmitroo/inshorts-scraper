President Ram Nath Kovind's speech praising Tipu Sultan was his own, and not prepared by the Karnataka government, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said. His statement came in response to BJP's allegations that the Congress "forced" President Kovind to praise Tipu Sultan. The President had referred to Tipu Sultan as a "pioneer" in the development of Mysore rockets in his speech.
