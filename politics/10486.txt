Condemning the attack on former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru in an article of RSS mouthpiece Kesari, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Sanghvi Friday called it "disgusting and reprehensible". Further, he said, "It is time that people understand the true face of the RSS and the BJP. It is even more unfortunate that backers of such people are in power".
