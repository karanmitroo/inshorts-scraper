West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's first election rally with Anna Hazare in Delhi ended up as a disappointing solo act, as the activist was absent from the venue (Ramlila Maidan), reportedly for health reasons. Anna's no-show is being seen as a huge embarrassment for Banerjee, who had counted on him for her Lok Sabha polls campaign.
