The Supreme Court today exempted Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi from personal appearance in the National Herald case. The apex court, however, refused stay on the proceedings of the trial court. The Gandhis had earlier moved the Supreme Court against an order that asked the duo to appear in a trial court on February 20.
