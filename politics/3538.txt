BJP MP Hema Malini on Saturday criticised the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh for hampering development work in her constituency Mathura. "The proposals we send from Mathura either get stuck at Lucknow or are worked upon at a very slow pace," she alleged. For better coordination, state and central government should be led by same party, she added.
