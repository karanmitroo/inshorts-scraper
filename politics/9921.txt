Congress has questioned the timing of S Jaishankar's appointment as India's new ambassador to the United States. Senior Congress leader Manish Tewari quizzed the sudden replacement of Sujatha Singh whose tenure was abruptly "curtailed" by the govt 8-months ahead of her retirement. He stated that Jaishankar's appointment immediately after US President Barack Obama's visit wasn't mere "coincidence".
