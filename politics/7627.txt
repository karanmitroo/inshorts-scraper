Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Wednesday called the 'Make in India Week' a "show off" organised by the BJP to cover its failures at the Centre and the state. Terming it as a land grabbing tool, he said it would fail like the 'Vibrant Gujarat' model. He alleged that only 3% of the MoUs signed during 'Vibrant Gujarat' were realised.
