Congress MP Hanumantha Rao on Wednesday denied making any "anti-national elements" references in his letter to the HRD ministry and blamed Union Minister Smriti Irani for unnecessarily linking him to the Hyderabad Dalit scholar suicide. Rao said his letter only mentioned on campus suicides, corruption, caste discrimination and irregularities and that the HRD had not responded to it.
