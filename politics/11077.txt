The Congress' central leadership has turned down Tarun Gogoi's offer to resign from the Assam chief minister's post, taking full responsibility for his failure to stop the BJP's forward march in the Lok Sabha polls. Mr Gogoi, Assam's CM for 13 years, met Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in the capital on Thursday evening to tender his resignation.
