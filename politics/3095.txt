Expelled Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has equated PM Narendra Modi with Lord Krishna and blamed the Opposition for creating hurdles in development works being carried out by the PM. Lord Krishna, who was born in Mathura, is worshipped as Dwarkadheesh by Gujarati brothers and Modi, a native of Gujarat, preferred to contest General Election from UP, said Singh.
