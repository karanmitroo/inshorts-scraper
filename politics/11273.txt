In a major embarrassment to the Congress, senior Himachal Pradesh Congress leader Major Vijay Singh Mankotia’s brother Ajay Singh joined the BJP on Saturday. “I am a separate person and he (Major) is a separate one, we are free to choose any ideology,” Ajay said. He was inducted into the party by BJP leader of Dharamsala, Kishan Kapoor.
