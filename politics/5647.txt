Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Sunday said AAP will not accept the resignation of its legislator Amanatullah Khan, against whom molestation charges were levelled by his sister-in-law and an FIR was registered. Sisodia added, “Whatever is happening with Khan is his family’s internal matter.” Notably, Khan had earlier been arrested in July on charges of molestation.
