Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has claimed the NDA-led central government is planning to introduce a law for controlling and regulating social media. Stating that the regulation would hamper the freedom of expression, Raut said the Shiv Sena would oppose the law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi won the 2014 general elections because of social media support, Raut added.
