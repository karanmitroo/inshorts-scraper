A Guwahati businessman named Arun Pathak has lodged an FIR against BJP's CM candidate Kiran Bedi and four other party functionaries, for describing people from the northeast as immigrants in the party's vision document. "The word immigrant cannot be a spelling mistake. The document was surely printed after being proofed. This is a racial offence," Pathak said.
