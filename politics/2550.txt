Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Bagga on Sunday filed a complaint against former AAP leader Prashant Bhushan for his 'derogatory' tweet against Lord Krishna. "At times he says Kashmir should be given to Pakistan and at times he...says the Bharatiya Sena rapes," Bagga said. The complaint mentioned that Bhushan has hurt religious sentiments and demanded a probe in this regard.
