Following the BJP's defeat in the Assembly elections in Bihar, four veteran party leaders – LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and Shanta Kumar – on Tuesday attacked the party's central leadership. The party was being “forced to kow-tow to a handful” and its “consensual character has been destroyed,” the leaders said in a statement.
