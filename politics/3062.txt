BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj on Tuesday said whether it's "Kabristan" (graveyard) or "Shamshan" (cremation ground) everyone should be cremated and there's no need to bury anyone. There are 2-2.25 crore seers in India who would opt for "Samadhi" (mausoleum) and 20 crore Muslims would need grave, where will they get that much space in "Hindustan", he further asked.
