Following the lowering of GST rates on 178 mass consumption products, Congress leader P Chidambaram claimed that the government was forced to heed the advice of the Opposition on flaws in GST implementation due to the upcoming Gujarat elections. "Congress is vindicated. I am vindicated. The merit of capping GST at 18% is now recognised," he added.
