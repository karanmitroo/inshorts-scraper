Nagaland has never elected a woman MLA in the 54 years of its statehood and through its 12 Assembly elections. Of the 195 candidates contesting the 60-member Assembly elections on February 27, five are women candidates. The only woman parliamentarian Nagaland ever had is Rano Shaiza, a United Democratic Party member who was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1977.
