Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday criticised the Gandhi family for continuously disrupting sessions in the Parliament. Modi alleged that there are leaders of opposition parties who want the Parliament sessions to run but 'one family' does not allow it. The PM also said that the Congress is taking ‘revenge’ after they lost in the Lok Sabha elections.
