The Shiv Sena has asked the Centre to reveal the number of soldiers martyred at the borders post demonetisation. The Akhnoor attack proves that demonetisation hasn't deterred the terrorists, it further claimed. "Terrorists once used to attack public places, but are now directly targeting Army bases and killing jawans. Should this be considered a change?" Sena said in its mouthpiece.
