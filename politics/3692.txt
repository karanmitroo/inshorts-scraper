Veteran journalist and former ABVP General Secretary Ram Bahadur Rai questioned the role of BR Ambedkar in framing the Constitution of India and termed it as a 'myth'. According to him, Ambedkar's role was "limited" since he only "corrected the language" of whatever was provided to him by Sir Benegal Narsing Rau, an Indian diplomat.
