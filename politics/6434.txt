Congress workers were detained on Sunday while trying to enforce a bandh in Allahabad to protest PM Narendra Modi's visit later in the day. They had asked people to observe the day as 'Feku Diwas' and were detained when they allegedly violated security restrictions. Meanwhile, some Congress activists set fire to an effigy of Modi before police chased them away.
