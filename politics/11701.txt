Congress' hunt for a celebrity candidate from Varanasi to contest against Narendra Modi, appears to have come to an end with Sachin Tendulkar (party's Rajya Sabha member) having refused to bite the bait. The party is now expected to throw its weight behind local candidate Ajay Rai. However, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said he is willing to contest against Modi.
