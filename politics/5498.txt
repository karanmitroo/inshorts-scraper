The BJP on Sunday alleged that workers of Hindu outfits are being "targeted" in Tamil Nadu. This comes after a member of the Hindu Munnani, a religious organisation, was attacked by unidentified assailants on September 22. The BJP alleged that despite the functionary seeking protection following a life threat, the police failed to provide him any, resulting in his murder.
