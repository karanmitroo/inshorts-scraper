West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday refused to take the blame for the collapse of a Kolkata flyover claiming at least 18 lives and leaving several injured. The "construction began on [the] flyover in 2008, during CPM time...", Mamata claimed. Responding to the opposition demand for a CBI inquiry, she said her main focus was rescuing the trapped.
