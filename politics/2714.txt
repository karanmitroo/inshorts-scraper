RJD chief Lalu Prasad has asked senior Bihar BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi to wear a saffron robe, pierce his ears and shave his head to look like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Claiming that by doing so he may derive benefits from the party, Lalu further mocked him for not being invited to Adityanath's swearing-in ceremony.
