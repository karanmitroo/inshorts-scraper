The RSS on Tuesday criticised the TMC government over a decline in Hindu population in West Bengal and further accused it of encouraging anti-national elements due to its Muslim vote bank politics. "The Hindu population in the state, which constituted 78.45% in 1951 had declined to 70.54% as per the 2011 census," it stated.
