JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi has slammed West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for indirectly terming Bihar CM Nitish Kumar as 'gaddar' (traitor) and advised her to "behave like 'didi' (sister), not 'dada' (bully)". Protesting against demonetisation in Bihar, Banerjee had said that all opposition parties must unite over the issue and someone who betrays will not be forgiven.
