Calling PM Narendra Modi 'superficial', Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi today alleged that Modi was leading the "poisonous campaign" of dividing the Hindus and Muslims during the assembly polls. Rahul said that Modi and the RSS use this divisive policy to win elections. He further criticised Modi for his eschewed views on the MGNREGA scheme and 'superficiality' about the Naga Accord.
