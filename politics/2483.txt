Amid controversy over Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) tampering in elections, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the parties who lost in elections have added a new dimension to EVMs, where it means 'Every Vote Modi'. "You press any button, vote goes to Modi." Naidu jokingly remarked.  Further, he questioned if EVMs were manipulated, why didn't it happen in Punjab or Delhi.
