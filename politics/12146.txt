Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia's plan to reserve 90% seats for Delhi-students in 12 DU colleges, which are fully funded by the state-government, has been slammed by the DU teachers and students. The Delhi University Teachers Association said that it is a Central University and the state cannot make changes in the reservation-policies of its colleges.
