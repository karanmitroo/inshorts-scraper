BJP MLA Sangeet Som has reportedly described the 2017 UP Assembly election as a fight between India and Pakistan. Som was addressing a gathering in Meerut when he was caught on camera making these remarks. However, when Samajwadi Party leader Atul Pradhan said he has planned to lodge a complaint against him, Som alleged that the video was doctored.
