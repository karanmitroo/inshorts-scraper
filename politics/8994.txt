Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has alleged that the Centre changed the head of the city government's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) as it was worried that a case would be filed against a central minister. Earlier on June 8, Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung had abruptly replaced AAP-nominated SS Yadav with MK Meena as the ACB chief.
