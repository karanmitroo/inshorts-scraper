Overturning CM Kejriwalâ€™s request, the home ministry retracted its decision to appoint IPS officer Praveer Ranjan as the chief of Delhi government's anti-corruption bureau. Ranjan's appointment had been cleared on request of Kejriwal but the move to revisit the decision comes due to AAP-Centre confrontation. The reason for the conflict was CM's demand for the suspension of four police officials.
