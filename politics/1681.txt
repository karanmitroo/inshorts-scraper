While speaking in the Rajya Sabha about cow vigilantism, Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agrawal linked the names of Hindu Gods with alcohol, following which Rajya Sabha members raised slogans demanding an apology from him. Ordering that the statement be removed from records, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien said Agrawal should not have made these "derogatory" remarks.
