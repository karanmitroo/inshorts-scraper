Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar has claimed that senior BJP leader late Gopinath Munde wanted to join Congress, but ex-PM Manmohan Singh advised him not to split BJP in such a manner. "Munde, the then Deputy Leader in Lok Sabha, was ready to join Congress, along with legislators like Pasha Patel, Madhuri Misal, Prakash Shendge, Pankaja Munde," he added.
