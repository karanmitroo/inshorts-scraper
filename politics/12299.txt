After its stellar performance in recently concluded assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday decided to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The party core group decided to appoint a committee, headed by Yogendra Yadav and Sanjay Singh, to draw up a road-map for the polls. However, it is unlikely that  it will contest from all 543 seats.
