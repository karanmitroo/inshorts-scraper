In its mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Shiv Sena has called Congress President Rahul Gandhi's recent visit to Hindu and Muslim religious places in Karnataka as a strategy of 'soft Hinduism'. "If Congress accepts and propagates Hinduism, then BJP will not be left with any counter-issue," Sena claimed. It also criticised the parties for hurting people's religious sentiments just to win elections.
