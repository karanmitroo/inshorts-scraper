Protesting against the recent beheading of two Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir, the Congress in Goa on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “56-inch chest” has now shrunk to 56 mm. Moreover, Goa Mahila Congress President Sunita Verenkar said, “We are sad that we don’t have a full-time defence minister. The defence minister we had has fled to Goa."
