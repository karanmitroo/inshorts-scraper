Congress leader Shashi Tharoor Thursday said that he was impressed by PM Narendra Modi when he congratulated him after winning the Lok Sabha elections. "I didn't expect him(Modi) to reach out and that's why I was very impressed. I was surprised because Modi had not shown signs of reconciliation with an opponent before that," Tharoor added.
