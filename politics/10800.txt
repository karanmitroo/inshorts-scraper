The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the National Judicial Appointments Commission bill, 2014, which will scrape the collegium system of appointing Supreme Court and high court judges. This bill which was passed by voice vote, will further ensure that seniority along with "ability" and "merit" be considered for elevation for judges, according to law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.
