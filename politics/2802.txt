Responding to the ongoing controversy over the security of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), social activist Anna Hazare on Wednesday said, "The world is progressing at a fast rate and here we are discussing of going back in time to ballot papers." Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had alleged that EVM tampering led to AAP's poor performance in Punjab.
