Aam Aadmi Party's Political Action Committee on Friday removed the party's Punjab Convener Sucha Singh Chotepur as the Punjab Convener over a video allegedly showing Chotepur receiving a bribe. AAP officials said the matter has been forwarded to the party's disciplinary committee. The 65-year-old had reportedly agreed to accept the money but insisted it was for party funds.
