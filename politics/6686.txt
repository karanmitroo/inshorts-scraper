Days after BJP leader Subramanian Swamy wrote to PM Narendra Modi seeking the immediate removal of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, the Congress party today said Swamy's real target is Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. "RBI Governor is just an excuse", the party added. Swamy had accused Rajan of wrecking India's economy and claimed that Rajan is "mentally not fully Indian".
