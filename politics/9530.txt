Congress-led Karnataka government Thursday declined to hold a CBI inquiry into the death of 36-year-old IAS officer DK Ravi, despite an offer made by the Centre, saying the state police is "perfectly capable" of handling the case. Union Minister Rajnath Singh had earlier said that the Centre was ready for a CBI investigation if the state government asked for it.
