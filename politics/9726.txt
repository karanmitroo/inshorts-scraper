Amid the ongoing political crisis in Bihar, JDU leader Nitish Kumar Tuesday admitted that appointing Jitan Ram Manjhi as the state CM was his 'mistake'. Manjhi was made the CM of Bihar after Nitish resigned from the post claiming the responsibility for his party's loss in 2014 general elections. "Whatever happened is before everyone...all humans commit mistake," Nitish said.
