Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah on Sunday asserted that neither India could take back PoK nor could Pakistan take India's Kashmir. The solution to the problem lies in dialogue between the two countries, he added. Abdullah said the people who call him "anti-national" are the same who once appreciated him for "defending the nation in the United Nations".
