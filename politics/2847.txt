Despite its landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh, BJP-led NDA will not see any net gain in its Rajya Sabha numbers in 2017. The alliance, however, will gain about 11 seats in 2018 while the UPA will lose 11 seats in the Rajya Sabha elections across 19 states. The four new nominated members will have the choice to join any party.
