Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has said, "The Prime Minister and his party should be ready for the real earthquake on March 11 that will clear all the misconceptions." This comes after PM Narendra Modi's earthquake jibe over Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's "seva in scam" remark. Notably, the Assembly election results of five states will be out on March 11.
