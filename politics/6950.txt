Tamil actor 'Powerstar' Srinivasan on Monday joined the BJP, with the Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu less than a month away. Srinivasan, besides being an actor, was in the news when he was arrested in New Delhi in June 2013 for allegedly duping a businessman. This comes after Tamil actress Namitha joined campaign activities for the ruling AIADMK on Saturday.
