Former Army chief Gen VK Singh has issued a legal notice to Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, threatening to drag him to court over alleged "failure" to act upon his complaints of "sedition and treason" against certain individuals. The retired General, who joined BJP today, called it "â€¦ a serious matter that has direct implications on India's national security."
