PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said it was in the interest of the Congress party to be "Congress-mukt (free of Congress)". He explained that the "Congress-mukt Bharat" slogan was not aimed at the opposition party but against the culture of casteism, corruption, and exploitation that had become symbolic with the Congress. "It's necessary for a healthy democracy," he added.
