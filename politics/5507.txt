Former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has said that the Centre will not scrap the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan. "Will stick my neck out and say that nothing will happen to the Indus Water Treaty. It survived four wars and a J&K assembly unanimous resolution," he added. This comes a day after the Centre 'hinted' at revisiting the pact.
