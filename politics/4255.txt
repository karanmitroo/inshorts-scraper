UP Minister Azam Khan on Friday said the bad blood between members of the ruling family will add a dark chapter to its history. "I’m in a state of extreme shock and pain," he added. In a veiled attack on Amar Singh, Khan said, "A single person’s conspiracy and nefarious intention have put the state up for auction".
