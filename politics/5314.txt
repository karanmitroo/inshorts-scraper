Congress on Sunday alleged that the Republican US Presidential nominee Donald Trump is learning the 'jumla' way to woo the Indian-American community. "His previous statements on India and against Indians clearly prove his mentality," it said. Congress was reacting to Trump saying the Indian and Hindu community would have a true friend in the White House if he gets elected.
