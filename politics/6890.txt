Actor Sanjay Dutt on Sunday turned up at an event organised by the BJP to mark Maharashtra Day and shared the stage with party leaders. "This is a classic case of anti-nationalism, which isn't new to the saffron party," a local Congress leader said. Notably, Sanjay's parents, Sunil Dutt and Nargis, along with his sister have been associated with Congress.
