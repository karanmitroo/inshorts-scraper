BJP leader in West Bengal Shyamapada Mondal has said state CM Mamata Banerjee has become a hijra (eunuch). "Mamata Banerjee is practising the politics of appeasement and indulging in theatrics," he said. "We cannot understand whether she's a man or a woman. I would say she has become a hijra as you see them on trains and buses," he added.
