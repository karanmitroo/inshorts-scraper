A video of former PM Manmohan Singh sharing stage with Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, one of the main accused in 1984 anti-Sikh riots, has surfaced online. Kumar, who is accused of inciting violence and making inflammatory speeches during the riots, was acquitted by a trial court in 2011. In 2016, a reinvestigation was ordered into his involvement in the riots.
