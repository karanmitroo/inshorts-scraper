The National Green Tribunal on Friday asked the Centre and the Haryana government to respond to a petition seeking that a fewer number of bikes participate in Amit Shah's rally in Jind. Around 1 lakh bikers are expected to take part in the rally scheduled for next week. The petitioner suggested that the state government employ bicycles in the rally.
