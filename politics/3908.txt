Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said his organisation is not "working against anyone" but only "working to unite the Hindu community and for its empowerment". Bhagwat said this during a rally in Kolkata, for which he had to obtain a permission from the Calcutta High Court. The city police had earlier denied him permission for the rally.
