Patidar leader Hardik Patel has said that only a chaiwala (tea seller) can ask unemployed youth to sell pakodas. This was in an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had once sold tea at a railway station. In a recent interview, PM Modi had said that earning â‚¹200 daily by selling pakoda is also a form of employment.
