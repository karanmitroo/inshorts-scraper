Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani on Thursday appealed to Rohith Vemula's mother Radhika Vemula to contest the 2019 elections and teach "Manusmriti Irani" a lesson in Parliament. Rohith had committed suicide in 2016 after being banned from Hyderabad Central University hostel for allegedly attacking an ABVP activist. His family had alleged that Minister Smriti Irani lied about his death in Parliament.
