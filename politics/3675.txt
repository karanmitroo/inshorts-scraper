Skier Devin Stratton recorded his accidental fall on his GoPro camera while skiing in Utah, United States, last week. Stratton had strapped his GoPro onto his helmet to capture his run when he approached a cliff and suffered a 150-feet free fall for over three seconds. Stratton thought he was going to be "dead for sure", but escaped with bruises.
