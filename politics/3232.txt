The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bill 2017, recently introduced in the Lok Sabha, has dropped the name of former PM Rajiv Gandhi from IIM Shillong's name. This is the first instance of the former PM's name being dropped from a leading education institution. The Bill aims to vestige greater autonomy and power to these institutions in granting degrees.
