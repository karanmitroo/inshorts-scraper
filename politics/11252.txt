In an embarrassment to the Congress, its candidate Vikram Madam (56) in Gujarat has conceded defeat to his BJP rival, who happens to be his niece Poonam Madam, even before the national election verdict on May-16. Vikram announced that he was losing by "30,000 votes" and even appealed to his supporters not to bet on poll results.
