Members of Rahul Gandhi’s Team returned fire Friday by reminding critical voices like ex-MP Milind Deora - who had raised question on Rahul and team’s leadership - that he had been part of the advisory circle too. "The truth is the defeat is a collective responsibility. How can you blame Rahul alone for it?" tweeted Youth Congress chief Rajiv Satav.
