As the Gujarat Assembly voted to fill the state's three Rajya Sabha seats on Tuesday, the Congress alleged that two of its MLAs were videographed showing their vote chits to BJP President Amit Shah which indicated cross-voting. Terming it as a violation of rules, the Congress moved the Election Commission with the complaint and sought that their votes be cancelled.
