BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday launched a campaign called ‘UP Ke Mann Ki Baat’  where voters’ feedback in the form of grievances and suggestions would be collected. He also flagged off 75 chariots, painted in party colours and enabled with LED, GPS and WiFi. Anyone can walk up to the chariot and get his suggestions video-recorded, Shah said.
