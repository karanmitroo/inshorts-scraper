The Modi government has treated Uttar Pradesh with “apathy and neglect” during its two-year rule, said BSP President Mayawati on Friday. She said the government seems to be failing to solve real problems people face such as inflation and unemployment among others. Mayawati also questioned PM Narendra Modi's alleged claim of working for the farmers in the state.
