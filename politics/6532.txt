During a hearing of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa’s disproportionate assets case, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said that acquiring of assets per se is not a crime unless their sources are illegal. This came after Karnataka challenged her acquittal by the state High Court. Earlier, Jayalalithaa had been accused of amassing disproportionate assets of ₹66.65 crore between 1991-1996.
