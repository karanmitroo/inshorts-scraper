AIADMK Minister RB Udhaya Kumar, while reacting to actor Kamal Haasan's demand for Tamil Nadu CM K Palaniswami's resignation, said he has some "mental disorder". "That's our conclusion...I think he wants to say something to the people but doesn't know how to say (it)," he added. Haasan had blamed the CM for all the "mishap and corruption" in Tamil Nadu.
