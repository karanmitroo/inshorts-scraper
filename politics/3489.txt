Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger son Prateek Yadav revealed that there was "immense pressure" on him to join the party in 2012 but he didn’t budge. "When people from Azamgarh wanted me to be a part of a political mainstream, I made it amply clear…I don’t have any political ambition," he added.
