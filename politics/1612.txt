Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar took oath as the Chief Minister of Bihar on Thursday, a day after resigning from the post due to a rift in the Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance. He had submitted a letter of support with 132 members' signatures, asking to form the government with the BJP as an ally. Kumar has two days to prove majority.
