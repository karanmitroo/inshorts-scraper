The Congress on Monday posted a video on Twitter with alleged examples of misogyny by PM Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders. The video included PM Modi's remark in Parliament over Congress leader Renuka Chowdhuryâ€™s laughter, him praising the Bangladeshi PM for having zero tolerance against terrorism despite being a woman, and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat terming marriage a "contract".
