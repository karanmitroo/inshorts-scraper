Delhi University student, Gurmehar Kaur, who had alleged she received rape threats over her campaign against ABVP, withdrew from a march on Tuesday stating she has been through a lot. "This is all my 20 year self could take. The campaign is about students, not about me. Please go to the march in huge numbers," said Kaur.
