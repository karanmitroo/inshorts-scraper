After supermodels from abroad were asked to remove scarves bearing Hindu symbols before entering the Taj Mahal, BJP leader Vijay Shivhare asked if Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath will be made to take off his saffron attire before entering the monument. "If saffron stoles are not permissible...then Muslims should also not be allowed to enter wearing skull caps," he added.
