Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday claimed that his government in the National Capital has worked harder than the previous Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government or PM Narendra Modi-led central government. "There is no such instance in the past that a government sacked its own minister found involved in corruption," he added citing that the AAP government had done so.
