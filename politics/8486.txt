Congress President Sonia Gandhi, while addressing a rally in Buxar (Bihar), on Saturday accused the BJP government of "moving away from democratic ideals" of India. "It is creating a serious threat for our democracy by imposing its ideology on the people. Communal tension is being created", Gandhi said. She added, "It is trying to weaken the foundation of social harmony".
