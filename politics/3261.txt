Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Singh Yadav has said that he will accept a ministerial berth in UP Cabinet if party President Akhilesh Yadav will offer him one after forming the government. "I never cared for positions. Be it Lohia or Gandhi, they never held any posts. The greatest thing in politics is to be with the people," he added.
