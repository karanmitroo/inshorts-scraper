Clashes emerged over train fare hike, after the BJP workers opposed Samajwadi Party (SP) workers for burning effigies of PM Narendra Modi in Lucknow. SP spokesperson Dan Bahadur Singh slammed the hike, saying it tantamount to "betrayal" of trust that the people of the country had placed in the BJP. SP workers also held protests in Varanasi and Allahabad.
