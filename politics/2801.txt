Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury has blamed party General Secretary Digvijaya Singh for the Congress' failure to secure a majority in Goa despite being the largest party in the hung state Assembly. Congress needed four MLAs' support to prove their majority while BJP needed eight. However, Manohar Parrikar-led BJP has now staked claim to form the government with 9 MLAs' support.
