A day after Chhattisgarh BJP leader Harish Verma was arrested for deaths of over 200 cows in one of his cowsheds, 90 cow carcasses were found on Saturday in two more cow shelters run by him. The fresh deaths were also allegedly caused due to starvation and lack of proper care. Verma has blamed the state government for the deaths.
