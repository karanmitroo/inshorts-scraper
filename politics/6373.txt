The Executive Council of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday gave its approval to rename the university's central library after BR Ambedkar, following demands from the RSS' student wing ABVP. The Left-groups active in the campus said the ABVP's demands were "ironic" as the BJP-led government is itself involved in "terrorising students who pursue Ambedkarite politics".
