Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya on Wednesday blamed the 'breaking India brigade' for the recent violent clashes in Maharashtra. He said it was the same group that had raised anti-national slogans in JNU in 2016. Adding that it wants to divide the country on basis of religion and caste, Vaidya said RSS strongly condemns and opposes such mentality.
