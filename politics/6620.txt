BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday called party President Sonia Gandhi the "unifying factor" in Congress and said without her Congress would have "disintegrated". "Dynasty is nasty in democracy but it is tasty to some people particularly Congress and its supporters. But the reality has to be accepted," he said. Sonia, however, has not succeeded as a leader, he added.
