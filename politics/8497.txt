The Shiv Sena workers have reportedly smeared black ink on the face of politician and columnist Sudheendra Kulkarni, who is slated to moderate Pakistan's former foreign minister Mahmud Kasuri's book launch on Monday. Earlier, the party had asked the Nehru planetarium in Mumbai to call off the event. However, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has assured "total security" for the same.
