Attempting to warn against 'love jihad', Durga Vahini, the women's wing of VHP, has sparked a controversy by using Kareena Kapoor's photo on the cover of its magazine, Himalay Dhwani. The cover features Kareena's face half covered with a veil. It is captioned: 'Dharmaantaran se Rashtraantaran' (Conversion of nationality by religious conversion). Kareena had married Saif Ali Khan in 2012.
