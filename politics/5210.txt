Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday equated the opposition parties with "terrorists". "They are trying to block every development project in the state. Now, you should think if there is any difference between them and the terrorists," he said. Naidu also alleged that YSR Congress was trying to create a rift between various castes in the state.
