HRD Minister Smriti Irani has asked Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi to return the farmers' land, acquired in the 80s to start a bicycle factory, to the UP State Industrial Development Corporation. During her Amethi visit, she said the 65-acre land, currently under the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust, be returned as the promised Samrat Cycle factory had not been built since.
