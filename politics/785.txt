Upon being asked if he would like to succeed PM Narendra Modi in future, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday recited a shloka which read, "I want that the affliction of all beings tormented by the miseries of life may cease". Incidentally, the same verse had earlier been recited by PM Modi in Parliament.
