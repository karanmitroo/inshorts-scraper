AAP MLA Jitender Singh Tomar, who is accused of forging his degrees, failed to give the common names of H2O (water) and NaCl (salt) when a team of teachers and cops quizzed him. Tomar had claimed to have studied B.Sc at Avadh University, Faizabad (UP). Furthermore, when asked about the types of chemistry taught in the college, Tomar said, "All chemistry is one chemistry."
