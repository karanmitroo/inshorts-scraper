Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackrey on Friday criticised the meeting between PM Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, calling it "an unfortunate event". â€œThe situation (between two countries) has not changed so far... I feel Mr. Modi is capable of changing the scene. I am not aware whether the government has learned anything from past incidents," Thackrey said.
