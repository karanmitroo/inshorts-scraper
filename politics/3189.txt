Accusing BSP supremo Mayawati of amassing ill-gotten wealth after demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said BSP's nature had changed to 'Behenji Sampatti Party'. Her problem with demonetisation was that she did not get enough time to prepare herself, he said. Modi added that he was surprised to see political rivals BSP and SP come together to oppose demonetisation.
