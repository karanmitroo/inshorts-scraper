Karnataka has asked the Supreme Court to review its decision to drop proceedings against late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case, saying it should recover a â‚¹100-crore fine over her estate's sale. The SC had earlier overturned a Karnataka High Court order giving a clean chit to Jayalalithaa, but abated charges against her due to her death.
