The Congress on Thursday called jeweller Nirav Modi, accused in Punjab National Bank's $1.77 billion scam, "chhota Modi". It also questioned how could the jeweller "dupe the entire banking system...under the nose of PM Narendra Modi-led government?" Slamming the government over Nirav "fleeing" the country, Congress said that "loot and run away is the new motto of this government".
