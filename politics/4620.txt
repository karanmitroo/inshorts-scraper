Speaking about his equation with late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said that the evil influence of Sasikala Natarajan ruined Jayalalithaa's faith in him. "She had total control over Jayalalithaa. Whenever we came together or had a political alliance, Sasikala would intervene and put a spanner into it," he added.
