AYUSH Minister Shripad Naik on Monday defended the decision of not inviting Vice President Hamid Ansari to the International Yoga Day event. "As per the law when the PM is the chief guest, we don't invite President and Vice President as guests," Naik said. The controversy arose after BJP leader Ram Madhav questioned Ansari's absence from the event.
