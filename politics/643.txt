Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, who is contesting the Gujarat Assembly elections from Vadgam constituency, on Sunday said the exit polls were fake and rubbish and called them "nonsense". Most of the exit polls have predicted that the BJP would secure a win in the elections. However, Mevani asserted the BJP would definitely lose the elections and not form the government.
