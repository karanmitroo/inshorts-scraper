BJP leader L Ganesan on Friday slammed DMK leader M Karunanidhi saying that those who did not accept Shiva, should not talk about Sanskrit since the language was born from Lord Shiva's "Udukkai" (drum). Notably, Karunanidhi had recently said, "We will not allow domination of Sanskrit not only in Tamil Nadu, but in any State. We will chase it away."
