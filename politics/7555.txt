Holding BJP leaders responsible, Rajya Sabha MP and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury on Friday said that deceased scholar Rohith Vemula was pushed to commit suicide. "Its virtually a murder," added Yechury. Yechury also claimed that the sole Dalit professor in the probe committee, for investigating Vemula's death, had handed in a dissent note and quit.
