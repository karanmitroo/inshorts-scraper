HRD Minister Smriti Irani on Thursday said the BJP stood with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, and rejected AAP's charges of financial misconduct against him. She said the BJP "condemns AAP’s malicious intention to deflect public attention from a corrupt official in Kejriwal’s office." The Serious Fraud Investigation Office found no evidence against Jaitley during a 2013 probe, she added.
