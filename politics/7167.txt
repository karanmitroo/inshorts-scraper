The Election Commission on Saturday directed that no political party, candidate, organisation or person should publish advertisements in the print media in poll-bound Assam and West Bengal on April 3 and 4, without prior clearance. This comes in the backdrop of the Commission imposing a ban on the publication of two advertisements by BJP during Bihar elections.
