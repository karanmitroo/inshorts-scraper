WB CM and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said that TMC and BJP ally Shiv Sena's leaders will meet President Pranab Mukherjee tomorrow over demonetisation. This comes after Banerjee met Sena's chief Uddhav Thackeray in connection with opposing Centre's move of banning high denomination notes. Common man's sufferings matter more than political differences, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said.
