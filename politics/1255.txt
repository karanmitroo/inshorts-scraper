The Madras High Court on Wednesday extended the stay order on a floor test in the Tamil Nadu Assembly until the court disposed of the petitions challenging the disqualification of 18 AIADMK MLAs. The MLAs, who support expelled party leader TTV Dhinakaran, challenged their expulsion under the anti-defection law arguing that they had not resigned or joined any other party.
