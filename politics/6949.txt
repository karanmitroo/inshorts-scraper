JD(U) leader KC Tyagi on Monday said that the declassification of files related to the attack on the Golden Temple during Operation Blue Star will give rise to terrorism. His statement came in reaction to Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal's demand for the files to be made public. Further, the Congress termed the demand as 'political move'.
