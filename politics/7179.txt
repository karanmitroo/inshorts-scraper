According to reports, PM Narendra Modi suggested the idea of holding simultaneous elections to panchayats, urban local bodies, states and the Parliament, at a BJP meeting earlier this month. Modi expressed concerns over parties spending too much time and money in electioneering, adding that his idea will give them more time to take the government's people-oriented programmes to the grassroots.
