CPI leader D Raja on Wednesday urged the Centre to consider the release of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case on humanitarian grounds. "It is a demand which has been raised by several political parties...because the convicts have spent 25 years in prison," Raja added. The Tamil Nadu government had also recently requested the Centre for their release.
