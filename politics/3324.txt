A masked man was on Monday handed over to the police for trespassing into former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK President Karunanidhi's residence and threatening his wife with a toy gun. "An unknown masked person, seemed like a trained criminal, entered into the premises...and threatened them with a gun point demanding cash," DMK leader Paranthaman said.
