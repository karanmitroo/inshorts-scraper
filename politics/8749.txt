The Central Government is reportedly likely to announce implementation of the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme on August 28, which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 war with Pakistan. Three ex-servicemen are on a fast-unto-death for the implementation of the scheme. The scheme has a uniform pension for servicemen of the same rank, irrespective of when they retired.
