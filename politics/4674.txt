Taking potshots at PM Narendra Modi's 'Fakir' remark, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has tweeted, "Fakir apni fakiri ka zikr nahi fikr karte hain" (Person who lives solely on alms doesn't talk about his penury, but worries about it). "Has any 'Fakir' ever said commerce is in my blood?", asked Lalu. On Saturday, PM Modi had called himself a 'Fakir'.
