The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi today refused to take responsibility for the rising Chikungunya cases in Delhi and reportedly blamed the Centre for snatching the power from AAP government. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is in Bengaluru for his throat surgery, said that he and his Cabinet ministers do not have the power to even buy a pen.
