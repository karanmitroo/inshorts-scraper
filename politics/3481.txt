Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, said that when someone looks for a sense of service and modesty in 'SCAM', the earth shakes. Modi said this in reference to Monday's earthquake in Uttarakhand while simultaneously slamming Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. Earlier, Rahul had said that SCAM stands for Seva (service), Courage, Ability, and Modesty.
