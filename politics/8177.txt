The CPI(M) on Thursday demanded reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the private sector. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury maintained that this was the best way to observe the anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution. "This is the least that the Parliament can do to carry forward Dr. BR Ambedkarâ€™s vision", he added.
