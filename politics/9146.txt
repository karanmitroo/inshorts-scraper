Rajasthan BJP MLA Bhawani Singh Rajawat sparked a row on Friday after he asked people not to wear helmets while riding motorcycles, stating that such protective gear help criminals to flee from police. He also termed the helmets as a burden over the head for the people, especially in the scorching heat. The opposition Congress has criticised his remarks strongly.
