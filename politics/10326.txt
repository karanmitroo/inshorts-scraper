Addressing a party rally in Kolkata on Sunday, BJP Chief Amit Shah launched a scathing attack on Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress, over the Burdwan blast and Saradha scam. He said they have to "uproot" the TMC from its turf as it would not allow PM Modi's development policies, "industry, employment and law and order", to reach Bengal under their regime.
