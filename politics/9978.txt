Criticizing his own party, senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi Wednesday praised PM Narendra Modi by calling his victory a victory of "Indianness". He also said that Modi’s elevation to power marked the beginning of a “new period”. “I don’t consider the election of 2014 as Modi and BJP’s victory, but it is the defeat of Congress,” he said criticizing Congress.
