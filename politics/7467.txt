BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Saturday 'advised' JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar to refrain from using freedom of speech and expression to hail terrorists like Afzal Guru, who attacked the Parliament in 2001. "Whatever is happening inside the JNU is condemnable. What is more condemnable is ... that the teachers of the university are also involved," Adityanath said.
