The Communist Party of India (CPI) on Sunday demanded a nation-wide ban on liquor and suggested that the Centre should come up with an ordinance in this regard. The CPI, which is in opposition in Tamil Nadu, will also be supporting a bandh on August 4 seeking the closure of liquor shops in the state.
