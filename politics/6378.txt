Quami Ekta Dal (QED), with two MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, merged with the ruling Samajwadi Party on Tuesday. "We have merged as we did not want to act like vote cutters in the (2017) Assembly polls," QED President Afzal Ansari said. The QED also called on other like-minded parties to unite against communal forces.
