Ruling Samajwadi Party MLA Kaptan Singh Rajput, who was convicted in a 2002 murder case, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Monday. Kaptan Singh, his brother and seven of their associates were booked in 2002 for the murder of Krishan Dubey in UP's Jalaun district. The seven other accused were, however, discharged by court due to lack of evidence.
