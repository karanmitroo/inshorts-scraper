The Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), an ally of the BJP, said on Friday the national party should contest only 102 of 243 seats and leave the rest for its partners in the upcoming Bihar elections. RLSP chief and Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha made this statement at a time when BJP president Amit Shah is on a two-day Patna visit.
