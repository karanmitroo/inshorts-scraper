Justifying the President's Rule in Uttarakhand, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said the government led by CM Harish Rawat was 'unconstitutional'. "There can be no better example of implementation of Article 356 (imposition of President's Rule)," added Jaitley claiming that the CM had lost majority on March 18 already. Meanwhile, the Congress termed the move a "murder of democracy".
