Overruling protests from party workers, the BJP Tuesday fielded former Army chief VK Singh from Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency. Singh will contest against AAP’s Shazia Ilmi and Congress’s Raj Babbar. BJP expects Singh's Rajput credentials to work in favour of consolidating the upper caste votes. The seat was vacated by sitting MP Rajnath Singh who moved to Lucknow.
