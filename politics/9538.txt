Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was summoned by a trial court as an accused in the coal scam case, Wednesday moved the Supreme Court challenging the order. The lower court had directed Singh to appear before it on April 8. Singh was allegedly involved in irregular allotment of Talabira-II coal block to a joint venture of Hindalco.
