Ahead of Gujarat Assembly elections, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said Congress had used "terrorists" in the past three elections in the state to target PM Narendra Modi. Congress used the entire government machinery during the 2007 and 2012 elections and misused the CBI, he added. Jaitley further said Congress was running a "strange" campaign by mocking development.
