The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday claimed that the CBI had registered a false disproportionate assets case against Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain after his residence was raided on Friday. Alleging that the investigation agency has become a political weapon of the BJP, AAP leaders claimed that CBI had 'failed' to recover any evidence against Jain.
