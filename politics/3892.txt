After meeting Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday officially joined the party. This comes after his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu said that he was likely to contest the assembly election from Amritsar East constituency. Sidhu, a former Rajya Sabha MP, had resigned from BJP last year and formed a new political outfit 'Awaaz-e-Punjab'.
