Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has said, "The biggest problem with the government is that they are doing nothing for job creation...a complete failure on job creation." Gandhi made the statement outside the Parliament after the President's address on the first day of the Budget Session. The Congress also questioned no revelation of data on demonetisation in the President's speech.
