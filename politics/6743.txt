BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday alleged that the UPA regime left "empty coffers" which has made it difficult for the NDA government to work for the poor. He further compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for foregoing LPG subsidy to that of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri's call for voluntarily giving up one meal to deal with food shortage.
