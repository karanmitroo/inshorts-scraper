Activist Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was formally launched on November 26, 2012. AAP was formed a year after the launch of India Against Corruption movement which was headed by activist Anna Hazare. While Hazare preferred not to enter into politics, Kejriwal went ahead to form AAP with few others. AAP won 67/70 seats in Delhi Assembly in 2015.
