Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday called off his protest after the lieutenant governor (LG) partially agreed to the demands. “The LG said two police officials whose suspension we had demanded are being sent on leave pending a judicial inquiry into the matter of negligence. Let’s end the protest here today. It is a victory of the people of Delhi,” Kejriwal said.
