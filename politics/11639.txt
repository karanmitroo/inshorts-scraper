Narendra Modi's maiden public meet in Gaya Thursday afternoon turned chaotic after overenthusiastic Modi supporters broke barricades to have a closer look at the BJP's PM candidate. As things got out of control, cops had to resort to a mild lathicharge to reign them. BJP leader Prem Kumar attributed the melee to unexpected crowd response and tactless handling by cops.
