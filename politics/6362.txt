The Ludhiana police has arrested Shiv Sena’s Punjab Youth President Amit Arora for “orchestrating” an attack on himself in February. Arora had earlier said he was shot at by two people, but a forensics probe found the claims to be untrue. Later, Arora reportedly confessed that he planned the attack to get “an escort vehicle…fame, and higher position in Shiv Sena”.
