Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Friday termed BJP President Amit Shah and BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate for state Assembly elections BS Yeddyurappa as "former jail birds". This was in response to Shah's tweet, which claimed that "corruption" and "Siddaramaiah" were synonyms. While Yeddyurappa was sent to judicial custody in 2011, Shah was arrested in 2010 in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case.
