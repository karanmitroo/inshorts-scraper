BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi on Sunday threatened to deport Bangladeshi immigrants after May-16, if NDA comes to power. "If people from Bihar come, they seem to be outsiders to you; but if some Bangladeshi comes, your face seems to shine," he said alleging that Mamata Banerjee was insulting the people of the country for the sake of votebank politics.
