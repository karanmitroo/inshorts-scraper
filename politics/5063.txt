Following the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar on Wednesday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi's step against black money and corruption, a political gimmick. This is to divert the people's attention from his government's failures, he added. Sarkar asserted that the poor, especially in the rural areas would suffer the most.
