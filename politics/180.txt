After two sitting MLAs of Rajasthan passed away within six months, two BJP MLAs on Thursday claimed that the state Assembly, which is built on a cremation ground, is haunted and demanded 'yagya'. However, Congress leader Dhiraj Gurjar said, "I have never felt the presence of an evil spirit in the assembly...Such things will only spread superstition among people."
