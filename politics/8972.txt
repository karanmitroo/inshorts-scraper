Reacting to the issuance of the passport to Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the Congress on Wednesday said that the Hurriyat leader shouldn't have been provided the same. "Geelani... is against the Constitution of India. He even didn't declare his nationality when the form was filled initially. They shouldn't have given this permission at this juncture," said party spokesperson Pramod Tiwari.
