The Left Front-ruled Tripura government  has decided to withdraw the Class XI textbook in which the BJP was tagged as a "communal party", an official said Wednesday. "Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha and Shiv Sena are among such parties, besides the BJP. Parties like BJP, though not based on religion, succeeded in capturing power through communalization of politics," the textbook said.
