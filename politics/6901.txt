Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that AgustaWestland had never been blacklisted and that such an assertion by former Defence Minister AK Antony was a "figment of imagination". Antony earlier claimed that the company was blacklisted by the UPA regime after irregularities were revealed in the VVIP chopper deal, and that the ban was later lifted by the NDA.
