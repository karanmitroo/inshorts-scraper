While slamming major airlines for banning Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad from flying, party's MP Sanjay Raut on Thursday said terrorists, Pakistani artists, rapists are allowed to fly but not Gaikwad. "One airline owner has nexus with Dawood Ibrahim. An airline allowed Vijay Mallya to flee," Raut added. Raut also said Sena might boycott NDA's April 10 meeting over this.
