Rajasthan Minister Kalicharan Saraf on Tuesday said that Congress leader Sachin Pilot attended the funeral of soldier Nimb Singh because he is ‘free these days’. Saraf’s remark came in response to a question on CM Vasundhara Raje’s absence at the funeral where Pilot was present. We have many things to do in the government, he added.
