The Congress on Tuesday said the Election Commission (EC) cannot introduce the option of None Of The Above (NOTA) in the Rajya Sabha elections, without Constitutional amendment as it is in violation of the Constitution. "The election shall be to a proportionate system...where the preference is given and the vote is single but transferable," Congress leader Anand Sharma said.
