The Shiv Sena said on Wednesday that Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan should not be attacked just because he belongs to the minority community. "This country is tolerant and the Muslims are tolerant as well," Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut added. Earlier, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya had said that although Shah Rukh lives in India, his "soul" is in Pakistan.
