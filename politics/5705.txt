Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia on Tuesday said that the organisation will not hold any agitation over the Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya until the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Togadia, however, maintained that the VHP is committed to build a huge Ram Temple at the site where the 16th century Babri mosque was demolished in 1992.
