The Congress on Thursday denied any development on passing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill following Parliamentary Affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu's meeting with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh over GST. “The government is using optics of meetings and is not serious about GST,” said senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal.
