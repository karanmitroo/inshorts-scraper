Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday began election campaign in Gujarat, riding on a bullock cart for a short stretch after the police refused permission for a road show in an open-top jeep. He kickstarted the campaign from Dwarka, promising “yuva rozgar, khedut adhikar” or jobs for the youth and rights to farmers during his interactions with the people.
