Congress MPs on Friday protested over Goa Chief Minister and former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's presence in the Rajya Sabha. Earlier, the Congress accused the BJP of using unfair means to attain majority in Goa Assembly. However, Parrikar said, "Other parties... didn't trust the Congress... It's a coalition government and there is no question of morality or immorality in it."
