The Samajwadi Party has alleged Hindus are one of the largest consumers of meat while accusing the ruling BJP of doing politics of appeasement in UP. "Navaratri has begun and small meat shops will see a drastic 80% fall of its customers and we all know why. Muslims don't celebrate Navaratri, only Hindus do," said SP leader Naresh Agrawal.
