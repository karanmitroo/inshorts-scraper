BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi has addressed over 150 rallies across India clocking 2.4 lakh km (average of 1,100km a day) but has rarely felt homesick, thanks to a fleet of three aircrafts- one jet and two choppers- which take him home every night. Almost every day, Modi takes off from Ahmedabad airport in an Embraer aircraft for his rallies.
