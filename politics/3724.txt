Reacting to a claim that money was distributed among poor in Goa’s Cumbarjua constituency, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday criticised the Election Commission, stating the poll panel’s message is "vote for those who give you money". "EC fails to stop this. EC prevents me from saying — "Take money from them n vote 4 us" (sic)," he tweeted.
