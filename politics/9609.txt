Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said Friday that 62% military chopper crashes that took place in India since 1986 were caused due to 'human error'. By making the statement, Parrikar dismissed the claims made by army officers' wives seeking replacement of the "30-35 years old" Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. He claimed that these "old" helicopters have "not outlived their life".
