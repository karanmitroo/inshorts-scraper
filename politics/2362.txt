Ahead of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls, the AAP has released a booklet titled 'MCD: Most Corrupt Department' to slam the BJP's work. The booklet accuses the BJP-ruled MCD of corruption, having ghost employees, pension scam, misgovernance, and having a dearth of funds. Delhi's civic body polls are scheduled to be held on April 23.
