Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who addressed a rally in Bihar on Saturday, accused PM Narendra Modi of being a 'feku' (braggart). "Prime Minister Modi promised two lakh jobs... and to reduce high prices. Did it happen?", Gandhi said. Further, calling the NDA government a 'suit-boot ki sarkar', he said, "PM Modi interacts with only those who wear suits".
