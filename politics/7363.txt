AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan was today suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly for this session for refusing to say 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'. All the other parties had demanded the suspension, leading to an uproar in the Assembly. Notably, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi recently remarked that he will not chant 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' as it was not Constitutionally mandatory.
