A special court in Gujarat on Tuesday asked BJP President Amit Shah to appear before it on September 18 as a witness in the 2002 Naroda Gam riot case. The summon was made on a request by Maya Kodnani, a former BJP minister who has been sentenced to life imprisonment in another riot case of Naroda Patiya.
