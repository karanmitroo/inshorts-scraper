The BJP has written to the Election Commission against Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav for asking voters to take money from other parties but to vote only for the Samajwadi Party. BJP alleged that Akhilesh's statement amounted to the violation of the Model Code of Conduct. Notably, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had made similar statements.
