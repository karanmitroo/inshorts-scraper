WB PWD Minister Arup Biswas was on Monday seen flaunting red beacon atop his car despite the Centre's month-old decision to ban its use to end VIP culture. "Our government has not yet banned red beacon. So we are not bound to follow the other instructions," Biswas said. The beacon ban, effective from May 1, exempted vehicles of emergency services.
