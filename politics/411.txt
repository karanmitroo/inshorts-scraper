After Shiv Sena announced it will be contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections alone, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the BJP-led coalition government with Sena will complete its full term. Refusing to comment on Sena's announcement, he said, "Let's wait. They have been saying many things." The BJP leader also expressed confidence in securing another term.
