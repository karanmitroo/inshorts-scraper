BJP on Friday suspended its MLC Lal Babu Prasad from the primary membership of the party over alleged misconduct with a woman MLC of the LJP. The action was taken on the basis of media reports of his alleged misbehaviour that had tarnished the party's image, the party said. A show-cause notice will also be served to Prasad.
