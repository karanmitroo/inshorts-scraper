The Uttarakhand High Court (HC) today said that the Election Commission's challenge given to political parties to hack or tamper the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) is unconstitutional. While hearing a plea against the EC's EVM hackathon, the HC said that it is yet to decide whether to stay the EVM challenge, scheduled to be held on June 3, or not.
