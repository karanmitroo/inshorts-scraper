Madhya Pradesh Minister for Panchayat and Rural Development, Gopal Bhargava, has compared red beacons to "mistresses". "Red beacon, hooter, bungalow and cars are never loyal to anyone. They are like mistresses, whoever keeps them they stay with that person," he said. He also said that he did not use vehicles with beacons or hooters while being in his constituency.
