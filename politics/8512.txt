Six Shiv Sena workers, who were involved in smearing black ink on the face of former diplomat Sudheendra Kulkarni, were on Monday arrested by Mumbai police. Kulkarni was the organiser for the book launch event of former Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri in Mumbai. The event was held despite Shiv Sena's threats of disrupting the programme.
