The Shiv Sena on Thursday called for revoking voting rights and citizenship of those who do not chant "Bharat Mata ki Jai". In an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana', the party also slammed AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi for saying he will not chant the slogan. "Has Asaduddin Owaisi not committed treason as well by insulting mother India?", the editorial said.
