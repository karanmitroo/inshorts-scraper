Addressing his fourth rally in election-bound Bihar at Bhagalpur on Tuesday, PM Narendra Modi challenged the Lalu-Nitish-Sonia grand alliance by asking for a report card of the past 25 years in Bihar. "For 25 years, the grand alliance constituents have tried hard to spread the poison of caste and communalism," Modi said at the rally, held at an abandoned airfield.
