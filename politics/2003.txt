Recently ousted BSP leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui has slammed party chief Mayawati saying that she is the greatest blackmailer India has ever witnessed. Notably, Mayawati had earlier said that Siddiqui was made in-charge of western Uttar Pradesh during the elections but there were complaints that he was a "blackmailer".
