Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday wrote an open letter to PM Narendra Modi, saying that the latter's comment on the former's DNA was an insult to Bihar's legacy. “Few days back, while addressing a public rally in Bihar, a comment was made by you about my DNA. The issue has been troubling many of us since then,” Kumar wrote.
