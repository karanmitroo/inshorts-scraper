Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi Tuesday took a train from Delhi to Punjab, where he will meet the farmers. Rahul will visit Khanna and Gobindgarh, also called the "grain bowl" of Punjab, to examine the condition of the grain markets after unseasonal rains. "I've been told the condition of farmers is very bad. I want to see that myself," Rahul said.
