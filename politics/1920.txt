The authorities in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar reportedly asked the members of a Dalit community to clean themselves with soaps, shampoos and apply scents before meeting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. A resident of the area also alleged that new toilets, roads were constructed and lights were installed in their slum "within no time" ahead of the CM's visit to the area.
