Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Wednesday said that all Dalits should give up Hinduism and embrace Buddhism to stop atrocities against them. "Only when Babasaheb Ambedkar was convinced that Dalits would not get justice in Hindu religion did he convert to Buddhism," Athawale added. He also said that BSP chief Mayawati should convert to Buddhism instead of issuing repeated threats.
