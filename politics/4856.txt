Congress President Sonia Gandhi, in an interview, has revealed that ex-PM Indira Gandhi felt "extremely uncomfortable" with Emergency (1975-1977), stating hadn't she felt uncomfortable, she wouldn't have called elections. "There were instances when Rajivji would meet people who would say this is happening, and he would tell his mother," she said. "I could see that she heard him," Sonia added.
