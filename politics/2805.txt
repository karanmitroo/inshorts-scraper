Raj Babbar has offered to resign from the post of Uttar Pradesh Congress chief after the poor performance of his political party in Assembly elections. "I could not live up to the expectation. I was given responsibility but I could not fulfil it, I accept it," he said. Notably, the Congress won just seven of the 105 seats it contested.
