Questioning PM Narendra Modi over the healthcare facilities in Gujarat, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused him of gifting his friend a government hospital in Bhuj for 99 years. This was reportedly in reference to the Gujarat government's decision to hand over the government hospital to a corporate house, Adani Group, under the public private partnership model.
