Uttarakhand speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal (Congress) on Wednesday embarrassed his party when he rapped its ministers for doing nothing to reduce the plight of the people hit by last year’s cloudburst and flash floods. He said that the ministers saw the damage done but couldn't concentrate on welfare issues as they were more ‘focused on making money’.
