The PMO has reduced Home Minister Rajnath Singh, to a rubber stamp in the selection process for the appointment of senior bureaucrats. Singh has to merely sign on the dotted line after PM Narendra Modi has approved an appointment. This is a marked departure from the past, when the Home Minister had the first say, after the administrative ministerâ€™s approval.
