The Election Commission on Wednesday blocked the usage of AIADMK's name and 'twin leaves' poll symbol after it was claimed by the faction led by O Panneerselvam. The ex-Tamil Nadu CM had rebelled after he was allegedly asked to step down by AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan. The EC also asked both factions to choose different symbols for the upcoming by-polls.
