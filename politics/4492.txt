Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Chief Mayawati on Thursday said that the government must deposit the collected black money in the accounts of the poor. "The Centre must waive farmers' loans and stop feeding big businessmen," Mayawati added. "Even after 37 days of demonetisation, the people who are suffering the most are poor, labourers and farmers," she further said.
