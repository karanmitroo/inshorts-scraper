Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal has said that people who were upset with the government's demonetisation move were the ones who were hit by the decision. "No honest taxpayer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money, and the public should also support the government's move," he added.
