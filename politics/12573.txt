Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh was  suspended  from the party for "anti-party activities", as his name has cropped up in Saradha chit fund scam.  Ghosh had earlier threatened to "reveal many things" if he was arrested in the Saradha chitfund case. He was served a show cause notice a week ago for speaking against party chief Mamata Banerjee.
