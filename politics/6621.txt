Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said there was a need to unmask the people practicing the ideology that murdered Mahatma Gandhi and are ruling the country, to save the nation from destruction. "Our fight is with ideology and not with a person specific... this country cannot be moved forward by the Sangh's (RSS) ideology," he asserted.
