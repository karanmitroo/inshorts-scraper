AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said that PM Narendra Modi would have claimed credit for construction of the Red Fort and Taj Mahal had they not been built long ago. Criticising Modi for his picture on Khadi Udyog's calendar, the parliamentarian said that though charkha is run with both hands, Modi is seen running it with one hand in pictures.
