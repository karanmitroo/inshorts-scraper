Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh on Tuesday slammed Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal saying that he forced industries to "flee Punjab", and has left the state "grappling with near-bankruptcy and a host of other critical problems". Amarinder also promised to sweep policy changes to revive "sick industries" in Punjab, if Congress is voted to power in 2017 state assembly polls.
