Speaking about launching a protest against Centre over the implementation of OROP scheme, Anna Hazare said there is "no harm in fighting for our own right... we are not begging". The social activist alleged that the government glorifies soldiers but does not fulfil its promises towards them. We stopped our agitation because the government promised us timely implementation, he added.
