Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday defended his position on comedian Tanmay Bhat's Snapchat video, and said upholding the freedom of expression is an "issue of principle". Tharoor said, "Upholding freedom of expression includes defending the right of people to say things you don't agree with or that you find obnoxious." He added that he had not seen the video.
