Addressing a rally at Belgaum on Sunday, Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack against Congress VP Rahul Gandhi saying, "Shehzada should be actually getting ready to write MA exams (Lok Sabha elections) but he seems to be preparing for Class VII exams." The statement came at the backdrop of Rahul's recent remark that "Gujarat ka gubbara phootne wala hai."
