After the Goa Assembly floor test, CM Manohar Parrikar said that Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh had come to the state for luxury and not to work. "Congress coming down for floor test was possibly all a hype because it was being demanded that Digvijaya should be kept down as the general secretary. He had to do something," Parrikar added.
