Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said that anybody living in India is a Hindu, asserting that the meaning of Hindutva is to unite all communities. Maintaining that India is a land of Hindus, he said India provides shelter to "tortured" Hindus from across the world. "The Muslims in India are also Hindus," he added.
