The Supreme Court Friday suspended Jayalalitha's sentence for two months and granted her interim bail. Jayalalithaa got relief on the condition that she will make all documents available to Karnataka HC for speedy adjudication of her appeal against conviction. "We will not give you a day more if you fail to file paperbook within 2 months", the court told her.
