A breach of privilege notice was moved against Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia by fellow AAP MLA Pankaj Pushkar in the city-state's assembly on Wednesday. Pushkar accused Sisodia of furnishing factually incorrect information on questions raised by the former to “hide” the government’s “misdeeds”. Notably, Pushkar was once marshalled out of the assembly for allegedly criticising the AAP government.
