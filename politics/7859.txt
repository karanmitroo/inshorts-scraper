Shiv Sena on Monday said they hoped PM Modi's "tolerance" towards terrorist attacks like Pathankot will end soon and reportedly advocated a strong response. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana questioned if the US can pressurise Pakistan over the Pathankot issue, why is "our ball in Pakistan's court". Such attacks will not stop unless given a befitting reply, it added.
