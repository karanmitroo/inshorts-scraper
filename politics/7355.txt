Three Congress MLAs, including a former Speaker, were on Tuesday suspended from the Haryana Assembly for six months for "tearing" copies of the Governor's Address. They tore the copies to protest against the suspension of party MLAs for interrupting Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki during his address to the House on Monday. They were accused of breaking the House decorum.
