Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, while addressing the Assembly on Monday, made a gaffe, stating the state is "ranked first in corruption and development". This happened while YSRCP was protesting in the House and Naidu was lashing out at YSRCP chief Jaganmohan Reddy. The Opposition later circulated the video of his statement on social media.
