The three-membered fact-finding team formed by BJP President Amit Shah to look into the Malda violence was on Monday detained at the Malda railway station. The district police did not allow the BJP team to go to Kaliachak citing law and order issues. Notably, violence had erupted last week in Malda following alleged blasphemous comments by a right-wing leader.
