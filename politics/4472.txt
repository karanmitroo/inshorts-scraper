Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said in poll-bound Goa that the Centre's demonetisation move was not a surgical strike on corruption but a firebombing on honest countrymen. Claiming that the move will majorly benefit the 1% super-rich Indians, Gandhi added that demonetisation is all about pulling out money from the poor and giving it to the rich people.
