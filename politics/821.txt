Reacting to Maharashtra CM Fadnavis praising North Indians for adding to Mumbai's "prestige", Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Nitin Sardesai claimed Fadnavis made the statement for votes. Adding that Fadnavis was not concerned about original Mumbaikars and people of Maharashtra, he said, "They (North Indians) came to Mumbai for their livelihood because there was no development in their states."
