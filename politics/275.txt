Slamming PM Narendra Modi for criticising the policies of previous Congress-led governments, party President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said, "You drive the vehicle by just looking in the rear-view mirror, which will cause accidents." Speaking at an election rally in poll-bound Karnataka, Gandhi added, "The country doesn't want to hear about the past. It is concerned about the future."
