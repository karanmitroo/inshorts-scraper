A woman on Sunday kissed Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on the cheek during a public meeting while they were on stage. “I was overjoyed by the fact that I was standing next to him. My family and I have always called him 'Appaji' (father),” the woman said. She also called Siddaramaiah the "lion" of the Kuruba community, to which he belongs.
