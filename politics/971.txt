Hindu Yuva Vahini leader Nagendra Pratap Tomar on Sunday claimed that India will become an Islamic country by 2027 going by current population growth rates. He further said, "Muslims bear children not because they want to have them, but because they want to occupy the whole country." The Hindu Yuva Vahini was founded by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
