BJP candidate Hema Malini had to finish her speech within three minutes at a public meet near Mathura as the stage on which she was standing collapsed partially. The reason for the collapse was the huge crowd, which had gathered to see “Basanti.” The three minutes speech concluded with 'stage gir raha hai'.
