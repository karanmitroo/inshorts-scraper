Two railway officials --  Swapnil Garg and AK Mal, were suspended on Tuesday morning by Lucknow's  DRM for making Union Railway Minister, Mallikarjun Kharge, walk a small distance at Lucknow railway station, as his carriage was not placed right in front of the VIP entrance. However, the suspension order was cancelled in 24 hours.
