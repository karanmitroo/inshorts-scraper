PM Narendra Modi has called the first ever meeting of all NDA constituents ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament. This is reportedly for bracing against the Opposition on raging controversies like the Lalit Modi row and the Vyapam scam. He may also attend two separate all-party meetings to discuss ways to ensure a smooth session.
