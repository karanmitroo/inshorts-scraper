Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the Election Commission should make him its brand ambassador to put an end to bribery in elections. This comes after Election Commission censured him for promoting bribery in elections. Adding that EC misinterpreted his comments, Kejriwal said his remarks were aimed at containing graft and he should be allowed to repeat them.
