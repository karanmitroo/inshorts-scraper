Jan Adhikar Party MP Pappu Yadav on Wednesday urged the Maoists to kill political leaders instead of security personnel. "Politicians are looting the country, so Maoists should first kill them," said the MP. Yadav also criticised PM Modi for the recent Maoist attack and said, "Modi had claimed that corruption, terrorism, and Maoist problems will be eliminated after demonetisation."
