Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said cricketer-turned-politician was already a member of Congress. "He is 100% in the Congress, and as Navjot Kaur Sidhu (his wife) had announced that he is a candidate from Amritsar East," the Congress leader said. Sidhu had earlier met party Vice President Rahul Gandhi to discuss his role in the party.
