Former Bihar MP Sadhu Yadav on Wednesday withdrew his nomination papers from Maharajganj Lok Sabha constituency, saying that his decision was to avoid the split in the votes of the JD (U) candidate in the fray. Notably, Sadhu had earlier announced to contest against his sister Rabri Devi from Saran constituency, but later filed his papers from Maharajganj.
