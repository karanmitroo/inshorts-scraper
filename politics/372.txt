The candidates of the ruling Trinamool Congress have won Noapara Assembly and Uluberia Lok Sabha seats in the West Bengal bypolls. While TMC's Sunil Singh won the Noapara seat, Sajda Ahmed won from Uluberia by over 4 lakh votes. The bypolls were necessitated by the deaths of Uluberia's sitting TMC MP Sultan Ahmed and Congress MLA Madhusudan Ghose from Noapara.
