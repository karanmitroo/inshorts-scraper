Following BJP's break-up with Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray Sunday said that BJP cannot be trusted after what they did to Sena. "Some BJP leader told me that they had planned the break-up long ago. If Balasaheb would have been alive today, he would have broken the alliance a month ago itself," he added.
