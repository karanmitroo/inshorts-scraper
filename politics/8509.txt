Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday said that incidents like the Dadri lynching would damage the BJP and the NDA and asserted that "this has nothing to do with the RSS". He also said that such incidents were sometimes blown out of proportion by the media, without referring to any specific instance.
