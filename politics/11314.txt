Thousands of Mumbaikars, including several prominent personalities, couldnâ€™t vote on Thursday after their names were found missing from the electoral rolls. Many of them had cast their ballot in 2009 elections and carried valid voter identity cards. Others found their names on the deleted list of voters and were debarred this season.
