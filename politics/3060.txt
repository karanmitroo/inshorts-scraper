The Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur, who is Kargil martyr Captain Mandeep Singh's daughter, has alleged that she received "rape threats" for opposing ABVP. "Giving rape threats in the name of nationalism is not right," said Kaur. After Ramjas college clash, Kaur had changed her Facebook profile picture holding a placard which read, "I am not afraid of ABVP".
