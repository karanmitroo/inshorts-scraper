Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said that whoever suggested the idea of demonetisation should enrol in an undergraduate course in economics. Demonetisation is a "monumental tragedy", which is "anti-poor and has put millions in misery”, he said. Further, the Modi government has created a myth that all cash is black money and all black money is cash, Chidambaram added.
