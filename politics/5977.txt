TMC MP Derek O'Brien on Wednesday said in Rajya Sabha that slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani is more dangerous 'dead than alive'. “My advice to Pakistan is that please do not meddle in our internal affairs, please do not shed crocodile tears," he said. “Kashmir is non-negotiable so Kashmir and its welfare should also be non-negotiable,” O’Brien added.
