Congress President Sonia Gandhi has refused to comment on the remarks Union Minister Giriraj Singh made on her on Wednesday. "Would not like to comment on people who have a narrow mindset," Sonia said. Criticizing Singh's controversial remarks, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, "There can be either Giriraj or Ramraj... Modi ji has decided there will be Giriraj".
