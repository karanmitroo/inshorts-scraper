BJP General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Saturday asked, "Why the people who had returned their awards (to protest against intolerance, in 2015) are silent on Sukma Naxal attack, in which 25 CRPF jawans were martyred." "There is a need to unmask the people who, in the name of human rights, have sympathy for Naxals and terrorists," he added.
