The Kerala Congress (M) on Sunday left the United Democratic Front (UDF) after being a part of it for more than three decades. "We were forced to reach this decision,” said the party Chairman KM Mani, adding, “Party won’t join the LDF or NDA.” The Kerala Congress (M) will now work as a separate independent opposition block in the Assembly.
