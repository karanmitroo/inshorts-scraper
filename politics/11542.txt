In a setback for BJP, its candidate from the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat, Arif Majid Pampori, Wednesday resigned from the party's basic membership over its "anti-Kashmir" and "anti-Muslim" manifesto for the elections. Pampori resigned after his advice to BJP president Rajnath Singh to exclude issues like abrogation of Article 370 and Ram Mandir from the party's manifesto, was ignored.
