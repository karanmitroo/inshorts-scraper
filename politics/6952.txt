CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat on Sunday filed a police complaint against Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien for sharing a morphed image showing Home Minister Rajnath Singh offering Karat a sweet. â€œI have lodged a complaint with Delhi Police as morphing a photograph, like the manner it was done, by a political party is an offence under cyber laws," Karat said.
