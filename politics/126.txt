Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala has said the BJP-led government's new slogan seems to be "khaunga, aur khane dunga, aur pack karke le jane dunga". Slamming the government over the â‚¹6,800-crore Winsome Diamonds fraud case, Surjewala said the group's promoter Jatin Mehta fled India and settled in the Caribbean. India doesn't have an extradition treaty with the Caribbean, he pointed out.
