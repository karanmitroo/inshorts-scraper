Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh on Wednesday called for using ballot paper-based voting in Assembly elections to be held later this year. "I used to think that these machines were fool-proof and tamper-proof, but with recent incidents, it can be seen that they can be manipulated," he added. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also demanded the use of ballot papers.
