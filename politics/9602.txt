Amid the ongoing controversy over the release of separatist leader Masarat Alam, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh Tuesday said that the government's priority is country's security and not the PDP-BJP alliance in J&K. Rajnath added, "I am not fully satisfied with the version of J&K government on this issue and have also sought some information and clarifications from them."
