Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind general secretary Maulana Mehmood Madani Saturday said Muslims themselves are responsible for bringing a bad name to their community. "It is not the enemies but a section from within the community which is responsible for creating this image of terror," he said. Further, Madani called for spreading education in the community to change this.
