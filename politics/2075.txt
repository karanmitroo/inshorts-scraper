The TMC in West Bengal has put up posters slamming the BJP-led Centre that read, "Ram ka naam badnam na karo" (Don't malign the name of Ram). The excerpt is taken from a Bollywood song from the 70s which was sung by Kishore Kumar. The TMC said that it is the beginning and more such innovative posters will come soon.
