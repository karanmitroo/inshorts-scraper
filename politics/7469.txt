The Election Commission is investigating a complaint made by the DMK, which accused the AIADMK of violating the election code of conduct on Sunday, police said. AIADMK workers allegedly opened a bus shelter on Coimbatore's outskirts, as part of the 68th birthday celebrations of party chief J Jayalalithaa. 'Amma' was written above the shelter, which allegedly violates the poll code.
