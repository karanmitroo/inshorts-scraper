The BJP has slammed the Congress for conducting a 'fake' survey after All India Congress Committee's National Media Coordinator Rohan Gupta shared a graphic claiming that the first phase of Gujarat polls had gone in Congress' favour. Gupta clarified that the survey was an online opinion poll conducted by the party's IT cell and was not an exit poll.
