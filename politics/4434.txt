Maharashtra BJP president Raosaheb Danve on Saturday said, "On the eve of elections, Laxmi comes to your house, and you should accept it," during a civic poll campaign meeting in Maharashtra's Aurangabad. Congress objected to Danve's remarks and asked Election Commission to book him for violating the model code during the ongoing Municipal council elections.
