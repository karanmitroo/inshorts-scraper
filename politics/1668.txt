Nagaland Chief Minister TR Zeliang won the vote of confidence in the state assembly on Friday, garnering the support of 47 out of 59 MLAs. Zeliang was re-appointed the CM after former CM Shurhozelie Liezietsu was sacked for not appearing for the floor test. Zeliang was the CM before Liezietsu, but was forced to resign after a protest by tribals.
