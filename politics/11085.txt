Sonia Gandhi was on Saturday re-elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) in the first meeting of the party, after the debacle in the Lok Sabha election. The CPP meet follows the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, where both Sonia and Rahul had offered to resign from their party posts, but the offer was rejected unanimously.
