Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Saturday called the ban imposed by the Rajiv Gandhi government on Salman Rushdie's 'The Satanic Verses' "wrong". He added that Indira Gandhi had admitted in the 1980s that imposition of Emergency in the country was a mistake. Furthermore, Chidambaram said intolerance in India is on the rise, and there is a "rush of bans."
