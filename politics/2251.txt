AAP leader Ashutosh on Monday asserted that no conclusion could be drawn from the exit polls about the results of the recent MCD elections. He advised people to be patient and wait till the results are announced on April 26. Notably, the exit polls have predicted a sweeping victory for the BJP, with the party winning 202-220 seats.
