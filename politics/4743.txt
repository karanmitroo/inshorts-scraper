Reacting to Supreme Court's ruling that all cinema halls must play the National Anthem before movie screenings, BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma on Wednesday said the move will strengthen the spirit of nationalism. "It (the verdict) is a reminder to people that we have to have affection and duty towards our national institutions and symbols," BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said.
