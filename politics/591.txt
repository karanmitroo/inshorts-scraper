In a letter to PM Narendra Modi, the Shiv Sena in Goa called Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar a 'bad Santa' for agreeing to the diversion of waters of Mahadayi river to Karnataka. Accusing CM Parrikar of "snatching the future of children", the party requested PM Modi to act like "real Santa Claus" and ask Parrikar to reverse the decision.
