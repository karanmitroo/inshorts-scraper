Ahead of Sonia Gandhi and Narendra Modi both addressing rallies a few kilometres apart in Chhattisgarh's Bastar on Thursday, security forces defused two Improvised Explosive Devices(IEDs) of 25-kg each, averting a possible landmine explosion on Dornapal-Jagargunda road in Sukma district. This is the same spot where Naxalites, in their deadliest attack on security forces, killed 76 of them in 2010.
