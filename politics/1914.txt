The Election Commission on Saturday rejected the Congress party's demand to allow it to access the motherboard of the electronic voting machine (EVM) in the poll panel's challenge to hack it. Further, the EC told the AAP that it does not believe that an 'open hackathon' was necessary. Notably, both the parties have refused to take part in the hackathon.
