BSP Chief Mayawati on Monday rejected the report of the judicial commission on the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, calling it an "eyewash" to save the SP government. This proves that the work of judicial commissions was not to punish the guilty, but to give clean-chits, Mayawati added. She alleged that even the Congress and BJP had done so in the past.
