Shiv Sena's youth wing chief Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday reiterated Sena's demand for converting the 226-acre Mahalaxmi Racecourse into a Mumbai-themed public park while meeting Maharastra CM Devendra Fadnavis. "We could shift the race course out of Mumbai such as Navi Mumbai or Alibaug,” added Thackeray. The Royal Western India Turf Club's land lease for the racecourse expired in 2013.
