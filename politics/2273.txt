With Delhi witnessing polling for its civic body today, the BJP slammed Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for his rant on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) tampering, saying, "Fault is not in EVMs, but in Kejriwal's leadership." BJP leader Sambit Patra said, "Kejriwal's language shows that he is frustrated. He went to Goa and Punjab to become CM, now he is nowhere."
