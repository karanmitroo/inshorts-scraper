Criticising Union Minister Maneka Gandhi's suggestion to make sex determination compulsory, Congress leader Shobha Oza said that it is a bizarre proposal. The leader said that the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994 was implemented to curb female foeticide. Oza also said that if implemented, this move will affect the project to save the girl child.
