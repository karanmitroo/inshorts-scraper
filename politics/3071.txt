DMK's Working President, MK Stalin has said former Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam never raised doubts about the mystery behind the death of ex-AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa when he was CM. "Only after he was denied the chief minister's chair, which was two months after her death, did Panneerselvam choose to go on meditation under media spotlight," he added.
