The YSR Congress party on Sunday submitted a memorandum to Andhra Pradesh Assembly Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao demanding the immediate disqualification of 23 of its former MLAs who defected to the ruling TDP. The YSRCP said it will only attend the Budget session if its demands were met. Earlier, the party boycotted the winter session over the issue of defection.
