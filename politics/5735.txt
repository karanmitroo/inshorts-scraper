The Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) on Sunday said it will boycott talks with the all-party delegation led by Home Minister Rajnath Singh. The party owed this to the Union and state governmentsâ€™ "decision" to let political parties meet the delegation only in Kashmir. It dubbed the development as an "affront to the political leadership of Jammu region."
