BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut Sangeet Som called Taj Mahal 'a blot on Indian culture' and a monument built by 'traitors'. He added, "The creator of Taj Mahal (Shah Jahan) imprisoned his father. He wanted to wipe out Hindus. If these people are part of our history, then it is very sad and we will change this history."
