At a debate on intolerance in Parliament on Friday, PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said that critics shouldn't be taunted to go to Pakistan every time as "we belong to this country, this country owns us." Mufti added that India is better than Pakistan or Syria and â€œIndian Muslims follow real Islam" as majority "tolerant" Hindu population makes it possible.
