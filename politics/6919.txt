BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday dragged the name of Congress President Sonia Gandhi in the AgustaWestland helicopter bribery case while speaking in the Rajya Sabha. This triggered an uproar, resulting in the adjournment of the session for ten minutes. Reacting to the same, Sonia said, "We have nothing to hide. Let them take my name, I'm not afraid."
