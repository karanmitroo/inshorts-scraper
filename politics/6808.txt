Bihar BJP President Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday claimed that crime rate has increased significantly under the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance. "The people are sitting on protest and the police is busy defending the culprit," he alleged. He was reacting to the killing of a Bihar youth by the son of a JD(U) MLC for allegedly overtaking his car.
