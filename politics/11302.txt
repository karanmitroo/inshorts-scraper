An FIR was filed against Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Saturday for his comments against Rahul Gandhi, that the Congress vice-president went to the houses of dalits for honeymoon and picnic. However, Ramdev had later claimed he did not make the remarks in a negative sense, and was willing to withdraw them if they have hurt the dalit sentiments.
