Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on Tuesday said that the Secretariat has stopped salaries and allowances to 20 AAP MLAs, who were disqualified for allegedly holding offices of profit by serving as Parliamentary Secretaries. While the Delhi HC refused to stay the Election Commission's order disqualifying the MLAs, it stopped the EC from announcing bypolls to fill the vacancies.
