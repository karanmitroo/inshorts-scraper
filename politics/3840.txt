V Dhivaharan, the brother of new AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala, has claimed that they stopped a "huge conspiracy to finish off" late TN CM Jayalalithaa in 2011. There was also a threat to the lives of Sasikala, her family, and other party leaders, he added. Sasikala was expelled from AIADMK in 2011, but Jayalalithaa reinstated her later.
