The Congress party today said it will organise an 'Aakrosh (Angst) March' across Bihar on Monday to protest a BJP leader's "derogatory" remarks against Rahul Gandhi. Such statements by RSS and BJP leaders are made "with an intention to bring war-like situation in the state", Congress said. The BJP MLA from Barmer had on Thursday called Rahul Gandhi a "traitor".
