Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said if the Centre allows him to speak in the Parliament on the issue of demonetisation, "an earthquake will come". Claiming that PM Narendra Modi is scared of coming to the Parliament, Gandhi added, "Demonetisation is the biggest scam in Indian history. I want to speak in the Parliament... will tell everything there."
