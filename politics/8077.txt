Former Union Minister V Narayanasamy was on Tuesday seen holding slippers for Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi while he was touring flood-hit Puducherry. "As a courtesy I offered my chappals as Mr Rahul Gandhi removed his shoes to walk barefoot in the water... I do not see anything wrong in it," Narayanasamy said on Wednesday after the footage went viral.
