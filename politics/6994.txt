The BJP on Monday defended its "very hard working" leader, Maharashtra's Rural Development Minister Pankaja Munde, after she was being criticised by other parties for posting selfies during her visit to drought-hit Latur. Saying she was being misinterpreted, the party said, she clicked the photos "out of happiness" to appreciate the work done in the drought-hit area to locate water.
