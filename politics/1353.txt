Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday said that YSR Congress Party President YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has qualities similar to rape convict Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. "That baba cheated people on their beliefs and similarly 'Jagan baba' is threatening the system. His behaviour lacks dignity and it spreads hatred," Chandrababu Naidu said.
