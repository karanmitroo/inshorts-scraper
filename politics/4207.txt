Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's New Year's Eve address, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said demonetisation's end will mark the start of "DeModitisation". Asserting that 2017 will mark the year of DeModitisation, she said this will be the New Year's resolution of all Indians. Banerjee further accused PM Modi of deviating from the actual agenda of black money.
