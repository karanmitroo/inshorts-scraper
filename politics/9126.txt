Textile Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar has called for making non-veg cooking optional in hotel management courses, sparking a row. Gangwar has written a letter to HRD Minister Smriti Irani and Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma saying that vegetarians from Jain and Brahmin communities are unable to pursue hotel management because of the compulsory component of cooking non-vegetarian food.
