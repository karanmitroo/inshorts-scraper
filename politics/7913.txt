Shiv Sena on Tuesday expressed concern over the Pathankot airbase attacks and said they had warned PM Modi "not to trust" Pakistan as "the chai with Nawaz Sharif has cost India seven martyrs".  Questioning the "failure of internal security", the Saamana editorial criticised the condolences to martyrs on social networking sites and said, "Pakistan has managed to finish India's self-respect."
