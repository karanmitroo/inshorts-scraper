Seeking youth support for Narendra Modi, BJP's youth wing has picked 10,220 campus ambassadors (from 2,730 academic institutions) to start 'Modi Cafes' in their respective colleges. The youth wing has even reached out to private institutions where political activities rarely take place. The cafes will start by Feb-10 where discussions will be conducted about Modi's agenda and policies.
