Jawaharlal Nehru University leader Kanhaiya Kumar has asked why can’t AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal, BSP chief Mayawati, Congress and Left parties unite to defeat the BJP. An anti-BJP alliance must be based on a Common Minimum Programme that prevailed during the UPA-I, he added. He also said, “Today, if you speak against the government, you are dubbed anti-national”.
