The Election Commission has delisted 255 political parties that existed only on record and never contested a local body, assembly or Lok Sabha election since 2005. The EC has also asked the tax authorities to initiate appropriate action against them, if necessary. Notably, the EC cannot deregister a party, but it can take back their symbol.
