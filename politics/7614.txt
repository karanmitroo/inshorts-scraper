A day after Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi criticised Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for allegedly trying to crush people's opinion, a case was lodged against him in an Allahabad district court today. The plea states that Gandhi had taken an anti-national stand by supporting the JNU students. The hearing on the issue will take place on March 1.
