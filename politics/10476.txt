BJP leader B Goplakrishnan has stirred a controversy by writing in an article that Nathuram Godse should have killed Jawaharlal Nehru instead of Mahatma Gandhi. He has claimed that Nehru was selfish and the root cause of a lot of problems of the nation. After facing criticism from the Congress, Goplakrishnan defended by saying that he wrote history, not fiction.
