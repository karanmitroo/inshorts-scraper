Congress’ deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma has said that the suspension of Congress MPs from the Lok Sabha will have a “disastrous fallout”. “It means that there is now no meeting ground with the government,” he added. Earlier, 25 Congress members were suspended from the Lok Sabha for five days for disrupting the House.
