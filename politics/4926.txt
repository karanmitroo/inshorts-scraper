The Supreme Court has asked UP Minister Azam Khan to tender an unconditional apology for his remarks on the Bulandshahr gang-rape case. “It is a democratic principle that a public servant should not comment on the investigation of crime if it is not related to him,” the court observed. Khan had allegedly called the incident “a political conspiracy.”
