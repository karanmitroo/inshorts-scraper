Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who drew flak for allegedly ‘holidaying’ in Finland, has dared journalist Arnab Goswami to show the truth on his Finland visit. “Poor Arnab Goswami! You spent 400 Euros to chase me but couldn't get the videos you wanted, as your reporter found me working!” he tweeted. He has also accused Goswami of defaming him.
