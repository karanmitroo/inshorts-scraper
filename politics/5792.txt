Delhi CM Arvid Kejriwal is a selfishly ambitious careerist who can sacrifice anyone and everyone in his ambitious pursuit, Congress leader Manish Tewari said on Sunday. "Kejriwal wants a promotion for himself in the delusional and misplaced belief that he will become Punjab CM," he added. Tewari was reacting to AAP Punjab chief Sucha Singh Chhotepur's removal by Kejriwal.
