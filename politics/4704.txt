Suggesting PM Narendra Modi to solve the chaos caused due to demonetisation, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said that for the first six months even ex-PM Indira Gandhi’s Emergency was popular, but then the popular mood turned against her. He also criticised Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for “terrible implementation of demonetisation”. “No preparation was done at all,” he said.
