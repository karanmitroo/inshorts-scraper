Referring to an RTI, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday claimed that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was in AIIMS when his wife Sunanda Pushkar’s autopsy was conducted there. “Why? To make Sunanda's death "natural". Patriot Dr Gupta refused to oblige,” he tweeted. Tharoor got admitted to AIIMS on January 18, 2014 and was discharged the same day, revealed the RTI.
