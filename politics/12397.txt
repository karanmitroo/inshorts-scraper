Nachiketa Walnekar, claiming to be an activist of the BJP, threw black paint at AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Monday while he was addressing a press conference in New Delhi. "Anna Hazare never wanted the movement to end and Kejriwal has misused the name of Hazare," Walnekar told media persons. However, the BJP has denied any involvement.
