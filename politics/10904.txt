Following an uproar in Rajya Sabha over the meeting of yoga guru Ramdev’s aide Pratap Vaidik with Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafeez Saeed, the house was Monday adjourned till noon. Several Congress leaders raised the issue and didn’t let the question hour begin. Vaidik later said, “Agar unke (Congress) neta milne jaate toh unka pajama giila ho jata, stretcher pe lana padta.”
