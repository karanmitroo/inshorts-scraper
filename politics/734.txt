Facing backlash for calling PM Narendra Modi "neech", Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar claimed he used the word to mean 'low level'. "I think in English when I speak in Hindi as Hindi is not my mother tongue. So, if it has some other meaning then I apologise," he added. PM Modi said the comment was "unacceptable in a democracy".
