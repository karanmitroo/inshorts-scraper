The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Tuesday cancelled its anti-demonetisation protest in Tamil Nadu, citing continuous rainfall as the reason behind the move. This came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met DMK chief M Karunanidhi. DMK spokesperson A Saravanan, however, said the protest has been cancelled only in eight districts and will continue in other places as planned.
