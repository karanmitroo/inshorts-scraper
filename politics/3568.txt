TMC on Wednesday alleged that BJP collected billions of rupees from "unknown sources" and was now preaching electoral reforms. Its decision to cap cash donations to political parties at â‚¹2,000 will not solve anything, TMC National Spokesperson Derek O'Brien said. The merger of Railway Budget with the Union Budget will damage the very core of the transport system, he added.
