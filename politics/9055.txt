Law Minister DV Sadananda Gowda on Tuesday called the Vyapam scam a 'silly' issue and said PM Narendra Modi need not comment on 'such' things. "[C]ertain issues which are so simple issues, so silly issues that need not be answered by the PM... It's not fair," Gowda said. Notably, over 35 people linked to the scam have died mysteriously.
