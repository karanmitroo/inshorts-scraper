While addressing a huge crowd at Varanasi, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal said - "I will contest these elections against Modi from Varanasi." Moreover, he invited the BJP leader for an open debate alleging, "He doesn't speak to anyone, comes by helicopters, holds a rally and leaves. He has to come here and talk to the people of this country."
