Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said that the Maharashtra government should stop water supply to beer manufacturing units in drought-hit Marathwada to tackle shortage of drinking water. A BJP minister responded saying, "If beer units are using drinking water, it should be stopped. But discontinuing supply of water reserved for them as industrial units is not alright."
