BJP MP Bhola Singh on Wednesday said, "While eastern India lacks development, it has brains. Western India has development but lacks brains.” He also questioned the government's 'Smart Cities' scheme saying it would only increase regional imbalances. He claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said Eastern India had "brains", but lacked development, a claim later rubbished by BJP's Venkaiah Naidu.
