Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi asked him to bring back absconding jeweller Nirav Modi when "he goes on another of his many foreign trips". "We will all be very grateful as a nation to get our hard-earned money back," Gandhi added. Nirav Modi is accused in Punjab National Bank's $1.77 billion scam.
