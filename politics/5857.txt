BJP on Monday described BSP supremo Mayawati as the ‘Goddess of Corruption’, stating misgovernance was at its peak during her regime. BSP has lost its political existence in Uttar Pradesh, said BJP Spokesperson IP Singh. The party’s statement came a day after Mayawati alleged that NDA government is ‘pro-capitalist’ and PM Narendra Modi has forgotten all his promises.
