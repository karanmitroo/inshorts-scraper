A senior member of the BJP's Dharwad district panchayat, Yogesh Gowda, was murdered by unidentified men on Wednesday, Karnataka police said. The police have not ruled out rivalry within the local BJP as a possible motive for his murder. Gowda was also reportedly involved in a land dispute, and his brother was murdered in the same place last year.
