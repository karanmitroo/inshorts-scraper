AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala's banners were removed from party's headquarters in Chennai on Wednesday after O Panneerselvam's faction demanded to "uphold the sanctity" of the party office. "This is definitely a positive step," said K Swaminathan from Panneerselvam's camp. Panneerselvam has said a "good ambience" is evolving for holding merger talks between the two AIADMK factions.
