In efforts to woo young voters in Delhi, the BJP will set up around 2,500 'Selfie with Modi' booths across the city, where people will be able to click their photos with a "virtual Narendra Modi". One such booth was Saturday inaugrated by BJP chief Amit Shah in Delhi's Khan Market. Modi is known for clicking selfies on various occasions.
