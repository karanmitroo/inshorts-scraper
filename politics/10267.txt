Under its event 'Ghar Wapsi', the RSS is planning to convert at least 4,000 Christian and 1,000 Muslim families into Hinduism on Christmas. It is a home-returning programme, the RSS said, claiming that this event in Aligarh will be one of the biggest conversion programmes. BJP MP Yogi Adityanath, and a few other prominent people, will be present.
