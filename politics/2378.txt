Aâ€‰Dalit Congress leader was injured in a clash with BJP workers in Vadodara following a dispute over which party will garland BR Ambedkar's statue on his 126th birth anniversary. A Congress worker had tried to garland the statue by saying that Ambedkar is a Dalit and it was his right to do so. The worker was later detained.
