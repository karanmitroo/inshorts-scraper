AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran on Saturday said that all those MLAs supporting him will teach a lesson to those who want to evict party's General Secretary VK Sasikala. Dhinakaran further hit out at O Panneerselvam, Edappadi K Palaniswami and their factions, saying, "They cannot buy the MLAs." Notably, this comes days after the announcement of AIADMK factions' merger.
