West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to gift cows to the poor farmers across the state, with the first batch of cattle to be given to North 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts. "This will not only ensure better living conditions for the cattle population, but will generate alternative employment opportunities for farmers," said an agriculture department officer.
