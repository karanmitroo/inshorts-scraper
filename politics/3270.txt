Amid the ongoing feud in the Samajwadi Party, CM Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said that the party still belongs to his father Mulayam Singh and some difficult decisions had to be taken. "There is no confusion and we are very clear that this party is of Netaji," he said. Mulayam has reportedly campaigned for brother Shivpal Yadav.
