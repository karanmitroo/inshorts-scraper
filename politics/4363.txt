The Nationalist Congress Party on Saturday termed the installation of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji in Maharashtra as a political gimmick engineered by the Bharatiya Janata Party to influence the Maharashtrian voters. "Earlier also, before Bihar elections, the bhumipujan of Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar memorial was done by the PM to influence the Bihar poll," NCP leader Nawab Malik said.
