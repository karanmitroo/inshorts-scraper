The BJP has claimed that the Congress government in Karnataka received a ₹250-crore bribe for awarding tenders to ten ineligible contractors for a government project. The Karnataka Slum Development Board project was aimed at building 50,000 houses at a cost of ₹2,500 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The BJP has demanded a CBI probe into the alleged scam.
