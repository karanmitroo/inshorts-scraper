BSP Chief Mayawati on Tuesday said that the BJP should reveal its ministers' bank account transaction details before the announcement of demonetisation. "BJP is misusing the state machinery to malign the name of BSP," she added. Her statement comes after over ₹104 crore were detected in an account linked to BSP and ₹1.5 crore in the account of Mayawati's brother.
