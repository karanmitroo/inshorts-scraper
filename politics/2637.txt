Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday mocked Yogi Adityanath-led state government saying, "When we will form the government again in 2022, we will sprinkle Gangajal...in all the government offices to purify them." He further said, "Incidents (of violence) are happening all over the state now, but they are not being highlighted with Yogi's picture in the media."
