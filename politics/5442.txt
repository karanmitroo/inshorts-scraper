The Goa Congress on Monday criticised the felicitation planned for Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and said,"[I]f the BJP wants to felicitate, it must be our brave soldiers." BJP is trying to "sell" the 'surgical strike' for political gains, and it is "disgusting", Goa Congress said. Parrikar must resign over attacks like Baramullah if he accepts the felicitation, the party added.
