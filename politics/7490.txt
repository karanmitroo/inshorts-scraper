Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Kalikho Pul and 29 Congress MLAs, including Speaker Wangki Lowang, have merged with the Peoples Party of Arunachal (PPA), the state's only regional party. Pul said that the decision was because the Congress high command sidelined them. The Congress now has 15 MLAs, whereas Pul's government is being supported by 43 MLAs, including 11 BJP MLAs.
