The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to give time to former AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala and asked her to surrender immediately. Sasikala had asked the apex court for some time to manage her affairs before going to jail, her advocate KTS Tulsi said. This comes after the court awarded her a four-year jail sentence in the disproportionate assets case.
