A CCTV footage submitted to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) shows AIADMK interim General Secretary VK Sasikala entering the Bengaluru jail she is lodged in, in civilian clothes. The footage, submitted by the former DGP Prisons, allegedly suggests that she had gone out of the prison. She is seen walking back inside with a bag, along with her relative Ilavarasi.
