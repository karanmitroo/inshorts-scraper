Addressing a gathering in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has said the rise in population isnâ€™t because of the Hindus, but due to those who support the concept of four wives and 40 children. Notably, his remarks came after the Supreme Court ruled that religion, caste, community wouldn't be allowed to play any role in the electoral process.
