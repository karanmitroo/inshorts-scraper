Congress leader Kapil Sibal took a jibe at PM Narendra Modi's emotional speech during a meeting with all NDA MPs on Tuesday stating that after crying, the PM must come to the House so that the Parliament can function. He also said that the PM must be crying as he must have realised that his policies have killed 70 people.
