Soon after BSP chief Mayawati rejected Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's proposal to join hands, Mulayam on Wednesday night ruled out any alliance with BSP, making a volte face. “The Samajwadi Party will fight the BJP alone”, Mulayam said. Earlier Mulayam had said that he was ready to join hands with BSP, if Lalu Prasad Yadav mediates.
