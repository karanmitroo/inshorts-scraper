The PMO has sought an explanation from the Kerala government over a district administration order that barred RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat from hoisting the national flag on Independence Day at a Palakkad school. The explanation was sought based on a petition filed by BJP district president E Krishnadas, who termed the order as a blatant misuse of the state machinery.
