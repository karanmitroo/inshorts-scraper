Reacting to the recent murders of engineers in Bihar, Union Minister and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday said that 'Jungle Raj' was back in the state. "Who will come to invest in the state when engineers and doctors are murdered," he questioned. He added that he had predicted before Assembly elections that Nitish-Lalu will bring 'Jungle Raj' again.
