RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday slammed the BJP for the International Yoga Day celebrations by calling it a yoga of politics. "[T]his yoga is being propagated by the hypocrites of BJP, this yoga is... not of making a body healthy. The Modi government is conducting its own PR by advertising something as personal as yoga," he said.
