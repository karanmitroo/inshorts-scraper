West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the party is revamping its state unit with re-jigs, keeping "an eye on 2016 assembly polls." While many leaders were removed from top posts, actress-turned-politician Rupa Ganguly was made the state's women's wing President. Ghosh added, "The people are with us and it was proved in recent law violation programmes across the state."
