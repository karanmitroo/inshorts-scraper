Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said that the BJP or any organisation linked to the party was not involved in journalist Gauri Lankesh's killing. This comes after Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi linked the murder to the BJP claiming that, "Anybody who speaks against the RSS/BJP is attacked & even killed". "The allegation is baseless and a lie," Gadkari added.
