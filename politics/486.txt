Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Wednesday claimed that some members of the BJP, RSS and Bajrang Dal were terrorists. The government will not tolerate any organisation which tries to hamper peace in the society, he added. Slamming Siddaramaiah over his remark, the BJP accused him of trying to polarise the upcoming Karnataka Assembly elections on communal lines.
