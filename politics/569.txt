Stating that western attire is "foreign imposed slavishness", BJP MP Subramanian Swamy urged the party to make it mandatory for members to shun western clothing and wear "Indian climate friendly clothes". "Article 49 of Const (Constitution)  directs alcohol drinks be banned. While I am not for penal action, BJP should make as part of party discipline," he further tweeted.
