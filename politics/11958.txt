Expelled AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny Wednesday decided to withdraw support to the Delhi government, while terming CM Arvind Kejriwal of being "more dangerous" than a corrupt person. Binny, however, said he would support the government on the matter of Jan Lokpal Bill. Binny had Sunday threatened to pull down the government if his demands were not met within 48-hours.
