In spite of the violence by naxalites, who have called for a poll boycott, the first phase of assembly elections in Chhattisgarh witnessed 67% voting across 18 constituencies of Bastar and Rajnandgaon. However, Naxalite resistance dominated in  polling booths of Durgapur and Sitram in Kanker district, which led to the failure of voting in these two places.
