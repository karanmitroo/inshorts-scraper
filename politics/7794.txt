Congress leader Digvijay Singh called the Indian media "gullible" for reporting the arrest of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar without a confirmation by any official agency. Ministry of External Affairs "was leaking Azhar Masood arrest story", he alleged on twitter. His comments come amid uncertainty surrounding Azhar's arrest by Pakistan in relation to the Pathankot attack.
