Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Friday said, "Modi government's new buzzword 'udaan' has found a new meaning - every scamster can flee and fly undetected and unchecked." This comes after reports claimed that jeweller Nirav Modi, who is accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of over â‚¹11,000 crore, left India a month before PNB reported the scam to CBI.
