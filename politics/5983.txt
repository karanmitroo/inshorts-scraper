Criticising PM Narendra Modi over his ‘delayed’ reaction on Dalit attacks, BSP chief Mayawati has said that he was sleeping like Kumbhkaran when the attacks happened. She further alleged that the PM’s speech was politically motivated to woo Dalit votes in 2017 UP polls. Dalits do not need sympathy from BJP, but action against the culprits, she added.
