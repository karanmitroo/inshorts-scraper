Congress' deputy leader in Lok Sabha and former CM of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, has hinted of a split in the party if Rahul Gandhi replaces Sonia Gandhi as the party's president. “I hope that a split does not happen. But if senior leaders are sidelined, they will have to think of other options,” he said.
