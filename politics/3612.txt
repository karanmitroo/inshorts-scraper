A day after Mulayam Singh Yadav spoke against the SP-Congress alliance and refused to campaign for the same, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said, "I am sure he will campaign for us." While Mulayam had said that there was no need for the political tie-up, Akhilesh said that the SP-Congress alliance will "firm up the verdict" in Assembly elections.
