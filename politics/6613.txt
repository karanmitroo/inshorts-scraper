Reacting to Congress making MLAs sign 'loyalty bonds', TMC MP Saugata Roy said, “Congress doesn’t have faith in their own elected MLAs and that is why they are taking such steps. It is laughable." He also said the anti-defection law already existed to deal with such situations. Congress earlier made its elected MLAs sign bonds pledging allegiance to the party.
