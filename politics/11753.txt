Advocate Ashok Aggarwal, a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national executive, resigned on Tuesday from the post and the party. "...lately things seem to have changed and the objectives and goals that it (the AAP) had created are getting lost. People like me, are feeling that the party is functioning like a private limited company," Aggarwal said.
