Ahead of Delhi civic polls, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav has sought AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal's resignation if his political party fails to win 50% seats in the election. "You have broken the trust of the people of Delhi. Following your betrayal, the public has lost faith in its own capability to distinguish good from bad," he added.
