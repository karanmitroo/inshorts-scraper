Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday expressed his pain on the ongoing tussle in his party. "I am deeply hurt and pained by what is going on in the party. This is betrayal of trust that Delhi posed in us," he tweeted. "I refuse to be drawn in this ugly battle. Will concentrate only on Delhi's governance," he added.
