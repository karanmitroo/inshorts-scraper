Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Friday said that PM Narendra Modiâ€™s puppy has grown into General VK Singh's dog. Recently, Singh had said that the government was not responsible if someone throws a stone at a dog. Similarly, Modi had earlier used a puppy analogy while sympathising with Gujarat riot victims. Further, Khan blamed pornography on smartphones for rape.
