Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu on Monday reportedly deleted a tweet paying "tributes to revolutionary freedom fighter" Veer Savarkar on his death anniversary. Naidu may have deleted the tweet due to the strained relationship between TDP and BJP as the BJP holds Savarkar, who is said to have coined the term 'Hindutva', in high esteem, reports said.
