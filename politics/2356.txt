Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said that even a united Opposition cannot take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2019 general elections. "Opposition parties have been left with nothing. Their coming together won't make any difference. It is also because of the fact that the credibility of Opposition leaders is low," he added.
