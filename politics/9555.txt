Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday that in case of a water shortage during the peak months, even the VIPs won't be exempted from a cut in supply. "Water supply shortage will be faced by all the VIPs starting from me. Only Prime Minister, President, embassies and emergency services will be exempted," he said, slamming water politics.
