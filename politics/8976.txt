Responding to veteran BJP leader Shanta Kumarâ€™s concerns over the Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that the scam was the propaganda of Congress, which was playing politics over the scam-related deaths. The CM further added that no one was benefited from 31 Vyapam-related deaths, which took place between 2007 and 2015.
