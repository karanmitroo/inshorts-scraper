Taking a jibe at PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation move, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said that if Nitin Gadkari wants to become PM this is an opportunity for him as he also has the backing of RSS. "I'm told it was only Gadkari who questioned Modi on the issue of demonetisation. But Modi brushed him aside," Digvijaya alleged.
