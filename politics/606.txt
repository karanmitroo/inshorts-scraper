Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the result of Gujarat Assembly elections was a "massive jolt" to BJP. "People in Gujarat do not approve of Modi Ji's model, the marketing and propaganda is very good but it is hollow from the inside," Rahul added. This comes after BJP won the elections with 99 seats, while Congress secured 77 seats.
