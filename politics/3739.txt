Speaking about the Samajwadi Party and Congress alliance in Uttar Pradesh, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Monday said that the 'bicycle' (SP's poll symbol) will speed away as the 'hand' (Congress' poll symbol) keeps it steady. "I'm very sure that this alliance will strengthen our position in the UP elections. We will win 300 plus seats," Sibal added.
