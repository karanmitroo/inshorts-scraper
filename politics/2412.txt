A BJP candidate for the upcoming MCD polls in Delhi Sunita Kaushik, touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city's urban poor, turned out to be a crorepati. In her election affidavit, Kaushik reported assets worth over â‚¹1 crore, including two residential houses. AAP spokesperson Dilip Pandey termed BJP's support for the poor "hypocrisy" and "fake".
