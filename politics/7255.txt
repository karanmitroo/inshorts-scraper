Addressing a rally in Assam's Tinsukia district, PM Modi on Saturday said that his fight is not against the state's CM Tarun Gogoi, but against poverty, corruption and destruction of Assam. He said that his agenda was development. Modi added that he remains indebted to the state as it was Assam tea that refreshed people when he was a tea-seller.
