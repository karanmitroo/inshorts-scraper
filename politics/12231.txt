Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday warned party workers not to indulge in "goonda gardi" (highhandedness) or else he would throw them out. Mulayam said the image of a leader depended on the conduct of his party workers in public and even attributed the success of BJP in the recent assembly elections to their "well-behaved" party workers.
