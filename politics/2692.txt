The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Central government, "Why no action was taken against BJP and Congress over alleged foreign funding". In 2014, the court had ordered the Election Commission and the Home Ministry to look into the accounts of the Congress and BJP for traces of foreign funds and take action within six months.
