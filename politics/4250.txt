PM Narendra Modi on Thursday reacted to ex-PM Manmohan Singh's 'monumental mismanagement' remark, stating it came from a leader who was at the helm of India's economic journey for around 45 years. All this while large sections of our society have continued to live in poverty, he added. Singh had earlier called demonetisation "monumental mismanagement... organised loot and legalised plunder".
