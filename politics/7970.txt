Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav did not attend the inaugural day of the Saifai Mahotsav on Saturday. Samajwadi Party Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav inaugurated it in Akhilesh's absence. Media reports speculated Akhilesh missed the function because two of his close aides were removed from key positions in SP units. The party's state spokesperson said he had "no clue about it".
