Accusing the former Gujarat CM Narendra Modi of taking ₹40 crore in kickbacks from Sahara, Congress on Friday tweeted a list which also had ex-Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit’s name as a recipient of ₹1 crore. The record showed that ₹1 crore in cash was given to Dikshit on September 23, 2013 in Delhi. Notably, Dikshit is Congress' UP CM candidate.
