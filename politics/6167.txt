NCP leader and ex-Union Minister Praful Patel has accused Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government of shielding its former Cabinet minister Eknath Khadse in the series of charges levelled against him. We were always sceptical about the ACB probe and the way itâ€™s going, he would be protected, said Patel. He further slammed Fadnavis for inducting alleged tainted individuals in his Cabinet.
