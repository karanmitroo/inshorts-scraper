A CBI probe has been demanded by suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad to look into alleged corruption charges against Delhi's cricket board, the DDCA. "It has nothing to do with BJP. It is about corruption in sports... Don't bring Arun Jaitley into this," said Azad. He expressed willingness to share evidence with the Delhi government's inquiry commission for the issue.
