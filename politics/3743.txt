CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has claimed that the BJP has already been given 'talaq' twice in the Delhi and Bihar polls, and the people of Uttar Pradesh will now give the party its third 'talaq'. "And finally, they will be ousted...in the 2019 General Election,” Yechury added. He also accused the Centre of “unleashing a financial emergency” through demonetisation.
