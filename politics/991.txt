Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday slammed Congress leader P Chidambaram's remark on 'Azadi' in J&K, saying it was an insult to soldiers, and showed how the party felt on surgical strikes and the bravery of the Army. "People who were in power yesterday... those people are taking a complete U-turn. Shamelessly making these statements," he added.
