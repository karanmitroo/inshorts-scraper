BJP leader Raghubar Das has been unanimously elected as the first non-tribal Chief Minster of Jharkhand. Das has formerly held the posts of Deputy Chief Minister and BJP Vice President. He became the front-runner for the post after three-time former Chief Minister Arjun Munda lost the election from his constituency, Kharsawan.
