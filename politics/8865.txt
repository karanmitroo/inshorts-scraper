A fake candidate allegedly sat for university exams on Tuesday as proxy for Shanti Kashyap, wife of Chhattisgarh Education Minister Kedar Kashyap. As soon as the incident came to light, the dummy woman candidate reportedly fled from the examination centre, leaving her answer sheet behind. A two-member committee has been constituted to probe the incident, a senior official said.
