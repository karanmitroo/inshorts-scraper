NCP MP Supriya Sule has compared Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis with “women who fight for water at public taps”. Addressing a party rally in Pune, Sule also said that Fadnavis is short-tempered and she is scared that he may throw something at her if she visits him next time. “He should maintain the dignity of the post,” she added.
