Congress Spokesperson Tom Vaddakan on Saturday called Russia's move of denying military exercise with Pakistan a tactic. "It's apparently clear, the exercise is on, but only the locale is being changed," Vaddakan said. He further said that India should pay more attention to India's relation with Russia as the country is a part of the entire security network.
