Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to remain silent when rationalists were killed and writers protested the issue of intolerance in the country. He said that protests nowadays meant "sedition" in India and added, "Gen VK Singh likened Dalit children to dogs, but PM allows him to continue as minister as if nothing happened."
