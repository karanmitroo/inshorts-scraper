The Congress on Wednesday demanded an immediate ban on advertisements promoting casinos in Goa, claiming that it will cast a wrong impression on young minds. "Just like there is a ban on advertising cigarette and alcohol, there should be a ban on advertisements promoting casinos," Goa Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro said.
