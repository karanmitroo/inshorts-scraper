JD(U) leader Ali Anwar on Thursday said the BJP is targeting Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra because he belongs to a political family. "It will harm the ruling party ultimately because... they are working with political vengeance against a political family," he added. "There are many such allegations against BJP leaders, but they are not targeted," Anwar said.
