DMDK Chief Vijayakanth on Friday compared the quality of roads laid in Tamil Nadu during the ruling AIADMK regime to "parottas" (South Indian bread), which broke into pieces. He said, "My drive from Tiruttani to Chennai was tiring. This was owing to the condition of roads laid by AIADMK government which came apart like the parottas."
