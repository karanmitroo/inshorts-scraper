Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) founder member and former MP Ilyas Azmi on Monday quit the party, citing "lack of inner democracy" and Arvind Kejriwal's "autocratic style of functioning". "...muslims and people from backward classes are completely being ignored. There is hardly any Muslim representation," Azmi added. This comes a week after he was dropped from the party's top decision-making bodies.
