Sidelined BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Friday claimed that 80% people in the BJP wanted former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani to be nominated as the Presidential candidate of the ruling coalition. He added that others in the party did not speak on this as they may have feared being denied a ticket in elections.
