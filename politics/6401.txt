After Minister of State for HRD Ram Shankar Katheria said that saffronisation of education and the country will happen if needed, the BJP MP has clarified his remarks. "I just said whatever is good for the nation, we’ll accept that; whether it's saffron or green or red,” he said while alleging that attempts were being made to discredit 'saffron'.
