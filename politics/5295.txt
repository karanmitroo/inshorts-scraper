Congress on Saturday said that if it is voted to power in Uttar Pradesh, it will carve out a special quota for the Most Backward Castes (MBCs) within the 27% Other Backward Class (OBC) reservation. The promise will be included in the party manifesto for the 2017 UP assembly elections, Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said.
