Union minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said the Congress is habitual of putting the blame of defeat on the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). This came after Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia claimed that three EVMs in Gujarat's Porbandar were rigged using Bluetooth. Singh added that this time Congress has grown wiser and started accusing the EVMs even before the results.
