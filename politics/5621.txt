The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday suspended its MLA Devinder Sehrawat from the primary membership of the party, AAP's Delhi unit convenor Dilip Pandey said. This comes after Sehrawat accused party men in Punjab of "exploiting women" in return for tickets. Reportedly, Sehrawat had also accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal of shielding people involved in such acts.
