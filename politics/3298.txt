Calling the demand to ban Shiv Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamna' a proclamation of direct emergency, Sena on Thursday threatened BJP of dire consequences if it goes ahead with the move. "Saamna is not only a newspaper but also a weapon. If BJP tries to ban Saamna then they will get to know what Saamna is all about," Sena's Sanjay Raut asserted.
