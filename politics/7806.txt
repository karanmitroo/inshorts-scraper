PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday took a jibe at the Congress in a rally in Assam, and said those who did nothing in 15 years are expecting results in 15 months. Attributing the state's failed development to former PM Manmohan Singh, who represents Assam in Rajya Sabha, Modi promised that the Centre's 'Act east policy' will focus on infrastructure development.
