A book on Sonia Gandhi by Spanish author Javier Moro titled 'The Red Sari', which was earlier banned from being published in India, has finally hit book stores in the country. "The Red Sari tells the story of an extraordinary woman whose dreams of home, hearth and anonymous living were struck down by the hands of fate," the book says.
