BJPÂ on Tuesday criticised the Samajwadi Party for reportedly willing to merge with the Quami Ekta Dal (QED), saying that would worsen the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh. Mukhtar Ansari is a don and he formed the QED while being in jail for the past 15 years, the BJP said. QED, however, refuted the reports of such merger.
