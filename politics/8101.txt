Supreme Court lawyer HS Phoolka reportedly said on Saturday that Congress member Jagdish Tytler was being shielded by Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh in the 1984 riots case. Phoolka accused Singh of giving Tytler a clean chit to become the president of the Punjab Congress. He said, "He is acting against the interests of the victims and... Punjab."
