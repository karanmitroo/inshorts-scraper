Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to the Election Commission on Saturday requesting the body to withdraw his security cover in poll-bound Punjab. "Our clear position is that given the law and order situation of Punjab, all security apparatus should be deployed for the safety and security of the people of the state," Kejriwal wrote in the letter.
