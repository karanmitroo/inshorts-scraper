In the video that surfaced Sunday, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal targetted Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav by saying, "When the whole Delhi stood by us, some friends of ours cheated us... backstabbed us." Kejriwal also said, "Yogendra Yadav was planting stories against me." He further alleged that the duo had also stopped volunteers and donors from campaigning and donating money.
