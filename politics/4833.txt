AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal has said his party can even lie down at PM Narendra Modi's feet for the sake of Punjab. "Even if something is not done, we will struggle and fight out and will ask him 'sadda haq aithe rakh..'" he asserted. In Delhi, the Central government interferes a lot, but they still fulfilled their promises, Kejriwal claimed.
