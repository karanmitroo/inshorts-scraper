Objecting to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's decision to form an alliance with NDA, Kerala JD(U) President Veerendra Kumar has announced plans to resign from the Rajya Sabha. Stating that Nitish considers him "one of the tall socialist leaders in the country", Veerendra said the CM urged him to not resign. He is yet to file his resignation papers.
