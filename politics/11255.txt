In connection to Narendra Modiâ€™s interview (which was aired on DD on Apr-27), Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar admitted on Friday that some parts of the interview "were apparently edited". He pointed a finger at Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari for failing to grant the "operational autonomy" that the public broadcaster had been seeking for years.
