Union Minister Uma Bharti on Monday said that since no Opposition has been left in India, the BJP will have to perform the role of the Opposition as well. "These election results have shown that we have reached a position which the Congress had occupied for a long timeâ€¦but at that time we were a strong Opposition," she added.
