All the four Trinamool Congress MLAs in Manipur, including the party's state President Thounaojam Shyamkumar Singh, have joined the ruling Congress. In 2012, six Trinamool candidates were elected to the Manipur assembly. Three of them were disqualified in 2015, but one was allowed to attend the house. This comes after a Congress MLA in the state recently joined the BJP.
