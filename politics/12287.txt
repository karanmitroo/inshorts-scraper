Following Congress's failure in Rajasthan, former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot on Thursday blamed Gujarat CM Narendra Modi of tampering with the EVMs. Gehlot alleged that the EVMs used in the state polls, which were programmed in Ahmedabad, were tampered in a way to ensure every fifth vote, irrespective of the button pressed, was cast in favour of the BJP.
