Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu, along with 42 Congress MLAs, has left the grand-old party and joined the regional Peopleâ€™s Party of Arunachal (PPA). However, former CM and senior Congress leader Nabam Tuki has stayed with the party. Notably, in July the Supreme Court had reinstated the Congress government in the state after a political crisis.
