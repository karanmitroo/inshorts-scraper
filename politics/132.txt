After Justice Revati Mohite-Dere was transferred three weeks after she began day-to-day hearings in the Sohrabuddin encounter case, Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "The Sohrabuddin case claims yet another Judge." Gandhi also shared a report titled, 'Fresh questions as judge who lifted media gag and slammed CBI is replaced'. BJP President Amit Shah was an accused in the case earlier.
