The opposition Congress on Friday slammed the Centre over the repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the international border in Jammu and Kashmir. "Those who came to power proclaiming 56-inch chest and had promised action against Pakistan have proved actionless. The government has failed to take any stern action," Congress spokesman Meem Afzal said.
