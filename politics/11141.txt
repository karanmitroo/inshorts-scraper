A Ghaziabad court on Thursday issued a non-bailable warrant against MNS chief Raj Thackeray for not appearing before it in connection with a case filed for his allegedly inflammatory speech against the people of Bihar. The court has posted the matter for June 18 and ordered Thackeray to appear before it on that date.
