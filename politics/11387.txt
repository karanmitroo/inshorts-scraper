AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and his parents, Gita Devi and Gobind Kejriwal, moved out from the Sankat Mochan temple complex (Varanasi) Friday morning, after temple authorities reportedly expressed displeasure over the ongoing political activity in the temple premises. They had been staying in the temple since April 15, as guests of the temple's head priest - Bishambhar Mishra.
