Jammu and Kashmir CM and Peoples Democratic Party President Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday won the Anantnag by-poll, defeating Congress candidate Hilal Shah by over 12,000 votes. The Congress had briefly halted the counting of votes in the morning, alleging discrepancies in several Electronic Voting Machines. The Anantnag seat fell vacant after former CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed expired in January.
