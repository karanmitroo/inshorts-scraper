As many as 453 country-made pistols were seized from three factories in Shamli district in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the police said on Friday. The police had reportedly received information about the factories after they intercepted two vehicles carrying arms at the Haryana-UP border. "These factories were manufacturing and supplying arms for the upcoming Assembly election," an official said.
