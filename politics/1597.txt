Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and his family's name is involved in Panama Papers, but no action has been taken against them. He made the statement while citing Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif's recent resignation that came after the country's Supreme Court recommended an anti-corruption case against him over his involvement in Panama Papers.
