Condemning Congress' video mocking PM Narendra Modi's hugs with world leaders, BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said this is the lowest the Opposition party has ever stooped. Adding that the Congress would apologise if they have any sense left, Javadekar said, "Cyrus Broacha making fun of the PM is different, the main opposition party doing it is different."
