The BJP has said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is determined to turn his party into "Indian Fake News Congress". This comes after Gandhi posted a former Army soldier's photo, wherein he appeared troubled standing in a queue to withdraw cash after demonetisation. BJP claimed Gandhi's post was misleading since the soldier had publicly expressed his support for demonetisation.
