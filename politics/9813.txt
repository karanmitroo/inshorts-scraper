A day after Jitan Ram Manjhi claimed that he is still the CM of Bihar, JDU spokesperson KC Tyagi said, "Manjhi has been expelled from the party." Accusing Manjhi of being involved in 'anti-party activities,' Tyagi said, "Sharad Yadav removed Jitan Ram Manjhi as a member of the JDU on charges of indiscipline."
