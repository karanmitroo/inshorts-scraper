Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation move is the "biggest impromptu financial experiment". Claiming that Modi did not discuss the move with anyone before, Gandhi said, "This isn't Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's decision but the PM's." He further said, "Opposition parties are only demanding that PM should come and address the Parliament".
