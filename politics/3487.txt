Late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa Jayakumar has said people are scared of the state's CM-elect Sasikala Natarajan. Further, Jayakumar added that the situation is very sad and people had not chosen Sasikala as the CM. "To become a Chief Minister being with someone for 33 years is not a qualification," Jayakumar said about Jayalalithaa's one-time close aide.
