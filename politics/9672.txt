Some discrepancies like different transactions with the same cheque number and anonymous contributions have been found in the BJP's donation list submitted to the Election Commission. According to Association for Democratic Reforms, there are three pairs of transactions having the same cheque or demand draft number. BJP sources said that this could be due to an oversight or typographic error.
