West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused PM Narendra Modi-led BJP government of non-cooperation. "The funds go to the Centre from the revenue we earn. And the Centre gives us a small amount from that," she said. "Had there been full cooperation of the Centre, huge employment opportunities could have been generated in the state," Banerjee added.
