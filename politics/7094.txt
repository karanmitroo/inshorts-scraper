BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday said there was "no economic basis whatsoever"  on the proposed excise duty on non-silver jewellery, and it should be withdrawn, like the EPF tax. There are other ways to generate revenue, like through VAT, which will not affect common people, Swamy said. Meanwhile, the Centre has formed a panel to look into the issue.
