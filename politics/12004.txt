Referring to his own party, the National Conference, J&K CM Omar Abdullah has admitted that the UPA could lose a potential ally, ahead of the J&K elections. "There are reservations in my party about fighting elections together with the Congress and there are sections in the Congress that would rather go it alone," Abdullah further said.
