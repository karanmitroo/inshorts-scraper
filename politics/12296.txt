In an interview to NDTV, AAP leader Prashant Bhushan said: "If the BJP gives us in writing that it will pass the Jan Lokpal Bill by Dec-29 and set up 'Jan Sabhas' in Delhi, as promised by the AAP, we may consider supporting the party." But he maintained that it was his view and not that of his party.
