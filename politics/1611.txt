Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah said on Monday that the previous government was so ineffective that no one knew who was the Prime Minister and who was not. "Under the previous government, every month, there were cases of corruption, but we have completed three years, and there is not even one case of corruption against us," he added.
