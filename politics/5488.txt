After a shoe was hurled at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh, he asked the people of BJP and RSS to throw as many shoes as they want. Adding that he doesn't fear the BJP or RSS people, Gandhi said, "Your anger is your weakness, I'm not going to take it even if you give it to me."
