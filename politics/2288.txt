Union Minister Uma Bharti has said, "I am happy... Being an accused in Ayodhya movement is not a taint. I consider this as a chandan tilak on forehead." She further said, "The movement was to assert that where Ram Lalla is sitting today was the birthplace of Lord Ram. The court has given its seal on that."
