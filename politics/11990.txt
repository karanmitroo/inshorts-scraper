The NTPC on Saturday served notices of power supply suspension to the two Reliance Infrastructureâ€™s discoms due to payment issues. If the two discoms fail to pay Rs. 449 crore by Feb-10, NTPC will suspend power supply to them. The power supply suspension will affect nearly 34 lakh consumers in central, south, east and west Delhi.
