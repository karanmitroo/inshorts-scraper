The BJP has demanded the resignation of Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh who is under the scanner over alleged disproportionate assets case. The political party has also decided to launch a two-month long campaign which will begin with 'Virbhadra Hatao, Pradesh Bachao' on October 8. Earlier, the High Court had barred the CBI from arresting the CM.
