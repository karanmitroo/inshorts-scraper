The Aviation Ministry has issued an order withdrawing the direct runway access given to Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Yadav and his wife Rabri Devi at the Patna airport, according to reports. The privilege was reportedly withdrawn owing to the fact that neither of the two leaders hold any constitutional post at present.
