The Shiv Sena has targeted media houses, by sending them legal notices on Tuesday, following their criticism, over the alleged force-feeding of a Muslim employee of Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi during Ramzan. The party sent notice to the Indian Express and asked it to tender an unconditional apology within 24 hours. It wants them to apologise or face defamation suits.
