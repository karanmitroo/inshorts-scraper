A day after actor Kamal Haasan met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Subramanian Swamy termed the duo as "zero". "The actor is a big zero and a pompous idiot, while Arvind Kejriwal is another big zero. And if they come together, zero plus zero. Haven't you learnt at school what it means?" Swamy said.
