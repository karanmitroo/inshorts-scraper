Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be attending the iftar party hosted by President Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Thursday. He is scheduled to meet the chief ministers of northeastern states on that day “to discuss important development projects.” Last year too, Modi had skipped the iftar party, which the President has been hosting since he took office.
