The Income Tax Department on Thursday asked RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadavâ€™s daughter Misa Bharti and her husband Shailesh Kumar to appear before it on Monday. Reports suggest that a criminal case is likely to be filed against the two. This comes after the I-T Department raided 22 places over alleged benami property deals involving Lalu Prasad and his family.
