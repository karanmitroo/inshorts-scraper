Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday raised the issue of granting full statehood to Delhi in light of the recent incident where a 13-year-old mentally challenged girl was allegedly raped by a neighbour. Kejriwal, who went to meet the victim at AIIMS, said, â€œDelhi is not a full state as a result of which such problems are coming up repeatedly."
