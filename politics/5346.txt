Ahead of AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal’s rally in Gujarat’s Surat city, banners featuring him along with terrorists Osama bin Laden, Burhan Wani, and Hafiz Saeed were put up across the city. The banners also had the caption “Heroes of Pakistan”. The banners were put up by the BJP as it doesn’t want Kejriwal's public rally here, the AAP alleged.
