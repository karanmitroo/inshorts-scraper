In an interview, Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptullah has said that the idea of Indians being 'Hindus' had 'evolved in history'. "The word Hindu originally referred to the national identity of people who live in this land. I look at it very rationally," she added. Earlier also, she had kicked controversy by saying that Muslims were not a minority.
