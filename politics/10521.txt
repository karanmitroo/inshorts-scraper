The Mayawati-led BSP is set to lose its status as a national party since it failed to win the two seats it needed to enjoy this status. The party had contested on all 90 seats of Harayana and 260 seats in Maharashra. However, it could secureonly one Haryana seat. The election commission will now take a formal decision on this.
