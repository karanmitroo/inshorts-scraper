RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday claimed that the Centre was abolishing the 27% quota for OBCs in the recruitment of professors and associate professors in central universities. "This is an attempt to kill the ideology of Dalit icon B R Ambedkar," he alleged. Senior UGC officials, however, clarified that there has been no change in the reservation policy.
