The Congress Opposition on Friday said in the Gujarat Assembly that if the government brings a proposal to declare cow as "Rashtra Mata", the party will support it. The BJP, however, maintained silence over the matter. Notably, an activist in Rajkot had committed suicide on Thursday after he, along with seven others, consumed pesticide, demanding "Rashtra Mata" status for cow.
