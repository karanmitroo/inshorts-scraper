The RSS has converted temples into 'shakhas', and its cadres are storing weapons in the temples, Kerala's Temple Affairs Minister Kadakampally Surendran alleged on Monday. "The government will take strong action against... (such) shakhas,’’ he said. Claiming that this shows the "cultural fascism" of the government, BJP dared the minister to reveal the temple in which RSS is conducting shakhas.
