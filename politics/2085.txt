Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav on Friday said the Dharmanirpeksha (Secular) Sevak Sangh (DSS) will counter the BJP and RSS at every step. "Today RSS is spreading religious fanaticism and fanning out its divisive ideology in the country," he alleged. Notably, DSS is an organisation of youth formed by RJD chief Lalu Yadavâ€™s elder son Tej Pratap.
