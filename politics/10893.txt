Shiv Sena MP Rajan Vichare who 'force-fed' a chapatti in the mouth of a fasting Muslim employee in New Maharashtra Sadan, has expressed regret over his action saying he didnâ€™t know that he was a Muslim. But the employee, Arshad Zubair has refused to buy the MP's defence saying that he was wearing his uniform which had a name tag.
