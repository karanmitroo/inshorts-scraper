The BJP on Wednesday alleged that former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat ordered the police to tap phones of BJP leaders and his rivals, among others. The BJP claimed the police had informed in an RTI that it recorded 378 such calls since June 2015. The party asserted they would ask the Governor to order an inquiry into the matter.
