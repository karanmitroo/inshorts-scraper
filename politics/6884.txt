The BJP on Friday welcomed the Bombay High Court order to demolish the Adarsh Housing Society in Mumbai. "It should be demolished because Adarsh was nothing but a monument of political corruption in Maharashtra," said BJP leader Kirit Somaiya. Earlier in the day, the Bombay High Court ordered an enquiry against the 'politicians, ministers, and officers' involved in the scam.
