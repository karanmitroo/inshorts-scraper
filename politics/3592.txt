In a jibe at SP-Congress alliance, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said the Congress party has been relegated to being the 'carrier' of Samajwadi Party's election symbol 'cycle'. After Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi alleged that Centre did not provide employment to the youth, Naidu said Congress itself did not get "employment" and they are just disappointed.
