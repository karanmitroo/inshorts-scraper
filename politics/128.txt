Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge has rejected Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to attend the meeting on the appointment of a Lokpal as a 'special invitee'. Kharge called the special invitee invitation a "concerted effort to exclude the independent voice of the opposition altogether from the selection process of the most important anti-corruption watchdog."
