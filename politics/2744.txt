Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Sunday asked actor Anupam Kher if he would change his views on BJP MP Yogi Adityanath now. His remark came after Adityanath was declared UP's CM. Earlier, during an event, Anupam had said that people like Yogi Adityanath and Sadhvi Prachi who speak nonsense should be thrown out of BJP and put behind the bars.
