A government school in West Bengal reportedly distributed maps showing parts of Kashmir in Pakistan during a Geography examination. BJP State General Secretary Raju Banerjee claimed that the map also showed Arunachal Pradesh outside the Indian border. Alleging that the map was circulated by Trinamool Congress-led teachers, BJP said the party supported terrorists.
