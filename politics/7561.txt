A delegation of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) met Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki on Monday seeking dismissal of the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government. INLD sought the government's dismissal over alleged failure in controlling law and order in Haryana, which "worsened" during the Jat stir. The party also sought a judicial probe into the "untoward happenings" during the agitation.
