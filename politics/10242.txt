The Delhi Police has banned radio channels from playing the Aam Aadmi Party's jingle on women security, preventing defamation. In the jingle, a woman narrates her tale of being eve-teased and getting refused by police to file a complaint. A senior police official said that action will be taken if it's a true story, but it's defaming if fictional.
