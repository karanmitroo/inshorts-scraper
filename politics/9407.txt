Following controversy over Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut's demand to withdraw voting rights from Muslims, party chief Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday asked why nobody reacted when AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi spoke of "finishing Hindus." "I want to ask those who exploit Muslims for their political gains whether they would continue to do so if Muslims had no voting rights," he added.
