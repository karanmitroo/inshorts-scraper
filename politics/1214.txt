Sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran on Monday claimed that his aunt and ousted AIADMK chief VK Sasikala has a video of late CM J Jayalalithaa in the hospital. The video will be submitted to the committee probing Jayalalithaa's death, he added. This comes after Tamil Nadu minister Dindigul Sreenivasan claimed they were forced to lie about Jayalalithaa's improving health.
