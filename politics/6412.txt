AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday claimed that 50,000 Muslims had migrated after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and asked if BJP would send a fact-finding mission, like that in Kairana over Hindu migration. Owaisi said claims of the exodus of Hindu families in Kairana were "bogus" and alleged that this "drama" suited the interests of BJP and the Samajwadi Party.
