BJP MP Varun Gandhi has said he broke down after reading the suicide note of Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula. He also referred Vemula's suicide as an incident of discrimination against Dalits. "Rohith wrote... he was taking the extreme step because he had committed the sin of taking birth in such form. This line pained my heart immensely," Varun said.
