The Home Affairs Ministry has denied reports that National Security Advisor Ajit Doval attended a BJP meeting on election strategies at Home Minister Rajnath Singh's residence. The ministry clarified that Doval was instead part of a regular meeting on national security. Earlier, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had alleged that Doval's presence at the political meeting violated norms.
