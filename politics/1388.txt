An FIR has been registered against AAP and its minister Imran Hussain for seeking votes in the name of religion by putting up posters asking Muslims to vote for the party. The BJP had filed a complaint with the Election Commission alleging that the language used in the poster is highly objectionable and seeks to divide peace-loving communities in Delhi.
