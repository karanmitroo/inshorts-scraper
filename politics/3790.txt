Former PM Manmohan Singh, in a letter dated 2015, had termed the bull-taming sport Jallikattu a "cruel form of entertainment", while the Congress party has supported the protests against its ban in 2017. Adding that traditional Jallikattu must be allowed, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has said that it is much better than bullfighting in Spain where the Bull is killed.
