Doctors witnessed a slight improvement in the health of former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, though he is still on life support and unconscious. After conducting a check on Tuesday, doctors said the improvement was very slow. Singh was admitted early on Friday after a fall at his residence that left him with a head injury.
