The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday suspended party leader Jassi Jasraj for 6 years for allegedly indulging in "anti-party activities". The Punjabi singer-turned-politician has been speaking against the party and uploading videos on social media for long, said an AAP leader. The party said that it had been forced to take action after giving many warnings to the leader.
