Congress leader Pramod Tiwari on Wednesday said "Kisi shabya desh ne yeh nhi kia" (No civilised nation has demonetised its currency) other than "Gaddafi, Mussolini, Hitler" and the fourth being PM Narendra Modi. This government has betrayed the trust of the country, he added. Reacting to his remarks, BJP said that it's totally wrong to compare Modi with these dictators.
