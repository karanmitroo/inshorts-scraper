Minutes after UP CM Akhilesh Yadav was re-inducted into the Samajwadi Party, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday said he had phoned SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav at 8 AM and urged him to call Akhilesh. “Urged him not to lose an almost certain win and avoid sycophants,” he added. SP will form the government in UP, he predicted.
