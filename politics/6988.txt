The Election Commission on Thursday postponed Anantnag Assembly seat  bypoll in Jammu and Kashmir, after the government said the law and order situation was "not conducive". This was former Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's constituency, which fell vacant in January after his death. The bypoll for Ghoradongri seat in Madhya Pradesh was also postponed due to the upcoming Simhastha Mahakumbh.
