The Arunachal Pradesh government on Wednesday said it has implemented a paperless system to cut down on the time taken to hold a cabinet meeting. The 'e-Cabinet' system uses a web-based software by which ministers can prepare for cabinet meetings, an official report said. The system is a multi-user secure solution that keeps information updated in real time.
