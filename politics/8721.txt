After receiving flak for saying that Sunny Leone's condom ad was the reason for increasing rapes, CPI leader Atul Anjan on Thursday apologised to Leone's supporters. Anjan said that he was not anti-condom, but the language used in the advertisement was not right. He also maintained that he was still against such ads and demanded a check on their broadcast.
