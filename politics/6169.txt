Navjot Kaur Sidhu, wife of Navjot Singh Sidhu, on Tuesday clarified that she has not resigned from the BJP even though her husband’s resignation from the Rajya Sabha means that he has quit the party. On prospects of Sidhu joining AAP, she said, “To serve Punjab he has no other option, but to serve from Aam Aadmi Party."
