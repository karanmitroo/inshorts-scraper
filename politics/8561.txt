A video of DMK Leader MK Stalin manhandling an autodriver who was trying to take a selfie with him, has gone viral. Early this year, in a similar incident, Stalin had slapped a party worker where the latter tried to get close to him in the Chennai Metro. Stalin is political heir to DMK chief M Karunanidhi.
