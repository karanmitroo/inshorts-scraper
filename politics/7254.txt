AAP minister Kapil Mishra has asked the BJP whether Mehbooba Mufti, who is expected to be the next CM of Jammu and Kashmir, will say 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'. In a letter to BJP President Amit Shah, Mishra further questioned that if she denies doing so, will the BJP still continue with the alliance with PDP in the state.
