Dalit leaders in Gujarat on Friday threatened to teach BJP a “lesson” in the 2017 Assembly elections. Calling for the Dalit-Muslim alliance to challenge the ruling party, the leaders slammed the state government for not taking adequate action against the culprits in the Una lynching incident. They also criticised PM Narendra Modi over his statements on atrocities against the Dalits.
