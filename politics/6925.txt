BJP MP Ram Prasad Sharma on Wednesday arrived at the Parliament on a horse to mark his protest against the odd-even scheme, imposed by the Delhi government. The white horse he was riding on had a placard hung from its back which read 'Pollution Free Vehicle'. Many MPs have demanded an exemption from the scheme saying it disrupts their work.
