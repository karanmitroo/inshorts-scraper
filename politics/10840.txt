Rejecting speculations about her plans to join Congress, former AAP leader Shazia Ilmi said, "For the record, I have not joined any party, nor am I in the process of joining any party. But I do not rule out any possibility in future". Earlier it was reported that Ilmi's entry into the Congress had almost been approved.
