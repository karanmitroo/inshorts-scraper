Despite the BJP falling drastically short of qualifying to have a Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Delhi Assembly, the party's MLA Vijendra Gupta was given the key post by speaker Ram Niwas Goyal on Friday. "Granting of LOP post to the BJP was victory of democratic values," said Gupta, claiming that his party hadn't asked for the post.
