Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav had punctured the 'cycle' while his brother Shivpal Yadav had broken its chain. "I really wonder how Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh will reach Lucknow riding the damaged cycle," he said. Singh claimed that the atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh was conducive for the blooming of the Lotus.
