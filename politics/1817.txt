West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the BJP should have nominated someone like LK Advani or Sushma Swaraj for the Presidential elections instead of Ram Nath Kovind. "I'm not saying that the Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind is unfit to be the President. Candidate should be someone who will be beneficial for the country," she added.
