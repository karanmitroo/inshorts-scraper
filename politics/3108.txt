Congress leader Gurudas Kamat on Saturday rejected any alliance with Shiv Sena in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. "I take strong objection to any discussion even of having any tie up or indirect support to the Shiv Sena," he asserted. Congress has fought against BJP and Shiv Sena for their divisive policies and the people would not spare them, Kamat added.
