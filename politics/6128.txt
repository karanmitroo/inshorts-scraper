BJP’s UP Scheduled Caste Morcha in-charge Deep Chand Ram on Sunday resigned from all party posts, stating he was feeling suffocated over Dalits row in Gujarat and Dayashankar’s slur against Mayawati. He also urged PM Modi to take action against such incidents. BJP’s SC Morcha state president Gautam Chaudhary, however, alleged that Ram had joined the party for ‘personal gains’.
