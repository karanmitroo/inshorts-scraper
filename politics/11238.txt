Responding to Narendra Modi’s statement, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said - "Modi has no right to say he will oust Bangladeshis from West Bengal. Who is he? He is nobody. I dare you to touch them [Bangladeshis].” The BJP's PM candidate had threatened to deport illegal immigrants from the neighbouring country if his party won the general elections.
