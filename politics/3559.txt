The Income Tax department has reportedly asked the Election Commission to cancel AAP’s status as a political party for allegedly filing "false and fabricated" audit reports on donations amounting to ₹27 crore. The audit reports were filed in 2013-14 and 2014-15 and hence AAP's registration could be cancelled, the department stated. Notably, AAP is contesting Assembly elections in Punjab, Goa.
