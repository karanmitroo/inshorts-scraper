In 2016 Tamil Nadu Assembly polls, Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK ended the 30-year-long anti-incumbency trend in the state. "It's a truly historic victory because after 1984, no ruling party in state has been able to win in elections for a second successive time," Jayalalithaa had said. "I'll continue to strive for the betterment of TN till my last breath," she had added.
