Commenting on Rahul Gandhi's statement about causing an earthquake in the Parliament, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said he cannot even make the wind blow. The Congress leader had said that if he speaks on demonetization, then the ruling regime would be hit by an earthquake. Gandhi was earlier challenged by Smriti Irani to speak in the Parliament.
