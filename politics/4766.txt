A Lok Sabha committee formed to probe if the Parliament's security was breached by AAP MP Bhagwant Mann, has found the MP guilty in the case. Mann had filmed and live-streamed "critical" areas of the Parliament on Facebook. Mann had defended his actions saying that he was educating his supporters about Parliamentary proceedings, while opposition parties criticised the move.
