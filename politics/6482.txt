A civil case of alleged non-payment of dues for constructing Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies against Congress President Sonia Gandhi and other party leaders has been settled out of court, the institute's director Hidur Muhammed said. "Soniaji is in no way connected to this institution and it's very unfortunate that the media propagated this false news," he added.
