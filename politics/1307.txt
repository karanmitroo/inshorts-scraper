RJD chief and former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav has compared the recent incidents of train derailments to Nitish Kumar's political decisions. "The trains are overturning the way Nitish Kumar is a political turncoat," Lalu said during a television interview. He further alleged that Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi were involved in the multi-crore Srijan scam.
