Referring to Prashant Bhushan's statement as his personal view, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday ruled out any alliance with the BJP. Kejriwal said: "Neither we will take support nor give support (to form a government). There is no question. It (was) his personal opinion," Kejriwal said. "(What I am saying) is the party's opinion."
