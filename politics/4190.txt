Following the declaration that Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav would be the new Samajwadi Party chief, Akhilesh on Sunday said, "What I did today was a tough decision but I had to take it." However, Akhilesh's father and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav termed the declaration "unconstitutional". Reportedly, Akhilesh will move the Election Commission to claim the party's 'cycle' symbol.
