An FIR was on Tuesday registered against AAP's Amethi candidate Kumar Vishvas, his party associate Somnath Bharti and two others for violating prohibitory orders, police said. Though the deadline for campaigning ended in the constituency on Monday at 6 pm, they allegedly continued to do so in violation of rules, the FIR alleged.
