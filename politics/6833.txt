Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa preferred to "stay within four walls" without bothering to visit the people suffering, during last year's floods. "I could come from Delhi to see what has happened in Tamil Nadu and to help... but the Chief Minister could not walk out of her house," he claimed.
