BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma on Wednesday blasted Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam over their statements on Army's surgical strikes. "Those who don't trust the Army are the ones who only believe their father's identity by seeing their parentsâ€™ wedding night video," he said. "Such people are Pakistani agents," he added.
