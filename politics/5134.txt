Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said that the issue of prevalence of drugs in Punjab is a hype created by the Gandhis as they are against the Sikhs. “Rahul Gandhi comes to Punjab, and somebody gives him a slip where he writes that 70% drug addicts tested were youth…he said 70% youth are on drugs,” alleged Badal.
