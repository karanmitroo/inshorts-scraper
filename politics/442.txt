Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has announced that the party will contest all state elections and the 2019 General Elections, adding that it will not form any alliances. Shiv Sena will oppose BJP's "bogus Hindutva" to ensure that "genuine Hindutva" gets political power, Thackeray added. The Shiv Sena and the BJP have been allies in the Maharashtra Assembly since 1989.
