The Supreme Court has rejected the bail plea of RJD MLA Raj Ballabh Yadav, who has been accused of raping a minor. The RJD legislator had earlier surrendered before a court in Bihar following the apex court's orders. Earlier this year, Yadav was named as one of the main accused on charges of raping a minor girl at his residence.
