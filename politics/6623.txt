Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that Congress and BJP have a husband-wife kind of a relationship. While addressing AAP volunteers in Goa, Kejriwal added, "They (BJP-Congress) are like husband and wife fighting inside the house. They know each other's secrets." Further calling them 'Mister and Missus BJP-Congress', he said, "Both parties combined are mafias, they run mafia raj."
