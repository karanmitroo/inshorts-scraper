Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma responded to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's claim that Paytm was the biggest beneficiary of PM Modi's move to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. Kejriwal called Modi's appearance in Paytm ads "utterly shameful". Sharma tweeted, "The biggest beneficiary is our country. We are just a tech startup, trying to solve financial inclusion & make India proud."
