West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek on Monday sparked a row by threatening to "chop off hands and tear out eyes" if anyone challenged the TMC. "Those who dare to show their eyes, we will tear it out... If someone shows us their hands we will cut them off", Abhishek, who heads the youth wing of TMC said.
