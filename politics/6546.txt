Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday questioned the authenticity of a recent report claiming the meat found in Dadri lynching victim Mohammad Akhlaq's house was beef. BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, on the contrary, demanded the filing of cow slaughter case against Akhlaq's family. Notably, the Mathura-based lab's report contradicts an earlier report claiming the meat was mutton.
