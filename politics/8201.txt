MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday said that Congress is the “best repository” of India's liberal values and that the people "made the mistake of taking Modi’s liberal campaign pronouncements at face value". He further said, "Modi’s slogans were unaccompanied by any serious plan" adding that "Modi was... riding on the back of a profoundly illiberal political movement.”
