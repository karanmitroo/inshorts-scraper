Reacting to PM Narendra Modi’s statement that he has a "dossier against each Congress leader", Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday asked, "Why no action was taken against them if you have dossier. Are you scared? You give hollow threats to them just before elections…it seems they have dossier against you". Modi had said it during a rally in Uttarakhand.
