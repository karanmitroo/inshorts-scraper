The Opposition on Thursday sought an apology from Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani after she read from a 2014 statement purportedly by SC, ST, and minority students of JNU that referred to Goddess Durga as a "sex worker". Irani, attempting to highlight alleged anti-national activities inside JNU, was referring to the statement where Durga Puja was called a "racial festival".
