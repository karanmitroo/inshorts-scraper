The BJP has said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, and not the public, is more aggrieved and distressed by demonetisation. People wholeheartedly support PM Narendra Modi and believed that demonetisation will eradicate black money, BJP's Shrikant Sharma said. People showed Congress the mirror of reality in four of the five recently held Municipality elections and supported PM Modi, he added.
