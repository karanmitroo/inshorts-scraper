RSS leader Indresh Kumar has said that the western tradition of Valentine's Day is responsible for rape, illegitimate children and violence against women. "Love is pure, but the western culture has changed it into a passion, which has somehow manifested into a business... This is responsible for the increasing cases of triple talaq, domestic violence, female foeticide, etc.," Kumar added.
