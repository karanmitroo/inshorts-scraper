The Shiv Sena has reportedly broken its alliance with the BJP for the upcoming Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation elections in Maharashtra. The party will contest for all 122 seats alone. This comes after it fell out with Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis over the launch of former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri's book.
