All India Mahila Congress General Secretary Nagma has alleged that Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi was functioning "like a representative of the BJP". Nagma questioned as to why Bedi did not clear files related to several welfare measures sought to be implemented by the Congress government in the Union Territory. Bedi must work without getting into political side, she added.
