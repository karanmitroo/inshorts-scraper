Addressing a rally in poll-bound Karnataka, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday said there was 'Seedha Rupaiyaa' governance and not "(CM) Siddaramaiah governance" in the state. He added that 'Seedha Rupaiyaa' was involved in every work in the state. Claiming that the BJP will win Karnataka Assembly elections, PM Modi said the incumbent Congress government's actions had made it unpopular.
