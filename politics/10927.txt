West Bengal CM, Mamata Banerjee has accused the media of blowing the matter out of proportion, in connection with the Tapas Pal episode, aiming to malign her party and government. "A campaign of rumour and misinformation is being carried out against us in a planted way. It may well be, that you don't even know what has happened," she said.
