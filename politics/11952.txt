Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday threatened to "go to any extent" to ensure the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill, which is opposed both by the Congress as well as the BJP. Last week, the Delhi Cabinet had cleared the draft of the Jan Lokpal bill; and remarkably the CM also comes under the ambit of Lokpal.
