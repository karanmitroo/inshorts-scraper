The alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland chopper deal, Christian Michel, on Wednesday said that he never met Congress President Sonia Gandhi or former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In an interview to a news channel, Michel added that he met former IAF chief SP Tyagi once and shook his hand, but avoided him for his links with Italian businessman Guido Haschke.
