National Conference (NC) working President Omar Abdullah today said his party was ready for fresh elections in Jammu and Kashmir if the PDP and BJP do not form a government. He ruled out any support to the PDP, saying they turned down the NC's offer in 2014. The state, where the PDP-BJP alliance was ruling, is under Governor's rule.
