Accusing the BJP government of copying UPA's financial inclusion schemes, Congress Friday said that the 'Jan Dhan Yojna' was "only a continuation" of the financial inclusion plan initiated by the UPA during its 10-year rule. "We are happy to note that imitation continues to be best form of flattery as far as NDA and BJP is concerned," said a Congress spokesman.
