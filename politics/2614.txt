Former AAP MLA from Bawana Ved Prakash Satish, who has quit the party and joined the BJP, has accused the Delhi government of not doing anything for cows. "Prime Minister Modi has come at the forefront as a yogi (ascetic) and Yogi (Adityanath) has come in Uttar Pradesh. I have come here to become part of that change," he added.
