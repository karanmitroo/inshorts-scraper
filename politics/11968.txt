Actor Nana Patekar has turned down a BJP offer to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai North Central constituency, which is considered a fortress of Priya Dutt (actor Sanjay Dutt's sister). "We are negotiating with more people in Bollywood. Patekar was our first choice against Priya since he is a popular Marathi artist," a senior BJP functionary said.
