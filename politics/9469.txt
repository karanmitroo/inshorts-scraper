Shiv Sena on Wednesday filed a privilege motion against writer and columnist Shobhaa De for calling Maharashtra CM a 'diktat' on Twitter following the state govt's decision of screening Marathi film during prime time. Calling it as govt's 'dadagiri', Shobhaa tweeted "Devendra 'Diktatwala' Fadnavis is at it again!!! From beef to movies. This is not the Maharashtra we all love!"
