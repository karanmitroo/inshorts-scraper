Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi roll back the proposal of taxing Employee Provident Fund (EPF) withdrawals. â€œEPF is the safety net of the employees and imposing a tax on this is wrong," Gandhi said. He demanded that Modi should instil confidence in the employees and voters by withdrawing the proposal.
