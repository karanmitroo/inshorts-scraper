Talking about PM Narendra Modi's remarks on Nehru-Gandhi family, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said he doesn't feel any hatred towards PM Modi and that the PM has helped him the most. "There is zero emotion of anger and hatred in me...It's the nature of our family. Maybe the legend of Gujarat, Mahatma Gandhi taught this to our family," Rahul added.
