Senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai Saturday attacked PM Narendra Modi by saying, "Modi has brilliant strategy. He used English media journalist like myself and others as villains to project him as a hero". Further, he said that the UPA would have lost the election even if the BJP had not declared Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate.
