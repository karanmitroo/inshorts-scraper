Calling the BJP-led alliance in Assam as the coming together of "two dangerous forces of communalism and divisiveness", Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "insulting" people of the state. “Those working in the tea gardens, as well as tribals are asking when will the good days (achche din) come,” Gandhi  remarked.
