The Election Commission (EC) rejected Lalu Prasad Yadav's political party RJD's application to participate in the EVM hackathon for turning up 39 minutes later than the deadline of 5 pm on May 26. While the only political party to stamp its participation is Sharad Pawar's NCP, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP raised issues on the existing framework of the EVM hacking challenge.
