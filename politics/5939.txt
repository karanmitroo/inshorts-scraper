CongressÂ on Monday
accused PM Narendra Modi of "ruining" India's case on Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) by referring to Balochistan in his Red Fort speech. Asserting that PoK is our right and entitlement, Congress leader Salman Khurshid said raising the Balochistan issue would give an "additional handle" to Pakistan to target India, as "we don't speak about atrocities in neighbouring countries".
