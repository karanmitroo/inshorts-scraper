Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that although the BJP claims it’s a party that cares for Hindus, it didn’t even spare them over its demonetisation policy. They have destroyed Hindus as well, he added. “Show some mercy to the people of this country Modiji. What animosity do you hold towards them,” he tweeted.
