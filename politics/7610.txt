Three office-bearers of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad's (ABVP) JNU unit resigned from the BJP's student wing on Wednesday. The three leaders expressed their “difference of opinion” with the NDA government and condemned its handling of the JNU row. "[T]here is a difference between interrogation and crushing ideology and branding entire Left as anti-national," they added.
