The CPI (ML) on Monday called for a Bihar ‘bandh’ to protest against the recently unveiled toppers scam in the state. Demanding the setting up of a judicial commission to investigate the scam, the party workers blocked various train movements across Bihar. They also blocked National Highways 83 and 110, that connect Patna to Gaya and Arwal, respectively.
