Following the murder of one of its activists in Kerala's Kannur district, the BJP has called for a state-wide shutdown on Thursday to protest against the LDF government. Blaming CPI(M) for the killing, BJP said that people not following Left ideologies are being murdered. This is the seventh politically motivated murder in the district this year, the party claimed.
