Speaking about demonetisation's impact, former PM Manmohan Singh on Wednesday said, "Things have gone from bad to worse, but the worst is yet to come." He added some have forecasted India's GDP growth could slow down to 6.3%, which will have a negative impact on employment and income. "We can imagine what kind of a disaster demonetisation is," Singh said.
