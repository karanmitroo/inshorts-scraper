Following Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's appeal to make a Sangh-mukt Bharat, BJP leader Sushil Modi on Monday challenged him to ban the RSS in Bihar. Citing that Nitish had been with the NDA for 17 years in the past when his political party, JD(U), was an ally of the BJP, Modi asked, "Why did he not oppose the Sangh then?".
