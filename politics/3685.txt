Announcing the alliance with the Congress, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said that his party would have won over 250 seats on its own but with the alliance, it would win over 300 seats out of 404. He also attacked the BJP-led Centre over its demonetisation policy, stating it adversely affected the common people.
