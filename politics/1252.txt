Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said that he can win from any of the 224 constituencies in the state. Reacting to BJP's decision to field party state President BS Yeddyurappa from north Karnataka, Siddaramaiah said, "Yeddyurappa may contest from anywhere, but victory will be ours. But our party high command will decide where I should contest from."
