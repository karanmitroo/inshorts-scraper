BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday tweeted, "As along as BJP is not the alternative to DMK in Tamil Nadu, we Hindutva fighters have no choice but to support AIADMK". "But BJP needs renovation first," he added. Swamy had earlier said that AIADMK leader VK Sasikala is much better than the "anti-national" DMK.
