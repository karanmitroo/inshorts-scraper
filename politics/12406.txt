In connection with BJP leader Arun Jaitley's call-detail records case, 6 more people ( three policemen and three private detectives) have been arrested. Earlier, Constable Arvind Dabas(35) and detective Neeraj Nayar(36) were arrested. However, they were released later in May'13 since they had already got the relief in the main phone-tapping case by another court.
