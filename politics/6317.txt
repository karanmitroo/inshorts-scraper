Former Maharashtra Revenue Minister and BJP leader Eknath Khadse on Thursday said the whole country would "shake" if he opened his mouth. He further claimed that he was responsible for making Devendra Fadnavis the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Khadse had resigned from his post following allegations of irregularities in a land deal and receiving phone calls from gangster Dawood Ibrahim.
