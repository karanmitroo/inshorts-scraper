Even before the national election results on Friday, Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit has conceded defeat saying, "I can speak for myself. I am unlikely to win. But I don't speak for the party". NDTV's Exit Poll shows that the Congress is likely to lose all seven seats in Delhi, as BJP is expected to win five, and the AAP two.
