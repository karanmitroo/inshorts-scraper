BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has launched the 'Rashtra Manch' portal, aimed at starting a movement against the Centre's policies. Joining the platform, BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha said the party didn't give him opportunities to express his views. Accusing the Centre of reducing farmers to the status of beggars, Yashwant said, "Everybody in BJP is living in fear. We are not."
