The Indian Railways demolished 500 slums along the railway tracks near Shakurpur in Delhi on Saturday night seeking to curb encroachment, killing one child and rendering 2500 people homeless. CM Arvind Kejriwal suspended 2 sub-divisional magistrates and ordered relief measures for the homeless people. He also said that the Railway minister Suresh Prabhu wasn't aware of the demolition drive.
