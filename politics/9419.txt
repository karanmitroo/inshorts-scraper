Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit on Tuesday raised questions over Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's leadership qualities saying Sonia Gandhi should continue to lead the party. Calling Sonia's leadership 'successful', Dikshit said, "Whereas (in case of) Rahul, of course, there is a question mark, there is skepticism because you have not seen him perform as yet."
