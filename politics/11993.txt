Taking the first major step against Sheila Dikshit, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday wrote to the President of India asking for an investigation on illegal authorization of colonies in 2008. Ms Dikshit had been indicted in November by the Delhi Lokayukta who ruled that she had regularised nearly 1,000 colonies for political gain before the national election of 2009.
