Congress leader PC Chacko on Monday said no political party has called for a Bharat bandh and added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is misleading the people of the country by falsely claiming so. "Prime Minister's step (demonetisation) is not attacking black money, but the white money... The action is against the ordinary people and daily wage owners," Chacko added.
