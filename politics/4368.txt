Slamming the Centre's demonetisation move, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said that cashless economy is a "bigger dream" than 'achche din' (good days). Akhilesh said this while attending an event to distribute cheques to the families of martyrs and 14 persons who had allegedly lost their lives while standing in queues outside ATMs or banks after demonetisation.
