IPS officer Amitabh Thakur, who filed an FIR against SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday for threatening him, has now been booked on rape charges. The complaint filed at a Lucknow police station claims that Thakur raped a Ghaziabad-based woman on December 31, 2014. However, Thakur said that he was considering the FIR against him as a “return gift”.
