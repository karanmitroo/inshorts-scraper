Tripura Governor Tathagata Roy on Wednesday said that there was politics involved behind the Supreme Court's ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and NCR. "A day will come when the 'Candle and Award-Wapasi gang' will file a petition for banning cremation of Hindus, on the pretext of pollution," he added.
