The BJP Karnataka IT Cell posted a picture of potholes on Twitter, saying it was confirmed to be from Bengaluru. Later, the picture was found to be from Mumbai, and Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge asked them to either prove it was Bengaluru, or apologise. However, the BJP asked Kharge to ride a 2-wheeler on Bengaluru roads and count potholes.
