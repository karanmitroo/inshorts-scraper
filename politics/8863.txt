A day after AAP leader Somnath Bharti made a controversial remark on women, his wife Lipika who recently accused him of domestic violence said, "I'm average looking, maybe that's why he ill-treated me." Bharti yesterday said, "[I]f Delhi government is given full freedom (over security), beautiful women will be able to go out even after midnight without any fear."
