All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi has said the government should bring a law that makes calling an Indian Muslim 'Pakistani' a punishable offence.The offence should be non-bailable and the offender should face a 3-year jail term, he added. Owaisi, however, asserted that the BJP-led Centre will never introduce such a bill in the Parliament.
