National Conference on Sunday slammed Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti for allegedly saying she was "ashamed to be a Muslim" following the attack on CRPF personnel in Pampore. "This is the same Mehbooba Mufti who used to say that terror has no religion. Now suddenly she sees terror as an offshoot of Islam," NC spokesperson Junaid Mattu said.
