Shiv Sena on Wednesday demanded to sack Uttar Pradesh's Cabinet Minister Azam Khan from his post for his remarks on the Dadri lynching case. "Why has Azam never written to the UN about the pathetic condition of Hindus in Pakistan? By writing to the UN about local issues, he has done an anti-national act," Sena wrote in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'.
