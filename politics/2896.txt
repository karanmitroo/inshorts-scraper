Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM has failed to open its account in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. The party, which had fielded 38 candidates for the Uttar Pradesh polls, could manage a vote share of only 0.2%. AIMIM had contested 6 seats in Bihar Assembly elections in 2015 but failed to secure a single constituency even then.
