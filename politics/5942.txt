CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury has claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ignored the Opposition's inputs in the all-party meeting organised to discuss the Jammu and Kashmir unrest. "The outcome of the all-party meeting was a 40-minute lecture by the PM... All that we had discussed in the earlier three hours did not reflect in what he said finally," Yechury added.
