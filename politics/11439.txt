Sidestepping the question of apologizing for the 2002 Gujarat riots during an interview, Narendra Modi Tuesday said the Congress should first account for their "sins" before asking him to tender an apology. When asked whether he agreed with Manmohan Singh's statement that he was a "danger" to India, Modi said, "I have never heard Manmohan Singh speak like this".
