Trinamool Congress leader Bobby Firhad Hakim reportedly called his constituency in West Bengal a 'mini-Pakistan in Kolkata' in front of a Pakistani journalist. While the opposition parties have criticised Hakim for his remarks calling it 'unfortunate', he has denied the report published in Pakistan's The Dawn and said, "I have not said anything about Pakistan."
