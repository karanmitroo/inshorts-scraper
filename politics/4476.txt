Asserting that army is a public institution, Congress on Sunday demanded answers from the government for superseding senior officers to name Lieutenant General Bipin Rawat as the army chief. Party leader Manish Tewari assured that it was not a personal attack but a legitimate question. He further criticised the government's defence that the Congress had done the same in 1983.
