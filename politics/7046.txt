The Congress on Wednesday demanded the retraction of the "disastrous" decision to sign the Logistics Support Agreement with the US. It alleged that this would lead to the "end of independence of India's foreign policy and strategic autonomy". India on Tuesday gave in-principle approval to a Logistics Exchange Agreement with the US, enabling both militaries to use each other's bases.
