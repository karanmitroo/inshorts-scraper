Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh Sunday accused AAP chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal of being a part of RSS' plan for a Congress-free India. In a tweet, Digvijay added, "When I said RSS was behind Anna Movement, no one believed me I was called mad. But ultimately I was proved right and I would be right this time too."
