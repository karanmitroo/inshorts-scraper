DMK leader MK Stalin on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the Income Tax raid at Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Rama Mohana Rao's Chennai residence. Calling the I-T raids a disgrace to the state, Stalin claimed it was perhaps the first time in Tamil Nadu's history that such a raid was conducted at a Chief Secretary's residence.
