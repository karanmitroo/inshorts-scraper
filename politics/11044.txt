Barely days after NDA government has taken over, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday suggested that the government should take up restoring names of cities to their ancient Hindu versions. “I think restoring Ahmedabad as Karnavati [Namo had recommended as CM], Aurangzeb Rd as Dara Shikoh, Allahabad as Prayag is easy for govt,” Swamy tweeted.
