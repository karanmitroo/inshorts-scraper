Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Friday reportedly alleged that the only option left with him is to travel in choppers as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) would get him killed in road accident. His remark came after his helicopter made an emergency landing in Karanda village due to some technical snag. He was later sent to Lucknow by road.
