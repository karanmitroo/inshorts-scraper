The Indian Union Muslim League on Saturday removed its women wing Vanitha League's state president Kamarunnisa Anwar from the post for praising the Bharatiya Janata Party. "I wish the BJP will be able to do good for the people and the state's development. We have expectations in this regard," she had said. However, she later apologised for the pro-BJP remarks.
