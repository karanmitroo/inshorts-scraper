Union Minister and daughter-in-law of Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal, Harsimrat Kaur has claimed that even if AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal contests polls against CM in Lambi, he too will forfeit his security deposit. "Let them bring anyone they can, any leader whom AAP feel can contest against CM," she challenged. She also called AAP a "non-player in Punjab politics".
