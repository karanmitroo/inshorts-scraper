Responding to the call for a "secular" front to counter BJP and RSS, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday said any opposition leader can dream of becoming the Prime Minister. Asserting that BJP will retain power in 2019, he said the popularity of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee is "limited to a particular state".
