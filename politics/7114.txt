Kerala CM Oommen Chandy on Friday filed a defamation suit in a Kochi court against solar scam accused Saritha S Nair and four journalists of two news channels for trying to malign his image. The channels had recently telecast a letter reportedly written by Nair which claimed that Chandy had sexually abused her in his office residence.
