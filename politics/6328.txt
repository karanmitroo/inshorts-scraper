BJP President Amit Shah on Monday said the Uttar Pradesh government with "three-and-a-half Chief Ministers" has "failed" to maintain law and order. The remark reportedly refers to CM Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav, uncle Shivpal Yadav, and state minister Azam Khan. Shah also accused the government of being unwilling to extend central schemes' benefits to the poor and Dalits.
