The BJP will launch a six-month long membership drive with the call for "saath aaye desh banaye" from Nov 1, the party said Monday. PM Narendra Modi will be the first BJP leader to have his party membership renewed through a mobile text message. The party seeks to increase its members by 20% during the drive, which is launched every sixth year.
