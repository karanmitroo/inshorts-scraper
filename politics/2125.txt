After Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered to mediate between India and Pakistan to resolve Kashmir issue, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday said India doesn't need Turkey's mediation in dealing with Pakistan. "As per the Parliamentary resolution 1994, we'll never ever rest till every inch of India is restored including that part which is in Pakistan's occupation," he added.
