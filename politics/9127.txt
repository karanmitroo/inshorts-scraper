Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Friday rejected the opposition's allegations that the Smart City project was only meant to benefit the upper class saying that the concept was not 'elitist' or 'pro-rich'. Naidu further added that the project was aimed at benefiting the poor who are forced to live on the fringes of growing urbanisation.
