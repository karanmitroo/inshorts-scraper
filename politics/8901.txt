The central government on Friday said it was ready to talk to the Congress to break the impasse in Parliament. "Government had planned to talk to Congress today morning, but due to the CPP meeting Congress leaders were not free. We will talk to them soon when Congress members are free," Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
