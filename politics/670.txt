RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday tweeted, "I am the son of Twitter. If you will not retweet me, then where will I go?" This reportedly comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remark "I am the son of Gujarat, your son. If you will not support me, so where will I go?" ahead of the state Assembly elections.
