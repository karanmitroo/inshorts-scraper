Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has questioned the honesty of farmers through his demonetisation move. "A farmer needs money for seeds and fertilizers. India's farmer is the most honest. He does not have any black money. Modiji's demonetisation has inflicted a major injury on farmers," Gandhi said.
