Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay on Saturday criticised the Delhi government for failing to present the case of diesel taxi owners before the Supreme Court, which banned them from plying in the city. â€œUnfortunately, the government did nothing to persuade the court. Due to its pathetic attitude, thousands of vehicle owners are on the verge of bankruptcy," Upadhyay alleged.
