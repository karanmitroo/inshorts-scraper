BSP supremo Mayawati on Saturday said that if her party is voted to power in the Uttar Pradesh polls, she will concentrate on the development of the state rather than constructing memorials. This comes after Opposition parties had attacked her for her rich lifestyle. She also urged voters not to waste their vote on SP and instead vote for BSP.
