The Congress on Wednesday denied reports that it has hired Japanese advertising and communication firms Dentsu and Burson-Marsteller for Rs.500-crore to strategise the 2014 Lok Sabha polls campaign for Rahul Gandhi and and brush up his public image. Congress leader Ajay Makan said neither Rahul required any PR agency for his image makeover, nor the Congress had such huge budgets.
