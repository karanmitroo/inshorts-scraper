The BJP on Friday accused Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of misusing the United Nations platform and said that Pakistan should stop dreaming of Jammu and Kashmir. Urging Pakistan to concentrate on their internal affairs, BJP Spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said that Pakistan should think of saving Balochistan and Sindh. "He (Sharif) was speaking like LeT chief Hafiz Sayeed," Hussain added.
