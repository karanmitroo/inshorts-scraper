In a letter to the state DGP, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav asked for two to three Muslim policemen in every police station in UP. His orders came after violent clashes erupted in Meerut at a Mahapanchayat, being held in support of the arrested BJP MLA Sangeet Som. Tensions continue in UP three weeks after the Muzaffarnagar riots.
