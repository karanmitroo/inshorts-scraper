Congress chief ministerial candidate for UP Sheila Dikshit on Sunday said that some Samajwadi Party leaders want to join Congress due to widening rift in Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s family. "Many of them are in touch already. Openly they are not doing it now," she further said. "All the scandals and differences are not going to help them," she added.
