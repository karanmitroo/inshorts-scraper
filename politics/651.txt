In his first address as the President of the Indian National Congress on Saturday, Rahul Gandhi said that he accepted the position with "deepest humility", knowing that he will always be "walking in the shadows of giants". Gandhi added that Congress is considered a 'Grand Old Party' but now it will be called 'Grand Old and Young Party'.
