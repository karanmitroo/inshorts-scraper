Union Minister Uma Bharti who has been shifted to the Drinking Water and Sanitation Ministry in the recent Cabinet reshuffle said that she did not fail as the Water Resources Minister. While reports claimed she was moved because PM Narendra Modi was unhappy with her performance, Bharti said that she was scolded by Modi only twice for being fat.
