BJP MP Subramanian Swamy took a jibe at lawyer Shehzad Poonawalla after he asked him to "adopt 5 cows if he cares so much about it", in a live debate on Wednesday. "Next you will ask me to marry all Muslim women since I oppose triple talaq! Who is more dumb: Bhupen or Buddhu?", Swamy tweeted on the 'stupid' suggestion.
