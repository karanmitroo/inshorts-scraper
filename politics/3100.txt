An FIR was lodged on Saturday against BJPâ€™s Uttar Pradesh unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya for violating the model code of conduct. Maurya had allegedly worn BJP's sticker on his jacket while casting vote at a polling booth on February 23. The law forbids exhibition of any notice or election-related sign on polling day within 100 metres of the booth.
