The Gujarat High Court has put an interim stay on the Central Information Commission's (CIC) order directing the Gujarat University to provide information on PM Narendra Modi's degree to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. The university had contended that the CIC order was “illegal” as it was passed in a case in which the varsity was not a party.
