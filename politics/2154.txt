Police have arrested four people after Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari claimed that his Central Delhi residence had been attacked by 8-10 people on Sunday night. The leader, however, was not present at his home when the attack took place. "This was a life-threatening attack, two of my men have been injured," Manoj Tiwari was quoted as saying.
