The Rajasthan Assembly on Monday tabled a bill that seeks to shield serving and former public servants from being investigated without prior approval from the government. The bill, which aims to amend an older law, also bars the media from reporting on accusations against public servants till the sanction to proceed with the probe is obtained.
