Anti-corruption crusader and social activist Anna Hazare on Tuesday warned the central government of another fast if the alleged 'anti-farmer' provisions in the Land Acquisition Bill were not removed. Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue, Hazare said that he was more concerned about corporates than farmers. He also indicated a nationwide 'jail bharo' agitation.
