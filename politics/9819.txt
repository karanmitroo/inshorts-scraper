In remarks that could stir a controversy, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor took to Twitter on Monday to say that Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru's hanging was both "wrong" and "badly handled". Afzal was hanged on Feb-9, 2013, when Congress was in power. Tharoor's statement comes after five J&K lawmakers from Congress called Guru's hanging a 'mistake'.
