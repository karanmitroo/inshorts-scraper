The Congress has rejected reports that claimed party President Sonia Gandhi has indicated an active political role for daughter Priyanka and termed it as a "mischievous instance of fake news". "The news is entirely false and baseless. These are government planted fabrications and distractions. They require no comment from the Congress, except that I dismiss this," spokesperson Anand Sharma said.
