Former JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav on Wednesday supported a sedition case against former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju for his comments over Bihar, and said that it will make him "careful" in future. Katju had earlier said that Pakistan can take Kashmir but it will also have to take Bihar, later clarifying that he was only joking.
