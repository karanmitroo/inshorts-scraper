Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Friday shared a video purportedly showing a man tied to the front of an Army jeep to ensure no stones were thrown at the jeep. "This requires an urgent inquiry," he tweeted. Meanwhile, the Chinar Corps of Indian Army tweeted that the contents of the video are being verified and investigated.
