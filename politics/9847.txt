The BJP Thursday accused AAP of attempting to 'communalise' the Delhi Assembly polls by triggering the recent attacks on churches in the national capital. The saffron party also alleged the Arvind Kejriwal-led party is doing so because it is 'desperate' for minority votes. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that the party will inform the Election Commission about the same.
