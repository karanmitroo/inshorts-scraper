Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said that RSS follows a “divisive” approach and that its ideology is a “threat” to India. The saffron outfit is an “unregistered” organisation that wants to grab power without being accountable for it, Singh added. He urged all “liberal” people to come together to save the country from this “cancer” in a united manner.
