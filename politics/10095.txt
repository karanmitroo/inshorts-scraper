Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has said that every child is born as a Muslim but his parents convert him to other religions. "Islam is the 'real home' of all religions and hence the real 'home coming' (ghar wapsi) will be when people of other religions embrace it," the MP from Hyderabad added.
