With just a few days left for the Lok Sabha polls, Congress got a rude shock when Ramesh Tomar, party candidate from Noida joined BJP on Thursday morning. Tomar said, "I am an old member of the BJP...I have realized that the nation needs Modiji now...So I decided to rejoin my party." He had quit the party in 2009.
