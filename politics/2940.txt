BJP MP and actress Kirron Kher on Friday said all exit polls have indicated Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's exit. Her remark came after Rahul rejected the exit polls prediction, stating, "Our alliance is winning and such exit polls we saw in Bihar also." Notably, exit polls have projected BJP as the biggest gainer in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.
