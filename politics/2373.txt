Former Uttar Pradesh CM and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said that the BJP people do not consider them as Hindu. "Now, it feels like if I go to a temple I should click a picture and tweet it," Yadav added. He also said that the UP government should not defame Romeo by naming anti eve-teasing squad after him.
