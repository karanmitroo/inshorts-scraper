DMK chief M Karunanidhi has slammed Arun Jaitley for meeting AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa on Sunday. Karunanidhi said, "Is it proper for a Union minister to meet a convicted person? I am reminded of the saying 'cat is out of the bag'... Jaitley meets Jayalalithaa when his ministry is dealing with her out of court settlement in Income Tax cases."
