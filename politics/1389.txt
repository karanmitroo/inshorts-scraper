The BJP won Mumbai's Mira-Bhayander municipal elections because of "money and muni", Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has said after a Jain leader's video urging people to support BJP to create a "meat-free society" went viral. The Shiv Sena filed a complaint against the leader with State Election Commission, alleging that he violated election norms by campaigning along religious lines.
