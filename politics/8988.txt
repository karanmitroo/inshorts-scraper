West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday that her Trinamool Congress will take on the "unethical alliance" of the BJP, Congress and CPI-M in the 2016 assembly elections. Mamata also denounced the BJP for spreading the "poison of communalism" in the state. Hitting out at the CPI-M, Mamata further added that its seats would go on decreasing.
