AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a video that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is frustrated and can get him killed. Asking his MLAs to be prepared to go to jail, Kejriwal said, "Going to jail is a small sacrifice that you will have to make as a much bigger conspiracy is at play."
