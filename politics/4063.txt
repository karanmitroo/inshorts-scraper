The BJP has distanced itself from party's MP Sakshi Maharaj's comments, saying his statement doesn't represent the BJP's stand. Earlier, Sakshi Maharaj had said that the rise in population isnâ€™t because of Hindus, but due to those who support the concept of four wives and 40 children. "Population is increasing and the land is limited," he had later justified.
