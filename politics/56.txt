After the BJP defeated the CPI(M) to win the Tripura elections on Saturday, PM Narendra Modi said, "Yesterday, the country celebrated Holi with all colours. Today, all colours have been washed away by saffron." He added that the party's win in the state depicted its journey from "shunya to shikhar (zero to peak)" and from "no one to number one".
