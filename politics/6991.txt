Expelled former DMK leader MK Alagiri on Tuesday said that he will not support any party in the May 16 Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu. "No support for anyone. Thatâ€™s all. It applies to my supporters also," Alagiri said. Alagiri, the elder son of DMK President M Karunanidhi, had been expelled from the party in 2014 for alleged anti-party activities.
