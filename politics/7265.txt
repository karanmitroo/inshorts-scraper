Uttarakhand state Congress President Kishore Upadhyay on Thursday accused Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev and BJP President Amit Shah of conspiring together to instigate Congress MLAs against the state government. Claiming he had enough evidence to substantiate the charges, Upadhyay said, "He (Ramdev) worked like a BJP agent to foment a rebellion against the state government and topple it.”
