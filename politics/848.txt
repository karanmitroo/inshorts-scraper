Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections, Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said the Congress had mortgaged itself to those who can only spread anarchy in the state. This comes after Patidar leader Hardik Patel announced that the Congress had accepted the Patidar reservation formula. Gujarat elections will be fought between stability and governance, and anarchy, Jaitley added.
