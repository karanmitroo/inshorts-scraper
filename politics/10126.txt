Four BJP workers were arrested on Monday for putting up posters declaring Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav 'missing' in his constituency Azamgarh in UP. The party workers were held while putting up the posters that announced in Hindi: "Find Mulayam, win reward." BJP claims that Mulayam has not visited his constituency since he won the election in May.
