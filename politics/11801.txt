National Conference (NC) leader Farooq Abdullah's recent comments that people of Kashmir are the biggest thieves, sparked ruckus in the J&K assembly on Monday. "How can the National Conference be so shameless? They are the patrons of corruption in the state and they are calling Kashmiris thieves," president of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Mehbooba Mufti said.
