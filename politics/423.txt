Slamming the BJP for criticising the letter sent by the Karnataka Police over the withdrawal of cases against minorities, state Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy on Saturday said, "The BJP doesn't understand English properly." This comes after the BJP said that the letter reminding police to send their opinion on withdrawal of cases against minorities, was a "blatant appeasement of Muslims".
