Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that the AAP government is not scared of any probe as it has done nothing wrong. "You (Centre) make your committee and get all our appointments probed. And we will form one, and you get the Sahara Birla matter probed with it. Agree?" he asked Delhiâ€™s Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta.
