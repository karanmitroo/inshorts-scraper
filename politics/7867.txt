Shiv Sena on Monday demanded cancellation of Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali's concerts in Kerala citing the recent Pathankot Air Force base terror attack. Shiv Sena state executive member P Aji added that they were not against art but against Pakistan. Notably, the concerts are scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode districts on January 15 and 17 respectively.
