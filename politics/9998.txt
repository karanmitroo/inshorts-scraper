The West Bengal govt moved the Supreme Court against CBI Monday, alleging that the investigating agency has harassed several TMC leaders in the Saradha scam probe. The CBI had recently asked Trinamool's number 2 and ex-railway minister Mukul Roy to join investigations.  The agency has also dismissed TMC's allegations that it's pursuing BJP's "vendetta politics" in the Saradha scam probe.
