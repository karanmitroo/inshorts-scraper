BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday said he will appeal to the Supreme Court for the National Herald case-related documents, in which Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi are allegedly involved. This comes after Swamy's plea seeking Congress' ledgers was dismissed by Patiala House Court on Monday. Swamy had accused Congress leaders of misappropriation of funds.
