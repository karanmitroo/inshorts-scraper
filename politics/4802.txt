The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Monday said that the Centre's demonetisation move will neither bring back black money nor put an end to corruption. CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury added, "All this has been proved, but he (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is relentlessly publicising the issue and is not understanding that amid all this, the common man is suffering."
