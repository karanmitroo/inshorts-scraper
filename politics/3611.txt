BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said that his party is ready to accept UP Assembly election as a referendum on demonetisation. "There are so many anti-incumbency issues in UP. Still, if the Opposition wants to do a referendum on demonetisation, we are ready," he said. BJP would form the government in the state with a two-third majority, he added.
