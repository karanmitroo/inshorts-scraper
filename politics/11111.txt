The post of Leader of the Opposition can go only to the leader of a political party and not to the leader of an alliance. Hence, neither the Congress, as the head of the pre-poll UPA, nor a post-poll grouping of regional parties can stake claim to the post, according to Subhash Kashyap, former Secretary-General of the Lok Sabha.
