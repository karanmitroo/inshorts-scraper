West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday led a march to Rashtrapati Bhavan from Parliament against the Centre's demonetisation move and compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to King Tughlaq for the decision. Protesting along with leaders of National Conference, AAP, and NDA constituent Shiv Sena, Mamata Banerjee said, "There was no planning, this is like the Tughlaq regime."
