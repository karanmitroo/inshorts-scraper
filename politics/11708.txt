Gujarat CM Narendra Modi was trending on Twitter on Tuesday, after uncomplimentary observations by US consulate Michael Owen, describing him as an "insular and distrustful person". In his post, which also released on the Wikileaks Twitter handle, Owen said Modi "can be charming in public appearances, he is a distrustful person who rules with a small group of advisers".
