A hung Assembly is likely in Uttar Pradesh with a BJP-SP tie if polls are held today, a CVoter survey has predicted. While BJP will win 134-150 seats in the 403-member Assembly, SP is predicted to get 133-149 seats. BSP will improve its 2012 tally with 95-111 seats, but the Congress will get only 5-13 seats, the survey further predicted.
