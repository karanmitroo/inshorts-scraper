On eve of the Budget Session on Monday, PM Narendra Modi said at an all-party meeting that the Parliament should function despite differences which may crop up during poll season. Terming the Parliament as a 'mahapanchayat', Modi sought support from all parties at the meeting, which was attended by all major parties except the Trinamool Congress which is against demonetisation.
