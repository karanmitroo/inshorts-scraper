Over 250 members from BJP's youth wing were arrested on Tuesday before they could take out a Tiranga Independence Day rally through Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar. This was reportedly done to prevent confrontation between the youth activists and local residents. Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted about the arrests stating that it was a 'true definition of a fixed match'.
