Following its humiliating defeat in the national election, Uttar Pradesh's ruling Samajwadi Party sacked 36 leaders who enjoyed minister-of-state rank. "We failed to convey our good work to the people," UP CM Akhilesh Yadav said. Notably, the Party won just five of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, the state it has ruled since 2012.
