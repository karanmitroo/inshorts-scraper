A case was Saturday lodged against Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Umashankar Mishra in Bihar for allegedly circulating vulgar pictures of Union Minister Smriti Irani on WhatsApp. BJP leader Rajiv Ranjan approached the police. "It was an attempt to defame Irani and the BJP", Ranjan said. Ranjan also urged LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan to take strict action against Mishra.
