The BJP on Friday appointed its expelled leader Dayashankar Singh’s wife, Swati, as the chief of its Uttar Pradesh’s women wing. Swati had led a campaign against Mayawati and some BSP leaders for the objectionable remarks against her minor daughter. This had come after her husband Dayashankar was expelled from the BJP for allegedly comparing Mayawati with a “prostitute”.
