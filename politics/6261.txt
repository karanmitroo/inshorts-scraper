A PIL seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India to scrap the 'Lotus' symbol allotted to the BJP was filed in the Bombay High Court on Thursday. Asserting that the national flower cannot be used as a party icon, the petitioner alleged that this violates the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950.
