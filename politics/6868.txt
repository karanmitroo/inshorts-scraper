Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Thursday said that anybody who tries to destroy the fabric of secular and communal harmony must be taken to task. Commenting on the incident in Dadri last year, where a man was lynched to death over alleged beef consumption, Rijiju said, "We... sought a report and offered all possible assistance."
