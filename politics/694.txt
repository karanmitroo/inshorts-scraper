Calling for a nationwide ban on alcohol, Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar asked his party activists to spread awareness about ill-effects of liquor consumption among people. “When Gujarat could implement liquor ban, Bihar could show that it could also be banned in the state, why it cannot be banned in the entire country?” he said.
