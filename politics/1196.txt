Union Minister of Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is equally popular in Muslim countries because he has worked beyond the boundaries of religion and caste. "India can become a world leader only when its leader has the capacity to lead and PM Modi is one such leader," Naqvi added.
