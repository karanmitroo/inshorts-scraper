Election Commission on Sunday asked DMK to stop political campaign on the social media, as campaigning must end 48 hours before the polls. Action was taken after receiving a complaint from AIADMK IT Wing in this regard. EC sought an explanation from party president M Karunanidhi as to why action should not be taken against him for Model Code violation.
