Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) on Saturday announced that it will not take part in the nationwide protest called by the opposition parties on November 28 against the demonetisation policy. “We have maintained that we support the note ban as a strong measure to stem black money,” said JD(U) leader KC Tyagi. Unlike Nitish, JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav had criticised note ban.
