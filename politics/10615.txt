AAP's Maharashtra convener, Anjali Damania and state secretary Preeti Sharma Menon have resigned from their posts citing the need to give attention to their personal lives. "Anjali and I have been battling between our family life, our careers and our party responsibilities. Both of us could not cope up with the multi-tasking that we had to do," said Menon.
