BSP supremo Mayawati, whose party managed to win only 19 seats in the recently held Uttar Pradesh election, has said that she will take the matter related to alleged tampering with EVMs to court. This came after Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal alleged that EVMs were tampered with in the elections as the votes were transferred in favour of some parties.
