Rashtriya Janadhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav has said the support of the Third Front will be crucial for any alliance to form a government in Bihar. He added that neither the NDA nor the Grand Alliance is likely to get a majority in the on-going elections. In the past, Yadav has switched multiple parties and contested from various constituencies.
