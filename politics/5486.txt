Former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday said that he will not align with Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress. “Amarinder is hand in glove with the Badals. His dubious behind-the-curtain deals with the Badals are an open secret,” he alleged. “This is a war between right and wrong. We will be on the right side and back Punjab,” he added.
