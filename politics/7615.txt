The Union Cabinet, chaired by PM Narendra Modi, today recommended revocation of President's Rule in Arunachal Pradesh. This comes a day after the Supreme Court refused to pass an order restraining the state's Governor from swearing-in a new government. Earlier, 31 MLAs including Congress dissident Kalikho Pul, approached the Governor to stake claim for forming the government in the state.
