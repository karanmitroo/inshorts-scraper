BJP's Alwar MLA Gyandev Ahuja on Monday alleged that JNU students danced naked after consuming alcohol and drugs every night. He also claimed that around 3,000 used condoms, 500 used abortion injections, 2,000 alcohol bottles and 10,000 cigarette butts among other things are found in the campus daily. "There is only nasha (intoxication) in JNU after 8 pm", he added.
