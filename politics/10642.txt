Reflecting on PM Modi's statement praising the Muslim community, Kerala CM Oomen Chandy Saturday said that if Mr. Modi was sincere in his statement, he should put his words into practice. “Any body can change at any time. I am not objecting to that. But he should be ready to think realistically beyond politics,” he added.
