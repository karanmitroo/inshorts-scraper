The Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) has declined the invitation of TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao, who will take oath as the first CM of Telangana on Jun-2, to join his Cabinet. “We are not interested in occupying posts of power. Our dream is to see Telangana become one of the best performing States,” Majlis president Asaduddin Owaisi said.
