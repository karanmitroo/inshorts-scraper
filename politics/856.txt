Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that if the Delhi Police was under his government's control, he would have taught social media trolls a lesson. Calling the trolls "cowards", he added, "These people who abuse and threaten women by making fake accounts on social media will get sleepless nights if the government of the day decides to punish them."
