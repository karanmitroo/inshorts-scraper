Slamming Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav for her remark over caste-based reservation, BJP on Tuesday demanded action against her. "Her statement shows the mentality of SP towards Scheduled Castes and Backwards. It’s unfortunate SP is talking about withdrawing reservation system," it added. BJP also alleged she made the remark on Akhilesh Yadav’s advice.
