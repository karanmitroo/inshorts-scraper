In an unexpected move, former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit on Thursday said that, the BJP should be given an opportunity to form government in Delhi, as it will be good for the people. "If BJP has reached such a situation that it can form government, it is good for Delhi," Dikshit said. However, the Congress distanced itself from the remarks.
