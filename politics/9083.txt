Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain on Friday defended CM Arvind Kejriwal's exorbitant electricity bill by saying that his connection is used for official purposes. "He lives in a room without an AC. You are talking about the area where he meets the public", Jain said. A controversy had arisen after Kejriwal's electricity bill for June stood at Rs 1.35 lakh.
