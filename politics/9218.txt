BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj on Sunday took up the issue of Ayodhya Ram Mandir again and claimed that the temple will be built during the present NDA regime. "Ram mandir will definitely be built during our tenure. If not today then tomorrow... We have only completed one year of our tenure, there are still 4 years remaining," he said.
