Senior advocate and expelled AAP leader Prashant Bhushan on Saturday questioned the recent sacking of Delhi minister Asim Khan. Raising concern over ticket distribution to political defectors and opportunists, Bhushan said, "It's astounding that the credit is being given to Kejriwal for removing a corrupt minister who was appointed without any due diligence, despite being known as a defector."
