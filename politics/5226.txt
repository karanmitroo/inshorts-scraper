Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Saturday attacked Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi saying that he won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with the help of SP and BSP. Referring to Rahul Gandhi's recent 'Khat Sabha' meetings across the state, Irani said he is now playing 'Khat' politics just to show Congress has distanced itself with both the parties.
