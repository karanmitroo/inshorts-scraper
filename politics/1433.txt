RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday said, "The surgical strike done by former PM Indira Gandhi separated Pakistan and Bangladesh, but PM Narendra Modi's surgical strike operation was all fake, a drama." This comes after Modi mentioned the operation in his Independence Day speech and said, "The country's security remains our priority; our forces have always proved their mettle."
