Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay registered a complaint with the Election Commission against AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. Upadhyay's step comes after Kejriwal on Wednesday alleged a nexus between Upadhyay and power companies in Delhi. "He is misleading people by levelling false allegations. We have presented all facts before the EC," the Delhi BJP chief said.
