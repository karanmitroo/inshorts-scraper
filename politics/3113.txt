Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar on Thursday shared his picture in an infinity pool on Facebook with the caption "Relaxing after elections. Guess who? Guess where?" that he edited later. After his first caption invited criticism with comments like "Soon you will rest forever", Parsekar changed the caption to "Communing with nature. A refreshing experience. Guess who? Guess where?"
