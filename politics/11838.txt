BJP leader Arun Jaitley today accused the government of cutting short procedures to appoint members of Lokpal ahead of general elections. The UPA government is trying to “pack” the Lokpal search committee with its supporters, thereby both legislative provisions and propriety are being violated, Jaitley said. Furthermore, he alleged that the government invited applications (for Lokpal) in an "inappropriate" manner.
