A survey conducted by the India Today-Axis has predicted that Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress would return to power in Punjab by winning 60-65 seats in the 117-member Assembly. While the survey gives 41-44 seats to the AAP, it predicts that the ruling Akali Dal-BJP alliance would be reduced to only 11-15 seats.
