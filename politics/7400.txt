The BJP-led Maharashtra government was criticised by one of its own MLAs for its ban on beef, at the state legislative assembly on Thursday. “Why should you snatch away the poor's meal?” asked BJP MLA Bhimrao Dhonde, asserting that the ban was not in the interest of farmers. The Maharashtra government had imposed the ban in March 2015.
