West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said she was confident of coming back to power in the upcoming assembly elections owing to the "unholy" Congress-CPM alliance in the state. Banerjee added that the Bengal Congress managed a few votes in 2011 because of its alliance with Trinamool, and has been a "mere extension" of the Left parties since then.
