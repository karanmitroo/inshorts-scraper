According to the AAP's official website, seven of its Lok Sabha nominees from Gujarat have managed to get only Rs 10 as poll funds. If the entire fund of the party's LS candidates in Gujarat is put together, it totals to Rs 1.31 lakh. However, party's state spokesperson denied the crunch saying, "Our website must have not been updated."
