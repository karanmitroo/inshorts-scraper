Kerala CM Oommen Chandy on Friday objected to the government's move to merge the Overseas Indian Affairs Ministry (MOIA) with the External Affairs Ministry (MEA), saying it is an â€œinsult" to the NRI community. While citing the proactive measures taken by the MOIA, including intervention during the Yemen crisis, he said the decision "will adversely affect the interest" of NRIs.
