Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Industries Minister Subhash Desai's resignation over allegations of graft was rejected by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday. Desai had allegedly denotified nearly 30,000 acres of land in Nashik that he had acquired from farmers to benefit a builder. Fadnavis has asked him to continue until the result of the inquiry into the matter.
