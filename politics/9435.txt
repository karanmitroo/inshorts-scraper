Trying to clarify the row on his 'presstitute' remark, Union Minister General (retired) VK Singh on Friday said that the term was meant for only a particular 'biased' section of the media and had no link with the word 'prostitute'. Furthermore, he said that his 'Yemen evacuations were not as interesting as visiting Pakistan High Commission' comment was misunderstood.
