DMK's Working President MK Stalin was arrested in Tamil Nadu's Thiruvarur today during the day-long statewide bandh called by his party, and supported by other Opposition parties like the Congress, CPM and CPI. The bandh was called in support of the state's drought-hit farmers, who have been demanding a waiver of farm loans among other things.
