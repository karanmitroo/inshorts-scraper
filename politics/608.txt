After chairing his first Congress Working Committee as party President, Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that the "whole architecture of BJP is about lies". Adding that the "Modi model" in Gujarat was a "clear lie", Gandhi said, "When we went to Gujarat, the people said there is no model, they said what is going on is stealing of people's resources."
