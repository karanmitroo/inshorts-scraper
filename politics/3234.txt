BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday labelled triple talaq as immoral, stating the practice only proved inequality between men and women which was unacceptable in the Indian society. "The woman is always living in a great deal of insecurity because of that. That only means that men and women are not equal, which we cannot accept," he added.
