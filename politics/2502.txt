Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said that though food is a personal choice, one should avoid eating what is prohibited in the Constitution. "I'm a pakka (staunch) non-vegetarian and will continue to be so, and there is no restriction. I'm the direct example," he added. His statement came amid the crackdown on cow slaughter in various BJP-ruled states.
