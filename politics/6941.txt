Commenting on the Shiv Sena's criticism of the BJP-led Maharashtra government, the Congress on Monday said that if the party "has any self-respect left, it should immediately quit the government". "Sena is bent on reaping the fruits of power while at the same time is indulging in constant drama of behaving like an opposition party," Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said.
