MoS for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Friday said he declined an offer to become Arunachal Pradesh's Chief Minister as he did not want to get involved in state politics. "CM Kalikho Pul offered me the post first... He wanted me to lead the new government," Rijiju said. Notably, Rijiju was accused of masterminding imposition of President's rule in Arunachal.
