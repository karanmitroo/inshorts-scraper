In addition to four BJP MLAs, two AAP MLAs from the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha also voted for the NDA backed presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind, who won the polls on Thursday. Prior to the polls, AAP had announced support to the opposition's candidate Meira Kumar. The two MLAs who cross-voted are suspected to be among the few suspended legislators.
