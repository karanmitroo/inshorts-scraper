Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Sunday said whatever he is today is because of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. “I would have reckoned Kumar as God, had he not said that he made a mistake by making me the Chief Minister,” the former Bihar CM said. Manjhi clarified he does not have any "animosity" towards Kumar.
