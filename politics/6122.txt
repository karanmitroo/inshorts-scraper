Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has said that his party ‘rotted’ during the 25 years of its alliance in Maharashtra with the BJP. “If Shiv Sena had gone independently, the picture would have been totally different now,” he further said. He added, “Bal Thackeray never hankered for power. He was only concerned about preventing a split in Hindu votes.”
