Addressing the Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said a special formula is being devised to release funds to Andhra Pradesh. This comes after the Telugu Desam Party threatened to exit the NDA alliance over non-allocation of funds promised when Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were separated. The government remains committed to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, Jaitley added.
