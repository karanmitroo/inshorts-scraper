Actor Rajinikanth on Friday took to Twitter and posted, "I extend my full support to our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modiji's Swachhata Hi Seva mission. Cleanliness is godliness." This comes a day after actor Kamal Haasan met AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal in Chennai. Notably, both the actors have been criticising politics in Tamil Nadu and are speculated to enter politics.
