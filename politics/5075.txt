BSP chief Mayawati has said that her political party will never ally or form a government with the BJP's help. "We'll get an absolute majority, we don't need anybody's help and will form the government on our own," she said. Mayawati added that she can never forget how the BJP government in 2003 targeted her in the Taj corridor case.
