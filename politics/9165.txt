AAP splinter group 'Swaraj Abhiyan' on Friday demanded Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's resignation saying he has lost the moral right to govern. The group, led by Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, made this demand over recent controversies involving AAP MLAs Jitender Singh Tomar and Somnath Bharti. While Tomar is accused of forging his degrees, Bharti is accused of domestic violence.
