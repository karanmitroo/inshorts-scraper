Former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat has challenged the BJP to call for fresh elections in the state. "The BJP is here with big moneybags and are trying all sorts of influence on our MLAs. They are shamelessly saying that some MLAs are in contact with them," Rawat alleged. "They've already purchased some... I've faith in our MLAs," he added.
