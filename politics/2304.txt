Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that the BJP workers should not take the law into their hands if they find any discrepancy in development works being carried out in the state. "When we were in opposition, dharna and protest were justified but now you (workers) are in power... Your work is to popularise government schemes," Adityanath added.
