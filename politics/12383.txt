Setting aside his bitterness for BJP, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday backed BJP's demand to confer a Bharat Ratna to former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Kumar also proposed awarding his ideological guru Rammanohar Lohia and ex-CM Karpoori Thakur with India's highest civilian honor. However, he refrained to comment on party leader Shivanand Tiwari's statement questioning the award to Tendulkar.
