According to a Jawaharlal Nehru University probe panel report, the controversial anti-national slogans raised at the campus on February 9 were made by several outsiders and not JNU students. Describing the incident as "unfortunate", the report said that the event was held without the permission of the university administration which amounts to "willful defiance".
