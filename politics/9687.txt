The Shiv Sena Wednesday defended RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's controversial remark on Mother Teresa. The Party said that missionaries opened centres in different countries to promote Christianity and Mother Teresa used to do a similar job, but not with any ulterior motive. Earlier, Bhagwat had said conversion to Christianity was the main objective behind Mother Teresa's service to the poor.
