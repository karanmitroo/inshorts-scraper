Delhi High Court on Wednesday slammed the Delhi government for declaring Rajasthan farmer Gajendra Singh as martyr who had committed suicide at an AAP rally in April this year. AAP's move was challenged by a petitioner advocate who argued suicide was a crime and cannot be glorified. The court has sought a response from the AAP government within 4 weeks.
