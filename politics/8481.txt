Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said Hindus and Muslims don't fight on their own but are made to fight. Targetting the Centre, Gandhi added, "When communal politics ends, some people will have to fold up their business." Speaking at a rally in Bihar's Jalalpur, she also accused Modi of insulting Bihari people by attacking the CM elected by them.
