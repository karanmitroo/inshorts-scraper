Taking a dig at BJP-led Centre over the repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan across the Line of Control (LoC), Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday asked if India's missiles were just for exhibition on Republic Day. "Forget ceasefire, this is direct war. These are direct attacks and India should answer them in the same manner," he further said.
