After BJP lost all three bypoll seats in Rajasthan, party MP Shatrughan Sinha on Friday tweeted, "Rajasthan becomes first state to give BJP Triple Talaq. Ajmer: Talaq, Alwar: Talaq, Mandalgarh: Talaq." "Better late than never, otherwise the disastrous results could or would be soon reformed as Tata-Bye-Bye results. Wake up BJP," Sinha added.
