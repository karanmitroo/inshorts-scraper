Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday claimed that, "Gandhi family has some secrets of Modiji. That's why Modiji will never be able to act against any member of Gandhi family." Earlier, Kejriwal had alleged a nexus between Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal and dared Modi to arrest Sonia Gandhi.
