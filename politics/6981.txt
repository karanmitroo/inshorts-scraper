Congress on Wednesday said party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi never intervened in any administrative matter including the Ishrat Jahan case. "Unlike the RSS, Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi never intervened or gave any suggestion," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi should stop perpetuating bundle of lies by using his cronies and pawns," he added.
