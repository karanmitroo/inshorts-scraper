The Patna high court on Tuesday ordered an interim ban on photos of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and his ministers in the state government's "Badh Chala Bihar" campaign. The courtâ€™s order came while it was hearing a petition filed by an RTI activist who accused the government of misusing public money in the name of the campaign for JD(U)'s publicity.
