AAP leader HS Phoolka on Saturday demanded that the Centre withdraw the Bharat Ratna conferred on former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi as "he justified anti-Sikh 1984 riots". Referring to Rajiv Gandhi's statement on his mother Indira Gandhi's assassination that 'whenever a big tree falls, the earth shakes', Phoolka said such a Prime Minister does not deserve the Bharat Ratna.
