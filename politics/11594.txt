During a mock poll in Jorhat (Assam) on Tuesday, every time a button was pressed in an EVM, the vote went in favour of BJP. Following the incidence, all EVMs of the area are being put through a 2nd level test. However, Congress lodged a complaint with the EC demanding thorough inspection of all EVMs in Assam.
