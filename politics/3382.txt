Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, the first non-BJP CM who supported Modi government's demonetisation move, on Friday changed his stance, stating the move hasn't achieved the desired goals. "I'm against black money, but don't agree with the way the note ban was implemented," he said. "It is time, the government come clear on what it has achieved by demonetisation," he added.
