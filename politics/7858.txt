BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh on Monday said that the party considers the violence in West Bengal's Malda a "national security issue", after BJP's three-member delegation was not allowed to visit the area. Singh also criticised the state government's inaction regarding the opium plantations in Malda which he claimed are "smuggled across the border".
