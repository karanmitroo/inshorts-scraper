Former union minister and DMK leader D Napoleon was inducted into BJP on Sunday in the presence of party president Amit Shah in Chennai (Tamil Nadu). Blaming the DMK leadership for his decision to switch parties, the actor-turned-politician said, "The DMK leadership is bad; they made me a minister but never let me function freely, they had tied my hands".
