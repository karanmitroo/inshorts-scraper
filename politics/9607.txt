The Shiv Sena Wednesday lashed out at J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed by accusing him of 'standing with the terrorists'. "Supporting terrorists is treasonâ€¦ The Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister is standing with the terrorists like a father figure", an editorial in Shiv Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana' read. Earlier, on Tuesday, the BJP had warned Sayeed to mend his ways.
