Narendra Modi will now be given Advance Security Liaison(ASL) facility, after the serial blasts in Patna last weekend just before his "Hunkar-rally". Under ASL, a detailed security cover of Modi's visit to any state will be prepared by the local police. The procedure is similar to the Special Protection Group (SPG) cover recieved by the PM, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul.
