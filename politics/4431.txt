BJD MP Baijayant Panda revealed that he has been returning his salary and daily allowances in proportion to the time lost due to Lok Sabha disruptions. He has been doing it for four or five years after every washed-out session, Panda added. Although it is nothing compared to the amount of money wasted, he said it was a 'symbolic gesture'.
