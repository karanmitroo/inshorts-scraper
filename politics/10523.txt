Ex-Bihar CM and JDU leader Nitish Kumar staged a day-long 'dharna' (sit-in) in Patna on Monday, demanding the central government to give special status category to Bihar. Attacking PM Narendra Modi during dharna, Nitish said, Modi had said in rallies that his party (BJP) will give special status to Bihar but now he has forgotten the people of Bihar.
