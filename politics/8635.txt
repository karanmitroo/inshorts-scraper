BJP MP RK Singh has alleged that the political party is selling election tickets to criminals in Bihar for the upcoming assembly polls. "Popular sitting MLAs are denied tickets... No wonder party workers are enraged in Bihar," Singh added. "If people believe that your government will provide good governance, then you should act in the same way," he also said.
