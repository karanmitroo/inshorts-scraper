BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday said that in the previous UPA government, no one considered Manmohan Singh as the PM, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has restored the pride associated with the post. "In the earlier government, every minister thought of themselves as the PM," Shah said at a press conference in Mumbai.
