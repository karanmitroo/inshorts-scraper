A day after the AAP won the Delhi elections, the Income Tax department has served a notice to the party seeking explanation for donations of over Rs 2 crore. The notice was sent after the Aam Aadmi Volunteer Action Manch  claimed that AAP knowingly accepted funds from bogus firms. AAP has to reply to the notice by Feb 16.
