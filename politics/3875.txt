Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Monday said, "For 52 years after the independence, the RSS didn't have a tricolour at their headquarters in Nagpur. They used to salute the saffron flag." Addressing a rally in poll-bound Uttarakhand, Gandhi added, "Since 7-8 months I'm researching, I even googled about our party to see what is it that BJP-RSS want to destroy."
