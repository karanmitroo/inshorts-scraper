The BJP on Monday expelled a total of 12 party leaders for allegedly attacking its MP Keshav Prasad Maurya in Uttar Pradesh. The MP had written a letter to the state BJP president demanding disciplinary action against the accused. Maurya was reportedly attacked on January 4 when he visited the district party office in Ballia, UP, for organisational elections.
