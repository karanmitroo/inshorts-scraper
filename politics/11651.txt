UP-ruling Samajwadi Party lodged a complaint with Election Commission alleging that a song from film 'Youngistan' promotes the election symbol of the BSP - the elephant. The song, 'Sangemarmar ki Deewarein', was shot in the Ambedkar memorial (Lucknow) and shows elephant statues erected there. The party added that the song is shown on TV and violates the code of conduct.
