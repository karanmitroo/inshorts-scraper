The Janata Dal (United) will not fight the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, to be held in seven phases starting from February 11. This comes after the JD(U) expressed its displeasure over the recently announced alliance between the Samajwadi party and the Congress. JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi had said on Monday that the party had expected a Bihar-like grand alliance.
