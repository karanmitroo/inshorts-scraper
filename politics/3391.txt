Chief Minister Panneerselvam on Saturday launched a signature campaign for converting late CM Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence in Chennai into a memorial. Aiming to garner public support on the matter, Panneerselvam made the first signature to this effect at his residence. Notably, AIADMK chief and the CM-elect Sasikala Natarajan currently operates out of the Poes Garden residence.
