In-spite of support from BJP, the UPA government's Lokpal bill was stalled in the Rajya Sabha by its ally, the Samajwadi Party (SP). It even threatened to support the no-confidence motion, brought by some Lok Sabha MPs from Andhra Pradesh. SP stressed that passing of the bill would lead to police raj dictated by the Lokpal.
