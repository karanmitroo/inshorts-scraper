The Election Commission has cleared Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia of allegations of holding an office of profit. He cannot be disqualified as an MLA for being Deputy CM as several states have posts of Deputy CM, said the poll panel. BJP leader Vivek Garg had earlier appealed President Pranab Mukherjee to cancel Sisodia's membership of the Delhi Assembly.
