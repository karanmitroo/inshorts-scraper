Referring to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's 'Fair & Lovely' comment, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said it shows a "racist mindset". Without mentioning Gandhi, he added that although the phrase is frowned upon the world over, he will pass it off as "ignorance". Earlier, Gandhi had called Government's scheme to reclaim black money a 'Fair & Lovely' scheme.
