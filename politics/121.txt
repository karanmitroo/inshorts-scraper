Shiv Sena's Goa unit has accused BJP President Amit Shah of acting like a "kangaroo court" after he said the BJP will resolve the Mahadayi river dispute if it wins the Karnataka Assembly elections. The dispute is between Goa and Karnataka over sharing water from Mahadayi river. A kangaroo court refers to a court where law and justice are disregarded.
