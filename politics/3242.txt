Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Friday described PM Modi's two-and-a-half year tenure as a film journey, starting from 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' (DDLJ) and then turning out to be 'Sholay'. Rahul said Modi earlier spoke about 'achche din' like the ones of DDLJ which turned out to be 'Sholay' in which Gabbar took away "hard-earned money" of people through demonetisation.
