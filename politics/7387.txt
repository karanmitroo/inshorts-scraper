BJP MP Yogi Adityanath's Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) has threatened to boycott voting in the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh if BJP does not make him its chief ministerial candidate. Hoardings with slogans such as "Yogi Nahin Toh Vote Nahin, Mission 2017" have been put up in Faizabad. Meanwhile, Adityanath has expressed "unhappiness" and distanced himself from the call.
