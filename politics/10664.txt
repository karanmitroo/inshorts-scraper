Taking a step further in eGovernance, Andhra Pradesh state cabinet has now gone paperless. On Monday morning, wielding iPads in their hands, CM Chandrababu Naidu and his council of ministers conducted a meeting of what is being called "eCabinet", a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country. This is expected to become a permanent feature of the cabinet meetings from now on.
