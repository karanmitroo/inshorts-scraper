Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday demanded sacking Union Minister VK Singh, after the latter made a controversial statement in the Faridabad Killing case. Singh had said the Centre was not responsible every time stones were thrown on a dog. Kejriwal tweeted, “VK Singh’s statement is shameful and prosecutable under SC/ST Act. A case should be registered against him immediately".
