The CBI on Wednesday told a special court that no sufficient evidence has been found against former Gujarat minister Amit Shah, in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case. Shah, a close aide of Narendra Modi and BJP's election-in-charge in UP, is facing murder and conspiracy charges in two other fake encounter cases â€” Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Tulsiram Prajapati.
