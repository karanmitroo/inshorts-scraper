While addressing a rally in Uttarakhand, PM Narendra Modi highlighted the corruptness of Congress and said that it turned the state from a "Devbhoomi" to a "loot-bhoomi". The appointed people lost no opportunity to make personal gains and were caught on camera, he added. Modi was referring to a sting operation, which showed CM Harish Rawat offering bribes to MLAs.
