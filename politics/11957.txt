The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice to CM Arvind Kejriwal along with AAP leaders Manish Sisodia, Prashant Bhushan and Shazia Ilmi. A petition was filed by Amit Sibal (son of Kapil Sibal) against Kejriwal (and others) in a defamation case. They had alleged that Amit had taken advantage of his father's position to represent certain telecom companies.
