Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday accused Muslim bodies of "creating hindrances" in resolving the Ram Janmabhumi-Babri Masjid dispute and said the "outer limit" to settle the issue is April 2018. "All the Muslim parties had yesterday said on TV that this (out-of-court negotiation) is all waste of time...they are trying to delay it," he said.
