Independent J&K MLA Sheikh Rasheed on Monday said in the Assembly that the state was "neither an integral part of India nor Pakistan's jugular vein". He further demanded a referendum to decide Jammu and Kashmir's status. Rasheed's remarks invited criticism from the ruling BJP which asked him to resign and advised him to either join separatists or migrate to Pakistan.
