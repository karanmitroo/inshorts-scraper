Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi hit back at the union territory leaders saying that all the work she is doing falls under her responsibility. "I am designated both as an LG as well as an Administrator", she said, adding that elected representatives refused to cooperate with her in her efforts. The Puducherry Assembly recently passed a resolution limiting her powers.
