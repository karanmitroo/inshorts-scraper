Reacting to the recent arrest of several separatist leaders, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said, "The separatists don't abide by our Constitution. The separatists should have been arrested much before." He added, "We should book the separatists according to the law." Notably, separatist leader Shabir Shah was arrested by Jammu and Kashmir Police on Tuesday night on charges of terror funding.
