Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly alleged that former PM Indira Gandhi had snubbed a report on demonetisation of certain banknotes recommended by the Wanchoo committee in 1971. Addressing BJP MPs on Friday, Modi further said, "We are not doing anything new... This (demonetisation) was the plank of the Congress but they didn't have the guts to implement it."
