BJP faced pressure on Sunday with sitting Lucknow MP Lalji Tandon signalling his reluctance to vacate the seat for party president Rajnath Singh, saying he would do so only for Narendra Modi. He was speaking against the backdrop of indications that Singh may shift from Ghaziabad to Lucknow. Earlier, Murli Manohar Joshi pressurized BJP to re-nominate him from Varanasi.
