Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said, "Terrorism is just like 'Bhasmasura' (a Raakshasa, according to Hindu mythology) as it will eat at the end of the day the people who encourage it initially." Naidu further said, "Pakistan every day is provoking our border security forces. Their policy of aiding and funding terrorism will ultimately affect them seriously."
