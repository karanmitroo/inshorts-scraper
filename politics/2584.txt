Reacting to Uttar Pradesh government's crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses, Yoga Guru Ramdev on Wednesday said, "Whatever is illegal should be acted against. What is the problem in it? Be it illegal slaughterhouses or illegal mining." Ramdev further said that under Chief minister Yogi Adityanath's rule, Uttar Pradesh would become an ideal state (uttam pradesh).
