The Chief Judicial Magistrate of Lucknow on Monday issued a non-bailable warrant against expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh for making a derogatory comment against BSP chief Mayawati. Singh had recently compared Mayawati to a prostitute while condemning her ticket distribution policy and alleging that she sells party tickets to anyone who pays her the highest amount.
