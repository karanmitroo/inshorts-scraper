After BJP slammed Congress President Rahul Gandhi for wearing a jacket that they claimed to be worth nearly ₹70,000, Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury said she can show people the same jacket for ₹700. "I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the desperation of the BJP. They have actually got the people searching online for the rate," Chowdhury added.
