Congress Spokesperson Raj Babbar on Friday accused the ruling Akhilesh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh of 'sleeping for four years and then rushing forward to complete gigantic projects in just one year'. The projects would never be completed in a year, he claimed. Babbar further claimed the Samajwadi Party government wanted to use unfinished projects to get re-elected in 2017.
