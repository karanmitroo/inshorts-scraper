Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday said, "Gandhiji sacrificed his life for the country; Indiraji too sacrificed her life. Who came from your house? Not a single dog came from your family." Further slamming PM Narendra Modi, Kharge said, "You are good in speaking, you give good speeches, but you can't fill stomach with good speeches."
