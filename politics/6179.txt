Amid the ongoing protests over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday convened an all-party meeting to discuss the current situation in the valley. Calling it "meaningless", opposition National Conference said it will not attend the meeting unless a credible, effective, and humane leadership is re-established in the state.
