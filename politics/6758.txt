The BJP on Thursday slammed National Conference leaders Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah for playing "politics of secessionism" and "encouraging separatists and anti-India forces" in the state by raising issues like NEET and Sainik Colony. BJP leader Virender Gupta said that the statements were issued to "settle political score with CM Mehbooba Mufti and the PDP-BJP alliance government".
