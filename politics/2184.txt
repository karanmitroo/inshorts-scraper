Senior AAP leader Kumar Vishwas, in an interview, has said partyâ€™s Convenor Arvind Kejriwal's stand on surgical strike was wrong and he shouldn't have attacked the Prime Minister. "Blaming EVMs isn't good. That can be a factor but we failed to reach out to the voters and volunteers," he said. Ticket distribution during Punjab election was wrongly done, he added.
