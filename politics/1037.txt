Slamming Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi for calling the GST 'Gabbar Singh Tax', Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said those who are used to 2G and coal scams would have objections to a legitimate tax. He further criticised opposition parties' decision to observe demonetisation's first anniversary on November 8 as Black Day, saying it displayed their faith in cash economy.
