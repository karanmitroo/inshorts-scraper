A video showing CPI(M) party in Kerala using an ambulance as a part of its bike rally surfaced on Friday. The video shows the ambulance equipped with speakers, a generator and covered with flex posters of the party. Terming the use of the vehicle as "misuse of power", a BJP leader said the party is "taking law into their hands".
