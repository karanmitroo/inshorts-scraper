The AAP has failed to secure any of the 29 seats it contested during the Gujarat Assembly elections. Accusing the BJP of "hiding something", AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj demanded that 25% VVPAT paper slips be randomly selected in each constituency and be tallied with EVM results. Meanwhile, an EC official said that random vote tally in Gujarat showed 100% match.
