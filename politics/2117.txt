Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Wednesday said those who think in the country's favour cannot adjust with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. "Kumar Vishwas is in the AAP, but he has always raised his voice in favour of the Indian soldiers and Kejriwal's record shows that he supports those who dream of dividing the country," Tiwari added.
