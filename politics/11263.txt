Puri Shankaracharya, Swami Adhokshjanand Devtirath, Thursday said that he would go to Varanasi to ask religious leaders to oppose Narendra Modi, whom he held responsible for the 2002 riots in Gujarat. "He has committed sins and no justice loving person can ever like him," the Shankaracharya said. He also accused RSS of using religion to mislead the people.
