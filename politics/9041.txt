Home Minister Rajnath Singh has claimed that India houses the oldest church in the world. A media source quoted Singh as saying, "Brothers and sisters, the first ever church in the world was built in Kerala around 2,000 years ago. This is the specialty of Indian culture". However, it was not clear which church Singh was talking about.
