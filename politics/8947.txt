The BJP on Sunday slammed party leader Shatrughan Sinha for meeting Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and calling him as the 'guardian of the state'. A senior BJP leader said, "The way Shatrughanji lauded Nitish only hours after the PM attacked him in Muzaffarpur is an embarrassment." Sinha had urged on Saturday that 'no politics should be seen in the meeting'.
