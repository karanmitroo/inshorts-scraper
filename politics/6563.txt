Congress leader Ajay Maken on Thursday termed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as "mini Modi", alleging he spent large sums on advertisements, while Delhi was reeling under water and power shortage. "Instead of performing his duties, Kejriwal is busy spreading lies through advertisements," he said. Instead of wasting time in other states, he should look after Delhi, Maken added.
