BJP leader Amit Shah on Saturday was re-elected unopposed as the party's national President, where he will take charge of his first full term of three years. PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh had proposed Shah's name. Earlier in July 2014, Shah was elected midway as the BJP President after Rajnath Singh began his term as Home Minister.
