Since MPs are not frisked in the Parliament house complex, Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar on Friday suspended 12 MPs (8 Congress, 4 TDP) from Andhra Pradesh after she received specific inputs that protesting members could bring "unwanted dangerous objects" inside the House. The rule was invoked for the first time since the rule was created in 2001.
