Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said BJP should declare it will contest the next elections using only cheques if it was serious about fighting black money. "Anyone who questions the government is being labelled a traitor or an irresponsible person," he added. Khurshid further stated the government should focus on the fake currency being pushed into India from outside.
