The Madras High Court has extended its stay on a floor test in the Tamil Nadu Assembly and on holding by-elections for the seats left vacant after the disqualification of 18 MLAs supporting sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran. The demand for a floor test for the CM E Palaniswami-led government had risen after the merger of two rival AIADMK factions.
