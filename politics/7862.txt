Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa on Tuesday wrote to PM Narendra Modi seeking to promulgate an ordinance that would allow the conduct of bull-taming festival Jallikattu during Pongal on 14 January. Jaya argued that event has a "deep attachment" to the rural people of the state and "arrangements have already been made". Earlier, Supreme Court had stayed Centre's notification allowing Jallikattu.
