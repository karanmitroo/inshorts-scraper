Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who reached Jantar Mantar on Friday to support the protesting ex-servicemen in the 'One Rank One Pension Case', was asked to leave the protest by ex-servicemen. Feeling that his visit was a political move, protesters raised slogans of "Rahul, go back". "We have been protesting for 62 days, why didn't he come earlier?", a protestor said.
