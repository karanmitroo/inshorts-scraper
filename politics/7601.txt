The Rashtriya Janata Dal today criticised the HRD Ministry's recent decision to install national flags at all central university campuses, which came after a meeting was held with the Vice Chancellors of 39 central universities. RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha said, "We learn nationalism not through the flags only but through engagement, discussions, debates."
