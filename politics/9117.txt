Pakistan's Foreign office spokesperson Qazi Khalilullah on Thursday accused India of politicising the UN Security Council's Sanctions Committee by making baseless allegations against Pakistan. He added that interference in the internal affairs of any country is violation of the UN Charter's principles. China also blocked India's move in the UN demanding action over Lakhvi's release earlier this week.
