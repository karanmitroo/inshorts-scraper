Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Kumar Singh on Monday said that Pakistan is a country of cowards and soon India will teach a good lesson to them. Further reacting to the recent ceasefire violation by Pakistan, Singh added, "On one side they (Pakistan) show white flags and on other target civilians. Our Indian army is retaliating."
