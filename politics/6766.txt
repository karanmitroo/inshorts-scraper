Assam CM Tarun Gogoi on Tuesday slammed Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar for giving credit to the Centre for rising Rhino population in Assam. Gogoi added that the Centre should not just be eager in claiming credits but should also "own the discredit for its alleged failure in checking the dwindling population of Asiatic lions" in Gujarat's Gir forest.
