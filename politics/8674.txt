Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said if the Janata Dal-United (JD-U), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress alliance, didn't win the upcoming assembly elections, Bihar would be the "bigger loser". “If people give us another chance, I will continue to work with the same zest and passion. If people do not... It's the people who would lose,” he said.
