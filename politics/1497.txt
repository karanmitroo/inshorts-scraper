BJP spokesperson for Jammu and Kashmir Virender Gupta said on Thursday that time has come when the people of Jammu and Kashmir should say goodbye to Article 370. Gupta added that Article 370 has created a "separatist psyche" and acts as a breeding ground for "separatist emotion". Notably, Article 370 of the Constitution grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
