Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad who recently assaulted a senior Air India official, has claimed that he was told by a top party leader not to speak with the media about the issue. "I am not hiding and will speak to all after Wednesday," the MP said. Gaikwad further threatened legal action against the national carrier.
