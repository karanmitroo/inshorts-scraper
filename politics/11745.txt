After skipping the rally with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday, activist Anna Hazare said he will neither campaign for Banerjee nor for any other Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidate. "TMC is giving tickets to tainted leaders. Anna was not aware of that. When he came to know, he decided to pull out," said Anna's aide Sunita Godra.
