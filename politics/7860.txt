BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav on Monday said that the party is "ready to go ahead with the BJP-PDP combination" in J&K, the way it was formed eight months ago. However, PDP should take the "first initiative", he said. Madhav added they are hopeful that the PDP would make a formal announcement soon and end the uncertainty over government formation.
