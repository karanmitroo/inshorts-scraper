BJP's office in Kolkata was allegedly attacked by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) students' wing members on Tuesday, reports said. This came immediately after WB CM Mamata Banerjee's close aide and TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay was questioned and arrested by the CBI in connection with the Rose Valley chit fund scam. We will seek justice from the court, Banerjee said.
