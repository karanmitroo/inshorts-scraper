Activist Irom Sharmila, who is making her electoral debut in the Manipur polls, has said she has not given up her fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) but only changed her strategy. She is contesting against Manipur's sitting CM Okram Ibobi Singh in the elections. Sharmila had ended her 16-year fast against the AFSPA last year.
