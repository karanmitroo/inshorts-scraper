The BJP is expected to win 170-183 seats in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, according to the India Today-Axis Opinion Poll. With Mayawati's BSP likely to bag 115-124 seats, the incumbent SP is expected to win 93-104 seats. While the poll predicts a hung assembly, it also says that Congress would barely be able to reach double figures.
