AIADMK leader M Thambidurai on Wednesday demanded that all Indian languages be called national and recognised as official languages of this country. To make his point, Thambidurai began his speech in Tamil without informing the Speaker's office in advance. "This is the situation that if I have to speak in Tamil, I need to get permission in advance," he said.
