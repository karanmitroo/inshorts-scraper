Uttar Pradesh urban development minister Azam Khan said on Friday that a BJP MP might have thrown the bodies in the Ganga to tarnish the Samajwadi Party's image. “He (Sakshi Maharaj) received the news first. He may have brought the bodies there in trucks and thrown them in the Ganga, perhaps to malign the image of the government”, he said.
