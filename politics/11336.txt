The JNU Students’ Union is planning to visit Varanasi on Apr-29 and start a campaign against BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi. According to them, throughout India there is unprecedented propaganda blitz screaming “Modi” which indicates that a ‘mass hypnosis’ has been created. They say it’s their duty as an elected body, and also tradition to make “alternative democratic voices” heard.
