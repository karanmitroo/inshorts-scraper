The Shiv Sena on Monday slammed the BJP over the recent Cabinet reshuffle and compared it to shuffling a pack of cards. An editorial in Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana' alleged that the reshuffle was a part of the party's preparation for the 2019 elections. It further accused PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah of favouritism.
