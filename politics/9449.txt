The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has warned its volunteers against attending the meeting organised by ousted leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, saying that attending the meet would be considered "indiscipline". Some leaders of the party have also accused it of threatening members with a "disciplinary action". The Yadav-Bhushan camp has fixed Ambedkar Jayanti (April-14) for the dialogue.
