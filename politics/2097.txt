A day after Pakistan mutilated bodies of two Indian soldiers, Congress leader Manish Tewari said, "The irony of this situation is that India does not have a full-time Defence Minister." He further said, "The government seems to be losing control over this country, it is high time Prime Minister realises the sensitivity of the situation and gets his act together."
