Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Tuesday tweeted that surgical strikes have failed to "deter" militants from attacking the armed forces. He also urged the Centre to explain its Pakistan policy after seven soldiers were killed by terrorists in the Nagrota attack. He also said Pakistan was no more isolated internationally now than it was six months ago.
