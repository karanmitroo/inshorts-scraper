J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday met PM Narendra Modi in Delhi and stated that he is equally concerned about the situation in Kashmir as others are. “Mufti sahab (her father) used to say that Modi ji has 2/3rd majority in the Parliament and if during his regime the situation doesn't change then it will never change,” she added.
