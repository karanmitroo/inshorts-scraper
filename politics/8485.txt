The second phase of the Bihar elections on Thursday witnessed 55% voter turnout, though the time duration for voting was curtailed in all but nine constituencies  due to security threats. Polls to 32 seats were observed in six Maoist-affected districts, and female voters reportedly outnumbered male voters by 5%. The third phase of the elections is scheduled for October 28.
