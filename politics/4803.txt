After Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticised the demonetisation policy, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Sunday tweeted, "NDA-I bestowed Bharat Ratna to Amartya Sen and he showed...what a unique Namak Haraam he is". Swamy also retweeted a tweet which said that a lot of NDA-I beneficiaries turned out to be "Trojan Horses" including ex-PM Vajpayee's aides Sudheendra Kulkarni, Brajesh Mishra.
