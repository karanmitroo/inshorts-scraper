Senior BJP leader LK Advani on Thursday said that he doesn't have the confidence that the 'Emergency', declared in 1975-1977, cannot happen again in India. "At the present point of time, the forces that can crush democracy, notwithstanding the constitutional and legal safeguards, are stronger," Advani said. However, he added, "I don't say that the political leadership isn't mature."
