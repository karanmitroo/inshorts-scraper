Assam Congress MP Gourav Gogoi on Monday came to Parliament wearing a mask to draw attention to the deteriorating air quality and pollution in Delhi. Gogoi said he read about the increase in PM (particulate matter) level and dropped the idea of walking to Parliament without a mask. He added Congress had raised the pollution issue in last parliament session.
