Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das was spotted riding a scooter without wearing a helmet on Diwali in the capital city Ranchi on Thursday. Around half-a-dozen other bikers had been accompanying Das during the ride and almost all of them did not wear helmets. Several other reports claimed that the CM took to the road without his security cover.
