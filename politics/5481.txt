A cartoon published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' mocking the Maratha silent rally over Kopardi rape case has sparked a controversy for showing a protesting couple kissing. In the cartoon, the words 'Mook Morcha' (silent rally) were changed to 'Mooka Morcha' (kiss rally). The Maratha community has demanded an apology from Sena for allegedly insulting people protesting against the crime.
