Less than two months after being arrested on molestation charges, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan has reportedly been booked again on molestation charges by a relative. The complainant further accused him of pressuring her into a physical relationship with him. Khan, however, said he was innocent and being unfairly targeted. Notably, Amanatullah had resigned from all party posts on Saturday.
