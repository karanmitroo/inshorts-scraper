Former PM Manmohan Singh on Friday said, "Independent thinking in India is under threat and Centreâ€™s attempts to suppress peaceful dissent is undemocratic,". "Recent attempts to interfere with free expression of students at the HCU (University of Hyderabad) and JNU are of particular concern," he said. "We must make every effort to protect the autonomy of every university," he added.
