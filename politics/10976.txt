CPI on Saturday asked the Centre and state governments to lift ban on Maoists saying, economic offences and communal violence were more harmful to society than the Left party extremism. Left party extremism was born with an ideology for uplifting the poor and the downtrodden, and "that it could not be stopped through a barrel", CPI leader, K Narayana said.
