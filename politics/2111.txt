The Election Commission said on Thursday that it will hold an open hackathon in the last week of May, allowing people to try and hack EVMs. The announcement comes amid various political parties and leaders alleging tampering of EVMs in the elections. The EC had earlier said it might invite technocrats, scientists and political parties to participate in the hackathon.
