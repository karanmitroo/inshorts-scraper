NCP chief Sharad Pawar released an autobiography on Thursday titled ‘On My Terms – From The Grassroots To The Corridors Of Power’ as part of his 75th birthday. Excerpts from the book revealed that Pawar formed the NCP owing to "shocking amendment to the constitution of Congress" to elect Sonia Gandhi as President even though Pawar was a "natural claimant".
