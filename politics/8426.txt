Delhi CM and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal will be visiting Punjab on Saturday amid the atmosphere of tension in the state following the finding of a desecrated holy book. Notably, AAP had won all its four Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2014. However, two of them were later suspended over alleged 'anti-party' activities.
