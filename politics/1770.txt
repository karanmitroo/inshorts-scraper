Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has said that he would attend the 'BJP Hatao, Desh Bachao' rally on August 27 if the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) invited him. It was earlier speculated that Nitish would skip the anti-BJP rally owing to differences between his party Janata Dal (United) and RJD as they are supporting different presidential candidates.
