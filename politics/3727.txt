Addressing a poll rally, UP CM and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said he once thought that SP's election symbol 'cycle' would slip out of his hands. The Election Commission had allotted the symbol to Akhilesh's SP faction after he proved the majority strength. "By God's grace and your blessings, 'cycle' has come to you again," Akhilesh added.
