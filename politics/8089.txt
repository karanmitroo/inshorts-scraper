Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut criticised the National Security Advisor level talks held between India-Pakistan on Sunday and said that it is futile to have talks with a hostile neighbour who sponsors terrorism in India and wants to destroy it. "While their talks keep happening, Kashmir continues to get infiltrated and ceasefire violations are on the rise," Raut added.
