Putting PM Narendra Modi in the dock, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Arjun Modhwadia on Saturday asked Modi to explain his frequent air travels on government expense ahead of Lok Sabha elections. Modhwadiaâ€™s anger came over reports which claimed that Kamla Beniwal spent government money on flights for her personal visits to Jaipur when she was governor of Gujarat.
