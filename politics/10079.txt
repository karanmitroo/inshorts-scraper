In much relief to Jayalalitha, an 18 year old income tax return case against her was withdrawn, Thursday. The court allowed withdrawal of prosecution by the I-T department, after the latter accepted her pleas. A total of four cases against Jayalalitha, her aide Sasikala and their firm, filed in 1996 and 1997 for not filing income tax returns were withdrawn.
