Reacting to a report of a woman removing her clothes in front of RBI office after failing to exchange old notes, BJP ally Shiv Sena on Friday described the Centre as the "worst regime in 10,000 years". Shiv Sena added, "When a woman in distress sits on a street in Delhi and condemns the government, it's like government-sponsored Nirbhaya tragedy."
