YSR Congress chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Sunday said the party is ready to move a no-confidence motion in the Parliament against the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. He added the party would even support Andhra Pradesh's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) if it took the same step. YSR Congress has reportedly decided to pass the motion in March-end.
