Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said, "It is our victory that Congress President Rahul Gandhi, whose ancestors used to say that they are 'accidental Hindus', today says he is a Janeudhari Hindu." Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had said Gandhi was a Janeudhari Hindu after his name was reportedly entered in the 'Non-Hindu register' at Somnath Temple last year.
