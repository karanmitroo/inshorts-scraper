Munna Marandi, the son of Jharkhand's BJP unit chief Tala Marandi, has been booked by the police for allegedly sexually abusing a minor girl. The girl, aged around 16, claimed that Munna sexually exploited her for nearly two years on the promise of marriage. This comes amid allegations of Munna having married an 11-year-old last week.
