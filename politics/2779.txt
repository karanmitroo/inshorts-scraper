Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has mockingly credited Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi for BJP's victory in the assembly elections. "I wish he leads the party for long, we want to achieve the majority in the forthcoming elections too," he said. Parrikar also taunted Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh, saying he had come to Goa for luxury and not to work.
