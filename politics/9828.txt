The Election Commission told the Delhi High Court Wednesday that AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal is correctly enrolled in voter's list for the Feb 7 Delhi polls. A plea was filed in HC by Congress leader Kiran Walia seeking removal of Kejriwal's name from the Delhi electoral rolls, claiming he has illegally declared himself a resident of the national capital.
