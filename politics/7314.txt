The BJP has removed the Vice President of its youth wing Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha, Shyam Dwivedi, from his post in Kashi after he allegedly made controversial remarks against AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi. Reacting to Owaisi's "I won't say Bharat Mata Ki Jai" statement, Dwivedi called him a traitor and offered â‚¹1 crore to anybody who chops off his tongue.
