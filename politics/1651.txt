Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said Bihar's ruling Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance was a mismatch, calling it an "alliance of fear." This comes after Bihar CM and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar resigned citing a crisis in the alliance amid corruption allegations against RJD's Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family. Kumar will reportedly continue as Bihar CM until further developments.
