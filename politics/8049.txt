A petition was filed by an NGO on Friday to seek a freeze on BJP's election symbol 'lotus' claiming that it "represents the manifestation of God" and its "unrestricted" use by poll panel during elections is "illegal". Since the petitioner spoke in Hindi, the court directed the matter to another bench for hearing, to be held on January 5, 2016.
