SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday claimed that the Dadri mob lynching incident in September 2015 that left a 50-year-old dead over suspicion that he consumed beef involved three BJP men. Yadav, who was speaking at a youth convention at the party headquarters, added that if PM Narendra Modi calls him, he will reveal those names.
