Police on Saturday arrested 1,150 workers belonging to various political parties after they resorted to rail roko in Puducherry. The workers went on a procession to block trains to extend their solidarity to the striking workers of Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC), a government-owned company. Over 12,000 NLC employees have been on an indefinite strike since July 20 seeking wage revision.
