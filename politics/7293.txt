Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said that free speech and nationalism can co-exist. He said, "We are in the favour of freedom of expression... We are in the support of dissent and disagreement. The Constitution gives the freedom of dissent but not the destruction of the nation." Jaitley was addressing the media about the BJP National Executive meet.
