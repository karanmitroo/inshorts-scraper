After supporting DU student Gurmehar Kaur over her viewpoint, lyricist Javed Akhtar has criticised those who did not allow BJP leader Shazia Ilmi to speak at Jamia Millia Islamia university. "Itâ€™s a shame Shazia was stopped and triple talaq was considered a "sensitive" topic. With what face such people ask for tolerance from others," he tweeted.
