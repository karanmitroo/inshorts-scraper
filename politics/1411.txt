AIADMK Amma's deputy chief TTV Dhinakaran on Friday met his aunt Sasikala in Bengaluru's Parappana Agrahara Central Prison on her birthday. This comes a day after the TN government agreed for a judicial probe into former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's death. The move was reported to be a step towards the merger of AIADMK's EK Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam faction.
