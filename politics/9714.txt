VHP international president Praveen Togadia Sunday defended the 'Ghar Wapsi' programme by calling it legitimate and constitutional. "Since the SC has observed that Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life, 'ghar wapsi' cannot be termed as unconstitutional", Togadia said. He also called for making India a 'Hindu Rashtra' to uphold the dignity of the community.
