Union Minister Anant Hegde has said polarising people for the right cause is real democracy, adding that he hoped the Karnataka Assembly elections will be polarised as the Hindus were fed up of Congress' appeasement policy. Earlier, Hegde was criticised for saying the BJP was here to "change the Constitution". He later rendered an apology in the Lok Sabha.
