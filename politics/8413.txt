Shiv Sena on Saturday took a jibe at PM Narendra Modi saying the BJP has got 'Modi oxygen in the form of power which will last till its subsidy of popularity ends'. "The future belongs only to Sena... We will fight with whosoever is willing to join us, or else, we are fully prepared to fight all alone," Sena added.
