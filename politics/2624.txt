Kerala Congress leader MM Hassan has told a gathering that a menstruating woman's body is impure and she mustn't enter places of worship during this period. "Muslim women don't observe fast during menstruation," he said. His remark prompted a participant to ask him, "If it's blood that is impure, arenâ€™t you, me and others also part of that impurity".
