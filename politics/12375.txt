The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party has ruled out any possibility of forming an alliance with either Congress or BJP. Earlier, CM Sheila Dikshit, in an interview, had said, "Won't comment on alliance with AAP. I don't rule it out, I don't rule it in. Moreover, reacting to Dikshit statements, Kejriwal tweeted, "Sheila ji's statement shows Cong has conceded defeat."
