DMK leader MK Stalin on Saturday charged the AIADMK with not considering welfare of farmers, many of whom had committed suicide. They committed suicide "due to debt burden as they were not getting adequate prices for their produce", Stalin said. He further alleged that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa did not implement the farmer welfare scheme she promised during the previous elections.
