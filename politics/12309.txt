The "None of the above" option, introduced in September this year, polled just 0.63% (49,892 voters) of the valid votes in Delhi, followed by 1.9% (6,43,144 voters) in Madhya Pradesh and 1.92% (5,88,609 voters) in Rajasthan. However, the option was exercised on a wider scale in Chhattisgarh, particularly in the Naxal-affected constituencies, with 3.07% (4,01,058 voters) turnout in its favour.
