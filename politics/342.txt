Congress social media head Divya Spandana on Sunday reacted to a comment by PM Narendra Modi during a Karnataka rally and said, "Is this what happens when you're on POT?" PM Modi had said farmers were his top priority, and by 'top' he meant 'Tomato, Onion, Potato'. "Congress keeps it classy, again," BJP leader Amit Malviya said in response.
