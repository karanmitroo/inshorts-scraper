RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Tuesday supported Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's recent statement asking all parties to come together and make India 'sangh-mukt' (free from RSS). "If all parties don't unite, then RSS will break up the country," Lalu added. He further said that he was ready to back Nitish as a PM candidate in the next Lok Sabha elections.
