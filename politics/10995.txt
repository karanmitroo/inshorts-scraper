Nine students of the Sree Krishna College in Kerala's Guruvayur were Sunday arrested for publishing "objectionable and unsavoury" language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, garbed as a crossword puzzle, police said. Those arrested, and released on bail soon after, included Student Editor of the magazine and its sub-editors. Notably, this is the second such case reported from the area.
