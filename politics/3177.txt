The DMK has moved the Madras High Court seeking to strike down Saturday's vote of confidence in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. With DMK counsel R Shanmugasundaram seeking an urgent hearing, the HC agreed to hear the petition on Tuesday. The DMK had demanded a secret ballot for the floor test, which was denied and eventually won by Edappadi K Palanisamy.
