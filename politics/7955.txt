Suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad on Friday asked party president Amit Shah to provide "instances and proof" of his "anti-party activities" so that he can clear himself of these "serious charges". In a letter to Shah, Azad who was suspended by the party on Wednesday wrote that he never acted against "party’s constitution nor against the interests of our party.”
