Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said that all BJP ministers in the Goa government are corrupt and added that Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is the leader of all those corrupt ministers. This comes after the Shiv Sena recently announced that it will fight the Maharashtra civic polls on its own and said that the BJP "stabbed them".
