In the backdrop of the strike by workers of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday demanded a CBI probe into the issue saying that the Delhi government does not owe anything to the MCD. Kejriwal also added that the BJP provoked the workers to organise the strike and they want Presidential rule in Delhi.
