Late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, who served as the state's CM six times, launched various schemes for the welfare of the state under the 'Amma' banner. These schemes included 'Amma Canteen' for setting up a chain of highly-subsidised restaurants, 'Amma Mineral Water' for supplying hygienic water at affordable cost, and 'Amma Gyms' and 'Amma Parks' for people in rural areas.
