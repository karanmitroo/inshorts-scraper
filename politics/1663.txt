The UP government has revoked its decision to provide separate VVIP lanes at toll plazas for MPs and MLAs stuck in traffic jams. Additional Chief Secretary Sadakant issued letters to all magistrates "modifying" an advisory dated July 13 that ensured separate VVIP lanes, which he said, "raised a number of questions". All existing facilities will benefit all citizens, he added.
