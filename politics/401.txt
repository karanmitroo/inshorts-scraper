Congress President Rahul Gandhi has appointed a six-member panel for the selection of a candidate for the upcoming by-election in Odisha's Bijepur. This is the first time that such an exercise has been carried out in the party. The move aims to ensure that the selection process is open and transparent and that district and block leaders are also involved.
