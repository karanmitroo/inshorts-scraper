Amid the controversy surrounding Rahul Gandhi's absence from the Parliament's budget session, Congress Sunday defended him saying that the party vice-president will come back strongly. "Rahul Gandhi has gone on leave since he has been working round the clock for the past few months for the party. Hence, he wanted a break," said senior party leader AK Antony.
