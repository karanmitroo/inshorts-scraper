Reacting to the trends which showed BJP sweeping polls in all three MCDs, AAP leader Gopal Rai on Wednesday said, "Yeh Modi lehar nahi, EVM lehar hai" (It's not Modi wave, but EVM wave). "EVMs are malfunctioning...the BJP is the centre of corruption...Can you tell me about even one achievement of the BJP in Delhi?" said AAP leader Ashutosh.
