Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Ashutosh on Friday said that the party would reduce electricity tariff in Gujarat by 50% if it wins the December 2017 Assembly elections. The party will take action against the power distribution firm, Torrent Power Limited, for allegedly charging high power tariff, and the BJP and the Congress for allegedly allowing it, he said.
