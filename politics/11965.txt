AAP has tapped Mahatma Gandhi's grandson, former governor and bureaucrat Gopalkrishna Gandhi, to contest against BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. However, the party is yet to hear Gopalkrishnaâ€™s final decision. AAP is also thinking of fielding one of its high profile faces, former TV anchor Shazia Ilmi, to contest against Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
