Human rights activist Irom Sharmila, who turned 45 on Tuesday, will reportedly spend a month in solitude in search of "peace and tranquillity" in Keralaâ€™s tribal-dominated Attappady region after her defeat in recently held Manipur polls. Sharmila, who is known for her 16-year-long fast against AFSPA, got only 90 votes in state polls.
