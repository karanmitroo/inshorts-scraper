The Congress' youth wing's online magazine Yuva Desh on Tuesday shared a meme on Twitter mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's past as a tea seller. The Indian Youth Congress later apologised, claiming that the Twitter page was mostly run by volunteers. Reacting to the meme, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani called the Congress "classist" and "anti-poor".
