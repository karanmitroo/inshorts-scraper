The Karnataka government on Wednesday dismissed reports claiming that preferential treatment was being given to ousted AIADMK chief VK Sasikala at the Bengaluru central jail. The government said Sasikala was being treated like any other ordinary prisoner. "There is no truth in the reports... I had been there yesterday and saw it for myself," state Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy said.
