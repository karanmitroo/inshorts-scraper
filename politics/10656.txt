Attacking the 15-year-old Congress-NCP rule in Maharashtra, BJP president Amit Shah Thursday accused NCP chief Sharad Pawar of "institutionalizing corruption and destroying the system". Pawar brought shame to Maharashtra, where greed of the ruling party leaders led to decline of the state, which witnessed maximum number of suicide by farmers and insufficient infrastructure, Shah added.
