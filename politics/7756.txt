Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Thursday claimed that he went to meet the family of a dead girl in Jamuria as a minister and not for political reasons. He had on Wednesday defied prohibitory orders and attempts by the police to stop him from meeting the family of a minor girl who was allegedly raped and killed in his constituency.
