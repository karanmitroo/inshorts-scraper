BSP supremo Mayawati has said the condition of BJP in UP has worsened to such an extent that it is ready to accept the ‘rejected commodities’ of BSP without any inquiry. "BJP has no candidate in UP, and that is why it is accepting people from other parties,” she added. Notably, BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya had recently joined BJP.
