Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Saturday said the "unholy alliance" led by PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah was behind a sting operation featuring himself. He said the video was "plain falsehood" and aimed at "blackmailing" people of Uttarakhand. Rebel Congress MLAs earlier released a video showing Rawat offering bribes to buy them back into the party-fold.
