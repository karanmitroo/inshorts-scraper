"There are ideological differences between PDP and BJP," said Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Rajya Sabha Monday while making a statement on separatist leader Masarat Alam being released from prison by the J&K government. "We'll not let anybody play with nation's integrity... We'll make any sacrifice, if needed," Rajnath said. "No question of any compromise with a traitor," he added.
