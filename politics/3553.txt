The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly was on Wednesday adjourned following an uproar between the ruling party and the opposition over Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's "those opposing Article 370 are anti-nationals" remark. The opposition members also threw chairs and tables, tore off papers, flung mikes, and raised anti-government slogans in the Assembly, which also injured one of the marshals.
