Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has said that he is free to say anything about UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, but since the latter is party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav’s son, he has “held his tongue”. My relations with Akhilesh are very cordial, he added. He further praised Akhilesh, stating the UP CM is clean, young and educated.
