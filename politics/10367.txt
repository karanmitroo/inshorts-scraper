A 75-feet-long cake and a Victorian 'buggy' hired from London will be the highlights of SP chief Mulayam Singh's 75th birthday on Saturday in Rampur. The celebrations will be marked with performances by popular singers like Hans Raj Hans and the Sabri brothers. "All departments are working to ensure it is a grand welcome," said Rampur's disrict magistrate, CP Tripathi.
