Lok Janshakti Party supremo Ramvilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan on Sunday claimed that Congress President Sonia Gandhi was insulted at the Swabhiman Rally in Patna as she was made to speak much before the leaders of JD(U) and RJD. "One may not agree with the Congress ideology, but its president Sonia Gandhi deserves respect due to her seniority", Paswan said.
