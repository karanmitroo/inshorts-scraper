The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Railways and Environment ministries to set standards for emissions by diesel locomotive engines in the country. The ministries should also “indicate the steps that Indian Railways should take to bring the emissions within the prescribed parameters”, the green panel said. NGT has asked for a report on the matter within six weeks.
