Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to respond to the corruption charges levelled against him by party Vice President Rahul Gandhi. "He has not so far addressed the issue. He has only addressed irrelevant side issues," Tharoor said. Gandhi had accused PM Modi of receiving crores in kickbacks during his tenure as the Gujarat CM.
