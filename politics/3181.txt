RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dividing the nation on the basis of caste, creed, colour, and race for the sake of retaining power. This comes after the PM said in Uttar Pradesh that if a cemetery can be constructed in a village, a cremation ground should also be built.
