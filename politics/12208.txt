After the clean chit given by court to the Gujarat CM, Narendra Modi Friday said he felt "liberated and at peace", claiming he was "shattered" by the blame on him for the killings in the 2002 post-Godhra riots. "Grief, Sadness, Misery, Pain, Agony -- mere words could not capture the absolute emptiness one felt on witnessing such inhumanity," he said.
