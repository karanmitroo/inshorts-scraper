The Bharatiya Janata Party has objected to the Tipu Sultan's portrait that was unveiled by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day. The CM uncovered the portrait among 70 other personalities, including revolutionaries, freedom fighters, and heroes. The BJP said that the Delhi Assembly should not put up a portrait of a controversial personality.
