The Aam Aadmi Party has decided not to contest the Oct-15 assembly elections in Maharashtra. AAP spokesperson Preeti Sharma Menon said that they have learnt a lesson after the Lok Sabha elections that without establishing a strong foundational structure, they will not be able to win elections in any state. The party has decided to concentrate on strengthening the organization.
