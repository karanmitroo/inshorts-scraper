AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday made a promise to make Punjab drug-free within 60 days of the formation of the AAP government in the state. "The police have been arresting the common man without any reason. But in AAPâ€™s regime those responsible for the poor state of Punjab will be put behind bars," he added.
