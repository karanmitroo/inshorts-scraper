The police on Tuesday registered a case against Goa Agriculture Minister Ramesh Tawadkar for allegedly threatening a farmer in the South Goa district. The complainant, Puno Velip, claimed the minister had restrained him while he was riding a scooter and tried to assault him. Tawadkar, however, denied the charges and said he was being targeted ahead of the Assembly elections.
