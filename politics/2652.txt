Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government has reduced the hike in power tariff to 28% after an earlier 55% hike by Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) sparked protests by the Opposition. The hike will be limited to 28% after the government announced that it will continue the subsidy in the power sector which would go directly into the bank accounts of consumers.
