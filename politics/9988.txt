AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal Sunday asked voters to take money from Congress and BJP in the Delhi Assembly elections. While addressing people in West Delhi's Uttam Nagar constituency, Kejriwal said, "I appeal to the people to accept bribes from Congress and BJP but vote for AAP. The money they'll pay you for votes, is the money they've stolen from us."
