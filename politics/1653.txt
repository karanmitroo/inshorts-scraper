Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Wednesday said the party was "deeply disappointed" by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's resignation but respected him as a leader. Congress will continue to fulfil the five-year mandate given to the ruling Congress-JD(U)-RJD alliance by the people of Bihar, he added. Earlier, the BJP had clarified that it does not want mid-term elections in Bihar.
