Senior AAP leader Prashant Bhushan on Saturday questioned party chief Arvind Kejriwal over AAP's candidate selection. Prashant's statement came just two days after his father Shanti Bhushan praised BJP CM candidate Kiran Bedi and criticised AAP. Prashant Bhushan also called for an AAP national council meet and said he wanted the party convener to change.
