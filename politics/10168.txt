During a public gathering of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday, a man hurled a stone at party chief Arvind Kejriwal. The incident happened at around 6.45 pm in the rally at Delhi's Deoli area. Though Kejriwal was not hurt as the stage was away from the sitting area, he slammed the BJP, accusing it of resorting to violence.
