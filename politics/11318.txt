In what would come as a major embarrassment for the AAP, local workers of its unit in Uttar Pradesh's Amethi were on Saturday found jostling with each other to shake hands with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Priyanka, 42, is in Amethi to campaign for her brother and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who faces Kumar Vishwas of the AAP.
