Referring to the recent debate over 'Bharat Mata ki Jai', the political resolution adopted at the BJP National Executive said, "Our Constitution describes India as Bharat also, refusal to chant victory to Bharat is tantamount to disrespect to our Constitution itself." It adds that the BJP would "firmly oppose any attempt to disrespect Bharat, and weaken its unity and integrity".
