Home Minister (HM) Rajnath Singh on Monday formed a three-member team to investigate the missing papers in the alleged fake encounter of Ishrat Jahan. Singh said that Ishrat was described as an LeT terrorist in initial documents. Earlier, the BJP accused former Home Minister P Chidambaram of modifying documents to show that Ishrat was not a terrorist.
