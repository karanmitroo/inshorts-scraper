AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday alleged that the Ram Temple issue was being raked up by the Sangh Parivar to save Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2019 General elections. Supporting advocate Kapil Sibal's plea that the case should be deferred to July 2019, Owaisi said election discourse should be based around "real issues" such as demonetisation and unemployment.
