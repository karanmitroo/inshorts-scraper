Amid the ongoing power struggle in the SP, party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday did not attend the unveiling of the party's election manifesto. SP leader Azam Khan reportedly visited Mulayam at his residence to request him to attend the event. Mulayam had earlier threatened to fight against his son if he did not heed his advice.
