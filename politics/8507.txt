Bihar's Urban Development Minister Awadhesh Kushwaha on Sunday resigned from the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) government after the emergence of a sting video that showed him accepting a bribe. Kushwaha was a nominee from the Pipra assembly constituency in East Champaran for the Bihar assembly elections. JD(U) Chief Sharad Yadav said a new candidate will be fielded from the constituency.
