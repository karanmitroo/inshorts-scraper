Reacting to AAP chief, Arvind Kejriwal's arrest, social activist Anna Hazare said, "Kejriwal going to jail like this was wrong. You should take bail and then fight." Kejriwal, who was on Wednesday arrested in Nitin Gadkari defamation case, said, "I am fighting against corruption. I will not seek bail as I have not done anything wrong".
