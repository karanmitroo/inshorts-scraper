Union Health Minister Harshvardhan on Friday denied proposing a ban on sex education, but added that crudity and graphic representation of culturally objectionable symbols in UPA's sex education programme was not sex education. "Sex education that builds societies free of gender discrimination, teenage pregnancy, HIV-AIDS, pornography addiction should be the goal," he added.
