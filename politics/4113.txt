The Election Commission of India, in August 1993, introduced photo identity cards for voters to improve the electoral rolls' accuracy and prevent frauds. The cards carry personal details, an identification number and in future, may contain biometric data. Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi on Wednesday announced that nearly 100% voters in the upcoming state Assembly elections have voter IDs.
