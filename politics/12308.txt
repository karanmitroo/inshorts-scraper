Incumbent Chief Minister Raman Singh won a third straight victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Chhattisgarh 2013 Assembly elections on Sunday, with the party getting an absolute majority. While the BJP bagged 49 of the 90 seats, the Congress, which at one time looked as if it would oust the BJP, managed to win 39 seats.
