The AAP on Sunday claimed that they had received death threats from Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's legal team during court proceedings in the defamation suit filed against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. "Such death threats were given while the proceeding was going on...if this is the process of justice, it is shocking state of affairs," AAP leader Raghav Chadha said.
