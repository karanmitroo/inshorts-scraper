Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has said that he shares many qualities of Prime Minister Narendra Modi like "making tea", and "playing drums" and is therefore, a "fit candidate" for the PM's post. Claiming that he is not bad looking or corrupt, Khan added, "If I become PM...I'll deposit â‚¹20 lakh in accounts of 130 crore people within six months."
