Reacting to the Centre's direction of banning 'NDTV India', Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday tweeted, "I hope the whole media goes 'off air' for a day in solidarity with NDTV." The I&B Ministry has directed NDTV India to go off air for 24 hours on November 9 for allegedly breaching broadcast norms in its Pathankot terror attack coverage.
