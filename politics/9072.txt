The Congress on Monday demanded that MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan be sacked to ensure an impartial probe into the Vyapam scam. Chouhan "cannot be spared and should take responsibility" of the 45 deaths connected with the scam, Congress leader PC Chacko said. The Congress party also attacked PM Narendra Modi, seeking an explanation into what was happening.
