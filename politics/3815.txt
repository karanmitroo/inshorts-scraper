Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday told voters in Punjab they should accept bribes offered by other political parties but cast their vote only for AAP. This comes a day after Election Commission issued a notice to Kejriwal for similar remarks in Goa alleging that it promoted bribery. If they are offering ₹5,000, ask for ₹10,000, Kejriwal said to voters.
