Even though the political parties are targeting young citizens, the enrollment levels in the age group of 18-19 years, remain terribly low; six out of every 10 newly eligible voters are unregistered, said the Election Commission. Maharashtra performed the worst with 66.2% unregistered young voters while Bihar, AP and Jharkhand had 60.5%, 59.7% and 56.9% unregistered young voters, respectively.
