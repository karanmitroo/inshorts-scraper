Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said that PM Narendra Modi’s surname means ‘Making of Developed India (MODI)’. He made this statement during the launch of a guide book on Swachh Survekshan (Sanitation Survey) of 500 cities. Putting forth the PM’s vision, he added that Swachh Bharat should become a Jan Andolan (mass movement), not a government programme.
