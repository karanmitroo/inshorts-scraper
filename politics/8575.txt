In the run-up to the Bihar Assembly elections, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has released his first ever Dubsmash video featuring a mimicry of PM Narendra Modi. In the video, Lalu is reminding the audience about Modi's promise of 'Acche Din' before Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and Amit Shah's statement over the phrase after the elections.
