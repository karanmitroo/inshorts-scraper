Dubbing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address targeting Pakistan over the Uri attack as an attempt to divert attention, BSP chief Mayawati on Sunday urged him to chalk long-term solution to such problems. “The nation expects the Prime Minister to take stringent steps…so that such incidents do not occur again. However [he]…is not able to build trust among Indians,” Mayawati said.
