Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday attacked the Opposition Congress for causing hindrance to the Parliament session. "Those who have been defeated and sent home are saying now that we've been destroyed we'll destroy you (ruling side)," Modi said. "Disrupt, Destruct and Demolish is now the Congress slogan... They've made a joke of Parliamentâ€™s functioning," he added.
