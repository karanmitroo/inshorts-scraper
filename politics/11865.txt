In a measure of retaliation, Delhi Congress on Sunday kick started a 'Pol Khol Abhiyan' against former CM Arvind Kejriwal. We are launching the campaign to expose the lies he had been telling in the name of common man's welfare, said Delhi Congress Committee President Arvinder Singh. Last month, AAP had launched a similar campaign against BJP and Congress.
