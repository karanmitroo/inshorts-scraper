BJP leader Tajinder Bagga has sent ₹700 to Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury on Paytm, asking her to buy him the same jacket that Congress President Rahul Gandhi wore to a concert. This comes after Chowdhury said that she can show the jacket, which BJP claimed to be worth ₹70,000, for ₹700. Meanwhile, Rahul has said the jacket was a gift.
