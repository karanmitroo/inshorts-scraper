Thirty Congress MLAs have been suspended from Chhattisgarh Assembly after they protested against CM Raman Singh's invitation to a foreign-based mining corporation for investment. The MLAs claimed the company had links with PNB fraud accused Nirav Modi, and was blacklisted in the state. The legislators broke Assembly rules and were automatically suspended for rushing to the Well of the House.
