Former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has called Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar a 'joker' and said, "In the 40 years that I have been in politics I have never seen a more incompetent defence minister." Calling for the removal of Parrikar from the post, Singh accused the BJP of trying to gain political advantage using the recent surgical strikes.
