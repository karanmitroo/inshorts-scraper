The CBI court on Tuesday rejected a discharge application filed by all the 12 accused, including LK Advani and Uma Bharti, in the Babri mosque demolition case and ruled that they will face criminal conspiracy charges. The leaders had pleaded to drop the charges against them, saying they had no role in the demolition of Babri Masjid.
