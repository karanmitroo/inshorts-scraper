Unidentified persons threw country-made bombs on an RSS Seva Kendra and a BJP worker's house earlier today in Kerala. â€œOnly a window pane was damaged," police officials said, adding that no one was injured. This comes days after a 27-year-old RSS worker was killed in front of his parents, wherein BJP had claimed that CPI-M was responsible for the murder.
