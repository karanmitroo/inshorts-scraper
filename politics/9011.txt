Former AAP leader Prashant Bhushan on Friday called Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal 'shameless' and 'hypocrite' for wanting him and Yogendra Yadav back in the political party. "After abusing 'Sale, Kamine' and orchestrating a physical attack by his MLAs in the NC meeting, Kejriwal wants us back! Hypocrite Shameless!", Bhushan posted on micro-blogging website Twitter.
