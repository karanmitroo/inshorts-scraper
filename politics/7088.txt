The Election Commission on Monday registered an FIR against Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi for violating poll conduct by holding a press conference on a voting day. "Holding press conference within 46 hours of closure of polls is violation, which may result into action being taken," officials said. Gogoi also reportedly alleged that the Election Commission was biased.
