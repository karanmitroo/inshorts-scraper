The government on Tuesday suggested to the Supreme Court the prosecution of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy for promoting "hatred between Hindus and Muslims" in his book 'Terrorism in India'. The book violates rules on hate speeches, an affidavit filed by the Home Ministry claimed. The government also opposed Swami's plea challenging the constitutional validity of penal provisions on hate speeches.
