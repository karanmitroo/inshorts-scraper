Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that the government will start a sustained dialogue in Jammu and Kashmir, with former Intelligence Bureau Director Dineshwar Sharma as the Centre's representative. He said it will help "understand legitimate aspirations of people in J&K". When asked about talks with separatists, he said Sharma will be "free to decide whom to talk to".
