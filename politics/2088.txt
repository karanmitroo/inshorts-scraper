Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Thursday said Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had the "potential" to become the Prime Minister of the country. Stating that he always found Gandhi "extremely perceptive and decisive", Singh added, "There was a deliberate attempt to undermine his image by calling him names." Singh further said the time was right for a "generational change" in Congress.
