Ending his self-imposed “political exile”, former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu Tuesday addressed a rally in Haryana to support BJP candidate Kulwant Bazigar from Guhla Cheeka constituency. “I have restarted my political career today from here. This place is like a temple for me and I have a lot of respect for you all in my heart,” he said.
