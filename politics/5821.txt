The Shiv Sena has said the Maharashtra government should have come out with an Ordinance reversing the Supreme Court’s cap on the height of human pyramids in the Dahi Handi festival. "It is okay if...criminals, thieves roam around...but the police has to keep an eye on govindas,” the party said. The Supreme Court has banned human pyramids over 20 feet.
