Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju has said, "Be it DU or JNU...Practice and have your own ideology...there is nothing wrong in that but one should not say anything against the nation." This comes after the ABVP won three out of four seats in DU students' union polls and the Left Alliance won all in JNU students' union elections.
