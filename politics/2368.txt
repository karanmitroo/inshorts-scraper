Hindu Mahasabha has suggested Muslim women, who are victims of triple talaq practice, to embrace Hinduism if they want justice. "If our government and law canâ€™t give you justice, we will ensure you get it," said Hindu Mahasabha General Secretary Pooja Shakun Pandey. "I will be happy to marry these women off and perform their Kanyadan," she added.
