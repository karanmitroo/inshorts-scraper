Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan submitted his resignation on Friday to Governor C V Rao. The decision came a day after the Nationalist Congress Party ended its 15-year alliance with the Congress-led government of Chavan, reducing his government to a minority. President's rule is expected to be imposed in the state, where elections will be held on Oct 15.
