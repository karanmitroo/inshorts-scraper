BSP supremo Mayawati on Thursday termed the demonetisation of old high-denomination notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an imposition of "undeclared economic emergency" in the country. Claiming that 90% people were unhappy with the decision, she alleged that the Modi government was trying to divert the attention of voters in Uttar Pradesh from the NDA government's failures.
