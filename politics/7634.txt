Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi was today advised to install statues of terrorists and separatists at the Congress' office by BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. Gandhi "can... pay floral tributes to them every day but the nation can never tolerate such divisive mindset," Naqvi said. Gandhi had earlier said the Modi government and ABVP were bullying an institution like the JNU.
