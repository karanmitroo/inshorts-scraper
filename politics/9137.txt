Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) Vice President Ramchandra Paswan on Sunday said that the NDA has better and more capable election faces than Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav. His statement came in response to the recent attacks on the NDA by the JD(U)-RJD alliance for not declaring its chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections.
