Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday said, "CM Nitish Kumar's arrogance will destroy the present government very soon and he will also fail in completing his tenure." He further said, "If Nitish didn't want to work with us then why did he wait so long? And why he has ruined four years of Bihar?"
