The Kerala High Court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by the prime accused in the solar panel scam, Saritha Nair, seeking a CBI probe into Chief Minister Oommen Chandy's role in the scam. Nair alleged that a businessman paid money to the CM's office in connection with a solar project. The court dismissed the petition, calling it politically motivated.
