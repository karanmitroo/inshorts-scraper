Heaping praise on West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Anna Hazare on Wednesday formally announced his backing to the TMC in the coming elections. He ruled out support to either Arvind Kejriwal or Narendra Modi, adding that Banerjee “thinks and works only for society and country”. The announcement came at a press conference (also attended by Mamata Banerjee) at Delhi.
