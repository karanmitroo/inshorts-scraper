Jharkhand JD(U) President Jaleshwar Mahato on Friday accused the BJP of hatching a conspiracy against the liquor ban in Bihar. He alleged that the BJP government in Jharkhand was transporting liquor to Bihar illegally via LPG cylinders and has also allowed the sale of liquor in bordering areas to ensure that the ban fails.
