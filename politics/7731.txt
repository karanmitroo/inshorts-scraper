Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra on Monday directed the PDP and BJP to resolve the issue of government formation within a day. Vohra will reportedly meet PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday over the issue. His intervention comes a day after Mehbooba termed the BJP alliance an "unpopular move" and said the Centre should address the state's core issues.
