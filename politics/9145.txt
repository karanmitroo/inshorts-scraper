Amid the ongoing row over BJP ministers helping ex-IPL chief Lalit Modi procure UK travel documents, BJP MP RK Singh on Tuesday called it 'legally and morally wrong'. Calling Lalit Modi a 'fugitive', Singh said, "If anybody helps a fugitive, it's wrong." He urged the government to take all measures to bring him back to India to face the law.
