Shifting from Goa government’s earlier stand, CM Manohar Parrikar said on Monday, he wouldn’t allow the controversial right wing outfit Sri Ram Sene (SRS) to work in the state. If SRS chief Pramod Muthalik starts his activities in Goa, we will take action against him, Parrikar said. BJP's spokesman had earlier ruled out the possibility of banning SRS in Goa.
