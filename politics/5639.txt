Recounting her childhood days, J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday said she used to eat lots of golgappas and study less during her class 12th days. Inaugurating a PG medical college in Jammu, Mufti recalled, "My parents wanted me to become a doctor, but I never used to study." She further praised the doctors, nurses and paramedical staff in J&K.
