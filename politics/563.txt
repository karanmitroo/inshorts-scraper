The Rajya Sabha on Friday rejected a private member bill seeking to guarantee employment to every citizen above 18 years of age or provide them unemployment allowance. The bill, moved by SP MP Vishambhar Prasad Nishad, was opposed by BJP who said the focus should be on making people employable rather than making them dependent on government allowance.
