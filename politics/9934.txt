Ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls, BJP Chief Amit Shah Thursday said that their main rival was the AAP. "In this Assembly poll, Congress is nowhere to be seen. We have a fight only and only with Aam Aadmi Party," Shah said. Further, he said if the BJP wins the Delhi elections, "then nobody can stop us elsewhere also".
