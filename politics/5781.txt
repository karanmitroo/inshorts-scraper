Commenting on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's roadshow across Uttar Pradesh, BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain today said Congress is "on the roads and will remain there". Congress' situation is so bad that they will not secure seats in double digits in the state elections, he added. Notably, Rahul Gandhi will launch his roadshow in the state on September 6.
