Blaming BJP and RSS of trying to divide and rule, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi thinks he can run the country alone. He added, “It's the people of the country and their power which pushes the country forward. They need to understand this”. Gandhi also asked Modi to talk less and work more.
