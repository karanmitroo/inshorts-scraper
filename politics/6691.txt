Bihar's Deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav on Tuesday said former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan are demanding President's rule in the state to revive their political careers. Neither Paswan nor Manjhi is worried about Bihar, he added. Paswan and Manjhi had earlier demanded President's rule over the alleged increase in lawlessness and political murders in Bihar.
