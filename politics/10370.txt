Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav celebrated his 75th birthday by cutting a 75-feet-long cake at midnight at a grand event in Rampur (UP). Mulayam also rode Victorian-style 'buggy' (horse-driven carriage), which was brought from London. The mega two-day birthday bash, which was organised by Azam Khan (UP Minister), however, drew flak from several quarters with questioning over funds.
