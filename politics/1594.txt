Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned on Friday after Congress members reportedly created a disturbance to protest the alleged abduction of their MLA by police in Gujarat. They also accused BJP of 'stealing' MLAs to influence the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections and forced repeated adjournments. Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi demanded Congress' apology to Gujarat for 'tarnishing its image'.
