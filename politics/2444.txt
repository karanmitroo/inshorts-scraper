During the joint statement of Indian PM Narendra Modi and Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, the announcer mistakenly asked the leaders to "step down" instead of saying "step off the elevated podium". Soon after he said, "May I request the two Prime Ministers to now please step down," someone loudly asked, "Step down?" and everyone present at the event started laughing.
