Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has challenged Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi to expose PM Narendra Modi in an alleged graft case. "Why doesn't he expose it (papers) outside Parliament?" asked the AAP Convenor. "Friendly match - BJP says they have AgustaWestland against Congress. Congress says they have Sahara/Birla against BJP. Both don't disclose (sic)," he tweeted.
