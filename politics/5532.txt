The Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) on Tuesday lodged an FIR against the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Chairperson Swati Maliwal over alleged irregularities in the appointment of staff in the panel. The DCW is accused of arbitrarily appointing 85 people in the past year. Maliwal, however, claimed that people are bothered as more work is being done in her tenure.
