BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Saturday attacked Bollywood actor Aamir Khan saying that the latter had collaborated with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI to promote his film 'PK', which released in December 2014. Swamy's comment came days after BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav reacted to the actor's intolerance remarks saying that Aamir must teach his wife about the nation's prestige.
