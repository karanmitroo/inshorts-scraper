Former Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil on Wednesday said that the 2008 Batla House encounter in Delhi was genuine. "If someone says something otherwise, then it's his responsibility to prove it," Patil added. His statements came a day after senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh called it 'fake' and dared the government to probe the matter.
