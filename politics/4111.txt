Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien on Wednesday said that the party's theme remains 'Modi hatao, Desh bachao' (remove Modi, save the country). This comes after Trinamool workers allegedly set the BJP office in Hooghly on fire. Moreover, O'Brien added that the movement will continue tomorrow and his party will carry on the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government.
