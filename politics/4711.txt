The Army personnel who were deployed at toll plazas in West Bengal have been withdrawn as the 72-hour routine lead carrier information exercise came to an end. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had accused the Centre of deploying forces without informing the state while the Army released documents that proved it had informed the state about the routine exercise.
