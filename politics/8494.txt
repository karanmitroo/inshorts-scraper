Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday called the return of Sahitya Akademi awards by several writers a “manufactured revolt”. Jaitley accused anti-BJP sections of resorting to “politics by other means”. He further condemned the murders of writers and the Dadri lynching incident but said that it “is the responsibility of the state government to maintain law and order”.
