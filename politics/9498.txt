Congress Wednesday demanded an apology from PM Narendra Modi over Union Minister Giriraj Singh's racial remarks on party president Sonia Gandhi. "Congress strongly deprecates and condemns the intemperate and distasteful remarks of Union Minister, Shri Giriraj Singh, bordering on insanity... PM must dismiss such a minister and apologise to the nation," Congress leader Randeep Sujrewal said.
