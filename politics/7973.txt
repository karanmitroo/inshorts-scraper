Sudhir Joshi, the content editor of Mumbai Congress journal, 'Congress Darshan', was sacked on Monday, after an article in the party mouthpiece criticised former Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru and party president Sonia Gandhi. Apologising for the gaffe, Mumbai Congress Chief Sanjay Nirupam said, "Some words that have been used... are certainly objectionable. I accept the mistake".
