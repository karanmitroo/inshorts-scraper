Special CBI judge, JT Utpat, hearing the case of alleged fake-encounters of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Tulsi Prajaptai was transferred to Pune Wednesday. This was followed by adjourning the hearing on Amit Shah's, who was allegedly involved in the conspiracies, discharge plea till Jul-2. Incidentally, last week, Utpat had reprimanded Shah's advocate for filing an exemption application.
