BJP President Amit Shah had lunch at a party worker's home in Kolkata's Cossipore Lock Gate slum on Wednesday, during his three-day-trip to West Bengal's capital. He was served vegetarian Bengali food including Shukto, alu-jhinge posto (mashed poppy seed potato), fulkopir torkari (potato-cauliflower curry) apart from other dishes and sweets. Shah's trip comes ahead of the Panchayat polls in 2018.
