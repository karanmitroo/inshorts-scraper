Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Nasim Zaidi on Saturday said the Election Commission will soon call a meeting of all political parties to assure them that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) are tamper-proof and secured. Zaidi added that the commission intends to use voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in all coming elections to bring in more transparency in the election process.
