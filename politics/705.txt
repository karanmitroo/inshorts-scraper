The Election Commission on Friday said it has put in place "an elaborate framework of system, security protocols and procedural checks" to prevent any "possible misuse" of the EVMs and VVPATs in Gujarat elections. The poll panel assured that no unaccounted EVMs and VVPATs can enter the election ecosystem, since all activities are tracked and done in presence of stakeholders.
