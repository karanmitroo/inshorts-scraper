Congress on Saturday allegedly released posters in Delhi on the day that Narendra Modi was scheduled to address three rallies back to back in the national capital. Focusing on the Snoopgate scandal, the posters read, "Women of Delhi Beware. For the next two days Saheb is in town. You may need to contact the anti-stalking helpline at 1091".
