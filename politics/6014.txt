BJP feels cornered or threatened by Aam Aadmi Party’s aggressive campaigning in Gujarat, asserted Shiv Sena Spokesperson Manisha Kayande on Saturday. The party’s statement came after the BJP replaced the leadership in Gujarat Assembly with the appointment of Vijay Rupani. The AAP is yet to announce its plan to contest 2017 Gujarat Assembly election.
