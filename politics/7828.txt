Parliamentary Affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday revealed that the Congress version of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill "didn't have the maximum cap" on taxes. Naidu said that it is not fair to make it a "condition" now and added that the budget session "can be preponed" if the Congress allows the passage of GST.
