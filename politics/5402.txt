Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has condemned Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Khoon ki Dalali’ remark on surgical strikes, stating, it is a time to leave aside political differences and unite amidst ongoing tensions at the border. "As we had stated earlier also, all the political parties should stand with the Prime Minister," he added.
