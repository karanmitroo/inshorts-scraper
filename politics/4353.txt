After Congress VP Rahul Gandhi used poetry to attack PM Narendra Modi, #RahulGandhiPoetry was an Indian Twitter trend on Saturday. Users reacted with tweets like, "Rahul Gandhi wanted to do a Atal Bihari Vajpayee ended up being a Kumar Vishwas. Be Original," and "Log toot jaate hain ek ghar banaane me Mujhe sharam nahi aati pappu kehlaane me... #RahulGandhiPoetry".
