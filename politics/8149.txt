National Conference party leader, Farooq Abdullah said on Friday that India needs to give up on claiming Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), as it  "will remain with Pakistan". "PoK belongs to Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir belongs to India," Abdullah said. He further added that India and Pakistan should hold talks and find a way to resolve their tense border relations.
