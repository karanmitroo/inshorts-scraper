Kerala BJP released a campaign flier wherein a late councillor seemed to request people to vote for her mother, who was standing for the by-elections held on Wednesday. The councillor, 23-year-old Kokila Kumar, died in a road accident in September. The flier portrayed her saying, "time did not allow me to complete the term you gave me to serve you."
