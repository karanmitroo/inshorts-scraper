PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to attend Nitish Kumar's swearing-in ceremony as Bihar Chief Minister on November 20 due to "prior fixed programmes," according to Bihar BJP Vice-President Sanjay Mayukh. Union ministers Venkaiah Naidu and Rajiv Pratap Rudy will represent BJP at the ceremony. Earlier, JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar had extended a personal invitation to PM Modi over a call.
