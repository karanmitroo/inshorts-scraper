PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government is reportedly considering to evict the Congress party from its 24 Akbar Road headquarter and three other bungalows in Lutyenâ€™s Delhi. The Centre had earlier served a notice to Congress to vacate the bungalows since the lease had run out. Notably, 24 Akbar Road has housed the Congress party since 1976.
