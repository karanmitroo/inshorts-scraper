The Samajwadi Party will unitedly fight against communal forces, Mulayam Singh Yadav's younger brother Shivpal Yadav said on Saturday. This comes after the party revoked the suspension of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, and party's General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, within 24 hours. We will all fight the upcoming state Assembly elections together, he added.
