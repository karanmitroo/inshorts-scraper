Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Friday asked people at a Congress rally in Belagavi district whether they had ever watched a 'blue film', referring to pornographic films. Slamming the BJP MLAs who were caught watching porn in state Assembly, Siddaramaiah said, "The assembly is like a temple...Such shameless people must resign and retire."
