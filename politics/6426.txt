Congress leader and ex-Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday accused the Centre of creating a "fake controversy" and a "doctored" report on the missing files in the Ishrat Jahan case. This comes after a report suggested that the panel probing to find the missing files "tutored" a witness. "Only the trial of the case...will bring out the truth," Chidambaram said.
