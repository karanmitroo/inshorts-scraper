Congress Tuesday termed the 'Make in India' initiative a farce and criticised the government for the Rafale deal with France. "Modi government has converted 'Make-in-India' into 'Make-in-France' by this unilateral deal," Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said. "It has taken no concrete steps to address the challenges of building global competitiveness in manufacturing," he added.
