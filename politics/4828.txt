BSP chief Mayawati on Saturday said that PM Narendra Modi-led central government's demonetisation decision was hasty. "The step was taken only to help the BJP get political benefit and has triggered a situation of chaos throughout the country, which is condemnable," Mayawati said. "Electoral promises made by PM Modi ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha elections had been forgotten," she added.
