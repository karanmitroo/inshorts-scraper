Reacting to CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan's claim that Madhya Pradesh roads are better than Washington DC roads, a Twitter user posted a photo of an Indian road with potholes and wrote, "Poor condition of Washington road". Sharing a picture of Chouhan being lifted by security personnel during 2016 floods, another user tweeted, "Mamaji, were you talking about this MP road?"
