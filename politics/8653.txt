Distancing itself from RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat's remarks calling for reconsideration of quota in India, the BJP on Monday said it respects the reservation rights of the SCs, STs and OBCs. Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "BJP is not in favour of any reconsideration of reservation being extended to these groups".
