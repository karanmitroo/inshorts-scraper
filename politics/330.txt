BJP's Karnataka CM candidate BS Yeddyurappa, who himself is a farmer's son, will work in farmers' interests, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday during a rally. Adding that the government is planning to start Gramin Retail Agriculture Market so that farmers receive fair prices, PM Modi said that such schemes will only benefit Karnataka if Yeddyurappa becomes the CM.
