A Delhi court Tuesday took strong objection to CM Arvind Kejriwalâ€™s absence in a defamation case, saying "he has no respect for the law". The court also summoned Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and senior AAP leader Yogendra Yadav in the case. Furthermore, the court ordered the trio to positively appear before it at 2pm on the same day.
