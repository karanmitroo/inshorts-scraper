A day after 13 RJD MLAs split from the party, RJD chief Lalu Prasad accused Bihar CM Nitish Kumar of trying to break his party. "Nitish Kumar has been trying to poach the MLAs for months now as his government is now in minority," Lalu said. He also alleged that the signatures of his 13 MLAs were forged.
