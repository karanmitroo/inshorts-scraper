For disrupting Parliament over the Telangana Bill, the Congress on
Tuesday expelled six of its MPs from Andhra Pradesh. The six Lok Sabha
members, L Rajagopal, Sambasiva Rao, Sabbam Hari, Harsha Kumar,
Arun Kumar and Sai Prasad, had blocked proceedings in the House ever
since the beginning of its last session on Feb-5.
