Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday called West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi "two sides of the same coin". "Both (Narendra) Modi and Mamata bluffed the people," she said. Referring to the TMC's slogan of "Ma-Mati-Manush" (Mother-Soil-Humanity), she said, "Ma is suffering, mati is drying up and manush are facing hardship and unemployment".
