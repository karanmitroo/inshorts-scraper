All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday said that standing during the National Anthem cannot be a test of someone's patriotism. "Why one should show patriotism in the cinema hall? What Supreme Court has said is absolutely right... One can stand on official occasions like 15 August, 26 January, etc.", Owaisi added.
