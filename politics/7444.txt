Left Front Chairman Biman Bose on Monday said they have only entered an "electoral understanding" with the Congress and not an alliance. He added there would be no "platform-sharing" between the Left Front and the Congress, but there would be "cooperation". State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury said since the Left is not calling it an alliance, they would reciprocate similarly.
