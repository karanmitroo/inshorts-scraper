Speaking at the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Congress had divided India 70 years ago for electoral reasons and petty gains. He further accused Congress of a hurried bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and said, "Why did Congress dismiss so many state governments at their will. This is no commitment to democracy."
