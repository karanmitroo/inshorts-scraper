Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday alleged that the Congress leaders in Bihar have "mortgaged" their party to Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal. "Even when the Congress shared power with the RJD in Bihar, it was a well-known fact that Lalu used to have the final say on distribution of ministerial berths," he added.
