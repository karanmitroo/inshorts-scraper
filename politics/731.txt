Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he did not appreciate the tone and language in which party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar called PM Narendra Modi 'neech', adding that he expected the former cabinet minister to apologise. "BJP and PM routinely use filthy language to attack the Congress party. The Congress has a different culture and heritage," he said.
