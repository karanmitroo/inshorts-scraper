Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah on Saturday tendered an apology after being criticised for speaking over the phone during the national anthem at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's swearing-in ceremony. "I didn't intend to disrespect the nation by my actions, I was standing for the national anthem, but if it offended anyone, I am sorry", he said.
