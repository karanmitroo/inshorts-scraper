Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav has challenged PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah to issue a blanket ban on meat exports. This came after Shah vowed to shut down all slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh if voted to power. "He (Shah) should ban the use of leather and start wearing khadaus (wooden sandals)," Yadav said.
