Congress Lok Sabha candidate Imran Masood was on Saturday arrested on charges of hate speech in which he threatened to "chop" Narendra Modi "into pieces". "If Modi tries to make Uttar Pradesh into Gujarat, then we will chop him into tiny pieces...I am not scared of getting killed or attacking someone," he had said.
