Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday had a narrow escape as a large piece of cloth got entangled with the rotor blades of his helicopter when it landed in Haldia, West Bengal. The chopper was declared fit to fly later. The cloth was reportedly a part of the red carpet placed on the ground near the helipad to welcome Gadkari.
