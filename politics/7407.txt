National Conference Chief Farooq Abdullah on Friday said that Vijay Mallya should not be referred to as a crook, as he is a normal human being whose business failed. The Indian government will deal with him, said Abdullah. He added, "I don't think there is any need of arresting Mallya, he will... come back when summoned."
