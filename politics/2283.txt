Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday said that though Muslims don't vote for the BJP, the BJP government has given them "proper sanctity". "We have got 13 chief ministers of our own. We are ruling the country. Have we victimised any Muslim gentleman working in the industry or service? Have we dismissed them," he asked.
