In an open letter to PM Narendra Modi, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav asked the former to direct all NDA ministers to keep a cow in their bungalows. “BJP supporters don’t care for cows, but they will waste no time in killing an Akhlaq over beef,” reads the letter. He also denounced the RSS for doing 'politics of hate'.
