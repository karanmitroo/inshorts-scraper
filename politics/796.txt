Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said that he would not like to enter into any competition with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on their humble backgrounds. "I don't want the country to take a pity on the basis of my humble background," he added. Singh also slammed PM Modi for pitting Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel against each other.
