In yet another setback to the Congress, the party MP from Garhwal (Uttarakhand), Satpal Maharaj, joined the BJP on Friday. Welcoming his move, party chief Rajnath Singh said Satpal Maharaj's entry will strengthen the party. Satpal had last week said that neither he nor anyone else from his family would contest 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
