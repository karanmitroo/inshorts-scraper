After the Pakistani Army mutilated two Indian soldiers' bodies, Congress leader Kapil Sibal asked whether any BJP leader would now send bangles to PM Narendra Modi. A BJP MP wanted to gift bangles to ex-PM during UPA regime when a similar incident had happened, he said. In 2013, Smriti Irani had said she would send bangles to ex-PM Manmohan Singh.
