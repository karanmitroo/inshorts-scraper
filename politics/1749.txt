BJP leader Amit Shah on Saturday said that the number of lynching incidents between 2011 and 2013 was higher than in the three years of NDA regime. "Mohammad Akhlaq died in Uttar Pradesh when Samajwadi Party was in government. Law and order is state subject. It is their responsibility and yet there is a protest against Modi government," he added.
