BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has sparked a new controversy after he said that people who do not do family planning should not be given voting right. Muslims should also opt for sterilisation like Hindus, he said. "When we talk of having four children, there is a lot of outcry, and when they have 40-children, no one says anything", he added.
