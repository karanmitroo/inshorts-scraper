RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday took a U-turn to his previous stance on reservations and said that quota should continue as long as social discrimination remains. He also said that reservation system will only vanish when those being discriminated against say that it should be wrapped up. "My earlier statements were not read and understood in totality," Bhagwat clarified.
