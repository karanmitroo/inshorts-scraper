The Congress on Monday criticised Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti for urging the Centre to follow the footsteps of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in dealing with the Kashmir unrest. "Kashmir evolved and unfolded over the UPA years whether it was in the form of opening up bus roads... or the internal security situations," party spokesperson Manish Tewari said.
