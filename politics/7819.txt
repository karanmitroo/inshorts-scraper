Senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar said on Sunday that madarsas should teach their students stories of patriotic Muslim personalities like Bahadur Shah Zafar to make them love their country. He urged the Maulanas, Imams and Maulvis to take the initiative as it was "required". This would make the child "patriotic, nationalistic, and also one(s) understanding Islam", he added.
