A lower court in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district has asked police to book AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and nine other party leaders on a complaint filed by an advocate for allegedly disrespecting the tricolour. It is alleged that the AAP workers carry their party's symbol 'Jhaadu' (broom) along with the national flag, which amounts to disrespect.
