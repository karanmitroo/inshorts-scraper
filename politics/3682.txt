Addressing a gathering on Tuesday, senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said, "beti ki izzat se vote ki izzat badi hai" (The honour of vote is bigger than daughter's honour). Further clarifying his remark he said, "If daughter’s honour is compromised, it'll only affect a village or community but if the vote’s honour is compromised, it will impact the entire nation".
