The opposition Congress on Monday attacked Union External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for helping ex-IPL chief Lalit Modi, an accused of Rs 700 crore money laundering, get UK travel papers within 24 hours. While Swaraj had clarified that she did so on 'humanitarian grounds' as Modi's wife was to undergo an operation, the Congress termed it as 'a lame excuse'.
