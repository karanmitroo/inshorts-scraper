The Tamil Nadu government on Monday announced the closure of 500 state-run retail liquor outlets, making it the first set of orders signed by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami. The announcement was to honour former Chief Minister Late J Jayalalithaa's promise to bring in prohibition in a phased manner in the state, said Palaniswami, who formally assumed office on Monday.
