A non-bailable warrant was issued against former Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti on Monday by a Delhi trial court in the domestic violence and attempt to murder case filed by his wife. The Delhi police had accused Bharti of not co-operating in the investigation. Earlier on the same day, a sessions court had rejected Bharti's bail plea.
