The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has alleged that Delhi Police was filing 'baseless' and 'fabricated' charges against its legislators. Despite knowing that the complaint was politically motivated, police charged MLA Prakash Jarwal with molestation, AAP leader Atishi Marlena said. Molestation charges against Jarwal were later struck down by the court which granted him anticipatory bail, Marlena added.
