Condemning National Conference President Farooq Abdullah's remark over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), the Bhartiya Janata Party said on Saturday that the leader has "insulted" India. "PoK is a part of India and is under the illegal clutches of Pakistan," said BJP Spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain. Abdullah on Friday said that the PoK belongs to Pakistan while Jammu and Kashmir belongs to India.
