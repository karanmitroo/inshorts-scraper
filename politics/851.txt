The Election Commission has issued a notice to Gandhinagar archbishop, Thomas Macwan, after he wrote a letter to the Catholic community, warning against "nationalist forces" and stating that the Gujarat Assembly elections could make a difference. Alleging that the "democratic fabric" of India was at stake, the letter claimed that there was a growing "sense of insecurity" among the minorities.
