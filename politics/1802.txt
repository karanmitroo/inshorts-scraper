The Opposition will hold a meeting to make a decision over the presidential candidate on 22 June, a day before NDA presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind files his nomination. “Congress does not want to comment on NDA’s candidate. We want to take a unanimous decision with other opposition parties", said Ghulam Nabi Azad, the leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha.
