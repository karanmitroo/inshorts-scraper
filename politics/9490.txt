Law Ministry Wednesday asked all the other ministries not to hire private lawyers and use the services of government advocates only. The ministry objected to the practice of various departments engaging private counsels. It further stated that if there is any 'compelling reason' to hire a private advocate, they should 'invariably' seek prior approval of the Department of Legal Affairs.
