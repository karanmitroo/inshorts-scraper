AAP MLA Alka Lamba climbed on top of a fire-tender van on Monday night, reportedly obstructing fire-fighting operations by an hour, in Delhi's Chandni Chowk area. A video of the incident showed firefighters trying to protect her instead of dousing the fire after she climbed the van. She later flashed victory signs in praise of the fire-fighters.
