Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh and AAP Convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday engaged in a war of words on Twitter. "Jarnail's (AAP leader) nomination bid from Lambi shows AAP-SAD collusion to ensure Badal's victory," Singh tweeted. Responding to it, Kejriwal tweeted, "Sir, are you fighting against Prakash Badalji or Sukhbir Badal or Majithia or safe seat?"
