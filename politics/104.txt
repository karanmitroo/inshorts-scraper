Former Congress leader Narayan Rane on Thursday claimed that BJP President Amit Shah has offered him a Rajya Sabha seat as an NDA candidate. He added that Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis was facing "problems" in inducting him into the state Cabinet. Last year, Rane launched the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksh after quitting the Congress and pledged support to the NDA.
