The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday staged protests against the BJP in order to build pressure on the government to sack four of its tainted ministers. The protesters assembled at Jantar Mantar (New Delhi) and raised slogans demanding strict action against Union Ministers Sushma Swaraj, Smriti Irani, Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje and Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde.
