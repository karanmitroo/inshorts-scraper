Lagama and Bandi, twin villages, close to the Line of Control, have categorically shown disfavor for the BJP, despite an overwhelming Hindu population. “We don’t believe in divisive politics.. You won’t find mass support for the BJP here,’’ says a tea-stall owner. The residents observed that BJP leaders didn't visit these villages as they knew that no votes were forthcoming.
