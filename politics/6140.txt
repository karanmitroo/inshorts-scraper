Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the weaker sections were being oppressed in Gujarat. Rahul made the remarks after his visit to Mota Samadhiyala where he met the kin of the Dalit youths who were thrashed by cow vigilantes in Una. “Modiji talks about Gujarat Model, but whoever raises voice against his ideology, is suppressed and crushed,” he added.
