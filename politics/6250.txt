JD(U) leader KC Tyagi on Thursday said that comparing an election manifesto with a religious text was not right as political parties make “a lot of false” claims in manifestos. This comes after AAP leader Ashish Khetan compared the party manifesto for the 2017 Punjab polls with the Guru Granth Sahib. Khetan, booked for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, later apologised.
