Goa CM Manohar Parrikar on Friday took a jibe at Congress leader Digvijaya Singh in the Rajya Sabha, stating, while the latter kept roaming around, BJP formed the government in the state. "I thanked Digvijaya…it is because of his incompetence that we formed the government…his own MLA didn’t have faith in him," Parrikar added.
