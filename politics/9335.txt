Breaking his silence over the recently released CAG report, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said that he was nowhere named as the wrong-doer by the government auditor. He further asserted that the CAG report was deliberately being misinterpreted for political reasons. Meanwhile, the Opposition continued to demand his resignation over the alleged irregularities in a company owned by him.
