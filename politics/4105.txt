The Supreme Court has refused to give an urgent hearing to a plea seeking that the Budget be presented in March and said it will hear the matter in "the due course of time". Earlier, opposition parties like Congress and Trinamool, among others demanded the budget be presented after the polling for the upcoming state Assembly elections ends.
