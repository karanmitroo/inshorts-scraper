The Madhya Pradesh Congress has removed three toilets from its party headquarters as a part of an attempt to remove 'vastu dosh' (architectural defects) from the premises. The party, which hasn't been in power in the state for 14 years, feels that this will bring good luck and improve its chances of winning the state assembly elections due this year.
