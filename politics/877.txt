Addressing the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, party President Sonia Gandhi on Monday accused the Narendra Modi government of "sabotaging the Winter session of Parliament on flimsy grounds". "The PM had the audacity to have a midnight celebration in Parliament to launch an ill prepared and flawed GST but he lacks the courage to face the Parliament," she added.
