Congress president Sonia Gandhi today sprang a surprise by nominating former union minister Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader in the Lok Sabha. Earlier, there was speculation earlier that either Kamal Nath or Veerappa Moily would be designated as the party's leader in the House, as the Congress president Rahul Gandhi had expressed his unwillingness to assume the responsibility.
