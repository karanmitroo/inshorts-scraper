Shiv Sena said in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Monday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should stop peeping in others' bathrooms, maintain the dignity of his office and concentrate on governance. "You are not elected to power to do this. Your horoscope too will be available to your successors once you step down from power," Sena's editorial further said.
