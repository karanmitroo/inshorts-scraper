Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav has said that Delhi Police and L-G Najeeb Jung are out to victimise AAP, further alleging that the AAP MLAs’ actions have given BJP an opportunity to target them. “If they were to apply the same criteria I think half of the BJP MPs should also be in jail right now,” he added.
