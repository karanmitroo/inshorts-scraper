Hardik Patel on Friday threatened to block the entry of Indian and South African cricket teams inside Rajkot Stadium for the third ODI match of Gandhi-Mandela series which is scheduled on Sunday. "I request to declare the details of ticket selling, because we believe that Saurashtra Cricket Association has given all the match tickets to the BJP people," he said.
