Ahead of Mungaoli and Kolaras bypolls in Madhya Pradesh, Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia on Wednesday said, "It's a fight between fake development of the BJP versus the real development that I have helped bring." "The BJP's development claims are not visible anywhere, whereas my efforts can be seen in the roads built and better supply of electricity," he added.
