Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said, "PM Narendra Modi is not against corruption, he is an instrument of corruption." Stating that fraud-accused businessmen like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya magically disappear from India to appear in foreign lands, Gandhi said PM Modi's magic could make democracy disappear from India. Gandhi also slammed PM Modi's silence on â‚¹11,400-crore PNB fraud.
