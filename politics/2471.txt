A municipal councillor from Loni has been arrested by Ghaziabad police for allegedly posting a morphed photograph of newly-elected Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on his Facebook timeline. A complaint was lodged against Ramkumar Chauhan by a member of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organisation founded by Adityanath. The alleged inappropriate post on Facebook was deleted.
