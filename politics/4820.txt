Making an election pitch in poll-bound Punjab, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday promised he will make the state drug-free once his party comes to power in Punjab. He further accused the Akali government of “ruining” Punjab by making it a "hub" of drugs. He also said that Congress is misleading people of Punjab over the fight against drug menace.
