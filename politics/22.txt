Hours after Communist icon Lenin's statue was razed in Tripura, Tamil Nadu BJP leaders have warned that the statue of Dravidian leader Periyar will be next. A post on BJP National Secretary H Raja's Facebook account read, "Today Lenin's statue, tomorrow Tamil Nadu's (Periyar) statue." Raja deleted the post later and said his account was managed by various administrators.
