Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi has apprised the Supreme Court that Lokpal's appointment won't be possible as amendments pertaining to the definition of Leader of Opposition are pending in the Parliament. "The Lok Sabha has declined to accept Mallikarjun Kharge as the LoP," he stated. "Thereâ€™s no intention to have an independent body like the Lokpal," senior Advocate Shanti Bhushan stated.
