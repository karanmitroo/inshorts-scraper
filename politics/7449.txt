Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Sunday said Karti is being targeted only because he is his son but "the real target is me". He rejected the allegations of Karti having undisclosed assets abroad as "malicious and totally false". He said the government should make a list of those assets and his son would voluntarily transfer them to the government.
