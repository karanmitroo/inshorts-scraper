According to RSS, secularism is "irrelevant" for India as the Hindu society has always been inclusive. RSS Publicity chief Manmohan Vaidya claimed, "since India doesnâ€™t have a history of theocratic states, the concept of secularism is irrelevant". Vaidya said he believed the Congress Working Committee in 1931 had agreed a saffron coloured flag with a blue chakra best portrayed India.
