SP leader Tarun Deo Yadav has announced an "appropriate reward" for those who would "behead" PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah for demonetisation and 2002 Godhra riots. "If you see a person as old as your grandfather waiting in a bank queue, you too will curse Modi," he said. The SP, however, has distanced itself from Yadavâ€™s statement.
