Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi will take a two-day halt on September 12 and 13 during his month-long ‘kisan mahayatra’ in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh in view of Eid. The yatra, that was kicked off from the Deoria district on September 6, aims to highlight the plight of farmers in the state. “It will commence from September 14 thereafter," Gandhi tweeted.
