Telangana BJP President K Laxman has said that the party will install a 'Statue of Liberation' in Hyderabad when BJP comes to power in the state to highlight sacrifices of those who fought against Nizam rule to merge with India. He alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government wasn't celebrating the day of merger officially due to "vote bank politics".
