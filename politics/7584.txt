Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Friday retaliated to 'anti-national' allegations by BJP leaders and said "patriotism runs in his blood" and that he doesn't need any certificate from RSS and the BJP. Addressing a rally at Amethi, Gandhi said, â€œToday, whoever speaks against Modiji is being threatened. But neither me nor the Congress and its president are afraid of him."
