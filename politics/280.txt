Speaking at a rally in Karnataka's Koppal, Congress President Rahul Gandhi referred to PM Narendra Modi and asked him to "start working" because he did not have "much time". Gandhi added, "There are two types of governments. One that gives away the nationâ€™s wealth to the rich, and another which redistributes wealth to the poor."
