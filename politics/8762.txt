Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that there was no other language which provides answers to complex philosophical questions like epics written in Sanskrit. "Be it art, literature, science or technology, people are admitting Sanskrit is most useful," Rajnath said. He added, "Even NASA, while building a super computer, had said Sanskrit was the most suitable language for it."
