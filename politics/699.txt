Kannada actor-politician Upendra's Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Paksha (KPJP) has unveiled the green and yellow auto rickshaw as its party symbol. "Auto signifies running on its own. Our aim is that the government chosen by the people's support should run on its own without any problems," he said while unveiling the symbol. The party was launched earlier this year.
