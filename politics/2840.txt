Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said, "There was no horse-trading in Goa. We had a discussion with non-BJP MLAs, they had some conditions. The support was unanimous." Gadkari further said, "The Congress was not able to choose a leader due to their internal tussle and they are blaming us for it."
