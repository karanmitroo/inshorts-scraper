Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Monday disqualified rebel JD(U) leaders Sharad Yadav and Ali Anwar Ansari from the membership of the House. This came after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) approached the Rajya Sabha chairman seeking disqualification of the two MPs for indulging in "anti-party activities", after Kumar withdrew from the Grand Alliance with RJD and Congress in Bihar.
