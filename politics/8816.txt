Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday lashed out at PM Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the Lalit Modi issue and said that he has three monkeys, just like Mahatma Gandhi. "Modiji has new types of monkeys that preach; don't see the truth, don't hear the truth and don't speak the truth," Rahul Gandhi said.
