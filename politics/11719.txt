Putting an end to the ongoing buzz, Arvind Kejriwal Sunday said he was ready to contest the Lok Sabha polls against Narendra Modi. However, the final decision would be taken at his party's rally in Varanasi on Mar-23. "The party wants me to contest against Modi, but the people of Varanasi will tell me on Mar-23," Kejriwal said in Bangalore.
