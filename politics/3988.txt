BSP will launch an online campaign titled 'Behenji ko aane do' to woo young voters ahead of the Uttar Pradesh polls. Notably, BSP supremo Mayawati is referred to as behenji (sister) in the state. The video series is a reply to SP's 'Kaam bolta hai' and BJP's 'Na gundaraj, na bhrashtachar, abki bar BJP sarkar' campaigns, a BSP leader said.
