BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said Bollywood actor Anupam Kher "is not only a reel life villain, but also in real life". Kher had recently commented that people like Sadhvi and Yogi, who speak "nonsense and ill-behave" should be "put behind the bars". Sadhvi Prachi also responded to the comments daring Kher to send her and Adityanath to jail.
