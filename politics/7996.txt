Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the Congress had begun believing vulgarity led to votes and seemed to have been misled by the AAP's success. He said the "current generation" of Congress leaders were weakening "what their ancestors established". He said most Congress members "expressed helplessness over the decision of their leadership that Parliament must be disturbed continuously.”
