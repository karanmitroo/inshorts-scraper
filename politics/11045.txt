Stepping up its attack on the UP govt over the recent gangrape-and-murder of two teenaged cousins in Badaun, state BJP Mahila Morcha took out a protest in Lucknow on Monday. They shouted slogans against CM Akhilesh Yadav and tried to lay siege to his office. The police had to use water cannons to disperse the protesters.
