Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia criticised the BJP saying that the party can only see "cow in people’s fridge and their plates". "Why can’t they see cows roaming in the streets of Delhi, eating poly bags and meeting with accidents?", he added. On the recent lynchings, he slammed the PM for hugging "several people who eat beef" abroad.
