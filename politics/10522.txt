In much disappointment for the Indian National Lok Dal, its candidate Inderjeet lost the elections from Rai constituency in Haryana to Congress MLA Jai Tirath by just three votes. While Tirath got 36,703 votes, Inderjeet came second with 36,700 votes. The Congress won 15 seats, the INLD won 19 while the BJP will form the government with 47 seats.
