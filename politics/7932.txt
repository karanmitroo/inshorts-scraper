AAP leader Ashutosh on Wednesday said the party had "irrefutable" evidence that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley used his political clout to influence DDCA investigations. Ashutosh alleged that Jaitley, in 2011, asked the then Delhi police commissioner to stop an investigation into DDCA office bearers. In 2012, he allegedly attempted to pressurise the then special commissioner of Delhi police.
