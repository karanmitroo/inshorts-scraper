BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra has tweeted a poster put up by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government in Kerala, which had a picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The poster was an invite for party members to attend a meeting on December 16 and 17. Meanwhile, the CPI (M) has said the poster would be removed.
