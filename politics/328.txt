Alleging that Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu was not letting them speak, Opposition members on Tuesday boycotted the Rajya Sabha. The Opposition objected to Naidu's decision to adjourn the House without conducting the Zero Hour, where the Parliamentarians raise questions of public importance. Opposition leader GN Azad claimed opposition party leaders were treated as "potential terrorists".
