AIMIM's Haji Rafat Hussain on Thursday threatened to smear black ink on activist Trupti Desai if she attempts to enter the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai. "...whatever work Desaiji has done for the temple that's okay, but... Muslims wouldn't tolerate if she raises fingers at them," Hussain said. Desai had earlier announced to enter the Dargah on the same day.
