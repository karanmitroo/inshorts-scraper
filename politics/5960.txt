The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said the alleged misuse of public funds for advertisements by the AAP government will be considered by a Supreme Court-appointed panel. It was hearing a PIL filed by Congress leader Ajay Maken. The plea sought action against the AAP government for wasting taxpayers' money for "publicity" of the party, violating the Supreme Court guidelines.
