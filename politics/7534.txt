Congress on Thursday steered clear of senior leader P Chidambaram's comments regarding the hanging of 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, and said it was futile to reopen the debate as it has attained judicial finality. Party spokesman Ashwani Kumar said that the decision of Supreme Court is final, after Chidambaram claimed that the verdict “was perhaps not correctly decided”.
