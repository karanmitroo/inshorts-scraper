The Enforcement Directorate questioned Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh for over nine hours on Thursday in the disproportionate assets case. The minister was asked to give explanations for 37 transactions made into five bank accounts. One of the accounts is allegedly owned by his LIC agent Anand Chauhan, who was arrested last year.
