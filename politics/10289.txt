AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal Thursday flew business class to Dubai to attend an event, sparking criticism from the opposition which said his “real face” has been “exposed”. The AAP, however, defended Kejriwal, asking whether it was a crime to travel business class, a facility provided by the organizers. Kejriwal left for a five-day visit to Dubai and New York Thursday.
