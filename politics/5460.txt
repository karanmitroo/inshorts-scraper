West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that Singur landowners will get back the possession of land after the Durga Puja festival. Meanwhile, State Minister Partha Chatterjee said they were never against industries, but against having industries on a multi-crop land. We had told the Tatas that they can have the factory on the other side, he added.
