BJP on Tuesday blamed the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal for the alleged lack of industrialisation and said nobody was safe there due to the "lawless" situation. "In Bengal neither Maa nor Mati nor Manush is safe. The BJP has to change the situation for the development of Bengal," BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said at a rally.
