Slamming PM Narendra Modi over his silence on the $2-billion PNB scam, Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday tweeted, "Ek Nirav Modi hai, dusra Modi Nirav (quiet) hai." Rahul also led a protest over the scam near Mahatma Gandhi's statue in the Parliament complex. Congress MPs have been repeatedly disrupting parliamentary proceedings in the ongoing budget session over the issue.
