Replacing Mahatma Gandhi's photograph with that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Khadi Udyog stationery was an "insult" to Bapu and a case of "sedition", RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav has said. "Modi cannot be even an iota of his (Mahatma's) personality," Lalu added. "RSS gang killed Gandhi and now hell bent on... killing his ideology," Lalu had tweeted earlier.
