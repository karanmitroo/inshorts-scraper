The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Tuesday said that Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. Bal Thackeray himself was clueless about his party workers bringing portions of the mosque down in Ayodhya, said VHP. "You don't become Hindutvavadi by merely chanting Chhatrapati Shivaji's name," it added.
