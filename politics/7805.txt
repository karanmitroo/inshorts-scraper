Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday said that the Centre would follow the SC verdict on the Ram Temple issue, and not what saffron leaders say. He added that the PM's agenda was development, and not controversial topics like Ram Mandir and Babri Masjid. The LJP-BJP relations will not strain over the Ram mandir, he asserted.
