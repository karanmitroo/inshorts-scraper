BJP President Amit Shah has expressed displeasure over the state of affairs in the BJP's Delhi unit at a meeting with the unit's office-bearers. He reportedly asked them to spend more time meeting common people rather than just the top leaders. He also addressed the issues of lack of coordination between office-bearers and subordinates, and favouritism in the party.
