Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday said the Congress, which has been "tolerated" by the BJP for many decades, should now "tolerate" the BJP for at least ten years. Speaking on the JNU issue in the Lok Sabha, he said no "anti-national" activity can be allowed in any educational institute and that we cannot allow our youth to be misled.
