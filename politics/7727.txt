Reacting to the Congress' allegations of being biased to the Centre, Arunachal Pradesh Governor JP Rajkhowa on Monday said that he was not anybody's agent. "I'm not a political person as I was never a member of any political party", said Rajkhowa. The Governor also added that he is acting on behalf of the President for a temporary period.
