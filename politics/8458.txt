RJD chief Lalu Prasad has attacked PM Narendra Modi for allegedly breaking his promises. "Modi said he will put ₹15 lakh in everyone's account. I thought, I have seven daughters, two sons and Rabri — I would have been richer by ₹1.5 crore... But like you, I also got 'than-than gopal' (zilch)," Lalu said during an election rally.
