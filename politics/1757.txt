Likening the roll-out of GST to an Indian wedding, Union Minister Jayant Sinha on Wednesday said, "Just like in Indian weddings, we will have a great big party and everyone will live happily ever after." Sinha said, "I call GST the Republic's instrument of simplicity," adding that the tax would help control inflation and is for the people of India.
