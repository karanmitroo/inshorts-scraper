Speaking about the British imperial rule in India at the Jaipur Literature Fest, former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor on Monday said that the Parliamentary system is "ill-suited" to India. The country is still "stuck" with the system because that was the system the British followed and Indians looked at the British as the "embodiment of everything", added Tharoor.
