Opposition leaders in Maharashtra on Monday demanded an apology over Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' remark that “those unwilling to say "Bharat Mata Ki Jai" have no right to stay in the country”. Responding to the opposition's demand, Fadnavis said he will keep chanting "Bharat Mata ki Jai" whether he remains the Chief Minister or not.
