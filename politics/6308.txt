An AAP delegation on Thursday met the Election Commission demanding the disqualification of over 100 legislators holding the post of Parliamentary Secretary across 11 states. The EC then asked them to approach the President and the Governors of the concerned states with their plea. Notably, AAP-led Delhi government has been facing criticism for appointing 21 MLAs as Parliamentary Secretaries.
