The Congress will not declare the name of the CM candidate in Rajasthan before the state elections, the state General Secretary in-charge Avinash Pande said on Thursday. Stressing that it has been a party tradition, he said, "The high command decides the chief minister after discussing it with elected MLAs." Congress leaders will put on a united performance, he added.
