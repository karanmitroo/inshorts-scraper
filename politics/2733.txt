BJP on Monday asserted that the RSS had nothing to do with Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister. "The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) never interferes with the selection of chief ministers," BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said. He further said it was unfair to criticise the appointment without giving Adityanath a "fair opportunity" to govern.
