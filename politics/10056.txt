Aam Aadmi Party's former firebrand leader, Shazia Ilmi, will now be campaigning for the BJP for the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls. Ilmi had quit the AAP last year, citing cronyism and lack of democracy in the party as the reasons. She had praised PM Modi's Clean India Movement earlier, as a precursor to joining the party.
