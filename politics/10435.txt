The first list of candidates of the Aam Aadmi Party, which is likely to be released in a couple of days, will have approximately 35 candidates, including former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and 7 other erstwhile AAP ministers. From the Lok Sabha poll candidates, only Rakhi Birla will be in the list; six MLAs are dropped due to poor performance.
