BJP MP Vijay Goel on Tuesday demanded that the Delhi University conduct a common eligibility test for admissions to undergraduate courses to ensure admission for meritorious students. He further demanded that 85% seats be reserved for students from Delhi in DU's government colleges and that "they should be given some relaxation in cut-off for admission to non-government DU colleges".
