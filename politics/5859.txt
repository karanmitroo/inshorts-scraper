Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra has written a letter to Home Minister Rajnath Singh, demanding action against the ‘fake’ accounts on social media which try to incite communal tensions. In the letter, he also mentioned some of the ‘fake’ accounts running under his name. "In the past as well I have complained about such attempts to Commissioner, Delhi Police," he wrote.
