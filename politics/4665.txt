Actor Anupam Kher has said that he would like to see Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi sing the National Anthem. Kher added that though he didn't "doubt" Gandhi's "Indianness", he did "doubt" if Gandhi knew the words of the National Anthem. Notably, this comes after the Supreme Court's ruling to play the National Anthem before film screenings.
