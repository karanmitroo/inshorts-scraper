Extending support to Andhra Pradesh leaders demanding special category status for their state, Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said his party will fulfil their demand if voted to power in 2019 general elections. The ruling TDP, which is part of the BJP-led NDA alliance, has also been protesting against the Centre, alleging it had "neglected" Andhra Pradesh.
