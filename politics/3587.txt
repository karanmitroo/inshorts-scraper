TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee has reportedly asked her party leaders to refrain from launching personal attacks on PM Narendra Modi. "She isn't in an aggressive mood. She is trying not to be abusive as far as the PM is concerned," a TMC leader has said. However, Banerjee has asked TMC MPs to boycott the Budget reading in protest against demonetisation.
