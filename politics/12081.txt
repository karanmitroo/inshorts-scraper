During an interactive session with 250 women on Monday, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said - "I want to tell you my perspective... In my house, there was papa (Rajiv Gandhi), there was uncle (Sanjay Gandhi) but the boss of the house was my Dadi (Indira Gandhi). There was no doubt about that. Grandma was the boss."
