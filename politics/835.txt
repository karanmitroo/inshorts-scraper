The Election Commission has restored the 'two leaves' symbol of the AIADMK for the party's E Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam camp. The EPS-OPS and the Sasikala Natarajan-TTV Dhinakaran factions had been fighting to claim the symbol, which was suspended following the split in the party. Reportedly, Sasikala camp will move the Madras High Court against the EC's verdict.
