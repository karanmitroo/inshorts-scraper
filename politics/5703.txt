The National Commission for Women has summoned AAP leader Ashutosh over his controversial blog in which he had allegedly defended suspended party leader Sandeep Kumar over his leaked sex tape. "This is in response to what we feel is a very reprehensible and demeaning blog Ashutosh wrote, where he defended a man accused of rape", said NCW Chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam.
