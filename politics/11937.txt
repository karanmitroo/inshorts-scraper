MNS chief Raj Thackeray was arrested on Wednesday morning from suburban Chembur (Mumbai) after he participated in the state-wise 'rasta roko abhiyan' (against toll plazas) despite police warnings. However, the MNS chief was released within only two hours. Several protesters have also been taken into custody for disrupting traffic at many places across the state.
