Speaking on his equation with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday revealed he didn’t get the election ticket from Delhi because of Jaitley. “Our issues will resolve once he stops talking behind my back,” he added. On Jaitley’s alleged claim that Swamy doesn’t listen to anyone, the latter said, “I only listen to gyanis, not fools”.
