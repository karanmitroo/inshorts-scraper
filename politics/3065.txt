Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said, "You live in a country where you compare your Prime Minister to a donkey. How is there no freedom of expression?" He further said, "Freedom of expression means you also respect others opinions. Congress which has no respect for fundamental rights is now trying to poison minds of people."
