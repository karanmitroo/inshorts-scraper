BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav has said demonetisation was never an electoral or political decision, it was taken in the long-term interest of the economy. He further asserted that there was no parallel economy running after demonetisation. "Black money is the result of aberrations in the society and whoever is holding the same needs to be punished," he added.
