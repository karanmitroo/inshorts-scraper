Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday alleged that the Manohar Lal Khattar-led Haryana government has been doing just two things, "badla (vengeance) and badli (replacement)". "This is what this government does. They have not done anything for the people of this state," Hooda said. This comes after Hooda was booked for alleged involvement in the National Herald Case.
