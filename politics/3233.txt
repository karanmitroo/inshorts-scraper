Granting exemption to CM Arvind Kejriwal from personal appearance for the day, a Delhi court on Saturday directed him to appear before it on March 21 in the DDCA defamation case. The court allowed him the exemption as he's in Bengaluru for treatment and would return on February 22. The court also granted bail to suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad.
