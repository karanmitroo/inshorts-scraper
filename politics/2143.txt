Union Minister Uma Bharti has said a plan had been prepared to implement liquor ban in Madhya Pradesh during her tenure as the Chief Minister. "I wanted to implement prohibition secretly. I think Shivraj Singh knows about that plan and he is now implementing the same," said Bharti, who served as the state's Chief Minister from 2003 to 2004.
