Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday asked RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav to ‘stop shedding crocodile tears’ over Gujarat Dalits' assault. In Bihar, Lalu and Nitish never visited places where Dalits were massacred, but both shed crocodile tears when it happens outside, he tweeted. Paswan’s remarks have come after Lalu wrote an open letter to PM Modi.
