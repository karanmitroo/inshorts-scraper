Supreme Court lawyer and former Mizoram Governor Swaraj Kaushal tweeted, "There's nothing like marital rape. Our homes shouldn't become police stations." "There'll be more husbands in the jail, than in the house," Kaushal, the husband of Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj claimed. This comes after the government told a court that criminalising marital rape might put the family system under stress.
