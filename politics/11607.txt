During a road show in Chandigarh on Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal claimed that he was in possession of a letter purportedly written by BJP's PM nominee Narendra Modi recently to the Centre, requesting for a three-fold hike in gas prices to help Mukesh Ambani. "Both Modi and Rahul use aircraft of Ambani to travel...they extend benefits to Ambani," he added.
