The CBI's raids on P Chidambaram's premises stem from litigation brought by Subramanian Swamy who says the ex-Finance Minister abused his office to approve the Aircel-Maxis deal. Aircel was sold to Maxis in 2006 and Chidambaram is accused of not seeking Cabinet approval mandatory for investment proposals above â‚¹600 crore. Karti is accused of money-laundering in connection with the deal.
