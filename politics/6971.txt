The Centre will move the Supreme Court against the Uttarakhand High Court's order revoking the imposition of President's Rule in the state, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said on Thursday. Rohatgi added that the government was only concerned with the Presidential notification and not with the disqualified MLAs. Earlier in the day, the High Court quashed the President's Rule in Uttarakhand.
