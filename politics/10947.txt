All 27 AAP MLAs are scheduled to meet President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday evening, and ask him for an immediate dissolution of the Delhi Assembly. The request for the meeting was put in after the party's MLA from Shalimar Bagh, Bandana Kumari, was allegedly given a death threat by a person she accused of being a BJP worker, sources said.
