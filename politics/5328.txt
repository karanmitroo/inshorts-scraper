Jammu and Kashmir Shiv Sena on Friday demanded that another surgical strike should be carried out inside Pakistan to kill underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed and other terrorists. "Dawood and the three terrorists are living and roaming freely inside Pakistan and are a danger to the entire world," state Shiv Sena President Dimpy Kohli said.
