After senior Kerala leader from the ruling CPI(M), Radhakrishnan, revealed the name of the Thrissur gangrape survivor, Health Minister KK Shailaja said, "I don't think there is anything wrong with it." While Shailaja added that 'naming rape victims' is not wrong as "they aren't the ones who have done anything wrong", revealing their identity is a punishable offence by law.
