The EC is using Spiderman quotes to attract voters for the upcoming Tura by-polls in Meghalaya. The seat was vacated after PA Sangma's death. Using the lines, "Your vote is a great power and with it comes greater responsibility", the EC is urging people to vote. The measure targets the youth, in a constituency reportedly affected by militancy.
