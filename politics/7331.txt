A scuffle broke out in the Uttarakhand State Assembly between ministers Harak Singh Rawat and Mantri Prasad Nethani on Friday, over the demand for a voice vote on the Finance Bill. Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal earlier passed the bill, rejecting the opposition's demand for a voice vote. Rawat's supporters were seen arguing with supporters of the Uttarakhand Chief Minister.
