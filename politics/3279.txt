BJP leaders were caught dozing off during former Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi's weekly Janta Durbar in Patna on Tuesday which was held to address people's grievances. Ex-Bihar minister Renu Kushwaha and her politician husband Vijay Kumar Singh apparently slept during the 30-minute press conference. Renu had quit JD(U) and had unsuccessfully contested Bihar Assembly election on BJP ticket.
