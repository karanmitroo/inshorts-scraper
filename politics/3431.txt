Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Friday filed an RTI application with the information cell of the Prime Minister's Office seeking details on the Centre's policy for advertising initiatives on social media. "When we connect with people it is dubbed corruption but when Modiji does Mann Ki Baat it is projected as patriotism," Sisodia said after filing the RTI application.
