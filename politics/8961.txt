Former Rajya Sabha MP Sabir Ali rejoined the BJP on Thursday, ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar. Ali was expelled from the party last year following an allegation by a senior leader that he had links with Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Ali said that the charges levelled against him were not proved.
