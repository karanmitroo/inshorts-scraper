BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Saturday praised JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar's speech in the JNU campus and said he was happy about his release from prison. The MP from Patna Sahib supported Kanhaiya as he did not find anything "anti-national" in his speech and because he also was from Bihar. Notably, his views are seen as varying with his party's.
