Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat, who was recently questioned by the CBI over a sting video, said the BJP and the government are using CBI as a tool "to settle scores with political adversaries". BJP has no faith in democratic institutions or the judiciary, Rawat said, who further urged his party workers to expose the BJP's "conspiracy" against democratic forces.
