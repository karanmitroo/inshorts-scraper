Union Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said that the Congress and its Vice President Rahul Gandhi are indulging in spit and run politics. "He (Rahul Gandhi) is claiming something new which is a stale story. He thought that he will make an earthquake, but he has dug a pit for Congress," Javadekar added.
