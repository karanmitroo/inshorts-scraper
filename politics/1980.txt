Actor Rishi Kapoor took to Twitter to slam Indian politician Sudheendra Kulkarni for attending China's Belt and Road Forum. Kulkarni is among the few Indians who attended the forum, after India decided to skip it due to sovereignty concerns on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Responding to India's decision, Kulkarni had said, "Whosoever advised PM, has given very, very bad advice."
