Reminding the BJP that Vallabhai Patel was an Indian National Congress leader who put a ban on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Congress leader Anand Sharma on Saturday criticised BJP for invoking Patel's legacy and contribution. Sharma asked whether BJP was short of leaders and said that PM holds run for unity but his party president's actions are divisive and inflammatory.
