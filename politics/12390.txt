Few weeks ago, there were 7 lakh people cheering for Modi at the party's Mahakumbh in Bhopal but on Monday, there were only 7,000 people listening to BJP's PM candidate. His rallies at the other places of Madhya Pradesh (Sagar, Chattarpur and Guna) also received tepid response of around 20,000-30,000 people only.
