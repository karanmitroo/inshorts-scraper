Social activist Anna Hazare Wednesday said that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has made more "sacrifices" in life than AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal and it would be a good thing if she becomes the PM. "Instead of wooing big industries, she is village-centric in her economic outlook. I am impressed by her ideology," he further said.
