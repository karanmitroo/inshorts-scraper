Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not have made his 96-year-old mother, Heeraben Modi, stand in a queue to exchange demonetised currency. Terming it a political move, Kejriwal further tweeted, "If I ever have to stand in a line, I will do so myself and not make my mother do so."
