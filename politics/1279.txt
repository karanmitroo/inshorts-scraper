Sidelined AIADMK Deputy General Secretary TTV Dhinakaran on Wednesday said that he would never go with the opposition DMK, calling them the party's "political enemy". Claiming that his faction has 21 MLAs, Dhinakaran added, "I have told the governor to ask CM Edappadi K Palaniswami to prove their majority. To protect our party, I will go to any extent."
