Although the Congress and the CPI(M) have not formally announced any alliance for the upcoming polls in West Bengal, the two parties have been holding joint protests and local level programmes. Notably, state Congress President Adhir Chowdhury had recently issued a statement asking all "democratic and social forces" to join hands with CPI(M) to defeat the TMC government.
