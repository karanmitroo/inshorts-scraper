Former Congress minister Srinivasa Prasad along with many of his supporters formally joined BJP on Monday, according to reports. The senior Dalit leader had quit Congress following his removal from Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's cabinet. While rejecting the view that BJP is an anti-Dalit party, Prasad said that he has joined the party without any conditions.
