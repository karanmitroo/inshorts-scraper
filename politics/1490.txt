West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday launched the 'BJP quit India' campaign, alleging that the Centre has taken away the rights of the people in the country. "The BJP-led government is trying to divide the country. We will not allow it. We want this politics of communalism and hatred to come to an end," Mamata added.
