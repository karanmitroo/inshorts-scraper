Telangana Assembly Speaker Madhusudana Chary on Friday allowed the merger of all the three legislators of the opposition YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). This comes as the legislators submitted a letter to the Speaker stating their merger. Calling the Speaker's act illegal, YSRCP demanded that he explain the constitutional validity of the merger.
