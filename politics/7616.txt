DMK MLAs were today evicted en masse from the Tamil Nadu Assembly after protesting certain remarks by a ruling AIADMK legislator against the party. AIADMK MLA GV Markandayan made some remarks about DMK treasurer MK Stalin's son-in-law, which infuriated the DMK members. After repeated requests from the Speaker went unheard, marshals were summoned to evict the MLAs.
