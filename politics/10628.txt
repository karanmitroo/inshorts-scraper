In yet another blow to the Trinamool Congress, the Calcutta high court ordered CID probe in Lok Sabha MP Tapas Pal's hate speech case. Justice Nishita Mhatre delivered the verdict on Thursday morning. On June 14, while delivering a speech, Tapas Pal had threatened CPI(M) supporters with rape and murder by his boys.
