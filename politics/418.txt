No government has successfully proven that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose died in an airplane crash in Taiwan in 1945, Trinamool Congress leader Sukhendu Sekhar claimed on Tuesday. Stating that the governments have misled people for 73 years, Sekhar claimed that an unpublished Defence Ministry book had said Bose's aircraft did not crash and he had resettled in "some other place".
