Claiming to raise its voice against atrocities on women, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) will soon launch a campaign in the Delhi University to counter 'love jihad'. "We will campaign against 'love jihad' in the DU after colleges re-open. We are not against love but against hiding identity and forced conversions," ABVP national vice-president Mamta Yadav asserted.
