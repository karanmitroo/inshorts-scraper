A plea was filed against BJP's Uttar Pradesh Chief Keshav Prasad Maurya in Varanasi on Wednesday for weighing himself against coins. It was filed by Manavadhikar Janshakti Party national spokesperson Chandrashekhar Singh. He alleged that Maurya was trying to appease Kashi residents who worship Goddess Lakshmi. Maurya was also recently criticised for being depicted as Lord Krishna in a poster.
