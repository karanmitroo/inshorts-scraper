Commenting on the Union Budget 2018, Congress leader Randeep S Surjewala said Modinomics plus Jaitleynomics equals to 'Jumlanomics'. Congress leader Tehseen Poonawalla said, "50% MSP to farmers. This means elections between April and October." Congress MP Ahmed Patel said, "Would have preferred if instead of MP's getting a salary raise, the salaried middle class would have got income tax relief."
