The Rajya Sabha MPs on Friday demanded a hike in their salaries, stating their remuneration should be more than that of the Cabinet Secretary. “MPs' salary is lowest of all,” said an MP. A joint committee of both the Houses has reportedly recommended that an MP’s salary be ₹1 lakh and the constituency allowance be ₹90,000.
