Union Minister VK Singh on Thursday said that it was wrong to blame the government at the Centre for crimes in states. Referring to the incident where two Dalit children in Haryana were burned to death, Singh attributed the incident to rivalry between two families. Singh also said, "If someone throws stones at a dog, the government is not responsible."
