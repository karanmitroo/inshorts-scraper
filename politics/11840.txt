The Union Cabinet Friday agreed to increase the ceiling for LS poll to Rs.70 lakh per candidate from the existing Rs.40 lakh, and for the Assembly poll to Rs.28 lakh from Rs.16 lakh. However, this is applicable only in the bigger States. Increase in the number of electors and polling stations were some of the reasons cited for the hike.
