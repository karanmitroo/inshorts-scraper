In the coming Lok Sabha (LS) elections, the Aam Aadmi Party is likely to field it's party leader Anjali Damania against former BJP president, Nitin Gadkari, in the Nagpur parliamentary constituency. Notably, it would be debut for both of them in electoral politics, as they have not contested either Assembly or LS elections, so far.
