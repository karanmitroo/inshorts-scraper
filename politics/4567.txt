Reacting to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's letter, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the former does not know how to write to a CM. Claiming to have never seen Centre misusing the Army's role, in her political life, Banerjee added, "Donâ€™t think that it behoves a Union Minister to pass near-defamatory remarks on a CM of any State."
