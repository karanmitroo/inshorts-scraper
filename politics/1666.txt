BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday resigned as a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. Hours earlier, she had threatened to quit claiming that she was not being allowed to speak in the House. "If I'm not able to put forward the concerns of my weaker section in the Parliament, I don't have the right to stay," Mayawati had said.
