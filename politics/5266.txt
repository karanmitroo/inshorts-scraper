Former media adviser to ex-PM Manmohan Singh, Sanjaya Baru, has said that ex-PM Narasimha Rao viewed Sonia Gandhi as Rajiv Gandhiâ€™s widow but others around her viewed her as the inheritor of Nehru-Gandhi legacy. Rao belonged to a generation that believed congress should continue as a national party and not as Indira, Rajiv or Sonia's Congress, he claimed.
