During his three-day visit to Gujarat, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has alleged that the PM Narendra Modi-led government does not listen to people and favours crony capitalism. Alleging that demonetisation destroyed several small businesses, Rahul claimed that BJP President Amit Shah's son's company rose "from its ashes". He further said development has gone "berserk" in Gujarat.
