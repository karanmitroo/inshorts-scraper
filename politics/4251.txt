Samajwadi Party General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav has been suspended from the party for six years for indiscipline, party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has said. The former was earlier sent a notice for speaking against the party line in media. He had earlier said the party will fight elections based on the Akhilesh Yadav's list of candidates, and not Mulayam's.
