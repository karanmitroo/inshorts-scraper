RJD leader Jagadanand Singh said that Nitish Kumar must step down as the CM as a number of criminal charges, including that of a murder, have been filed against him. "The victim whom Nitish Kumar had killed is still waiting for justice...when the criminal is the head of the state, the case becomes a state vs state scenario," Singh added.
