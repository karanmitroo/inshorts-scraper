On being asked why the BJP didn't win 150 seats in the Gujarat Assembly elections as he had predicted, party President Amit Shah said he didn't know the Congress would carry out low-level politics. Adding that people of Gujarat defeated politics of caste and religion, Shah said the BJP's vote share increased from 47.85% in 2012 to 49.1% in 2017.
