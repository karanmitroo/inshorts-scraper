When being asked about Mayawati-led BSP's inclusion in the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav said, "She takes up so much space, their election symbol is an elephant too." Akhilesh said this at a joint press conference with Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. Further, Gandhi said BSP made some mistakes during its reign but he personally respects Mayawati.
