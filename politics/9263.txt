Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday met a delegation from the ex-servicemen cell of the party and discussed BJP’s non-implementation of the one-rank-one-pension scheme. Gandhi claimed the UPA had made provisions and kept aside money for the scheme which the Narendra Modi government ignored. He further promised the delegation that he will “pressurise” the Centre to act on it.
