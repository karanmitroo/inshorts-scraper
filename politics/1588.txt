Two Samajwadi Party MLCs and one from Bahujan Samaj Party have resigned from the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council and from their respective parties. This could allow CM Yogi Adityanath and four BJP ministers to be nominated to the legislative body without contesting elections, reports said. Adityanath and the ministers need to join one of the two state legislatures by September.
