Amid reports blaming him for SP scuffle, Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh on Thursday said, "I may not be with CM Akhilesh (Yadav), but I'll always be with Mulayam Singh Yadav's son Akhilesh." "When his (Akhilesh's) family was opposing his marriage, I was the only one who stood by him, but today I am hurt by his words," Singh added.
