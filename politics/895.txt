Backing Patidar leader Hardik Patel over his alleged 'sex tape', Gujarat's Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani said that Patel had nothing to be ashamed of as right to sex is a fundamental right. A video allegedly showing Patel in a compromising position with an unidentified woman had surfaced online on Monday. Patel denied its authenticity, blaming it on BJP's "dirty politics".
