Following the death of Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, her aide and senior AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam kept Jayalalithaa's photograph in his pocket and took oath as the new Tamil Nadu CM. Moreover, Panneerselvam refused to sit on Jayalalithaa's chair out of respect and chose to sit on a chair next to it, while he served as the state's CM earlier.
