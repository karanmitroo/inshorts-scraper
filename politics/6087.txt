PM Narendra Modi, during his general elections campaign as the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, had in February 2014 accused the Congress of looking for chances to “beat” and “kill” him. Notably, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that Modi is "so frustrated that he can get [him] killed", for which the former was ridiculed on Twitter.
