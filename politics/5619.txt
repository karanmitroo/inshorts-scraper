Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has demanded an apology from BJP President Amit Shah for allegedly insulting Asura king Mahabali by sharing a poster showing Vishnu's avatar Vaman keeping his foot on Mahabali's head. "By eulogising Vamana and denigrating Mahabali in his Facebook post, BJP national president Amit Shah has humiliated Kerala and Malayali's national festival Onam," Vijayan said.
