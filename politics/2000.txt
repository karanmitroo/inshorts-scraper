Sacked AAP Minister Kapil Mishra, who on Sunday alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party has carried out a donation scam, passed out during the press conference. Mishra has been on a hunger strike for the past five days. He has alleged that the party used fictitious donor names and shell companies to launder black money.
