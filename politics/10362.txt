Being criticized for spending people's money on SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's 75th birthday celebrations, UP Minister Azam Khan on Friday hit back. When asked about the funding for the grand event, he said, "Why does it matter where the money for celebrations is coming from? The celebrations are being funded by terror organisations like Taliban and Dawood."
