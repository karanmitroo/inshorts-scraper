Narendra Modi and yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Sunday shared stage in the national capital, with the duo appealing for a stable government that can provide employment to millions of youth and bring back money stashed abroad. While Ramdev lambasted the Congress-led UPA government over black money and spiralling prices, Modi said he respected issues raised by the yoga guru.
