Former Congress MLA Veer Singh Dhingan, whose wife accused AAP's newly-elected MLA Dharmender Koli for molestation and misbehavior, has now said that he isn't sure if Koli was involved in it. I have been told by people as I wasn't present there, Dhingan added. Meanwhile, AAP's Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia refuted the charges saying the allegations were politically motivated.
