According to an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) source, Delhi CM-designate Arvind Kejriwal, on Wednesday, refused to take the Z-plus security cover that is being provided to him. "...he is a man of the masses and doesn't need any security," told the source. Party leader Kumar Vishwas told NDTV that the personnel placed on security duty mean to track Kejriwal's movements.
