Shiv Sena on Saturday claimed that it was the "only guardian" of Maharashtra and that it has been "guarding it honestly" for fifty years. Sena also alleged that the Marathi identity and unity of the state are being destroyed, and vowed to not let it happen. Notably, Shiv Sena will celebrate its golden jubilee on Sunday.
