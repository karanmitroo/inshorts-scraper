Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that previous governments seemed to hate development and looted public money to win elections. "They were driven by political calculations, resulting in schemes being inaugurated but never seeing completion," he added. PM Modi said this during his two-day visit to Varanasi, where he inaugurated projects worth  â‚¹1,000 crore.
