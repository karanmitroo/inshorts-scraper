PM Narendra Modi was alleged of offering Italy the freedom of two marines, in lieu of evidence, to link Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her family with the 2013 Finmeccanica-Agusta Westland corruption scandal. The allegations were levelled by Christian Michel, a British arms agent, who claimed that Modi met Italian PM Matteo Renzi in a secret meeting in September 2015.
