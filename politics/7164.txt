Accusing the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh of "abetting" mafia linked to liquor, forest and construction, BJP on Saturday said its fight in the state was against corruption. The Congress is "weakening like a termite-infested tree" and its "leadership should introspect why MLAs and other leaders were leaving the party", BJP state in-charge Shrikant Sharma said.
