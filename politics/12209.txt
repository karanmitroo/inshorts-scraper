Delhi's newly elected CM, Arvind Kejriwal, has defeated BJP's Narendra Modi, to become TOI's Person of The Year. Praising the 'aam aadmi', TOI writes, "Kejriwal is the creator of a new matrix of clean politics, without the traditional baggage of caste, community and religion. The 45-year-old former IRS officer has altered the very idea of what a politician should be."
