Congress leader Anand Sharma on Friday said that the Parliament's midnight session for the GST launch was an insult to the 1947 midnight session where former PM Jawaharlal Nehru announced the country's independence. "We cannot compare a tax launch with the country's independence...There have been more important milestones in past but no midnight session was called for them," he added.
