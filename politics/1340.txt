A booklet issued by the BJP to help improve general knowledge doesn't mention India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru in its 'First in India' list or Mahatma Gandhi in its 'Great men' list. While the booklet doesn't name Indira Gandhi as India's first woman prime minister, it states that she was the first woman to be honoured with the Bharat Ratna.
