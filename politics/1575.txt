Reacting to the recent JD(U)-BJP alliance, Congress leader Anand Sharma on Monday said, "Now, Nitish Kumar will only sing praises of PM Narendra Modi. Earlier he used to say Modi will ruin the nation." Sharma further said, "Nitish is a man of no principles and he won't decide who will win the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections but the nation will."
