BJP president Amit Shah and RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav have been booked for violating the model code of conduct during their campaigns toward the Bihar polls. An FIR was filed on Tuesday against Shah for referring to Lalu as "'chara chor" or fodder thief, while another was filed against Yadav for calling Shah a "narbhakshi" or cannibal.
