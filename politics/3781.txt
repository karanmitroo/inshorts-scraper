Congress leader and advocate Salman Khurshid on Saturday asserted that Centre's ordinance allowing Jallikattu would not resolve problems and said that there is a need for a permanent solution. Adding that the judgement on the matter is still pending in Supreme Court, Khurshid said the apex court's decision may be against those agitating to lift the ban on Jallikattu.
