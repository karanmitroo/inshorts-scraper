Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi Wednesday moved the Supreme Court after the Bombay High court dismissed his plea for quashing a defamation case against him. The defamation case was logged against him when he, during his speech, alleged Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The petition came after the Bhiwandi court summoned him in 2014.
