Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday slammed the Centre's demonetisation decision and said, "Money is not black or white; the transactions are." He further said, "Black money is possessed by the people living in big cities. Did you see those affluent people in the ATM lines? Only the common man was seen and weird incidents were reported."
