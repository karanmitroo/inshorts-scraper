Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi has said, "I'm very sorry to hear this that no less than the Prime Minister of world's largest democracy and second most populous nation is addicted to one-liners, acronyms, and jumlas." He further said, "He cannot get rid of this addiction. He trivialises mild words in English language. He trivialises a natural calamity like an earthquake."
