AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday tweeted, "Nation has a new expert in Shariat. @MVenkaiahNaidu, kindly explain what is Shariat? Islam gave women equality and rights 1400 years ago." His remark came after Naidu said that triple talaq is not a religious issue as it has no sanction in Shariat. "It is a matter of right of equality," Naidu added.
