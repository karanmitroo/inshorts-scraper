Patidar leader Hardik Patel on Saturday warned that India will be under President's rule if PM Narendra Modi wins the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Calling for all "non-BJP parties" to unite in the fight against the BJP-led NDA government, Patel said he would campaign for West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee in the next general elections.
