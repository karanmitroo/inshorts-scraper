Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party Co-founder Arvind Kejriwal, who turned 48 on Tuesday, was the only Indian in 'The Worldâ€™s 50 Greatest Leaders' list released by Fortune in March, 2016. Kejriwal was included in the list following his 'odd-even' plan where vehicles were allowed on the roads only on alternate days to tackle pollution in Delhi.
