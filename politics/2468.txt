The RSS on Thursday asserted that the concept of Hindu rashtra (nation) was not an objective but an adjective for this country. "The Hindu Rashtra is a secular, democratic, and an inclusive concept," RSS leader Rakesh Sinha said. Further, he added that the concept of Hindu nation addresses a larger objective, and it was different from any mode of worship.
