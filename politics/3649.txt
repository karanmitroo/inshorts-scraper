Congress leader Sheila Dikshit on Saturday slammed BJP and asked if the party demolished Babri mosque under constitutional norms. This comes after BJP released its manifesto for UP elections and announced that the party will build 'Ram Mandir' under constitutional norms if elected to power. They have started to mislead people as people have lost confidence in them, Dikshit added.
