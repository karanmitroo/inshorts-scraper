Reacting to the manhandling of filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali by Karni Sena members, Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav has invited Bollywood to shoot in "historical, glorified, culturally rich and developing" Bihar. "If Bhansali incident would have taken place in Bihar, there would have been endless hot debates on jungle raj and casteism by elite and eminent journalists," he tweeted.
