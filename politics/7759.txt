Stating that PM Narendra Modi is using the Governors to control non-BJP ruled states, Congress leader Raj Babbar on Wednesday said that the party will continue to fight against the autocratic behaviour of the Modi government. He said that the Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh was 'shamefully' expelled even though they had 58% of the votes in state elections.
