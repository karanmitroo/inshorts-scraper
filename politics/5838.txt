Union Minister Maneka Gandhi on Friday clarified her recent remark on 'paternity leave' that such a legislation will have little impact in India and it will be just a holiday for men. Claiming that she did not say any such thing, Gandhi said, "Ideally raising a child is the responsibility of both the parents... this maternity bill is just the beginning."
