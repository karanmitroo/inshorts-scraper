Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election rally over his 'blood pressure' remark, Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav said, "The Prime Minister talks about blood pressure. Once election results are out, all BJP leaders will have to get their blood pressure checked." Modi had earlier said there were no machines to check even blood pressure in UP hospitals.
