Referring to Congress President Sonia Gandhi's Italian origin, the BJP said people know who is 'Ram Bhakt' and who is 'Rome Bhakt'. This was in response to Congress leader Kapil Sibal's comment that PM Narendra Modi was not a Hindu after he had embraced Hindutva. Earlier, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was accused of entering as non-Hindu at Somnath Temple.
