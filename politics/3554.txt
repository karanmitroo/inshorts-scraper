Minutes after Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the annual Budget 2017, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday asked, "What is the need of announcing budget every year?" "Were all announcements of last year's budget fulfilled?" he further asked. Thackeray had earlier appealed to President Pranab Mukherjee to not allow presentation of the budget before polls in five states.
