RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and BJP leader Sushil Modi on Friday engaged in a Twitter spat on Friday. “Railways is rapidly slipping into a financial morass and terminal debt trap,” Lalu tweeted. Sushil Modi then responded that Lalu milked railways like cow but PM Narendra Modi knew Railways better because he served tea with milk on platform.
