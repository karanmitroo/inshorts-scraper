Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has asserted that the Centre's move to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes was a hastily executed decision. "I feel that the government is either not fully prepared or has not fully explained it to the nation," Tharoor added. However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has defended demonetisation, saying the country is moving towards a cash-less economy.
