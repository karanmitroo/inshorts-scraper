Union Tourism Minister Chiranjeevi has resigned from his post in protest against the Cabinet's approval of the formation of separate Telangana. Chiranjeevi felt anguished over the way the protests in Seemandhra regions against the division of AP were handled. Coming under intense pressure from the "United Andhra" supporters, he faxed his resignation to the Prime Minister's Office on Thursday night.
