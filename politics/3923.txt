Information commissioner MS Acharyulu has been relieved of HRD ministry, days after he ordered Delhi University to make public records of 1978, the year in which PM Narendra Modi had allegedly passed out. Acharyulu had also pulled up the PMO for not providing any information if 'Jana Gana Mana' was the national anthem and 'Vande Mataram' the national song.
