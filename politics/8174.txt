Ruling out any alliance with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM, the BSP has said that it would contest alone in all 403 seats of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly. "We will fight the next elections by offering the alternative of 'Kanoon ka Raj' as against the BJP's "Danga Raj' and the ruling SP's 'Goonda Raj,'" BSP's National General Secretary Swami Prasad Maurya added.
