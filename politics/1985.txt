BJP leader General VK Singh has demanded that the Hurriyat Conference be declared a terrorist organisation and separatist leaders be immediately jailed under the Public Safety Act of Jammu and Kashmir. He further said that Hurriyat leaders should not be allowed to live in comfort while under house arrest and instead be locked up in central prisons on terrorism charges.
