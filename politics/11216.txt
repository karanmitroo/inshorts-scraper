Following election commissioner, HS Brahma's public criticism of the handling of the Varanasi stand-off on Friday, the Election Commission appointed a special observer to oversee polling in the high-profile constituency. With the appointment of Praveen Kumar as the special observer, Pranjal Yadav, district magistrate and returning officer of the Varanasi constituency, will have to take a back seat.
