The BJP on Tuesday disrupted proceedings in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly over state minister Azam Khan's "derogatory remarks" against PM Narendra Modi. “It is an irony that the ‘badshah’ of the country does not keep his mother with him and goes on gifting things to enemy’s mother. He talks of ‘beti bachao’ but left his own wife,” Khan had said.
