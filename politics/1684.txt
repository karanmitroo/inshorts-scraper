BSP chief Mayawati's resignation as Rajya Sabha MP may not be accepted since it does not follow the prescribed format, according to reports. Mayawati has cited not being allowed to speak about Dalit atrocities in the Rajya Sabha as the reason for her resignation. However, parliamentary procedure dictates that a parliamentarian cannot cite a motive or reason for resigning.
