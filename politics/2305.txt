Protesting against the death sentence awarded to Kulbhushan Jadhav by a Pakistani court, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Tuesday vandalised a Zara showroom and threw clothes that had Pakistan's tag. "We had written letters to them asking them not to sell Pakistani brands. Other stores in areas like Juhu had acceded to our request," said MNS leader Rita Gupta.
