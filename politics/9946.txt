Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackrey Friday lashed out at the BJP and said, "We have joined the government in Maharashtra to bring stability, it does not mean that we have succumbed to any one. We got 63 seats... this is not a small achievement". The Shiv Sena does not need a 'wave' to come to power, he added.
