Amidst criticism for attending only seven sittings since being nominated two years ago, Bollywood star Rekha on Tuesday turned up to attend the Rajya Sabha proceedings. She posed before photographers with folded hands and said "namaste" as she entered the Parliament House complex. Rekha along with cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, has been criticised for low attendance in the House.
