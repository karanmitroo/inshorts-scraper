Actor-turned-DMK politician Radha Ravi has allegedly made a remark comparing political rivals to children with disabilities. “We want the police to file an FIR against him under the recently passed Disabilities Act,” said a disabled rights activist. Ravi made the speech on March 1, at an event celebrating the birthday of DMK working President MK Stalin.
