Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Wednesday referred the issue of a recent sting operation showing some TMC leaders allegedly accepting bribes to the Ethics Committee for investigation. The issue was raised in the Rajya Sabha as well, with the CPI(M) demanding a probe into the issue. TMC, however, has given clean chit to the leaders shown in the video.
