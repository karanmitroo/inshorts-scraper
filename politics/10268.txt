Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has come out in defence of the khap panchayats saying that they were like "parents minding the children". He also said that the presence of the extra-constitutional bodies makes the court's work easy as matters are solved outside. Calling it an "old system", he said that they help check society's evils and curb them.
