The opposition Congress on Friday created a row in the Chhattisgarh Assembly demanding a complete ban on liquor sale in the region. Congress MLA Satyanarayan Sharma also alleged that a Sub Divisional Magistrate abused a panchayat secretary over phone while pressurising him to set up a government liquor shop. Similar incidents were taking place everywhere in the state, he added.
