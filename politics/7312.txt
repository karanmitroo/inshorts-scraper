Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday called BJP a progressive party that accepts political dissent but is against anti-nationalism. "We are different from other parties because we have progressive policies, decisive leadership and nationalist ideology," Singh said. He further praised the performance of the government and said there have been no allegations of corruption over the past 22 months.
