Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said that singing the National Song, 'Vande Mataram', should be made compulsory by the law. "Nationalism shouldn’t be just part of January 26 and August 15 celebrations," added Thackeray. Notably, a notice has been issued by the BMC to make singing ‘Vande Mataram’ compulsory in all schools run by them.
