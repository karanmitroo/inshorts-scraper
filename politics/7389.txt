The Parliament Ethics Committee on Monday issued a notice to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi seeking clarification on whether he declared himself a British citizen during his stay in the UK. The Ethics committee sought clarification because India does not recognise dual-citizenship. BJP's Subramanian Swamy had earlier accused Rahul of declaring himself a British citizen to float a company.
