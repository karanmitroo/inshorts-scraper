Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a rally on Friday, said if one were to search on Google, maximum number of jokes would be found on Congress leaders than on any other leader. This comes days after Modi had said in the Parliament that only former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh knew the art of taking bath while wearing a raincoat.
