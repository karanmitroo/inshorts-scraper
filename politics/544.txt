Addressing the Rajya Sabha, Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agrawal on Thursday accused Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal of treating CM Arvind Kejriwal like a 'chaprasi' (peon). This came after Union Minister Vijay Goel blamed AAP-led Delhi government for failing to act against illegal constructions. BJP-led municipal corporations are responsible for checking illegal constructions, Agrawal added.
