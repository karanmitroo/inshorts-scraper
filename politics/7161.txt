BJP’s campaign committee head Himanta Biswa Sarma has claimed that BJP and its allies would win 50 of the 65 constituencies in Assam that go to polls on Monday. Rubbishing the claims, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said, "The Congress had won 54 of these 65 seats in 2011. We are likely to get more seats than last time.”
