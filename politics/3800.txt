The Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha has decided to field Major (retired) Ramesh Upadhyay, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, in the forthcoming assembly elections from two seats in Uttar Pradesh. Upadhyay had moved the election application last week and both the jail authorities and NIA said that they had no objection to him contesting elections.
