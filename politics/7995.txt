BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday suspended party MP Kirti Azad for allegedly attacking Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and committing anti-party activities. Azad had earlier backed allegations of corruption within the DDCA during Jaitley's tenure as its chief. Reportedly, Azad was not given a show cause notice or chance to explain himself.
