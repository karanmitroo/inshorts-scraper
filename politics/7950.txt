Suspended MP Kirti Azad was served a show-cause notice by BJP on Thursday and asked to explain his misconduct within 10 days related to accusations against Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) over alleged financial irregularities. Earlier, Azad had named BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over irregularities and claimed that a probe had implicated Jaitley.
