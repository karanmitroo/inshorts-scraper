Congress leaders on Tuesday staged a walkout from the Lok Sabha following Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s remarks over Arunachal Pradesh political crisis. In response to Congress’ allegations that the BJP-led government was destabilising state governments, Rajnath said in the history of independent India, if there is anyone who has this old habit of destabilising popular governments, it is Congress.
