The BJP criticised the Bihar government after its Minority Affairs Minister Abdul Ghafoor was caught on camera 'feasting' with Mohammad Shahabuddin, who is serving a life sentence. The video shows Ghafoor and another MLA meeting Shahabuddin inside Siwan jail on March 6. RJD chief Lalu Yadav, however, defended the government saying it was normal courtesy to offer snacks to guests.
