Mint has uploaded a video on YouTube explaining NOTA in the context of elections in India. NOTA was introduced following a 2013 Supreme Court directive in the People's Union for Civil Liberties versus Union of India judgment, making India the fourteenth country to do so. Further, Bihar has registered the highest NOTA votes polled so far in any state.
