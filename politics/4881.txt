BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav has said that he hopes US President-elect Donald Trump would bring "fresh ideas" to combat terrorism and establish the rule of law. "Going by his pre-election statements towards India, the President-elect seems to have a friendly perspective towards India. He does not seem to be a run-of-the-mill politician," he added.
