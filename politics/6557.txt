The BJP on Monday staged a protest near the Congress headquarters in New Delhi, against the party leaders' statements over the 2008 Batla House encounter issue. "The Congress president and her associates should apologise", said Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay. Last week, Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh had said the encounter was “fake” and demanded a judicial probe into it.
