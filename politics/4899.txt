BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi cannot see India's development under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as he is wearing "Italian glasses". "Rahul baba you have to answer....what did your party do during its tenure at the Centre?" Shah said while adding that banning old ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes would help boost Indian economy.
