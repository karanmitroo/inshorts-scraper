"I am not contesting from Rae Bareli. I never agreed to nor do I now ... I've been denying this for the last two months," AAP leader Shazia Ilmi tweeted Tuesday. There was buzz in the party that Ilmi will be fielded against Congress president Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli after Kumar Vishwas was fielded against Rahul Gandhi from Amethi.
