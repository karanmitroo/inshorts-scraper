Following PM Narendra Modi's address on the eve of New Year, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said, "Modi ji sounds so hollow now. People have stopped believing anything that he says." "He has become a subject of ridicule internationally," Kejriwal claimed. This comes after Modi announced welfare schemes for poor, middle-class, farmers, senior citizens, and pregnant women in his address.
