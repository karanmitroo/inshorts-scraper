Registering protest against demonetisation, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said PM Narendra Modi is running the government of a few industrialists and will give common people's money to them. Claiming that no investigation has been ordered against these industrialists, he said, "I'm happy that I'm fighting against these people...who want to suppress all the citizens of India."
