Calling the number of seats won by BJP in the MCD polls as "unbelievable", AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said AAP will analyse the reason behind its defeat. "The BJP...has done nothing but spread corruption, Dengue, Chikungunya and pollution," he added. Sisodia further claimed that without EVM tampering, there was no way BJP could have won these many seats.
