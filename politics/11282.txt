Senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi has written to PM Manmohan Singh and the Election Commission protesting against the government's move to go ahead with the appointments to top scientific posts. "I consider the whole process as malafide and the appointment of two top scientific secretaries should not be made when the present government is set to leave," Joshi wrote.
