Ahead of the elections, BJP on Tuesday asked the Muslims to give it a chance and apologized for any past "mistake". Addressing a gathering, Rajnath further asked them not to go by the "propaganda" of Congress and promised to stand for equality. "Try us once. We don't come up to your expectations, don't look at us ever again," he said.
