Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday said that election time brought "tourists" like BJP chief Amit Shah, who showed ignorance about the state. Slamming Shah for refering to 'Kannada Rajyotsava' as 'Karnatak Mahotsav', Siddaramaiah added, "We celebrate birthdays of 26 leaders and builders of Nava Karnataka. Amit Shah in a desperate attempt to communalise, picks on Tipu Jayanthi."
