Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has reacted to his party colleague Kumar Vishwas' video, which had slammed the AAP government, saying that it is a must watch. In the video, Vishwas said, "If you form government in Delhi on an anti-corruption plank and fall silent when some of your own come under scanner, people have the right to question you."
