Human rights activist Irom Chanu Sharmila has been rushed to hospital hours after she ended her 16-year-long fast on Tuesday. Sharmila, also known as 'The Iron Lady of Manipur', had been fasting in protest against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act which granted security forces extra powers. After breaking the fast, Sharmila had announced plans to become Manipur's Chief Minister.
