Re-poll at five polling stations in Wokha (Nagaland) reported zero turnout on Thursday, officials said. Previously, the villagers had resented imposition of the repoll and questioned on its grounds. Also, the ruling Naga People's Front had lodged a complaint with the EC against its decision of repolling alleging that the move was ordered on "mere allegations" of Congress.
