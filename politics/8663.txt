Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said the Narendra Modi-led government "respects everybody's freedom" and is not involved in the meat bans imposed in certain parts of the country. Referring to the fatwa and the 'ghar wapsi' call to AR Rahman, Naqvi said, "AR Rahman is an asset to India... disturbing him was a work of ill minds".
