A Mumbai-based startup, VoxWeb, has claimed that the hand symbol used by actor Rajinikanth was similar to its brand's logo, but with the left thumb free. The symbol, seen as the actor's trademark gesture, has figured prominently since he announced plans to launch a political party. The startup said they would ask the actor's team to make some alterations.
