Addressing a gathering in poll-bound UP, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Monday halted her speech and covered her head on hearing 'azaan' (Islamic call for prayer) in the background. She was speaking during the inauguration of an exhibition marking the birth centenary of ex-PM Indira Gandhi. “Indira Gandhi wanted to see India as a strong and developed nation,” she stated.
