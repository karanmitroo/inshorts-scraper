On the issue of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's citizenship being reported to the Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, the Congress on Thursday said it showed "hatred against the Congress leadership". Congress Leader Veerappa Moily said that the case was "blindly" referred, "without any sense of judgement, without making any case".
