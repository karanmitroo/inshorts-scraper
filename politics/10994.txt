The Shiv Sena on Thursday anointed Uddhav Thackeray as the saffron combine's CM pick. "The CM issue can be decided by discussions (with the BJP). We are not in a hurry," Thackeray said. However, senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde said the CM issue will be decided by leaders of the Mahayuti, or grand (Sena-BJP) alliance.
