PM Narendra Modi on Thursday ended his silence on the lynching of a man in Dadri over rumors of eating beef, by saying that communal harmony would help develop and forward the country. He also said, “Some politicians are making irresponsible statements for political interests… Do not pay attention to such statements, even if Modi himself makes any such statement.”
