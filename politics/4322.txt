While delivering a speech on celebrations of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 92nd birthday, BJP's Aligarh mayor Shakuntala Bharti said, "Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji is no longer with us, but his memories remain." While the Mayor accepted her mistake and apologised for it later, former Aligarh Zila Panchayat member Narendra Pachauri termed Bharti as an 'ignorant'.
