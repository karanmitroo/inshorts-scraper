Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi Saturday said the police had no hidden motive behind visiting Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's residence. “No snooping motive was there. No direction had come from the Central government. Delhi Police never had any political pressure from Centre,” Bassi said. Congress had alleged that the "unwarranted and weird enquiries" were politically motivated.
