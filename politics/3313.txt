Commenting on AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala's conviction in the disproportionate assets case, DMK leader MK Stalin said justice had been done after 21 years. "This would be an example for politicians to live corruption-free," he added. Stalin also requested Governor Vidyasagar Rao to establish stable management in the state. Notably, the Supreme Court awarded Sasikala a four-year sentence.
