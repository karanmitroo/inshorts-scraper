Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday said that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal must apologise for calling Narendra Modi a "coward and a psyc[h]opath" in his tweets. "CBI has already clarified Delhi CM's office has not been raided", Prasad added. Kejriwal had made the remarks after CBI reportedly raided the office of his Principal Secretary.
