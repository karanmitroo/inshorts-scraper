The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared the Election Commission's proposal to procure new Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) equipped EVMs. The EC reportedly requires â‚¹3,174 crore to buy 16 lakh VVPAT machines to conduct the 2019 polls. The new machines show the result to voters for seven seconds on a paper slip which is then recorded for verification later.
