Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Sadhvi Prachi on Tuesday called superstar Shah Rukh Khan a Pakistani agent. Asking him to move to Pakistan, Prachi said, "By talking about returning the awards, he has committed treason. He should be punished for this." Her comments came a day after Khan had said that there was extreme intolerance in the country.
