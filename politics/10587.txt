In another controversy, Doordarshanâ€™s decision to live telecast the Vijaya Dashmi speech of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday has created a huge furor. Congress and left parties said the decision was unacceptable and called it a "dangerous misuse of the state machinery". The CPI-M said it was an instance of the public broadcaster being misused by the Modi government.
