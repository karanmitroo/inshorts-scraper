Twitter users have mocked Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for wearing a floral crown which was presented to him by local fishermen in Goa. While one user tweeted, "That awkward moment when you've run out of deodorant but need to address a press conference", another wrote, "No this isn't Snapchat, it's for real". Another tweet read, "Fool khile hain Gulshan Gulshan".
