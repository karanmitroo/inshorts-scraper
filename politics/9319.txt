Rajya Sabha proceedings on Friday were disrupted by repeated adjournments amid demands for the resignation of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari following a CAG report alleging irregularities in a company owned by him. The CAG report has revealed that Gadkari's company Purti Sakhar Karkhana Ltd did not meet conditions for availing interest subsidy from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
