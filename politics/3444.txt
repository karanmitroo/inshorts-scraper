BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain has said there's no winnable Muslim leader in BJP to be fielded in upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. "The party selects candidates from all religions, castes and classes. The committee looks at the ability of the candidate to win," he added. Criticising SP, he said it allied with Congress to hide its five years of failure.
