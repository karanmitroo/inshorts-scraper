Reacting to the Union Budget 2017-2018, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said, "Ye sher-o-shayari ka Budget hai (It is a Budget full of poetry). There is nothing for the farmers and the youth." He further said, "We were expecting fireworks, instead got a damp squib... Any step to clean political funding will be supported by us."
