The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has claimed that the Election Commission failed to curb the use of money power in the Assembly elections in Goa. "I will say it on record that the Election Commission has miserably failed to stop distribution of money and liquor across Goa on the eve of the polls," said AAP's chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes.
