Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday justified killing of 16 Karsevaks during 1990 Ayodhya dispute. “If I had to kill 30 Karsevaks for the nation’s unity, I would have done it,” he said during the launch of a book in Lucknow. He further added that if Karsevaks were not shot, Muslims would have lost trust in the country.
