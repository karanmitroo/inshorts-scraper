The BJP criticised the AAP-led Delhi government's odd-even car rule for curbing pollution by calling it "a decision that was taken under pressure." BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that the move failed to make "due consideration of all implementation issues" and slammed CM Kejriwal for not consulting the public on this matter. Notably, Delhi air pollution exceeds WHO limits.
