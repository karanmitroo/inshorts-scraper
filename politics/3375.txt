Attacking Narendra Modi's radio program 'Mann ki Baat' at an election rally, UP CM Akhilesh Yadav said, "[Modi] says 'mann ki baat' on TV and radio, I want to ask him as to when will he do 'kaam ki baat' (talk of something worthwhile)." "The downfall of those who had befooled the people promising 'achche din' has started," Akhilesh added.
