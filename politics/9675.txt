Soon after Congress leader Jagdish Sharma released photographs of Rahul Gandhi and claimed that he is in Uttarakhand, the party vice president's office rejected Sharma's claims saying the pictures are old. A statement issued by Rahul's office says, "These pictures were taken when Rahul Gandhi was on an offsite to Uttarakhand in 2008." However, they didn't reveal his exact location.
