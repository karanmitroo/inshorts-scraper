Shiv Sena on Monday said that India was a 100% Hindu nation and hence the community needs no reason to spread terror in their own country. Notably, Home Minister Rajnath Singh had recently accused the Congress of coining the term 'Hindu terrorism'. "Giving terror a saffron colour and playing politics over it was a cunning and selfish move," Sena said.
