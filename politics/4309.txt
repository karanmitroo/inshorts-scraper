AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP SR Balasubramanian has condemned the involvement of CRPF forces by the Income Tax Department during raids at former Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Ram Mohan Rao's office. Balasubramanian said that the I-T could have obtained the state police's assistance for the raids as deploying CRPF for protection gave the impression that the state's police force was unreliable.
