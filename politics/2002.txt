Kerala Minister G Sudhakaran has said that rape cases can be reduced if men engage in farming and women discard mobile phones while walking. "Farmers seldom get time to abuse women...he is busy in farming," he said. Women who use mobile phones are likely to be not aware of their surroundings and anti-social elements take advantage of this, he added.
