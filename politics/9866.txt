Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who recently earned the party's wrath for praising PM Narendra Modi, has again praised the PM. The MP said in PM Modi "we are all seeing a master communicator at work". Tharoor, however, hit out at the BJP and added that the party was "simply promoting a nakedly bigoted Hindutva agenda".
