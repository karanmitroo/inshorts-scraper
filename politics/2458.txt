Blaming movies for the rising crime against women, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi on Saturday urged the film fraternity to portray women in a better light. "If you look at films...you will find romance almost always starts with eve-teasing. The man and friends will surround a woman..be mean to her...abuse her...and slowly she falls in love with him," she added.
