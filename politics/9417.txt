Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Friday ruled that 'Godse' was no longer unparliamentary except in reference to Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. The order came as a relief to Shiv Sena MP Hemant Tukaram Godse, who had voiced for removal of the word from the list of 'unparliamentary words'. The word was banned by the Parliament in 1956.
