Delhi Home Minister Satyendra Jain on Saturday reiterated the Delhi government's demand for full control over Delhi police and said the administrative system makes him "helpless". Jain added that he wants better law enforcement but can't even end bribery within the Delhi police and criticised commissioner BS Bassi of talking like a "spokesperson of a party".
