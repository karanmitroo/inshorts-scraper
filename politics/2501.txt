Reacting to BJP candidate N Sreeprakash's vote appeal before by-election in Kerala's Malappuram, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Monday said, "Beef is not a matter of faith for the BJP, but a tool to target a particular community." The BJP leader had promised that he will ensure the supply of good beef from clean slaughterhouses if he wins the election.
