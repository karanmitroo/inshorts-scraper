When asked about Priyanka Gandhi taking a more active political role, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday said one person alone cannot revive a political party. "I have always believed that the answer to the Congressâ€™ revival lies...in a collective endeavour," Jairam added. He further said, "No individual has a magic wand. The magic wand lies in a collective entity".
