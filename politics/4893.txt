Amid political protests against demonetisation, BJP leader Shaina NC on Saturday said that opposition parties were pretending to be economists and did not  understand demonetisation. Saying that opposition must understand that the people are with the decision, Shaina added, "It takes a lot of guts to do what our PM has done. The easiest thing to do is to criticise."
