BJP has filed multiple complaints across the country against a man who reportedly tweeted vulgar cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the cartoon, the man made references to the recent controversy over alleged rape threats to a DU student. "Our members and also those of the RSS will file cases against this across the country," BJP spokesperson Shantaram said.
