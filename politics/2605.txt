Days after UP government ordered the closure of illegal slaughterhouses, the Jharkhand government on Monday ordered to ban all illegal slaughterhouses in the state within 72 hours. However, the Jharkhand government reportedly doesnâ€™t have any record of legal abattoirs in the state. The order came after Hindu Jagran Manch, Bajrang Dal and Jharkhand Gau Raksha Dal demanded the ban.
