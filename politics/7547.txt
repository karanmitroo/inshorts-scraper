CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Friday launched an attack against Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani in the Rajya Sabha. Yechury objected to Irani reading out an unverified Facebook post, allegedly by Rohith Vemula, in which he had questioned the lack of Dalits in the CPM Politburo for 51 years. He asked the deputy chair to rule on the issue.
