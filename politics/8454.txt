Following Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ‘mouthpiece' Panchjanya defending the Dadri lynching incident, Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Manmohan Vaidya on Sunday said, “Paanchajanya/Organiser are not mouth piece of RSS. An official office bearer only speaks on behalf of RSS.” Vaidya asserted that the Sangh does not support “any violent incident” and that the “culprits must be brought to book.”
