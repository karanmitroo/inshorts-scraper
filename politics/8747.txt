The BJP unit in Odisha will reportedly hold a state-wide protest on September 2 against the government's “failure” in preventing infant deaths in Cuttack. BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra said the party will demonstrate in front of the offices of chief district medical officers in all 314 block headquarters. Cuttack saw at least 51 infants deaths in the last 11 days.
