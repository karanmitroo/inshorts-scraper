AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal dared the Modi govt on Tuesday and asked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to arrest him if he had received any 'hawala money' for party funds, which came through cheques. Referring to Congress, Kejriwal further said even his worst critics admitted that he was an honest man and would never do any wrong-doing.
