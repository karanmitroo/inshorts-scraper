Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Tuesday termed the AAP as a "seasonal bird" and the Congress a "proven enemy" of the state. He further accused both the parties of indulging in "political gimmickry to attain power in the state". "The interests of the state are safe only in hands of the SAD-BJP alliance," the five-time Chief Minister asserted.
