Delhi High Court on Tuesday refused to put Delhi assembly elections on hold. The order came while the court was hearing a petition alleging that no public notice was issued with regard to last dates of filing nominations which barred many persons from contesting the polls. The court, however, said the dates were "notified" by the poll panel on time.
