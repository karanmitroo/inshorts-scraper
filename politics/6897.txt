Responding to AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal's assertion that the Congress would be decimated in the Punjab elections, Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh said that Kejriwal was living in a "fool's paradise". "Like the PPP (Punjab Peopleâ€™s Party), the AAP will soon vanish into thin air," he said. He was referring to the PPP, which merged with the Congress last month.
