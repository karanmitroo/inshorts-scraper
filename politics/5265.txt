Union Minister Babul Supriyo was on Wednesday attacked with bricks in West Bengal's Asansol city, allegedly by TMC activists, when he was going to stage a protest against the arrest of some BJP workers. "They also showed me black flags. I do not know why the police allowed the mob to come near my car," Supriyo said.
