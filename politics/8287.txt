Head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s communication cell Manmohan Vaidya on Sunday condemned Congress’ "undemocratic and intolerant mindset”. He added, "All democratic and well meaning forces should protest it”. This came after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi earlier said that the party will “not just defeat but smash the RSS” and called the Bihar results a defeat of the RSS agenda.
