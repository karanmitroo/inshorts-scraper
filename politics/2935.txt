Only two Uttar Pradesh Chief Ministers have completed their full five-year terms since 1951-52, when the state's first election was held. BSP's Mayawati was the first Chief Minister to complete a full term during her tenure from 2007 to 2012. Current Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav became the second one to do so with the completion of his term in 2017.
