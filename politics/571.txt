Leading with almost double the votes received by rival AIADMK candidate Madhusudhanan, former AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran has said, "This is Amma's constituency. They have decided who should be Amma's successor. This a successor that the people have chosen." Claiming that he has late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa's "wishes", Dhinakaran said that all AIADMK workers also support him.
