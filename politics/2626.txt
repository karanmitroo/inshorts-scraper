UP CM Yogi Adityanath, while addressing a gathering in Gorakhpur on Sunday, said that Hindu poet Tulsidas never accepted Mughal emperor Akbar as ruler because he always considered Lord Ram as his ruler. He further said that though it is widely believed that Akbar was a generous ruler, he once tried to influence Tulsidas to change his faith.
