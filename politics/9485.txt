Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government is developing a mobile app which can secretly record audio-video and transfer the data into a secure server to help check corruption practices. "As soon as a user starts recording using this application, the screen of the phone will go dark appearing to be switched-off," said an official closely associated with the project.
