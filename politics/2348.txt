Reacting to the death sentence awarded to Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said "empty vessels make the most noise", adding that Pakistan needs some reasons to remain engaged. "It (Pakistan) should understand that if India starts retaliating, then Pakistan does not have the power to fight back," he said.
