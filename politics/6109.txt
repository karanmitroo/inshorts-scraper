Mahatma Gandhi could have survived after being shot had he been hospitalised in time, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy told Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. He also raised a question as to why Gandhi’s autopsy was not conducted. “If one goes purely by who were beneficiaries of MG elimination we can conclude Nehru and British were and patriots suffered,” he later tweeted.
