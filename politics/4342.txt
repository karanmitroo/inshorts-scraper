BSP supremo Mayawati on Monday alleged the BJP-led Centre is using the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax department and the Central Bureau of Investigation to pressurise the Samajwadi Party to form an alliance with Congress for the UP polls. "BJP will give the green signal only when it is sure that such an alliance will actually benefit them," she alleged.
