Amid ongoing tensions in the Yadav family, posters with a caption ‘I’m Amar Singh, an expert in breaking families’ have sprung up on the streets of Lucknow in UP. The posters also show Amar Singh in a dog’s body with a caption “I’m BJP’s agent…my tail can never be straightened”. UP CM Akhilesh Yadav’s supporters are reportedly behind these posters.
