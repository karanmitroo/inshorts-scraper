Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala has said that the party "has enough space for seniors and young leaders to work together" and it "is not the Congress' culture to send senior leaders on 'compulsory leave'... as the BJP does." These comments came following reports that several Pradesh Congress Committee presidents handpicked by Rahul Gandhi had faced attack from senior party leaders.
