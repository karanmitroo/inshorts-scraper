Referring to a Janata Dal (United) minister who was videotaped while allegedly taking a ₹4-lakh bribe, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, “They claim to be the disciples of veteran socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan… look at what their ministers did.” Awadhesh Kumar Kushwaha, the minister in question, was asked to resign by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for the same.
