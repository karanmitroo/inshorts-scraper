The BJP on Sunday said that there are no differences with its ally PDP in Jammu and Kashmir and the Mehbooba Mufti-led government is "working well". "The Chief Minister is engaged in daily work...so are ministers and the Deputy CM. There is no tension," said BJP. The PDP had earlier accused BJP of betraying it in the council elections.
