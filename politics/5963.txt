The Congress on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that "India has been forced to come to terms with a PM-mukt Parliament”. It is the first time that a PM was absent when a Constitutional Amendment was being passed, it said. “Instead of paying lip service, Mr Modi should actually give the Parliament... the respect it deserves,” Congress said.
