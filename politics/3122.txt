Late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's nephew Deepak Jayakumar said, "I respect O Panneerselvam. He was a good Chief Minister and I support his administration." He added, "TTV Dinakaran is not fit to be the party deputy general secretary. My aunt was opposed to family politics. She got Dinakaran MP post, and she threw him out of the party too."
