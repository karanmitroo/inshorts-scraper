Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said the Islamic practice of triple talaq to divorce women verbally has no sanction in Shariat. "Triple talaq is a matter of right of equality and right of women to live with dignity. It should not be politicised. I appeal to all political parties... to put an end to negative politics," he added.
