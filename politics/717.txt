BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'desh ka baap' (father of the nation) during a debate with ex-JNU Students' Union President Kanhaiya Kumar on a news channel. Criticising the remark, Congress asked PM Modi to apologise for the 'insult' to the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi.
