Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was criticised by former member of the Infosys board, Mohandas Pai, after the politician tweeted about his admiration for a Portuguese-built church in Goa. Pai wrote that his forefathers were driven out of Goa and killed by the Portuguese. In reply, Tharoor clarified that he had praised only the architecture, not the Portuguese.
