BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli today said that the Samajwadi Party (SP) government in Uttar Pradesh is neck deep in corruption. "The tenure of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh cannot cover up its bad tenure in terms of the lack of development," he added. Kohli further said that removing one or two ministers is not going to change SP's situation.
