A tweet by former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari has caused uproar, which reads - "Dilli chunav ke liye BJP taiyyar, Kejriwal ke mukable Kiran Bedi hongi CM candidate (BJP ready for Delhi polls, Kiran Bedi will be CM candidate against Kejriwal)". However, some in BJP said his Twitter account had been hacked and there was some mischief behind the post.
