Addressing party workers on the occasion of Ram Mahohar Lohia's birth anniversary on Monday, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the workers had ruined him by pouring cold water on his dream of forming a government at the Centre. "Had we won 40-45 seats, SP would have formed the government at the Centre," Yadav added.
