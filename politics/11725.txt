Whistle-blower website WikiLeaks on Monday accused the BJP of pushing fake propaganda that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange endorsed its PM nominee Narendra Modi. In a series of tweets posted early Monday morning, it clarified that the US diplomatic cables released by it in 2011 never described Modi as "incorruptible" or "the lone honest Indian politician".
