After the Delhi government released the full statehood draft bill for the national capital online, BJP leader Satish Upadhyay on Wednesday termed the same as 'unconstitutional'. Calling it CM Kejriwal's "new drama" and "stunt to divert Delhiites' attention", Upadhyay added, "We also vouched for statehood but in a very different manner and the situation at that time was very different."
