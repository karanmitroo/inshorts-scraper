A day after economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticised PM Narendra Modi over demonetisation, BJP MP and economist Subramanian Swamy tweeted, “It’s winter so migratory birds Amartya Sen and others must be flying to India”. He had earlier said, “Sen is not an Indian…in fact he’s technically a visitor. He actually functions as a foot soldier of Indian culture”.
