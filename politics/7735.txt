Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa on Sunday requested the Centre to withdraw the recent revision of excise duty on petrol and diesel. Jaya said that the Centre's move to meet its budgetary deficit was "condemnable" while the rates of global crude are declining. The Centre on Saturday increased the excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹1/litre and ₹1.5/litre respectively.
