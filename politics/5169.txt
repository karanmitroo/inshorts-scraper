The Supreme Court on Wednesday revived cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu's trial in connection with alleged malpractice during 2009 Lok Sabha elections when he was elected from Amritsar. Dismissing the charges of corruption against Sidhu, the apex court bench said he will have to stand trial for allegedly getting a Punjab government official transferred to seek his help.
