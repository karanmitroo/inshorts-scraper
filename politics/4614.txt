After separatist group, Hurriyat Conference invited tourists in Kashmir, BJP leader Ram Madhav on Wednesday took a jibe at it and said the Hurriyat leaders must have confused "tourists" with "terrorists". "Unless terrorism stops, unless violence comes to an end and peace returns, from where will the tourists come?" Madhav asked. "This is... the biggest hypocrisy of Hurriyat," he added.
