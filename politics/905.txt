While campaigning for his wife in the upcoming civic polls in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki, BJP leader Ranjeet Kumar Srivastava asked Muslims to vote for the BJP or else "face difficulties". He added that if they didn't vote for his wife, they will distance themselves and even the Samajwadi Party won't come to their rescue as it was the BJP's reign.
