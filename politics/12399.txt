JD(U) MP Shivanand Tiwari on Monday questioned awarding Bharat Ratna to Sachin Tendulkar instead of legendary hockey-player Dhyan Chand, adding that the award has lost its importance. Tiwari said while Sachin made crores of rupees; Dhyan Chand refused money and luxurious life offered by Germany. However, JD(U) distanced itself from Tiwari's remark and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar welcomed the step.
