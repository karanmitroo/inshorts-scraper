BJP Uttar Pradesh Women's Wing President Swati Singh on Thursday said if BSP Chief Mayawati has any guts, she should come out of hiding and contest assembly elections against her. She added that Mayawati is a woman who has always slept on a bed filled with currency notes but is afraid about the future of her black money after demonetisation.
