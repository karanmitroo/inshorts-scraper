A day after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley claimed that India has remained world's fastest growing large economy for the past three years, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "Dear Mr Jaitley, May the farce be with you." Gandhi's tweet, inspired from the line from Star Wars movie series, was shared along with Press Information Bureau's tweet stating GDP growth average.
