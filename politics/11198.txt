The Patna High Court on Thursday dismissed the PIL challenging Lalu Prasad’s continuance as Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President after his conviction in a fodder scam case. The PIL was filed by RJD rebel MLA Samrat Chaudhary on May 1, citing the party’s constitution where it was mentioned that a convicted person could not be its president.
