Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that the Congress was suffering because of dynasty issues as it is difficult to create leadership outside the dynasty. Citing Congress' poor performance in recent Assembly elections, Jaitley further said, "Congress at this point does not have tall leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi who could strengthen the party."
