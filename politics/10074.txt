The Central govt has imposed governor's rule in J&K with effect from Jan-8, sources said. The centre's move came after major political parties in the state failed to cobble up an alliance to form govt. The imposition of governor's rule became more important because Omar Abdullah Wednesday said that he would not like to continue as caretaker CM anymore.
