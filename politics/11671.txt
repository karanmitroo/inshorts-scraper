Delhi Election Commission has slapped a show-cause notice on Baba Ramdev for alleged violation of model code of conduct by allowing political activities in a Yoga congregation in Ramlila Ground in Delhi that was addressed by Narendra Modi Sunday. The organisers had reportedly sought permission for holding a 'Yoga Mahotsav' and had not informed that Modi would be attending it.
