The Election Commission is planning to ask the Uttar Pradesh government to reschedule next year's state board examinations in consultation with it to ensure there is no clash with the Assembly polls. The schedule for the examinations was declared on Thursday. The commission has also asked poll-bound Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa not to announce exam schedules without consulting it.
