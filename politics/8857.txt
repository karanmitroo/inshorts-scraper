Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on Friday slammed the Congress over its youth activists who took off their shirts during a protest against Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan. "Lok Sabha Speaker is parliament's pride. Is this the respect the Congress has for women? Is this what Rahul Gandhi preaches to the Congress?" Irani said.
