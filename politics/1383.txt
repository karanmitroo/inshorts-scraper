The Congress on Monday demanded Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu's resignation after the derailment of Utkal Express, which claimed the lives of 23 people and left more than 100 injured in Uttar Pradesh. "When a similar incident happened four decades ago, the then Railway Minister stepped down...The government should take moral responsibility for the accident," Congress leader Manish Tewari said.
