Continuing to oppose the Centre's demonetisation move, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi thinks as if he is a tiger and the only one who is right." She further said, "Where is the black money? This is public money, taxpayers' money that you have taken... you did not consult anybody before taking the decision."
