CPI(M) Politburo member Subhashini Ali on Saturday said that her party "will not form a front with Congress nor forge an alliance with it". She said the number of farmer suicides had gone up during the NDA regime because of its "anti-farmer policies". Ali alleged that inflation, unemployment were soaring but the government was reducing welfare funding for the backward.
