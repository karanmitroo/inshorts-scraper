AAP on Sunday announced that its Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann will be fielded against Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal in the 2017 Assembly elections. Badal is a two-time sitting MLA from Jalalabad town in the state's Fazilka district. Mann has also dared Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh to contest against Badal, rather than from his traditional Patiala constituency.
