Accusing the Congress of "double standards", BJP President Amit Shah on Tuesday asked party Vice President Rahul Gandhi to clear the Congress' stand on the Ayodhya dispute. "On the one hand, temples are being visited (by Rahul Gandhi) ahead of elections. On the other hand, they are trying to delay hearing of the Ram Janmabhoomi case," Shah said.
