Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has said that the Congress had brought peace in Jammu and Kashmir, while the BJP has created space for terrorists. "We broke the backbone of terrorism into three-four pieces and brought peace," Gandhi claimed. "They (BJP) don't have an understanding of the basic tools. Every single person says the Prime Minister doesn't listen," he added.
