Accusing the CPI (Marxist)'s Kerala unit of misinterpreting his statement on alliance with Congress, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Saturday said it was CPI(M) and not CPI (Kerala). Yechury had earlier hinted at an "electoral alliance" with Congress to defeat the BJP and "communal forces". Kerala leaders had criticised him, alleging he was taking a pro-Congress stand.
