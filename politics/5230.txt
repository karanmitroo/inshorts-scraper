DMK Treasurer and Opposition leader in the Tamil Nadu Assembly MK Stalin has convened an all-party meeting on October 25 over the Cauvery issue. DMK's allies, Congress and IUML, confirmed their participation but BJP has already ruled out its presence. Stalin said the meeting was being held following pleas from farmers and public to “exert serial pressure” on the issue.
