An AAP MLA from Delhi, Jagdeep Singh, was on Sunday arrested for allegedly assaulting the manager of a company contracted by the municipal corporation. He was later released on bail, the police said. Notably, Singh is the seventh AAP legislator to be arrested by the Delhi Police. He, however, claimed that he was home and it was just a "rumour".
