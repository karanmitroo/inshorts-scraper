Reacting to China's displeasure over Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama's visit to Bihar, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday said, "We are not recognising him as a political leader, but as a spiritual leader". "So, China's stand is irrelevant, if we want to invite a major Buddhist leader to a conference, then it's our privilege," he added.
