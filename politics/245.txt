Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa slammed Congress President Rahul Gandhi for reportedly visiting a temple after eating "Javari chicken". "Why is Congress repeatedly hurting Hindu sentiments? Looking at everyone equally is Samajawad (socialism), yours is majawad (enjoyment)," he tweeted. He also hit out at CM Siddaramaiah who had last year visited Dharmasthala Manjunatha after eating fish.
