Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday said, "In name of sanatan dharm you want people to be divided. You take the name of God to emotionally blackmail people." He added, "If Prime Minister talks about weakness, then the message goes to the entire country. One should not talk like this just to gain votes."
