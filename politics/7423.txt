Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union President Kanhaiya Kumar on Wednesday indicated that he is unlikely to campaign for the upcoming Assembly polls in West Bengal and Kerala, saying, "[M]ainstream politics is not my calling. I am a student..." This comes after CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday announced that Kumar will campaign for the Left in West Bengal.
