Bahujan Samaj Party Chief Mayawati on Monday criticised the Centre for not taking any action against BJP minister Gen (Retd) VK Singh and said it reflected the "anti-Dalit mindset" of the government. After two Dalit kids were killed in Haryana in November, Singh had said the government is blamed even if a stone is pelted at a dog.
