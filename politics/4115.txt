Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday cancelled Chief Minister V Narayanasamy's order banning the use of social media for official work. This comes after Bedi created a WhatsApp group for the exchange of official information. The union territory government had discouraged this in a circular saying that companies' servers are abroad and any country can get access to it.
