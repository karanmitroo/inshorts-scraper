After a prolonged illness, former BJP president Bangaru Laxman (73) died on Saturday in Hyderabad. Bangaru was earlier sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted by a court in 2012 in an arms deal case. The conviction followed after he was seen taking Rs 1 lakh bribe in a video released by Tehelka.
