Samajwadi Party General Secretary Amar Singh on Wednesday said some senior leaders in the party are trying to "demonetise the friendship" between him and party supremo Mulayam Singh. "It is time I take a decision on (my) future political course," he added. Talking about infighting in SP, he said he does not understand "why garbage is being thrown" at him.
