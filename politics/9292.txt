The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed an order issued by Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP govt which called for initiating criminal cases against media organisations for publishing or broadcasting defamatory content against the government. "You cannot do both things together - come to the Supreme Court against defamation on one hand, and then take action against the media," the court said.
