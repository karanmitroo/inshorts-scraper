BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday said crackers will be burst by terror groups in Pakistan if BJP loses the Bihar elections and "only the likes of Mohammad Shahabuddin would be laughing." Shahabuddin, who has been imprisoned for life, had served as an RJD MP four times. Bihar has become a "haven for terror modules", Shah added.
