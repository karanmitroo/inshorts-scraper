The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Friday suspended SP MLA Rampal Yadav from the party for six years. According to reports, Yadav and his supporters earlier clashed with the police regarding the demolition of a building the MLA owns. Notably, Yadav was suspended for alleged anti-party activities two months ago, but his suspension was revoked later.
