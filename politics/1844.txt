Muslims have started protesting against the Uttar Pradesh government's plan to make marriage registration mandatory and termed it as 'un-Islamic'. "Muslim marriages are only registered at the office of the Waqf board of UP as per the Nikahnama documents," Muslim leader Haji Jameeluddin said. "There is no need to register marriages again merely to satisfy a government's whim," he added.
