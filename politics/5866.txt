The government should not intervene in issues relating to the customs and rituals of temples, former Kerala CM Oommen Chandy said on Monday. "As the government is not interfering in the beliefs of other religions, it should not interfere in Hindu beliefs," he said. Notably, the Kerala government opposes the ban on entry of menstruating women at the Sabarimala temple.
