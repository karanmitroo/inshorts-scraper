PM Narendra Modi on Monday asked if it's fair for a man to divorce his wife over the phone which can ruin a Muslim girl’s life. When someone kills a girl in Hindu mother’s womb he goes to jail then how can we let Muslim daughters suffer due to triple talaq, he said. This issue shouldn't be politicised, he added.
