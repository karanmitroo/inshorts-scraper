AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal was shown black flags by some local residents, who claimed that they did not support any political party, in Faridabad as he kicked off his two-day Haryana roadshow from the city Saturday. "Showing black flags to Kejriwal is nothing new in this country. Black flags are always shown by the opposition parties," said an AAP supporter.
