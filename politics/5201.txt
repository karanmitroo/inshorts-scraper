Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, along with a four-member team, started his visit to Srinagar on Tuesday, reportedly for talks with separatist leaders to discuss the unrest in the Kashmir Valley. “We came here for humanity. Our motto is to share the grievances and pain (of Kashmiri people),” Sinha said. The team will also call on Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti.
