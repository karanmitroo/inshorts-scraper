Hours after Congress candidate from Vadodara, Narendra Rawat, refused to contest elections against BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, the party fielded Madhusudhan Mistry from the same seat. "I was declared the Congress candidate, I requested the high command to change the candidate and requested that Congress may declare a stronger candidate from Vadodara," Rawat said.
