Commenting on Uttar Pradesh government's recently released booklet wherein Taj Mahal was not included as a tourist destination, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "Not showing a lamp to the sun doesn't reduce its brightness." "It's for such a regime that (Hindi writer) Bhartendu had written: 'Andher nagri, chaupat raja' (A confused ruler, a chaotic state)," he added.
