After charges were dropped against five people accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh claimed that the Central government was connected to the accused. Singh said, "The central government wanted to save Malegaon (blast case) accused as they have connections with them... Even Prime Minister wants to save the people involved in terror activities."
