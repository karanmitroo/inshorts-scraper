Referring to demonetisation and the Centre's push towards a cashless economy, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said everything in India has changed except politicians and media. Adding that demonetisation is being steadily implemented, Jaitley said that "journalists just focus on the painful aspect of every situation ignoring its socio-economic background & handwork in implementing it".
