With new currency being printed after the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, Subhash Chandra Bose's grandnephew CK Bose has demanded that Netaji's photographs be put on new notes. Claiming that such demands have been raised by Indians for many years, he said, "I think in order to honour Netaji the NDA government must accept the demand of the people."
