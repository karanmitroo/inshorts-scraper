A Delhi BJP member, Raghav Mandal, ordered a pair of leather shoes online and sent them to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as his birthday gift on Wednesday. "I sent this gift to Arvind Kejriwal as a symbolic protest against his hypocrisy. He uses fine jogging shoes but always wears ordinary sandals in public and official events," Mandal said.
