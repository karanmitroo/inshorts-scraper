Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday kicked off his "Coffee with Captain" programme from Amritsar ahead of the upcoming polls in the state. The programme is reportedly aimed at interacting with people from all walks of life. Most of the questions Singh took from the 500-odd people gathered, were about the problems of drug addiction in the state.
