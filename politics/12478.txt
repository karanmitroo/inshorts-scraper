Former PM AB Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla, a BJP national vice president, has announced her resignation from the party alleging that the party is under the grip of power politics with Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh running one-man show. She said she was forced to contest from Korba, while her choice was Beltara constituency and would now spend time with family.
