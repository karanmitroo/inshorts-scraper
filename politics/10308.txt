Ex-Union Minister GK Vasan, who had quit the Congress earlier in Nov, revived his father's Tamil Manila Congress on Friday. Vasan revived the party in Tamil Nadu, 18 years after his father launched it in protest against the then PM Narasimha Rao in 1996. The rebel leaderâ€™s step is expected to affect the Congress in the next state assembly elections.
