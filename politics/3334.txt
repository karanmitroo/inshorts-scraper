Stating resources as the biggest challenge for Congress in Uttarakhand, CM Harish Rawat has said that Pankaj Udhas's ghazal can be rephrased as "Ek tu hi dhanwan hai Modi baki sab kangaal" (only Modi is rich, rest all are poor). He further called BJP a 'vote-lutwa' (vote-snatcher) party. BJP has more factions compared to us this time, he added.
