Formed on October 4, 1992, by Mulayam Singh Yadav in Lucknow, the Samajwadi Party was one of the many political factions that split from the parent organisation, Janata Dal. Influenced by the veteran socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia (1910â€“67), the party is aimed at "creating a socialist society, which works on the principle of equality".
