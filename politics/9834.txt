Assam CM Tarun Gogoi Friday blamed the ruling NDA for the growing religious intolerance in the country. Gogoi posted on Twitter, "Growing religious intolerance even at the heart of India's capital is due to the passive role played by the Modi-led NDA Government." He added, "Such passive role will not only hamper national integration but also economic development."
