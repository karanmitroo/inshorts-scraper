Ahead of the 2017 Goa Assembly election, a section of BJP workers from Fatorda constituency has joined the Goa Forward Party (GFP). Among those who joined the GFP from BJP are Sujay Lotlikar and Raju Naik. “I was with the BJP for the last 20 years. But the Fatorda BJP leader failed to give us our due respect,” said Lotlikar.
