Following his removal from the Cabinet, Samajwadi Party's Uttar Pradesh chief Shivpal Yadav on Monday said he was dropped from the ministry as he opposed those doing illegal work. "I will continue to raise my voice against those doing illegal work," he said. Yadav was sacked from his ministerial post by Chief Minister and his nephew Akhilesh Yadav last month.
