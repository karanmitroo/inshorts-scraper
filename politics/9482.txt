In contrast to the attempts being made to warn people about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking, BJP MP Dilip Gandhi Tuesday said there is no 'Indian' study to confirm that tobacco leads to cancer. "All agree on the harmful effects of tobacco. But there's no Indian survey report to prove that... All the studies are done abroad," he said.
