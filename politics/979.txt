Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that he would have quit as Finance Minister if the serving Prime Minister had insisted on implementing demonetisation. Chidambaram, who served as the Finance Minister in the Congress-led government, further said that though the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a "good idea", it was hastily implemented.
