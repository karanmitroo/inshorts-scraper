TMC MP Derek O'Brien on Monday called the Malda violence a criminal incident and accused the BJP and RSS of trying to paint it as communal. He lauded the state government for handling the incident tactfully and informed that 10 arrests have already been made with no reported injuries or deaths. Earlier, Mamata Banerjee had also called the incident non-communal.
