Late Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Kalikho Pul's 60-page suicide note, written on 7 August 2016, names four legal officials accusing them of demanding bribes in crores from him. Pul's suicide note, typed in Hindi and bearing his signature on each page, attempts to expose corruption among some members of the Congress, along with players in the country's highest legal circles.
