Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia on Saturday accused the Centre of resorting to "dadagiri" by snatching powers of the Delhi government. "We are not even allowed to pass laws. Delhi government can't even transfer somebody unless the Centre gives its nod," he said. Notably, the Aam Aadmi Party has been demanding full statehood to Delhi.
