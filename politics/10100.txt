West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, on Monday, forgave the man who slapped him during a public meeting on Sunday. "At a personal level... let me forgive the perpetrator and wish him early recovery", he wrote on his Facebook account. However, he refused to make any comment on the attempt-to-murder charge imposed on the man.
