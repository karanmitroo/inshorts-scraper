A Delhi court has directed the Delhi Police to file an Action Taken Report (ATR) on a criminal complaint filed against six persons, including Congress' Rahul Gandhi and AAP's Arvind Kejriwal, over their remarks on surgical strikes. The direction by the court came after a plea alleged that their statements had hurt the image of the Army and the country.
