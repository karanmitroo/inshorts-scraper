JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar along with his MLAs left for Delhi on Tuesday, after his party planned to parade its 130 MLAs before President Pranab Mukherjee. According to the party, its decision came as Bihar Governor was delaying in inviting Nitish to form govt in the state even after it had submitted letters of support of 130 MLAs on Feb-8.
