The Election Commission would be monitoring all election rallies through live streaming and webcasting, Goa Chief Electoral Officer Kunal said on Tuesday. The poll panel has also decided to monitor live streams from all polling stations across the state, he added. "Live streaming is possible as Goa has good connectivity and necessary infrastructure is in place," Kunal said.
