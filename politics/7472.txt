Prime Minister Modi is God's gift to India, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Sunday. “He is a man of ideas and has the strong will to execute them. He will make India ‘Vishwa Guru’ by 2022,” he said. Chouhan also slammed Congress saying Mahatma Gandhi's party should be "embarrassed" for Rahul Gandhi's stand on the JNU-row.
