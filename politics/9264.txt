Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), a party of the Kushwahas, claimed that Emperor Ashoka was a Kushwaha by caste, which Indian historians across the nation have widely criticized. A historian reportedly said that there was no reference to the emperor's caste in any of ancient texts, but an RLSP member said that he had documents to prove Ashoka's Kushwaha lineage.
