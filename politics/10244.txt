The Karnataka assembly was adjourned amid uproar on Thursday over BJP MLA Prabhu Chavan's gazing at Priyanka Gandhi's photo on his phone during assembly proceedings. The Congress demanded 'strict action' against the MLA, citing the act to be 'indecent'. According to Congress members, Chavan's conduct was unacceptable and has hurt the dignity of their leader.
