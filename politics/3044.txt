BJP's Shazia Ilmi has challenged AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to take out a rally in support of Gurmehar Kaur, along with a slogan 'Don't blame Pak for Indian soldiers' martyrdom'. Both Kejriwal and Rahul had backed Kaur, who allegedly received rape threats over her campaign following the unrest in Delhi University's Ramjas College.
