Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday, taking a dig at Modi's 'Start Up India' project, said that a contradiction lies "in saying I want start-ups but I will be intolerant." Addressing students in Mumbai, he further slammed "the ruling dispensation, particularly the RSS" for its extremely “rigid vision” for India. "Start-ups require free movement of ideas," added Rahul.
