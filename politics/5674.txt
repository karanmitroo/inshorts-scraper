Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said that Jammu and Kashmir had a 100% population of Hindus for "tens of thousand years" before the religion of “Kashmiri Islamic militants” came into existence. His remark came amid unrest in Kashmir, in which the death toll has risen to 76. Swamy had last month favoured imposition of President’s rule in Kashmir.
