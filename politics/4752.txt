Criticising PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation decision, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said, "Children these days say the other word for Paytm is PayPM". Mamata was the first leader who spoke against demonetisation policy and has played a major role in bringing together the opposition parties to organise a protest against ruling BJP.
