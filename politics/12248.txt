Referring to Narendra Modi, Union minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday told reporters, "A guy who didn't appoint a Lokayukta for 10 years is hardly the person to speak about Lokayukta. This is like Asaram talking about virginity". Modi had questioned why Congress was not implementing Lokayukta Act brought in by the previous BJP government in Uttarakhand.
