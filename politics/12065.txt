During an interview, actor Salman Khan said - “Why would Modi say sorry if he is not responsible for it (Gujarat riots). And if he is responsible then why the judiciary gave him a clean chit?” However, he added - “Don't want to endorse anyone for PM as I do not want my fans to get influenced by my judgement.”
