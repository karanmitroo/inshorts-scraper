BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday tweeted, "Looks like Arnab G is again cheating. His advertisements proclaim Republic is coming. That is illegal and he knows that too". Notably, Swamy had earlier objected to the use of the title 'Republic' by journalist Arnab Goswami for his TV channel, stating under the Emblem Act one cannot use the word 'Republic'.
