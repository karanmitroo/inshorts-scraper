BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday said that 2017 is the start of the "Hindu revolution that Rishi Aurobindo foresaw". "Minorities need not fear. E.g, like Parsis and Jews, Muslims too can (sic)," he tweeted. On UP mandate, he said, "UP is grand. In 1977 South voted for Indira's Emergency, UP wiped out Congress 100% thus gave us back democracy".
