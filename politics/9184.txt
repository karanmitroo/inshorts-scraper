Perturbed by Indian Army’s cross-border Myanmar operation, Pakistan Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan on Wednesday warned India that it should not mistake Pakistan for Myanmar. Khan's statement came in response to Union Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore's remarks that Myanmar's military action was a message to other countries. “Pakistan Army is fully capable of responding to any adventurism,” Nisar said.
