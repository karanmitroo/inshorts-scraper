Karnataka Excise Minister Satish Jarkiholi spent a night at a graveyard, along with hundreds of people, Saturday. All the people had dinner at the Vaikunth Dham, to bust the myth and fear attached with graveyards. "Graveyards are holy places, in fact," he said. Jarkiholi is also among the people fervent for bringing in the anti-superstition bill in the state assembly.
