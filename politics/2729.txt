BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday said that the government has independent information suggesting that the two Indian clerics who went missing in Pakistan are working against the country. "They are lying in order to defend themselves and get sympathy. They are saying that they were portrayed as RAW agents. We can't trust them," he added.
