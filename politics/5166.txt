Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday said that the cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu is a human bomb and will explode once he will enter the Congress. He further alleged that though Congress' Punjab chief Captain Amarinder Singh has said that he has no objection to Sidhu joining the party, both abuse each other.
