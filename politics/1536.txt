The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have accused Maharashtra Housing Minister Prakash Mehta of intervening in the allotment of government land to favour a private real estate firm. Demanding a probe, they called for his resignation in the state assembly. This comes after a probe was launched against Mehta for misleading the slum rehabilitation body to favour a developer.
