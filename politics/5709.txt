The AAP on Monday threatened to file a police complaint after "objectionable" posters showing sacked Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar came up across Goa with the party symbol on them. The posters also have "AAP for Women Empowerment" written on them. “I suspect BJP behind such acts. BJP rules and governs the state,” AAP Goa Convenor Valmiki​ Naik said.
