Congress has dismissed former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit's promise of support for the Aam Aadmi Party, saying that its her personal opinion. "This is her own ideology and nobody can question her on that. But the party is extremely sure about not joining hands with Arvind Kejriwal," Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Mukesh Sharma said.
