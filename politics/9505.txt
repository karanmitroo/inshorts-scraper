Social activist Medha Patkar resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday. "I never accepted any position of the party but as a senior member and an activist the disappointment is there," she said. Earlier in the day, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan were sacked from the party's national executive.
