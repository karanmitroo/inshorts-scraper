West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee will join PM Narendra Modi on a two-day visit to Bangladesh beginning June 6. The 60-year-old Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief reportedly accepted the formal invitation from the Centre on Thursday. On the contrary, she had refused one such request of accompanying former PM Dr Manmohan Singh to Bangladesh in September 2011.
