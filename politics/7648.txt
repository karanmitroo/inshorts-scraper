National Conference leader Omar Abdullah today said that Home Minister Rajnath Singh should provide evidence supporting the "serious" charges he levelled against JNU. Abdullah tweeted, "Cracking down on students and using Hafiz Saeed to justify the crack down is a new low, even for this NDA government." Singh had earlier claimed Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed supported the JNU incident.
