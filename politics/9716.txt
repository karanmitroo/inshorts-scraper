Aam Aadmi Party leader Yogendra Yadav has started a campaign called Jai Kisan against the Land Acquisition ordinance. As a part of the campaign, he will give salt to the MPs to remind them of their pre-poll promises. "Salt is a symbol of loyalty. Our leaders have breached their promise at every level by devising anti-farmer policies," Yadav said.
