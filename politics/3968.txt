The Election Commission on Thursday censured BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj for violating the Model Code of Conduct and the Supreme Court's decision not to seek votes in the name of religion. The EC warned him of facing strict action for any such violations in future. This comes after the BJP MP blamed Muslims for the population boom in the country.
