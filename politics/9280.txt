Former Bihar deputy CM and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday said that his party would not form alliance with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U). He added that Nitish was not reliable as he had betrayed the BJP after 17 years of alliance and sharing power in the central and state governments.
