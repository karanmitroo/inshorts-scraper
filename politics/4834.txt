Congress leader Manish Tewari on Wednesday said that the introduction of new â‚¹2,000 currency notes is illegal as it cannot be done without amending the RBI Act, as per law. "At some point of time court will look into the legality of demonetisation in addition to the inconvenience it has caused to people," Tewari added.
