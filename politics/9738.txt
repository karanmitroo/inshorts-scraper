Rejecting Nitish Kumar's accusation, Union Minister of Urban Development Venkaiah Naidu Sunday said that PM Narendra Modi has no role in Bihar's ongoing political crisis. Naidu said, "JD(U)- the name is 'united' but, as usual, they are divided." He further added, "I would like to make it very clear...Nitish is blaming Modi and the Centre for his own party's failures."
