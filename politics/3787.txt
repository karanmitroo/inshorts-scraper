Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who recently joined the Congress, held a joint press conference with Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday and said, "Baap baap hota hai, beta beta hota hai." Dismissing rumours that Sidhu is not on agreeable terms with Amarinder Singh, the Captain said, "I am his wicketkeeper. I will catch him in the slips."
