Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has admitted that some workers are “maligning” the party’s image by being involved in “land grabbing”, “loot-khasot”, and “hooliganism”. Singh said, “They are not interested in helping the SP form... government again [in UP] in 2017.” He further asked the workers to be careful with their “behaviour” and maintain “good relation[s]” with the public.
