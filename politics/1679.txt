The NCP has dismissed the rumours that some of its MLAs and MPs may have indulged in 'cross voting' in the Presidential elections. Notably, 'cross voting' is casting vote for a party/candidate one does not belong to. The NCP, an ally of the Congress, is rumoured to have voted for NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind instead of Opposition's Meira Kumar.
