Gujarat BJP ministers, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and Atmaram Parmar, have sparked a controversy after they were seen attending an event meant to felicitate exorcists, where they were also seen shaking hands with nearly 100 exorcists. Later, one of the ministers also defended the act by terming it as a gathering of "worshippers of the divine" and not of believers of superstition.
