Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday condemned the recent Alwar lynching and said that those who don't agree with PM Narendra Modi and the RSS have no place in the country. "This is the new vision of India which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is propagating. It's a vision where only one idea will prevail," Gandhi added.
