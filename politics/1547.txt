The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has alleged that the food served to BJP President Amit Shah at a Dalit party worker's house in Haryana's Rohtak was cooked elsewhere. It claims that the food was prepared at Tilyar Lake by professional chefs and was checked by a team of doctors before being served. However, the BJP has denied the claims.
