After having defected from the ruling Uttarakhand Congress regime, nine rebel MLAs, including former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, on Wednesday joined the BJP. The MLAs, who had been disqualified from voting in the floor test, had earlier been expelled from the Congress. Their defection had led to the imposition of President's rule in the state in March.
