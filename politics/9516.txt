The AAP Sunday removed party's internal Lokpal Admiral Ramdas from his post. It also removed Prashant Bhushan from the chief of National Disciplinary Committee. A new Lokpal panel comprising former IPS officers Dilip Kumar and Rakesh Sinha, and educationist SP Verma has been set-up. This comes only a day after Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were expelled from the National Executive.
