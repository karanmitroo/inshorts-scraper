Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said entertaining Pakistani artistes after payment of ₹5 crore is neither patriotic nor in national interest. "You are continuing to give them opportunity and trying to accommodate them," he added. Notably, MNS chief Raj Thackeray recently said producers casting Pakistani artistes would have to pay ₹5 crore to the Army welfare fund.
