The Allahabad High Court has issued a notice to PM Narendra Modi after a petition was filed accusing him of over-spending during the Lok Sabha election campaign. In the petition, Congress candidate Ajay Rai, who lost the Lok Sabha polls against Modi in Varanasi, has requested the high court to nullify Modi's election from Varanasi on these grounds.
