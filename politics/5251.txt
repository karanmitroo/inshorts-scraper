The Communist Party of India on Friday alleged that there has been an upsurge in atrocities against minorities and Dalits in India. The party's National Council Secretary Shameem Faizee charged the BJP-led NDA government with "falling in line" with the RSS ideologies. The party would observe December 6 as a 'Day Against Communalism and Casteism' across the country, Faizee stated.
