Tamil Nadu Interim CM O Panneerselvam has alleged that after being "thrown out" of AIADMK in 2011, VK Sasikala had written a letter to ex-CM J Jayalalithaa, vowing to her that she would not join politics. "Now tell me who has cheated Amma," he said while reading out a letter allegedly written by Sasikala.
