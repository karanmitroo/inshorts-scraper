BJP President Amit Shah slammed the Congress government in Karnataka for 'minority appeasement' through its celebration of Tipu Jayanti. "Siddaramaiahji is more interested in votebank politics through Tipu Sultan Jayanti rather than development of Karnataka and its Rajyotsava on November 1," Shah said. BJP has opposed Tipu Jayanti celebrations, with some leaders terming Tipu Sultan a 'tyrant'.
