Aam Aadmi Party leader Somnath Bharti on Friday suggested that Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi is loyal to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Bharti said, "When Bassi talks about the 'khaki', it is not clear whether he is talking about the policemen, who wear the 'khaki' uniform or the 'Khaki' pants which the RSS workers wear."
