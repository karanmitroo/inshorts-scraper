Referring to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's speech at the University of California, BJP President Amit Shah on Tuesday said some opposition leaders have to go abroad to give speeches as nobody in India listens to them. In his speech, Gandhi had criticised the PM Narendra Modi-led government over its demonetisation decision and the growing polarisation in the country.
