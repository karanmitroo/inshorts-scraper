During a visit to poll-bound Gujarat on Monday, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi criticised the BJP-led central government's GST regime and termed it as 'Gabbar Singh Tax'. Gandhi further slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the demonetisation move and said, "Even PM Modi didn't understand for the first 2-3 days what happened."
