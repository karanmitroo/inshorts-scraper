Slamming Pakistan for its call to observe July 19 as 'black day' over Jammu and Kashmir protests, BJP on Saturday said Pakistan should instead observe a "Black Year" for breeding terrorism. Such "theatrics" will not change the reality that Pakistan "helps terrorist(s) launch attacks against India" and supports terrorism to an extent which is "harming its own citizens", BJP added.
