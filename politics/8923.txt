Rahul Gandhi on Friday visited agitating students at the Film and Television Institute of India. The students have been on strike since June 12 to protest the "political appointment" of five persons, including the chairperson, who they say have been appointed because of their "affiliations" to RSS and BJP. "The RSS and its wings promote mediocrity," said Rahul.
