Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday vouched to fight for tea garden workers as he slammed PM Narendra Modi for focusing on 'chai pa charcha' but not on the 'languishing' condition of these workers. At a rally about tea garden workers in West Bengal, he added that there should be "talks about the hardships, hunger and future" of these workers.
