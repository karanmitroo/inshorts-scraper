Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has alleged that PM Narendra Modi in Lucknow rally plagiarised what ex-PM Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay Gandhi had said in 1971. He tweeted that both the leaders in 1971 had said, "We say remove poverty, they say remove Indira." PM Modi on Monday had said, "They say remove Modi, I say remove black money."
