BJP leader Vijendra Gupta on Tuesday alleged that the AAP government managed to save money on various projects in Delhi, not because of honesty but because steel and cement became cheaper. Gupta further alleged that they excluded many infrastructure-related features for cutting costs. Notably, the Delhi government had earlier claimed to have finished several projects at lower-than-expected costs.
