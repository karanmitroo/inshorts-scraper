The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday released their trade and transport sector manifesto for 2017 assembly polls in Punjab, promising measures to end liquor mafia in the state among other steps. The manifesto further promised to curb "goonda-tax" collection, and give a tax-holiday of 10 years to agro-based firms. Electricity tariff will also be substantially reduced, the manifesto added.
