BJP on Friday petitioned the Election Commission to stop Congress president Sonia Gandhi from airing her messages on Doordarshan and All India Radio. The party alleged that it is violative of the Model Code as it polarises the election scene among religious communities. It also alleged that this is also a violation of broadcast norms of Doordarshan/AIR.
