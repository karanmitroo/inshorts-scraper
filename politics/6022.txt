Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday asked BJP workers in Telangana to carry out a ‘Tiranga Yatra’ on bikes from August 15 to September 17 across the state. This comes after the workers demanded an official celebration of the ‘Hyderabad Liberation Day’ on September 17, when the erstwhile Hyderabad was merged with the Indian Union in 1948.
