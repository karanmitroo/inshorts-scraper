In response to the BJP's criticism of his government, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said the way JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar was "beaten up" in presence of the police, shows there is "jungle raj" in Delhi. Condemning the assault on Kumar in the Patiala House Court in Delhi, he accused the BJP of highlighting even "small incidents" in Bihar.
