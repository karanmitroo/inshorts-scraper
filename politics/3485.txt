Late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaaâ€™s niece Deepa Jayakumar has contested the doctors' claims that the former was regularly visited by family at hospital. Jayakumar said, "From the first day when I was standing in front of the hospital and I was asking permission to let me see her, I was denied."  Further, Jayakumar added she would definitely contest elections.
