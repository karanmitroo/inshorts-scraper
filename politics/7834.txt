National Conference (NC) chairperson Farooq Abdullah said on Sunday that the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly should be dissolved and fresh elections held if PDP and BJP fail to form a government. Further retracting his earlier comment of a possible alliance with BJP, he asserted that NC had only 15 MLAs in the Assembly and 14-15 people cannot form the government.
