BJP workers in Union Minister Jayant Sinha's constituency Hazaribagh forged his signature to dupe local unemployed youths into paying money for jobs in NTPC, police said on Sunday. The workers showed the letter as proof of their job recommendation and extorted money, police added. The fraud came to light when some youths personally met NTPC officials regarding their appointment letter.
