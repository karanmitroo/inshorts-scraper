Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday slammed the regional transport offices (RTOs) and said that it is the "most corrupt organisation in the country" and their loot surpasses the dacoits of Chambal. At the Jagran Forum, Gadkari added that Road Transport and Safety Bill is delayed as "RTO officials have provoked ministers in the states to oppose it".
