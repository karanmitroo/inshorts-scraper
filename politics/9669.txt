Amid sharp criticism of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi going on 'sabbatical' ahead of the key Budget Session of Parliament, party leader Jagdish Sharma has released Gandhi's photo claiming that he is in Uttarakhand. "I posted pictures of Rahulji to debunk the wrong reports that were doing the rounds about him being in Bangkok," Sharma said.
