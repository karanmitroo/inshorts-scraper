Punjab outgoing Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday submitted his resignation to state Governor VP Singh Badnore after his party Shiromani Akali Dal lost the election. "Whatever they (Congress) will do will come in front of you," he said. "As a responsible opposition we'll support all matters related to Punjab," said his son Sukhbir Singh Badal.
