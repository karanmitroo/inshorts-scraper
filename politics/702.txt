Addressing a rally in Gujarat's Nikol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday listed Congress leaders who had insulted him in the past. He mentioned Anand Sharma, who called him "mentally unstable", Digvijaya Singh, who called him "Ravana", and Jairam Ramesh, who compared him to 'Bhasmasur'. This comes after suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar referred to PM Modi as "neech".
