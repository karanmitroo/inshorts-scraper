The Madras High court on Monday declined to stay the suspension of 79 DMK MLAs from the Tamil Nadu Assembly. The court did not give any interim direction to allow the MLAs to attend the session. Initially, 80 MLAs were suspended, but the suspension of one MLA was revoked as he was not present in the Assembly on that day.
