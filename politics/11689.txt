Targeting BJP for treating LK Advani unfairly, Shiv sena president Uddhav Thackeray Saturday said, "Narendra Modi's era has begun, but that does not mean it is the end of the Advani era". He also alleged BJP of insulting Advani by keeping him waiting about his Lok Sabha seat. Uddhav's remarks come in the backdrop of rift between the two parties.
