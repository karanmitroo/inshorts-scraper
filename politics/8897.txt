Former Home Minister P Chidambaram has accused Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh of distorting UPA government's 'Hindu terror' comment. Chidambaram said that ex-Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde had questioned 'Hindu terror' (during the UPA regime) in a different context. Earlier, Rajnath had said the UPA government had “weakened” India’s fight against terror by coining the term 'Hindu terror.'
