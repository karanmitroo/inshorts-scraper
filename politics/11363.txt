Ahead of the next round of voting in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday, RSS and VHP workers are distributing hate pamphlets that urge - "Free India of three crore Muslim infiltrators from Bangladesh" and "Free Kashmir of traitors." The pamphlets do not carry a party name or symbol, but feature photographs of BJP leaders Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh.
