Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay on Friday accused CM Arvind Kejriwal of creating new controversies so that he could run away from his responsibilities again. "Kejriwal is... preparing to leave the Government on the pretext of constitutional crisis," Upadhyay alleged. He further said that Kejriwal's childish behaviour shows how immature he is to fulfil the promises made to the public.
