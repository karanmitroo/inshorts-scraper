A Hindu Mahasabha party leader, Navin Tyagi, sparked a controversy on Tuesday by demanding that actresses performing item numbers in films wearing "skimpy" outfits should be declared as prostitutes. His demand was condemned as "regressive" by political parties and the National Commission for Women. Tyagi also sought a ban on wearing of skirts and jeans by girl students in schools.
