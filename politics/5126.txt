Calling the situation in Jammu and Kashmir "explosive" in the wake of continuous cross-border firing, National Conference on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to celebrate Diwali with the "abandoned" people living along borders. "Diwali falls on Amavasya (new moon day)...let the Prime Minister light a lamp to end the darkness of borders," the party said.
