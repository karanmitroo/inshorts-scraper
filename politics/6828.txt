A criminal complaint was filed against AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday at Delhi's Karkardooma court over alleged offences of sedition for saying, "Even if somebody puts a knife at me, I'll not say 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'." The complainant sought an FIR against Owaisi and claimed his expressions showed 'disaffection, disloyalty, â€‹and... feeling of enmity' while giving the statement.
