Reacting to the controversy that erupted over Prashant Bhushan's tweet on Lord Krishna, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav on Sunday said that people in the BJP and RSS have never understood Indian culture and mythology. "They do not understand that Krishna of Mahabharata and Krishna of Raas Leela are the same," he added.
