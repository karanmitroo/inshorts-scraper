The 52-second-long Indian National Anthem was cut short by 20 seconds during Jayalalithaaâ€™s swearing-in ceremony in Chennai on Saturday. Altering the national anthem is against the constitutional rules, and it was done reportedly to make sure that the event began on the time considered auspicious by the AIADMK. The full version was however played at the end of the ceremony.
