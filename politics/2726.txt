Former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal has declined an offer of a free government accommodation made by the current CM Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government. Badal said he was thankful to Singh for the gesture while adding that he will make his own arrangements for stay. Badal's Shiromani Akali Dal in alliance with BJP could win only 18 seats in Punjab.
