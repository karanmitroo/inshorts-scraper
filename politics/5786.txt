Expelled AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP Sasikala Pushpa on Monday said that “there is no question” of her resignation from the Upper House. This comes in the light of Pushpa facing a sexual harassment case filed by two of her domestic aides, regarding which she has to appear before the Madras High Court. She was expelled from AIADMK earlier in August.
