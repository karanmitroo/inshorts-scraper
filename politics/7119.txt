West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday termed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as Bhayanak Jali Party. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) government stood for "Terror, Maut (Death) and Corruption". She further said that the PM's comments do not befit the office he holds and challenged him to arrest her.
