Retired school teacher, Jashodaben (62), who claims to have married Gujarat CM Narendra Modi at the age of 17 but parted ways in three years, has lost hopes of reunion with him. "I don't think he will ever call me," she said in an interview. However, she hopes that Modi will become the country's PM some day.
