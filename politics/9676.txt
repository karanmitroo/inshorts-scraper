The Congress party Wednesday protested against government's Land acquisition Bill by holding a 'Zameen Wapsi Andolan' at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar. The programme was attended by senior Congress leaders like Ahmed Patel, Jairam Ramesh and Raj Babbar. "Narendra Modi wants to gift farmers' land to the kind of people who buy his suit for Rs 4.5 crore," Raj Babbar said.
