Expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh was arrested on Friday in a joint operation between UP Police and Bihar Police from Buxar in Bihar. Singh's arrest came days after a Lucknow court issued a non-bailable warrant against him for comparing Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati to a prostitute. He made the remark while accusing Mayawati of selling party tickets for money.
