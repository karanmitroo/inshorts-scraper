Former J&K CM and president of National Conference Omar Abdullah has written a letter to J&K governor NN Vohra, extending support to PDP, the single largest party in the state with 28 seats. Earlier on Monday, NC had decided not to ally with the BJP for govt formation. Notably, Governor's rule was imposed in the state on Jan-9.
