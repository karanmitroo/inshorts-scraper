Reacting to the Ravindra Gaikwad-Air India controversy, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has said, "CMD ki kya aukat hai ki social media par ek saansad ka apmaan kar rahe ho?" Raut further said, "It is clearly visible in the clips that the MP was ill-treated. You're teaching us how to behave properly, first you learn how to do it yourself."
