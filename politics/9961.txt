The Congress on Thursday came out strongly against senior party leader Janardan Dwivedi for his pro-Modi remarks. "In no way is Narendra Modi a symbol of Indianness as we understand it," Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said. Hinting that an action will be taken against Dwivedi, Maken said, "Congress' Party leadership will discuss about the disciplinary action against him."
