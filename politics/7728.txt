Union Minister Jayant Sinha on Sunday said his father and former Finance minister Yashwant Sinha was misquoted by a PTI story on Saturday in which he had reportedly claimed that Modi government may meet Indira Gandhi's fate. Jayant added that his father already asked PTI to issue a clarification. Yashwant had earlier rued the lack of dialogue within the government.
