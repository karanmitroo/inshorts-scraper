Attacking the ruling BJP government over the black money issue, the Congress said on Wednesday that the Centre was not sincere about the matter. Party leader PC Chacko accused the BJP of making false promises of bringing back the black money within 100 days during the 2014 general elections. The government has not even acted in the direction, he alleged.
