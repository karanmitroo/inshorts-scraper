The Congress on Thursday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not being present in either house of the Parliament when GST Bill was taken up, debated, and passed on Wednesday. "This has happened for the first time in the past 66 years that the Prime Minister was missing when a constitutional amendment was being debated," Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said.
