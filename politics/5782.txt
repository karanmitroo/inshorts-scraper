The BJP-led Maharashtra government on Tuesday cancelled 94 tenders for irrigation projects worth ₹6,000 crore sanctioned by the previous NCP government allegedly without proper clearance. The BJP claimed that this was a part of a crackdown on corruption, while the NCP called it a conspiracy. The irrigation scam was uncovered in 2012 after mass irregularities were found in irrigation projects.
