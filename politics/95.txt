After the BJP secured a lead in the Tripura Assembly election on Saturday, PM Narendra Modi tweeted that the party's victory depicted a journey from 'shunya' to 'shikhar' (zero to peak). Stating that BJP's "historic victory" reflected democracy's triumph over brute force and intimidation, PM Modi said he "bowed" to every BJP member working in the state for years.
