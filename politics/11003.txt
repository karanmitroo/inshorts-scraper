Objecting to a recent Union Home Ministry order, emphasizing on the use of Hindi, DMK chief M Karunanidhi said, "The PM should focus on development rather than on promoting Hindi. No one can deny it's a beginning to impose Hindi against one's wish". The order said that government departments must use Hindi in their official accounts on social media.
