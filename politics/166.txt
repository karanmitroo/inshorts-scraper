Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan has revealed that he held a "secret meeting" with his contemporary Rajinikanth in a car to tell him about his decision of entering politics. Haasan added that they promised to maintain dignity if they ended up in opposite political camps. While Haasan launched his political party on Wednesday, Rajinikanth announced his entry into politics last year.
