Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Juhie Singh on Wednesday said that Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati sees Dalits only as her vote bank and thinks they will be with her forever. "Whenever Mayawati's reputation is affected, only then she talks about Dalit ideologies. Otherwise, what all torture Dalits have to go through, she does not care," Singh added.
