Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM), which contested on six seats and polled 1.2% of the total votes, has alleged tampering of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the Assembly elections. "Votes polled by our candidates are too less and unexpected. Such a low response to our candidates is not expected," GSM President Anand Shirodkar said. Earlier, Mayawati had raised doubts over EVMs.
