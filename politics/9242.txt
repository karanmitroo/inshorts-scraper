Ex-TRAI chief Pradip Baijal has alleged that former PM Manmohan Singh knew about the 2G scam and had even warned him of harm if he didn't cooperate on telecom licenses. Baijal, who is an accused in the 2G spectrum allocation scam case, has revealed this in his self-published book 'The Complete Story of Indian Reforms: 2G, Power and Private Enterprise'.
