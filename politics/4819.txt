Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung on Saturday said he has never had an altercation with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, adding that the latter has always been a "gentleman". "My personal rapport with him is very good...though we have disagreed violently on file," he added. He also revealed he once offered to send "parathas" to Kejriwal when the latter was on fast.
