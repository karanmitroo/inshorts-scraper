The Congress has approached the Election Commision after some Marathi channels on Sunday night re-telecasted PM Narendra Modi's Madison Square Garden speech. Calling it a violation of the code of conduct, the Congress said that since Modi spoke as the PM, the speech cannot be used as a campaign tool. The Congress also called it a case of paid news.
