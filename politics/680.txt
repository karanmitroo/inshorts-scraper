Karnataka Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy has claimed that some BJP leaders in the state were behaving like Islamic State terrorists. "These (BJP) leaders are trying to foment communal passion in the state by giving provocative statements," he added. Slamming Reddy's comments, the BJP said Karnataka has become a "hub for jihadi activities" due to such "mindsets".
