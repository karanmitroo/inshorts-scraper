The Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Saturday revoked the suspension of nine of the 19 Opposition members who were suspended for creating ruckus in the Lower House during the budget presentation several days ago. The MLAs had sung devotional songs, played cymbals and raised slogans. The budget copies were also burnt outside the House.
