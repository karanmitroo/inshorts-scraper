Senior Samajwadi Party leader and UP minister Azam Khan on Wednesday urged voters to avenge the murderers of Muzaffarnagar. Asking voters not to hand over the country's reins to a "murderer", Khan in a veiled reference to Narendra Modi said, "We don't have to allow a person with a blot to become the 'badshah' (king) of Hindustan."
