Seven personal-staffs of Mohammad Azam Khan (Urban Development Minister, UP) including his private secretaries wrote a letter to the Chief Secretary on Tuesday accusing the minister of using abusive language against them despite best efforts by them. "He should be removed from the ministry or employees should be transferred elsewhere. Officers are unwilling to work with him," sources told PTI.
