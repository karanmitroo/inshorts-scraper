Attacking both, Congress and Narendra Modi, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee Friday said: "They (Congress) have no guts... Had I been in Delhi in place of Congress, I would have sent Modi to jail by tying a rope around his waist." The statement by Mamata came after Modi reiterated his statement on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.
