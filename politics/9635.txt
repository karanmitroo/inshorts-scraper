The Congress Sunday slammed the release of extreme Hurriyat leader Masarat Alam and questioned PM Narendra Modi over the matter. "We strongly condemn the release of Masarat Alam," Congress leader Randip Surjewala said. "Prime Minister must answer as to why peaceful atmosphere of J&K is being sought to be disturbed by successive unilateral moves by PDP-BJP government," he added.
