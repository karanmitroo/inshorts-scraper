What L K Advani's rath yatra couldn't achieve in the 1990s, Narendra Modi's juggernaut has done in UP in 2014: a near-total decimation of the entire opposition with 71 out of 80 seats and 42% vote share for BJP. It's the maximum the party has ever got and in 2009 it has managed to get only 10 seats.
