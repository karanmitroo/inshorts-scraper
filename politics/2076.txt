The AAP government in Delhi on Saturday sacked Kapil Mishra as the Water Minister, days after he sided with senior party leader Kumar Vishwas, who has been vocal against the party. Following this, Mishra claimed he would "expose" certain AAP leaders' involvement in a scam. An official said Mishra was removed after he submitted several "inflated" bills.
