Taking a jibe at PM Narendra Modi for his remark on former PM Manmohan Singh, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said, "Our PM likes searching Google or peeping into otherâ€™s bathrooms".  A few days ago, Modi, in the Parliament, had said that people should learn from Dr Singh how to bathe in a bathroom wearing a raincoat.
