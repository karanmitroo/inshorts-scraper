Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said it has become fashionable to criticise anything Hindu, Indian or Bharatiya in India. He made the statement while supporting the World Culture Festival organised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Naidu said, "...it is a prestige for the country... to politicise and try to ban the programme is not good for the country."
