Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) chief Pravin Togadia on Thursday said there cannot be anything in the name of Babar in India because he was a "foreigner" and an "invader". On the out-of-court settlement in Ram Temple case, Togadia said that during the Chandrashekhar government in 1991, the other party to the dispute had rejected the offer of talks.
