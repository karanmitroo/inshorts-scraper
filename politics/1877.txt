CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury was manhandled on Wednesday at a press conference by Hindu Sena activists in protest against a newspaper article written by CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat that criticised Major Leetul Gogoi's actions in Kashmir. After the incident, Yechury took to Twitter and said, "We'll not be cowed down by any attempts of Sangh's goondagardi to silence us."
