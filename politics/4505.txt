The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the unconditional apology tendered by Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan in connection with his statements on the Bulandshahr gang-rape case. The Samajwadi Party leader had earlier told the court he was ready to apologise unconditionally. Notably, Khan had described the gang rape of two women near Bulandshahr in July as "political conspiracy".
