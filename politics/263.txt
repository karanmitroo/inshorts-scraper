Congress President Rahul Gandhi's convoy was stopped and shown black flags by a group of people on his arrival at Karnataka's Sindhanur on Sunday. The mob also threw the flags at the convoy when security personnel attempted to clear the area. Gandhi is currently on a four-day visit to poll-bound Karnataka.
