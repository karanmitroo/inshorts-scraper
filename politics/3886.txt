BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh on Monday said Behenji (BSP supremo Mayawati) was nervous as she was rattled by the success of PM Modi's demonetisation move. Opposition leaders fought elections and relied on the black money they generated while in power, he added. Mayawati on Sunday said that only BSP can stop BJP from coming to power in Uttar Pradesh.
