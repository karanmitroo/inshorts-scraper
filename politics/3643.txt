Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday said he was not "worth of being a compounder, but ended up being the Union Health Minister". Talking about his biography 'Anything But Khamosh', Sinha claimed it was the most honest and transparent book on someone's life. There is no sensation, no disrespect to any woman, but everything is there, Sinha added.
