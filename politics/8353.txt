RJD chief and former Bihar CM Lalu Prasad on Monday said that the dignity of the PM's post has hit an all-time low during PM Narendra Modi's tenure. "Modi himself does not believe he is the PM of this country, otherwise he would not have brought down the level of his speeches to such a low level," Lalu added.
