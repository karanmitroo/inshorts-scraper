Gujarat CM Narendra Modi skipped a meeting of the National Integration Council (NIC) called by PM Manmohan Singh. Convened in the backdrop of the Muzaffarnagar communal clashes, which killed nearly 50, the 148-member NIC was planned to discuss, among others issues, safety and security of women and measures to promote communal harmony. Chhatisgarh CM Raman Singh also remained absent.
