Addressing a rare press conference, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said - "Hum bilkul finishing line par hai. We are going to pass this bill. This bill is needed. This bill will help India." Rahul also appealed to holdouts like Samajwadi Party to put aside "little differences" so that the bill could be passed in this session of parliament.
