Shiromani Akali Dal President and former Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal has likened Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu to a monkey for calling Anandpur Sahib's Virasat-e-Khalsa museum a "white elephant". Stating that â‚¹12 crore was spent on maintaining the museum, Sidhu had said it was not self-sufficient. The museum was built during the Badal family-led SAD-BJP regime.
