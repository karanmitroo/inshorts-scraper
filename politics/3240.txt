Following Tamil Nadu CM E Palanisamy's victory in the floor-test on Saturday, his predecessor O Panneeselvam said the people of the state had been betrayed by the MLAs. "Once we go back to our constituencies we will get to know the truth...Amma's rule will be established," he said. This comes after 122 MLAs voted for Palanisamy during the trust vote.
