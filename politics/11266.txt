TMC chief Mamata Banerjee Saturday ruled out any alliance with the BJP saying, “We care for people irrespective of their religion, caste or creed. We will never, ever have an alliance with the BJP.” This statement from Banerjee comes just a day after BJP president Rajnath Singh promised big package for West Bengal if NDA comes to power.
