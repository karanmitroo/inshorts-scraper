Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has reportedly sought a clarification from state law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar over reports that his law degree was fake. After a Bihar-based university Monday informed the Delhi HC that it doesn't have any records of Tomar's degree, Congress had asked Kejriwal to immediately dismiss him. "My degree is 100% genuine," Tomar claimed Monday.
