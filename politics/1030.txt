Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Tuesday said that she will convert her religion from Hinduism, like Dalit leader BR Ambedkar, if the ruling BJP did not change its mindset towards Dalits, tribals and backward classes. Referring to the ongoing Ayodhya dispute, she said a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will serve no purpose towards the emancipation of Dalits and downtrodden.
