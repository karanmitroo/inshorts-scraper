Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress-led UPA regime of pressurising banks into giving loans worth thousands of crores to select industrialists in a scam bigger than 2G and coal scams. Adding that bad loans were a "liability" handed over by "economists" in the previous regime, he said his government was trying to solve problems of the poor.
