J&K CM Omar Abdullah said his party cannot support any party that was against Article 370, and accused the BJP for being vague on this issue. He said that PM Modi should clarify the party's stand on this critical subject during his visit to Kishtwar next week. He also said that the "Modi Factor" will be weakened in the Valley.
