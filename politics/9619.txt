PM Narendra Modi Tuesday criticized J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's statement giving credit to Pakistan, Hurriyat and militants for smooth conduct of Assembly polls. "If somebody makes such a statement, we can never support it," Modi said. The government "will move ahead with 'zero tolerance' towards terrorism" and "all resolutions passed here (in Parliament) will be implemented...", Modi added.
