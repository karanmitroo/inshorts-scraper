BJP leader Vinay Katiyar has called Tamil actor Kamal Haasan "mentally unstable" and demanded an apology for his column titled 'One cannot say there is no Hindu terror anymore'. Hindus are losing faith in 'Satyameva jayate' and are subscribing to 'might is right', Haasan had said. This comes ahead of the actor's reported entry into politics, on his 63rd birthday.
