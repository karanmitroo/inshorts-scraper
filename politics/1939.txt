Actress Swara Bhasker slammed actor and BJP MP Paresh Rawal for his tweet on author Arundhati Roy, stating, "As a Parliamentarian he openly threatened a woman and called for a brutal act of violence against her." Paresh took shamelessness and irresponsibility to another level, she added. Paresh earlier tweeted Arundhati should be tied to Army jeep instead of stone pelter.
