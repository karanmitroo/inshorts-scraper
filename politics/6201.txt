Ahead of the floor test scheduled later on Saturday, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki has resigned as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP). He has been replaced by Pema Khandu, who was unanimously elected by the party. This comes after the Supreme Court on July 13 reinstated the Nabam Tuki-led Congress government in the state.
