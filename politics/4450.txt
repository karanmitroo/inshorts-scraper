Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday asserted that the SAD-BJP alliance, if re-elected, would work on ensuring free pilgrimage of Sikhs to Nankana Sahib in Pakistan. Badal also urged people to follow the philosophy of Guru Gobind Singh for the overall well-being of the mankind. Notably, Nankana Sahib became a part of Pakistan after the partition of India.
