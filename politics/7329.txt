BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav on Friday said he "cannot say" if a new government will be formed in Jammu and Kashmir as the stalemate with the PDP still existed. He added that no new PDP demands were acceptable. The state has been under Governor's rule since January, after PDP's Mehbooba Mufti refused to take over from her deceased father.
