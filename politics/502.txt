The nomination of Narayan Dass Gupta, one of AAP's three Rajya Sabha candidates, has been put on hold till Monday by the Returning Officer. This comes after the Congress filed an objection against him, alleging Gupta held an office of profit. The AAP dismissed the charge, saying the Congress was trying to gain ‘cheap publicity’.
