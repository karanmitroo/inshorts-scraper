BJP National Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh on Friday said West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has shown her lowest of the low by dragging the Indian Army into politics. Singh added, "It's very unfortunate, the kind of politics Mamata Banerjee has been doing after demonetisation. BJP is of the opinion that the issue of army deployment in Bengal has been politicised."
