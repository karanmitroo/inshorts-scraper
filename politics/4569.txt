The Shiv Sena on Saturday urged the Centre to deal with Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) issue in the same manner as former PM Indira Gandhi had dealt with the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. "We are not going to get any international help on this matterâ€¦India should interfere directly in PoK, the way Indira Gandhi did with Bangladesh," said the party.
