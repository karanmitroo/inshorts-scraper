Over 500 AAP workers launched a protest outside Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani’s residence on Thursday. Protesters demanded her resignation and immediate arrest for allegedly providing misleading information regarding her educational qualifications to the Election Commission. AAP workers argued for action against Irani to be at par with ex-Delhi Law Minister Jitender Tomar’s.
