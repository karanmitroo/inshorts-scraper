Bihar art, culture and youth affairs minister Vinay Bihari believes that mobile phones and non-vegetarian food encourage rape. "Many students misuse mobile phones by watching blue films and hearing obscene songs which pollute their mind," he explained, recommending their ban in schools. Non-vegetarian food, he feels, contributes to hot-temper, whereas pure vegetarian food keeps the body and mind pure.
