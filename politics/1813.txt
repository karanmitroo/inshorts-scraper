National Commission for Minorities Chairman Gairul Hasan Rizvi has said those who celebrated Pakistan's win should go there. "Some people in India reportedly likened Pakistan’s victory to Eid before Eid... Those who feel happy about Pakistan's victory should go and live there or they can be sent packing for their hearts lie in that country,” said Rizvi.
