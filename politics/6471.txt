A Congress delegation on Thursday met the Chief Election Commissioner, asking him to recommend "immediate disqualification" of 21 AAP MLAs to the President. Led by Congress leader Ajay Maken, the delegation alleged that the MLAs held "office of profit" by working as Parliamentary secretaries to the state government ministers. Maken said it would be "unethical" to let them continue.
