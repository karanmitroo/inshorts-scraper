Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said that Congress VP Rahul Gandhi must apologise to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj for calling her a 'criminal'. He added that if Gandhi failed to do so, he would have to face a criminal defamation suit. Gandhi had made the remark against Swaraj for helping scam-tainted Lalit Modi procure the UK travel documents.
