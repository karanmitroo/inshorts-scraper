Kerala's newly appointed BJP chief K Rajasekharan on Saturday said that temples in Kerala should be free from government control just like mosques and churches across the state. Around 1,300 temples are under three state-controlled Devosom board, he said. He also requested the government to recover the 25,000 acres of temple land that was encroached upon in the state.
