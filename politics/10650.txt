Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Friday slapped a legal notice on Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh for dragging his name into the Bunglow eviction row. Sinha has demanded an unconditional apology from Ajit within 15 days. Ajit had claimed that the central government is targeting him but spared its own leaders, including Yashwant Sinha, who occupies an official bunglow in Lutyens' Delhi.
