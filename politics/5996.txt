TMC leader Mukul Roy on Monday predicted that CPI(M) will become irrelevant in the Indian political context by 2017. "Under the leadership of Sitaram Yechuri, Surjya Kanta Mishra... the CPI(M) will collapse... there shall be no party called CPI-M in India,‚Äù he said. Roy further alleged that CPI(M) has "totally quashed democracy" in Tripura with single party rule.
