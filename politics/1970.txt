Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra pointed to former AAP member Neil Terrance Haslam as the one who conducted investigations into the alleged party donations scam. Haslam, a self-proclaimed anti-corruption activist, had levelled several allegations of corruption in AAP in the past. After being sacked from the party, Haslam had posted on his Facebook handle that he was a BJP member.
