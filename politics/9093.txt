Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Friday reacted strongly to reports that claimed he had delayed an Air India flight to the US as he was waiting for his delegation. Fadnavis took to Twitter and said he would file a defamation case for putting him in a bad light. Two people claiming to be his co-passengers backed his statement on Twitter.
