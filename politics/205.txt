Addressing a gathering in poll-bound Karnataka, PM Narendra Modi on Monday questioned if the people need a government which asked for 10% of commission to do work or a government with a mission of development. Adding that the state requires "speedy governance", PM Modi said the state's downfall is guaranteed if the Congress government continued in the state.
