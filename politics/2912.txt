BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that the massive mandate which the people of Uttar Pradesh have given to BJP indicates that voters have rejected the politics of Muslims' appeasement. "BJP's campaign was full of positivity but those by the SP-Congress alliance and BSP focused on Muslims' appeasement," he alleged.
