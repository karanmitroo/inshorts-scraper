Following complaints by BJPâ€™s candidate Smriti Irani, the Election Commission on Wednesday ordered Preeti Sahay - Priyanka Gandhi's secretary - to leave Amethi. Irani and Priyanka's secretary had entered in a verbal duel, as the former objected to her presence at one of the booths in Jagdishpur area. The district magistrate of Amethi informed that Sahay has agreed to leave.
