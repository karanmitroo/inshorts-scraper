Lambasting PM Modi for "blowing his own trumpet", BSP Leader Mayawati said that he had not taken any concrete steps for the poor while visiting his constituency, Varanasi. She said that "populist promises" alone, were an inadequate measure. She also claimed that the Rs. 2375 crore package promised to weavers of Varanasi, will not benefit them directly.
