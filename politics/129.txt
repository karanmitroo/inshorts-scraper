Kerala's CPI (M) government has withdrawn a case against six Left MLAs for vandalising the state Assembly in 2015. The legislators had damaged property, disrupted Assembly proceedings as then Finance Minister KM Mani, accused in a scam, presented the budget. The opposition parties have slammed the withdrawal, arguing that the incident had caused a lot of shame for the state.
