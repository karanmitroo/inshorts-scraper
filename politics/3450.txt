Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said attacks on him, or the Centre or the BJP are understandable, but he questioned why was the RBI Governor dragged into politics. Further, Modi said that everyone should respect the sanctity and honour of an institution like the Reserve Bank of India. "We should keep the RBI out of controversies," he added.
