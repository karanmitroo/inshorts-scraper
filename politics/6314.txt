Feeling "humiliated" after the cancellation of the Samajwadi Party-Quami Ekta Dal merger, QED leader Afzal Ansari on Tuesday blamed Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav for calling it off because of his "ego" and for his own "branding". Announcing the decision to contest 44 seats in the 2017 Assembly polls, Ansari said the QED would show SP its "real place".
