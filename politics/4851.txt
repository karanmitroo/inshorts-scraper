Blaming the BJP-SAD government for the attack on his vehicle, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday claimed that it was an attempt by the Badals to scare him away from Punjab. "They can never break my resolve to work for the welfare of Punjab...I have come here to sacrifice my life for the sake...of Punjab," he asserted.
