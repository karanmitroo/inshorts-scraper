The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Aadhaar Bill rejecting the amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha. The bill had earlier been returned by the Rajya Sabha with several amendments including that it be kept voluntary. The opposition had also objected to the bill being treated as a money bill. The House was then adjourned till April 25.
