BJP Uttar Pradesh unit President Laxmikant Bajpai on Saturday blamed the Samajwadi Party (SP) government for the riot in the Varanasi prison. "It is not possible without the nexus between prison officials, district administration, and the state government," Bajpai alleged. Earlier in the day, a major riot broke out at Varanasi District Jail between the inmates and police forces.
