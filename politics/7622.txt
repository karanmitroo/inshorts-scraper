Kerala police on Wednesday arrested six CPI(M) activists for the murder of a 27-year-old RSS worker on Monday in poll-bound Kannur district. A gang of 20 CPI(M) workers had reportedly barged into the victim's house and hacked him to death in front of his parents. Kannur earlier witnessed bombs being hurled on an RSS centre and a BJP worker's house.
