Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday denied any rift with Kumar Vishwas and said the AAP leader was like his younger brother. Kejriwal added that some people were trying to show that there is a rift between the two but nobody could separate them. This comes after AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan alleged that Kumar was conspiring to break the party.
