A day after Punjab’s Maur Mandi was rocked by a bomb blast, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday demanded probe against Punjab’s Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, saying, he should be arrested immediately for peaceful elections. "He’ll cause more violence…Sukhbir Badal is a hardened criminal who will go to any extent to ruin Punjab in its peace," Kejriwal tweeted.
