Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh on Friday said the nation must strive to achieve the target of spending 6% of the GDP on education through public funding. He emphasised on the need to reduce the gap in the quality of education between "haves and have-nots" by imparting "universally accepted secular education" and improving infrastructure in government schools.
