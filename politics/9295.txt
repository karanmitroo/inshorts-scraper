Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday targetted Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal over his recent tussle with Lt Governor Najeeb Jung, saying people of the national capital experimented with AAP but it turned out to be 'very costly'. "...governance isn't their political agenda... People want governance and not controversy," Jaitley said. "...it seems coming days may be painful," he added.
