Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the nation would oppose the Congress if it obstructs the passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill. “If the Congress opposes this bill... every citizen and every businessman will oppose Congress. Congress is against development of the nation, and they have established it by issuing a dissent note,” Jaitley said.
