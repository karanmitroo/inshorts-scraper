Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi on Tuesday said the Election Commission will keep an eye on the role of police in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections slated next year, besides focusing on the use of money and muscle power. The EC has directed that the charge of police stations should be given to inspector-level officers and not sub-inspectors, Zaidi added.
