Ahead of Rahul Gandhi's visit on October-17 to meet the victims of Sunday's stampede at Ratangarh temple, the Datia district hospital went through an express makeover. The victims who previously occupied floors were given beds with fresh sheets and blankets. A senior police-officer and district-collector are also reported to have made several rounds at the hospital to check security arrangements.
