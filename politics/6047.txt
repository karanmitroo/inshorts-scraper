Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra on Wednesday said, "Let them (women) kill those who try to rape them, let them kill their rapists." Calling for giving arms and arms training to all females, Mishra added, "Treat rapist as terrorist â€“ death penalty must, no age bar should be there." He further suggested that rapists should be killed 'publicly'.
