Alleging discrimination against the opposition parties in media coverage by Rajya Sabha TV, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said, "This is Rajya Sabha TV, do not make it BJP TV." Adding that all the political parties should be given proper coverage, Azad said the first 5 minutes of TMC MP Derek O'Brien's speech was edited by the public broadcaster.
