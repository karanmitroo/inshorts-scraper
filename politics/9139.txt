The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Tuesday slammed the NDA government's move to push for yoga, saying it's a violation of the secular Constitution, which does not allow the promotion of religious activities by the government. In a letter, the Board warned all Muslim institutions against the rising Hindutva forces and accused these forces for attacking Islamic beliefs.
