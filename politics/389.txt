Speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, "Hindutva is like Hindu wahhabism," adding that it was high time the "better Hindus" took back Hinduism. He further said earlier generations of Hindus believed in practising their faith in private, whereas now a space has been created where advertising Hindutva is the only way of being a Hindu.
