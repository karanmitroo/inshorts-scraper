Protesting against the delay in construction of a road in west Champaran, BJP MLA Vinay Bihari on Monday arrived in shorts and vest in Bihar Assembly. However, he was denied entry by the security personnel. Earlier, Bihari had reportedly sent his kurta (shirt) to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and his pyjama (lower) to CM Nitish Kumar in protest.
