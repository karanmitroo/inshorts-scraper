The Congress on Sunday demanded a probe into the auction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's suit, which raised Rs 4.31 crore. Senior Congress leader and Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel said that since Modi had questioned the auction of paintings made by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee during the election campaign, he too is answerable now.
