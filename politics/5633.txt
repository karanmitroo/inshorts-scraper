In 1997, when the United Front government wanted him to become the Prime Minister, TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu declined the offer on the advice of his son, he said on Saturday. "My son told me the Prime Minister's post is temporary but the Chief Minister post is permanent," Naidu added. He had served as the convener of the United Front.
