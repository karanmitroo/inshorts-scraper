RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat Monday accused Mother Teresa of converting the poor to Christianity. "Mother Teresa's service... used to have one objective, to convert the person, who was being served, into a Christian," he said. "The question is not about conversion but if this (conversion) is done in the name of service, then that service gets devalued," Bhagwat added.
