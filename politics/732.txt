The Election Commission on Tuesday rejected actor Vishal's nomination for the RK Nagar bypolls, hours after accepting his nomination. The commission, which initially rejected Vishal's nomination, changed its decision after the actor sat on a dharna. The actor seeks to contest elections for the RK Nagar seat that has remained vacant since CM J Jayalalithaa passed away last year.
