Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has dismissed Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's statement and has said that the move to join the BJP was not pre-planned. "Now Gandhi scion predicts things before it actually happens," he said. Kumar's statement comes after Gandhi said that Nitish had planned to break the Grand Alliance and join the BJP 3-4 months ago.
