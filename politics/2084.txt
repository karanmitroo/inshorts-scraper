BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said, "When I speak of Mughals' atrocities or Saudis demolishing mosques, Muslims say they have nothing to do with them. Then why cling to Babri Masjid." "When it suits them, they will say this is our Islam, Shariyat and only clerics in Saudi Arabia can change this," he added.
