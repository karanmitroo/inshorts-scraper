The BJP on Wednesday decided to field Chandra Bose, the grandnephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, against CM Mamata Banerjee in the West Bengal assembly elections. "The time has come to bring about a change in West Bengal which will be brought by BJP. This is not my fight. This is the fight for development in West Bengal," Bose said.
