Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi on Tuesday alleged that Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav had taken gifts from a liquor manufacturer and loans that were later written off. He claimed it was done to allow the manufacturer to set up a liquor factory in 2003-2004. The RJD has termed the accusation as Modi's agenda to tarnish Lalu Yadav's image.
