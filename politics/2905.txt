Textiles Minister Smriti Irani has called Priyanka Gandhi a "paper tiger". Speaking post BJP's lead in the UP assembly elections, Irani said, "The fact that there was a resounding support for Modi's leadership in the Gandhi bastion (Amethi) tells you how redundant they are for their own political organisation and electorate." BJP are leading in four of five Amethi seats.
