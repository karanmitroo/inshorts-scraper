Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal on Monday said the AAP is following the Congress party by adopting an "anti-Punjab" and "anti-Sikh" stance. Badal claimed that the AAP has hurt Sikhs' sentiments by superimposing their election symbol 'broom' on Golden Temple in their youth manifesto. Further, he cautioned that the AAP, if voted to power, would "ruin" Punjab like the Congress.
