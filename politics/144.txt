Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday said PM Narendra Modi was the world's costliest 'chowkidar' (watchman) and questioned why bank frauds were happening under his "vigil". Stating that PM Modi has promised to bring absconding fraudsters back to India, Sibal said, "The question is why you allowed them to flee when you are a chowkidar?"
