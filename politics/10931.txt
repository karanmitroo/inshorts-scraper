Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh on Monday admitted that there were some members who were "disappointed" with Rahul Gandhi's leadership, but this was not the general mood within the party. Singh, who last week said that the Congress vice-president does not have a temperament conducive to the ruling benches, clarified that his remarks had been misinterpreted.
