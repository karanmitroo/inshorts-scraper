Union Minister Radha Mohan Singh's helicopter trip in Maharashtra used 10,000 litres of water to prepare a makeshift helipad, BJP worker Dayanand Nene alleged. Nene later wrote to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to stop such "colossal wastage" of water. Earlier, Maharashtra minister Eknath Khadse and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav were also accused of water wastage.
