RSS has reportedly asked the BJP not to declare a CM candidate in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections as Lalu Yadav's RJD and Nitish Kumar's JD (U) have formed an alliance and the caste factor is in their favour. Projecting an OBC face may prove to be counterproductive and erode the BJP's upper caste support base, the report added.
