Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday said, "In today's time of economic liberalisation, if reservation is not provided in private sector, then it would be playing a joke with the concept of social justice." He also advocated increasing the reservation in jobs beyond the Supreme Court ordered ceiling of 50%, due to the increased population of Scheduled Castes.
