The CPI(M) has opposed the idea of bringing political parties under the ambit of the RTI, stating such a move would give an opportunity to the government to “snoop and spy” and harass them. “If my politburo is meeting and somebody puts an RTI (asking) who said what… what business is it anybody else's,” said CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat.
