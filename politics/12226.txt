Rahul Gandhi on Sunday made an unannounced visit to the riot-hit areas of Muzaffarnagar, to meet the affected people from both the Muslim and Hindu communities. While returning from Shamli relief camp, Gandhi was shown black flags by protestors believed to be from the Muslim community, who were reportedly unhappy that nothing much is being done for their relief.
