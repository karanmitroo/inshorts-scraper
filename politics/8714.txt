West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that her government will declassify all the files and documents related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose next Friday. “We want to maintain transparency and accountability. People must know about Netaji,” Banerjee said. These documents belong to West Bengal government and not the ones which are held by the Central government.
