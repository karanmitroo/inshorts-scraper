Wishing Prime Minister Narendra Modi a 'Happy Holi', Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Sunday said he would like to tell him to play Holi with colours and not murder democracy. Further accusing the BJP, he said, "They first broke the leg of a horse, and now, they are trying to break the leg of Uttarakhand through horse trading."
