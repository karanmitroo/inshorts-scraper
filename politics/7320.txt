The Shiv Sena on Friday demanded permanent suspension of AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan from the Maharashtra Assembly for refusing to chant "Bharat Mata ki Jai". In party mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Sena said that Pathan was let off with a "soft" punishment. "Time has come for Muslims to decide if they will support Javed Akhtar or Asaduddin Owaisi," the editorial said.
