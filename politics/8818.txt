Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde has got embroiled in a controversy after news channels showed a man carrying her slippers during her recent tour of drought-affected regions in the state. Congress has criticised Munde, saying it showed her "high-handed attitude". The BJP MLA has, however, defended herself saying that the man was her private employee and not a government servant.
