Referring to the Dadri lynching case, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday, “We need to rise above these kinds of incidents because they don't give a good name as far as the country is concerned.” The incident, wherein a man was lynched over alleged beef consumption, comes at a time when the government is trying to secure foreign investments.
