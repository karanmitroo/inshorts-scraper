Taking a jibe at BJP's crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said, "cow is mummy in UP but yummy in Northeast". His remark came after Nagaland's BJP leader Visasolie Lhoungu said, "Ban on cow slaughter like the one in UP won't take effect in Nagaland if our party comes to power next year."
