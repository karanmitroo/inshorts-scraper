Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Saturday announced 70 candidates for the upcoming elections in Kerala. A day earlier, party chief Mamata Banerjee said she will visit the state to expose the "unholy" alliance between the Congress and CPI(M) in West Bengal. However, TMC's Kerala state President said they would not be able to win a seat in Kerala, in these elections.
