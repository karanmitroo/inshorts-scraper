Samajwadi Party leader Gaurav Bhatia on Thursday said the inclusion of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari into Bahujan Samaj Party exposes the mentality of the Mayawati-led party. The 4-time MLA Mukhtar Ansari, who is currently lodged in Lucknow jail, will contest the UP elections from Mau Sadar on a BSP ticket. Ansari is the prime accused in politician Krishnanand Rai's murder case.
