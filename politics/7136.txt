Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday termed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pakistani JIT visit as "political short-sightedness". "Despite grave problems with [the] PM, it is absurd for AK (Arvind Kejriwal) to call him an ISI/Pak agent," he said. Notably, Kejriwal had earlier criticised PM Modi for allowing the JIT to visit India.
