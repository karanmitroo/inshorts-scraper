Ex Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan risks disqualification as an MLA after the Election Commission asked him to appear before it for allegedly giving incorrect accounts of his poll expenses during the 2009 state assembly elections. Should he be disqualified, he may face similar action in the event of his being elected as an MP from Nanded in this election.
