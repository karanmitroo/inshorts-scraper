The VHP Friday said it was ready to "facilitate" conversions in Goa if the local people wanted it. "If they want to come (back to Hinduism) how can we stop them?" , said Dada Vedak, VHP's convenor for Goa and Maharashtra. VHP would not use force, but reconvert the people with "mamata (compassion), samata (equality) and prem (love)", he added.
