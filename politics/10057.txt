Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Praveen Togadia Wednesday said that a law for having only two children should be framed. "Population of minorities is continuously increasing, but when the issue is raised, a controversy is started," he said. "Hindus had faced conversion and nobody else could understand the pain," Togadia added.
