Congress candidate Ajay Rai on Monday prompted Election Commission to launch an inquiry against him after he went to vote wearing his election symbol on his kurta. Flashing of election symbol at the booth is violation of Sec-130 of Representation of Peoples Act. Rai defended his action saying that he has the right to wear the symbol as a candidate.
