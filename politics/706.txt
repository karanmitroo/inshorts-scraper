Slamming the Congress for criticising the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar has said that some people think purchasing fighter aircraft is on par with purchasing tur dal and moong dal (pulses). "A fighter aircraft is not only (an) aircraft. (The) aircraft is probably smaller part of the total cost. Real cost comes in special equipment," he added.
