Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said, "RSS and BJP want Odd-Even to fail but Delhi will fail BJP yet again." Kejriwal referred to BJP leader Vijay Goelâ€™s assertion that he will violate the rule as a mark of protest against the scheme. This comes after a section of auto and taxi unions threatened to strike on Monday.
