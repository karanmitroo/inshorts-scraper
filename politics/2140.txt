Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar on Monday announced that the party would contest the upcoming state local body elections alone. The decision has been taken after discussions with state party leaders and local workers, he added. Notably, Congress was defeated in the recent Assembly polls in the state where it fought in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party.
