After PM Narendra Modi claimed that Indira Gandhi didn't implement demonetisation despite recommendation, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, "Modi isn't aware of India's history." "For the PM to say that Congress is bigger than the country proves that he isn't aware of the history of India. His party's people were against Congress which was fighting the freedom war," Sibal added.
