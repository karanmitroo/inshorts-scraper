Congress leader Randeep Surjewala on Wednesday termed BJP MP Kirti Azad's suspension from the party as a "manifestation of corruption-philia that has gripped BJP". Surjewala described PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah's style of functioning as ‘my way or the highway’. Meanwhile, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal tweeted there is no democracy within BJP as honest voices are muzzled.
