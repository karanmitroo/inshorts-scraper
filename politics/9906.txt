The AAP and Congress attacked the government, Monday over BJP's Delhi CM candidate Kiran Bedi being seated in the VVIP section during the Republic Day celebrations. The Congress called it "brazen and cynical misuse of power" as former ministers and opposition members were seated behind. The AAP called it a "partisan Republic Day", threatening to complain to the EC.
