BSP President Mayawati on Monday slammed the Centre for the rising "intolerance, communalism and anarchy" and said ministers who make "crude" remarks should be in jail and not in Parliament. Referring to Minister VK Singh for his 'dog remark' after the death of two dalit kids, she accused PM Modi of remaining silent when his own ministers made "provocative" statements.
