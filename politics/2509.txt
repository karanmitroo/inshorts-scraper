Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan on Tuesday apologised for his tweet on Lord Krishna, stating his "tweet was inappropriately phrased and has unintentionally hurt sentiments of many people". While slamming the anti-Romeo squad in UP, Bhushan had earlier tweeted that Lord Krishna was a "legendary eve teaser". Later, BJP had filed an FIR against him.
