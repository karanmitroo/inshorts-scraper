Pinarayi Vijayan will reportedly be the next CM of Kerala after the CPM Secretariat and party's Kerala Committee on Friday nominated him in the presence of General Secretary Sitaram Yechury. He was chosen over former Chief Minister VS Achuthanandan. "The party had decided to pick Vijayan as legislature party leader considering Achuthanandanâ€™s advanced age and poor health", said Yechury.
