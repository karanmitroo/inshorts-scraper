BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday said that welfare schemes benefiting the poor and needy would be instituted using black money brought back to India from abroad. Shah said, "Modi-ji had said that the entire black money stashed abroad came to â‚¹15 lakh per person, but that does not mean that this amount will be deposited into each person's account."
