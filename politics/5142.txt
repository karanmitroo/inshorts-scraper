UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said the surgical strikes were carried out earlier as well but BJP is misleading the country over the matter. He also termed the BJP members as “hoshiyar, chamatkari and chalu”. Yadav questioned what BJP had done in over two years and claimed that even the land for AIIMS was provided by the UP government.
