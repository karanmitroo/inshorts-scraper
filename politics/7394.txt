The Congress on Friday accused the Centre of raising rail fares through the "backdoor,'' claiming the Railway Budget "sick". Congress' Ahmed Patel said, "You now have premium Tatkal and Tatkal. Why are you using a back door... Why don't you increase price through the budget itself?" He further said the Railways was driven by loans and needed "major surgery".
