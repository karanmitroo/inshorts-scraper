Targetting PM Narendra Modi-led BJP government, Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece Saamana said Tuesday that he should clean the filthy mouths of his party MPs just the way he cleans the streets. Further, Sena sarcastically slammed BJP MP Dilip Gandhi for his 'tobacco improves digestion' remarks saying, "He should be given Nobel prize for his remark."
