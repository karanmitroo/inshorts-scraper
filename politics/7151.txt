Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani on Saturday said that everybody has the right to say 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'. "Chanting ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ is a matter of emotion. Every human being has the right to chant for the motherland," she said. Her statement came a day after a fatwa was issued stating that Muslims should not chant the slogan.
