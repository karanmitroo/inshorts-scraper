After Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) Chief Hafiz Saeed threatened that Pakistan would show India what surgical strikes are, Congress spokesperson Meem Afzal said that if this happens, Pakistan should also be ready for our reply. Terming the recent strikes from India as 'befitting reply', Afzal added, "The statement of Hafiz Saeed in itself depicts that he is involved with the Pakistan Government."
