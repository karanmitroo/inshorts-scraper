Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked party workers to not use derogatory words against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing a rally in Gujarat's Dakor, Gandhi said that Congress workers should always use decent words and oust him from power. He had earlier criticised suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar's "neech aadmi" remark targetting PM Modi.
