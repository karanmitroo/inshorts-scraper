Congress leaders on Monday hoisted the national flag at the RSS office in Indore. After the Congress declared it would "storm the RSS office carrying the Tricolour", RSS cadres welcomed the Congress workers, and leaders from the RSS and Congress then hoisted the Tricolour together. However, the BJP dismissed the event as a "political stunt".
