AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi said both UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and former Gujarat CM Narendra Modi failed to stop riots in their states. "Riots happened in Muzaffarnagar but the CM failed to provide justice to victims. How does it make him any different from Modi?" he asked. "Akhilesh is grabbing Muslim votes by scaring them with BJP's name," he added.
