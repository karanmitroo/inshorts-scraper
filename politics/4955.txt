Tripura Governor Tathagata Roy has said that although he is a Hindu, he personally considers Sikhism to be the nearest thing to the perfect religion. “Sikhs don't mess with others' religions, but if others mess they'll be taught a lesson for 14 generations to remember,” he tweeted. Roy also shared a video on Twitter about Sikhism.
