Ten MLAs of the ruling Naga People's Front have resigned from the Nagaland Assembly as well as the party. This comes amidst growing calls to defer Assembly elections scheduled for February 27 until the Naga insurgency issue is resolved. This comes after political parties across Nagaland issued a joint declaration to not contest elections until the issue is resolved.
