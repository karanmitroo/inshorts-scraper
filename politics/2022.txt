Newly elected BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Wednesday requested Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal that the cost incurred on the Assembly's special session be recovered from the AAP. Sirsa stated that the one-day session for demonstrating EVM 'tampering' was nothing more than a "blatant misuse of a constitutional institution" by the ruling party.
