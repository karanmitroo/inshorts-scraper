BJP leader Giriraj Singh, who is facing arrest for his alleged hate speeches, was granted anticipatory bail on Friday by a Patna court. Singh had stoked controversy on Apr-19, saying that those who opposed Narendra Modi should go to Pakistan. His advocate argued that Singh has already said that his assertions weren't aimed at any particular caste or community.
