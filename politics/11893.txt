Addressing a press conference in Bhopal on Saturday, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) convenor Ashok Singhal said it has become "imperative" for each Hindu couple to have five children. He further added that unless conversions were stopped immediately, the day would not be far off when Hindus would be reduced to a minority in this country.
