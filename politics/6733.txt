BJP West Bengal President Dilip Ghosh on Sunday called the girl students of Jadavpur University "below standard and shameless who are always in search of opportunity to be in the company of male students". "Those allegations of molestation are baseless," he said. Notably, girl students of the institution had recently alleged molestation by ABVP members during a scuffle on campus.
