The BJP and the Congress on Saturday jointly condemned the shoe hurling at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying it is an 'unacceptable' act. BJP leader Nalin Kohli said that such incidents are becoming a trend and it is worrisome. Meanwhile, Congress leader PC Chacko called it a "condemnable action" but said the situation was created because of Kejriwal himself.
