UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, whom the Election Commission has acknowledged as the President of the Samajwadi Party, on Tuesday asserted he will take "Netaji" (Mulayam Singh Yadav) along and ties with him are unbreakable. After the EC announced its decision, Akhilesh had gone to meet Mulayam and sought his blessings. "The cycle will continue to move forward," he tweeted.
