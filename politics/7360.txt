A Delhi court on Wednesday directed the police to lodge an FIR against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas for allegedly molesting a party volunteer. The court also gave the police the liberty to arrest him during the investigation if required. The complainant had accused Vishwas of making “sexually coloured” remarks, which should be investigated, added the court.
