Bihar CM Nitish Kumar-led faction of the JD(U) on Saturday passed the resolution to formally join the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). This comes after Nitish split from the Grand Alliance, consisting the RJD and the Congress, over corruption allegations on RJD chief Lalu Yadav's family. Nitish's move saw a rebellion from some of the party leaders, including Sharad Yadav.
