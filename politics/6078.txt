Congress President Sonia Gandhi’s roadshow in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi was cancelled midway on Tuesday after she reportedly fell ill and reportedly left for Delhi on her doctor’s advice. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished her speedy recovery on Twitter, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said, "She (Sonia Gandhi) will be completely fine and will see Modi government’s eradication to its end."
