The Congress and the BJP have issued whips to their Rajya Sabha MPs asking them to be present in the House on Friday. "There is a clash between government and opposition; we want to be in our full strength even on Friday, which is normally a day for Private Member Bills," said Satyavrat Chaturvedi, Congress' chief whip in Rajya Sabha.
