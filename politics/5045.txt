Kerala Minister KK Shailaja has defended CPI(M) leader for revealing a rape victim’s name, stating, “It’s no big deal”. "If former Speaker Radhakrishnan has taken the victim's name, you may want to make a big deal out of it…victims, their parents usually want to hide their names…but they are not the ones who have done anything wrong,” she added.
