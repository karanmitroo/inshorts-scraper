The BJP on Friday submitted its report to UP Governor Ram Naik on the exodus of Hindu families from Kairana. BJP leaders, while calling for a CBI probe into the matter, alleged that criminals enjoying the ruling Samajwadi Party's patronage were running extortion networks. However, a district administration report said three families of the claimed 346 had migrated over 'extortion'.
