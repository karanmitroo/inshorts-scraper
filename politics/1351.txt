The All India Jain Minority Cell has slammed Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, after he called Jain monk Naypadmasagarji Maharaj a terrorist and equated him to televangelist Zakir Naik. This comes after the Shiv Sena complained to the Election Commission about a video wherein Maharaj openly advocated voting for BJP in Mira Bhayandar municipal elections to create a meat-free society.
