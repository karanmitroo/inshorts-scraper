Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Friday said that PM Narendra Modi is not paying attention to the unemployment issue among Muslims as without work they sit idle and produce kids. Reacting to his remark, BJP said, "Azam Khan should ask this question to the Congress, whom they have supported in the past and have formed an alliance".
