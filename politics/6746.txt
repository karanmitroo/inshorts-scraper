A PMK candidate in Tamil Nadu was booked on Sunday after he showered an election official in Ulundurpet with currency notes protesting "inaction" by authorities. The candidate had earlier complained about the money being distributed to voters by AIADMK and DMK activists in the high-profile constituency. Notably, the Election Commission had postponed polling in Aravakurichi over similar concerns.
