Madhya Pradesh Congress leader Dilip Mishra said farmers will fire bullets at the BJP-led government under fellow Congress leader Ajay Singh. His tributes to the farmers killed in police firing come with this promise, he said. Claiming the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government "killed democracy" and "Pradesh's farmers," Mishra added, "Madhya Pradesh's public will also fire at the government."
