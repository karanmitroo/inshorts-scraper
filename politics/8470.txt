BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday backed RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat's calls for reviewing the reservation policy in the country. "We hold the views of the RSS supremo in high esteem. Sad and disheartened at attempts by some people to ridicule and make fun of this highly learned, father figure of RSS/BJP," Sinha tweeted.
