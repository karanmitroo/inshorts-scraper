The Congress Party on Thursday said that the government is trying to please the entrepreneurs by approving Air India's disinvestment and is doing so because the elections are near. "This government, instead of improving the public sectors, wants to disinvest them. SC/ST get majority of the employment from the public sectors," a Congress leader said.
