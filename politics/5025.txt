BJP President Amit Shah on Friday asked, "I fail to understand why Mulayam SIngh, Mayawati, Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi are upset with this (demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes) move?". Terming the move as a "great campaign against corruption", Shah further said people should question the political parties these politicians belong to and added, "They have exposed themselves."
