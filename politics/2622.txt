BJP MP RK Singh has said that being a nationalist he will thrash anyone who raises slogans like "Bharat tere tukde honge". "JNU students are known for such anti-national sentiments...any nationalist won't tolerate it," he added. Earlier, another BJP MLA had threatened to break the limbs of those who kill and disrespect cows.
