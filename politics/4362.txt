Dalbir Kaur, sister of Sarabjit Singh, the Indian farmer who was sentenced to death by a Pakistan court on charges of spying and terrorism, reportedly joined BJP on Sunday. Although his death sentence was postponed, he was not released from prison. Kaur had campaigned for her brother's release, but Sarabjit died in jail after being attacked by other inmates.
