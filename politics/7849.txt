At a rally in Punjab on Thursday, state Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh asked people to "beware" of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in the 2017 state assembly elections and accused him of making false promises. "Ask your children not to fall in the trap of his party as he is luring the young more," Singh said listing out Kejriwal's failures.
