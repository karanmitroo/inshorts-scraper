A 15-second video showing actor and politician Chiranjeevi scolding his fan, has gone viral. Chiranjeevi was coming out of the audio launch of his son's film 'Bruce Lee: The fighter' and a fan continously kept following him. Irritated by this, Chiranjeevi said - "Every time you do this and how many times do you need to be told? Stupid fellows!"
