VHP leader Sadhvi Saraswati said, "I appeal to the Government of India that those people who consider eating the meat of their own mother as a status symbol should be hanged." She further said, "Such people should be brought before the public and hanged, then only people will know that it is our duty to protect 'gau mata' (holy cow)."
