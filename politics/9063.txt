Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday demanded the Centre to release the caste data in the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011. He said that the report would give an idea regarding caste proportions in the society. "The BJP is the biggest casteist party and they played caste politics in the last general election,” he further alleged.
