A video showing an absconding sharpshooter, wanted for the murder of Bihar journalist Rajdev Ranjan, with former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin has surfaced. BJP attacked the state government's failure to arrest the accused saying, "Clearly, he thinks he can do whatever he wants and no one can do anything about it."
