Opposition MPs from eight parties on Friday united against the Centre's decision to strip the minority status of Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia University terming the decision as "sinister". The MPs threatened to launch a signature campaign and meet the President. Last week, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had claimed that both the institutions are not minority institutions.
