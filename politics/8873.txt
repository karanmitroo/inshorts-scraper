The Narendra Modi-led government on Monday decided to withdraw six key amendments in the Land Bill, including those on removal of consent clause and social impact assessment, introduced in December 2014. However, the government would debate clauses on relating retrospective, land return and review. The opposition is against 9 of the 15 amendments brought in by the NDA government.
