During an interview on Saturday, Union Minister Smriti Irani showed an objectionable tweet allegedly of political analyst Tehseen Poonawalla. It was tweeted when the decision to hoist India's flag at every university was taken. "...may I request @smritiirani ji we must also 'erect' a 56-inch pole in every Univ with a condom on it," the tweet read.
