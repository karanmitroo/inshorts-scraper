Calling it the "cheap politics" of the Congress and the BJP, Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Monday blamed the two parties for the ink attack on him outside Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung's official residence. "The AAP is working for people's health and education and... there is the Congress or the BJP who are working on throwing inks," he said.
