Two cases have been filed against PM Narendra Modi for allegedly questioning Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's "DNA" at a rally. The cases were filed by two JD(U) leaders in the Chief Judicial Magistrate's courts. PM Modi on Saturday had said, "There seems to be some problem in his (Nitish) DNA because the DNA of democracy is not like that."
