BJP's prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi goofed up yet again and referred to Mahatma Gandhi as 'Mohanlal' instead of 'Mohandas' Karamchand Gandhi. "Would you fulfil Gandhi's wish? Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi...," said Modi at a rally in Rajasthan on Tuesday. This comes days after he made remarks confusing Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Moookerji with revolutionary Shyamaji Krishna Verma.
