Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday asserted that the party's alliance with the BJP has been forged on the issue of "Hindutva" and not for "power". “You (BJP) may be taking advice from NCP chief Sharad Pawar but we don’t take advice from him,” Uddhav said, claiming that some of the BJP and NCP leaders share close ties.
