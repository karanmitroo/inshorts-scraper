After taking on Mukesh Ambani and other industrialists, former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday cleared the air that he was not against capitalism. "We are not against capitalism, we are against crony capitalism," Kejriwal said. The AAP leader added that all business activities of the country should be in private hands.
