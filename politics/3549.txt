The Election Commission on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar for his bribery remarks that he made in Panaji, Goa. "I understand if someone organises a rally and you take â‚¹500 for moving around with (the candidate), that is not a problem. But when you vote, choose the lotus (BJP's poll symbol)," Parrikar had said.
