Former PM Manmohan Singh on Friday said he became a politician by accident when late PM Narasimha Rao invited him to become a Finance Minister in his cabinet. Speaking at the launch of former President Pranab Mukherjee's new book, Singh said Mukherjee had the right to be upset when he wasn't chosen as PM after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.
