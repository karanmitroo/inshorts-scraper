HRD Minister Smriti Irani Monday slammed TOI for its false report that read "Govt wants schools to observe 'good governance day' on Christmas." Irani posted on Twitter that no school has been asked to remain open on Christmas day. She added that the essay competition is wholly online. Irani also demanded a retraction from TOI on front page in bold.
