J&K CM Omar Abdullah Friday said PM Narendra Modi should clear his stand on the issue of Article 370, a constitutional provision which guarantees special status to the state. “As a Kashmiri, I would want to know what the PM wants to do with Article 370 and what is the agenda of the Centre on the issue,” Omar said.
