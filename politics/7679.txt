Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday said that Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has taken a U-turn on the beef issue. Hooda alleged that BJP does not have a "stable policy" as it first agreed to consider a special permit for foreigners to consume beef in Haryana but ruled out the plan later.
