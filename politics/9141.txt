BJP general secretary Ram Madhav created a controversy on Sunday by questioning Vice-President Hamid Ansari's absence at the yoga-day event in Delhi. The prominent RSS leader also accused Rajya Sabha TV of blacking out the yoga-day event "completely" despite being run on taxpayers' money. However, he later apologized after being criticized on social media.
