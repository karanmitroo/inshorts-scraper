Delhi government has said that it will felicitate Bihar CM Nitish Kumar at a function which is likely to be held on August 19 in the national capital. The AAP government's move comes days after the meeting between Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Nitish. Earlier in July, Nitish had also backed AAP's demand of full statehood status for Delhi.
