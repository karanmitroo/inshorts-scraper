Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has criticised the BJP-led Centre for not taking action against Karnataka government's "offensive" demand for a separate flag. He said it was part of BJP's plan to win the upcoming Karnataka assembly elections. The state government should also be slapped with sedition charges over the demand, he added.
