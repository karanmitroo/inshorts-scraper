Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has stated he agrees with the elected Arvind Kejriwal government in 99% of the cases that come to him and disagrees with him only in 1% of the cases. "CMs are sworn to provide the government. Governors are sworn to protect the government,” he added. He also said AAP’s reading of the Constitution leads to conflicts.
