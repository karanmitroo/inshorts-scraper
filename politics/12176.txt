After facing criticism from political parties and supporters, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday decided not to take up the two five-bedroom duplex flats allotted to him. "Since yesterday my friends, supporters have been saying I should not move into the five-bedroom flat. I am asking the government to look for smaller accommodation for me," Kejriwal said.
