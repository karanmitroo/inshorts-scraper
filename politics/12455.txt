Attacking BJP, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, on Saturday, tweeted - "I hate all those who advocate Ideology of Hate including Taliban and I won't allow the Hindu version of Taliban to succeed in India". Criticizing Modi for trying to "hijack Sardar Patel's legacy," Singh said he expected Modi to proclaim Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh "as RSS Pracharaks."
