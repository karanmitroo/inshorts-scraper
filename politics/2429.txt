Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asserted that the Election Commission has become 'Dhritarashtra', with the only motive to help son 'Duryodhana' (BJP) win elections. "The EC's motive is not to conduct the elections but to ensure the BJP's victory," he said. He further alleged that EVMs used in the recent Rajasthan by-poll were tampered to help BJP win.
