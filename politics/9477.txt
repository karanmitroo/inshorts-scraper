The Aam Aadmi Party Tuesday released a fresh list of spokespersons which did not feature its senior members Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. This comes after both of them were recently expelled from the national council and other committees. The list has 14 spokespersons from Delhi, apart from six new entrants from other states.
