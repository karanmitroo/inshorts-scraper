The Home Ministry has made public a report sent to it by Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao on former CM Jayalalithaa's health on December 7. This comes in response to an RTI query asking whether the ministry was aware of the time and cause of her death. The government had earlier said the Governor's report was exempt from disclosure.
