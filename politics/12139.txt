'When on road, always say Pehle AAP' -- this is the tagline of national road safety week, scheduled to begin in Ahmedabad (Gujarat) on Jan-10. The tagline, which will be displayed in bold on big banners alongside all major roads in Gujarat, is perceived as free publicity for the newborn Aam Aadmi Party - commonly known as AAP.
