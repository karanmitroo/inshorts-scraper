Less than a week before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Gaurav Bhatia on Sunday resigned from the Samajwadi Party. He held the post of the National President of the party's Legal Wing before resigning. Bhatia further announced that he did not want to reveal the reason behind his decision. Last month, SP MLA Ashu Yadav had resigned from the party.
