Sahid Khan has confessed to hiring contract killers to murder BSP leader Chaudhary Munawwar Hassan, his wife, and four children to grab a disputed property that his former business partner (victim) acquired. While Khan killed the family in April when Hassan was in jail for rape, he murdered the BSP leader after he was released last week on interim bail.
