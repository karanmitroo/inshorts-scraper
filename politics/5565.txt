BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav has said that the days of strategic restraint are over and suggested, "for one tooth, the complete jaw". He said this while reacting to the terror attack in J&K which claimed the lives of 17 Indian Army jawans. Union Minister Jitendra Singh also said that not responding to the attack would be “cowardice”.
