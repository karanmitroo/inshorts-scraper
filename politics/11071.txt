Activist and anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare on Sunday criticized Arvind Kejriwal for showing 'disrespect' to the judiciary. "Going to jail has become fashionable for some people. Every citizen of the country must respect the judiciary. The stubbornness Kejriwal is showing by not furnishing a bond for his bail is not acceptable," Hazare said.
