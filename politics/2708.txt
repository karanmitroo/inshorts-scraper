Alleging "systematic erosion" of Jammu and Kashmir's special status by the ruling PDP-BJP alliance, National Conference President Farooq Abdullah said the spirit of inclusiveness alone can steer the state out of the prevailing instability. "PDP has volunteered to be RSS' flag-bearer to trample the unique identity of Jammu and Kashmir and demolish its time-tested secular ethos," Farooq added.
