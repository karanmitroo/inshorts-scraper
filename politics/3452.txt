Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday said that the Congress should tender an unconditional apology for disrespecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and obstructing the Parliament. "They called the PM by names umpteen number of times in the House. They called him Hitler, Mussolini and Gaddafi and made all sorts of meaningless remarks against him," Naidu claimed.
