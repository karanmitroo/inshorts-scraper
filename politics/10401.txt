A total of 5 Congress MLAs on Wednesday were suspended for heckling Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao. They were suspended from the Assembly for the period of two years by the newly-elected Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde. Calling the Devendra Fadnavis govt "illegitimate", the agitating MLAs raised slogans against Bagdeâ€™s decision and demanded that the voting be done again.
