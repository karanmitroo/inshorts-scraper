After Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused Punjab government of being indifferent to farmers, CM Parkash Singh Badal hit back on Friday, saying Rahul Gandhi's party can't claim Sikh respect. Emphasising the work done, he added, “What [has Congress ] done? I don’t want to repeat attack on Harmandir Sahib. [Rahul’s] hands are clean? ’84 riots. It’s all political.”
