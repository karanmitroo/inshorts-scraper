Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of launching personal attacks against him. Gandhi said that Modi quoted Indira and Rajiv Gandhi. He added, "But did not answer a single question I had asked him." In his speech in the Lok Sabha, Gandhi had questioned the Centre's 'Make in India' initiative and black money scheme.
