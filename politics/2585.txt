After almost seven years, BJP leaders, barring a few of them, attended a dinner hosted by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar at his residence on Monday. In 2010, Nitish had cancelled a dinner for the BJP national leadership after photographs showing him holding hands with the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi appeared in newspapers.
