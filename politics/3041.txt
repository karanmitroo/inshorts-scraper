RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday equated notebandi (demonetisation) to forced nasbandi (sterilisation). "It wasn't notebandi but nasbandi, carried out by the Modi government on crores of people, who were forced to stand in queue for withdrawing their own money from the banks," said Lalu. He further called PM Narendra Modi a twin brother of US President Donald Trump.
