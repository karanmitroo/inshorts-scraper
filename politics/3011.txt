A poster that read 'Freedom for Kashmir' surfaced on the wall of the new School of Social Sciences block in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). On being apprised about it, the JNU administration ordered the security staff to take down the poster. The poster was reportedly put up by Left group Democratic Students Union (DSU).
