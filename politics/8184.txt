It is part of "our sanskar" to hug guests, said Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday, in wake of the controversy surrounding the Lalu-Kejriwal hug. Tejashwi said there was nothing wrong with embracing a guest who had come to participate in a celebration. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had claimed RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had "pulled and hugged him".
