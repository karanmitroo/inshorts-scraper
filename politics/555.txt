The Tripura Assembly Speaker has issued a show-cause notice to five-time Congress MLA Ratan Lal Nath for joining BJP despite being elected to the house from the former party. Nath had switched the party on December 22 along with several of his followers. Following this, Congress' state unit wrote to the Speaker, requesting cancellation of Nath's membership to the assembly.
