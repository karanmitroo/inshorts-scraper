Sacked AAP minister Kapil Mishra was attacked by a man claiming to be from the party, while he was sitting on an indefinite hunger strike outside his residence in New Delhi on Wednesday. "Iâ€™m on war against corruption. Let them attack I won't relent... I urge my supporters to not retaliate to any aggression", Mishra said after the assault.
