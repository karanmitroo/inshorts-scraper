Responding to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's comment that PM Narendra Modi is obsessed with power, BJP on Tuesday said it would be wrong to blame Rahul for being obsessed with PM Modi. "He should contain making unnecessary comments on OROP. It has been implemented... which was not even thought of for 60 years," BJP leader Shaina NC said.
