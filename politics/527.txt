Following the Bhima Koregaon clashes in Maharashtra, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that a central pillar of the "RSS/BJP's fascist vision for India" was that Dalits should remain at the bottom of the Indian society. "Una, Rohith Vemula and now Bhima-Koregaon are potent symbols of the resistance," he added. The clashes erupted on Bhima Koregaon battle's 200th anniversary.
