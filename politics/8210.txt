Consumer Affairs Minister and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan on Thursday said that BJP-led NDA lost the Bihar elections owing to “fear created among the minorities” following the Dadri lynching incident. He further attributed their loss to the Grand Alliance’s success in convincing people “that if the NDA comes to power... reservation will be done away with.”
