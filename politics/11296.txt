Congress had the numbers but a BJP man became the mayor of Delhi South Corporation by just one vote on Tuesday as two Congress MPs didn't turn up to vote. Congress MP Sandeep Dikshit came eventually, but by then the election had ended. Later, Congress alleged that BJP didnâ€™t allow Dikshit to vote although voting had started 10 minutes late.
