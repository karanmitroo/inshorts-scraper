Former External Affairs Minister, Natwar Singh, Wednesday claimed that Sonia Gandhi had declined to become PM in 2004, because of strong opposition from her son Rahul. He added that Rahul was afraid her mother would be killed like his father and grandmother, if she accepted the post. Notably, Singh had resigned from the Congress-led government in 2005, following corruption allegations.
