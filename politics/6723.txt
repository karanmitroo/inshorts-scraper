Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party was against the state's development and its sole motive was to spread disharmony in the area. He added that the party's decision to gherao his residence in Chandigarh was useless and undemocratic as the doors of his house were always open for the common man.
