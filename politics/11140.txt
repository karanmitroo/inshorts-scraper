The Congress faced its worst humiliation as its tally slipped to 44, much below its earlier lowest performance of 1999 (114 seats). The Congress had won 206 seats in 2009. Ironically, the Congress did not win a single seat in seven states and even failed to reach double-digit mark in any state. The UPA together won 58 seats.
