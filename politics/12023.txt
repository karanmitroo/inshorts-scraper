Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has written to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking mercy for Khalistan Liberation Force terrorist Devinderpal Singh Bhullar. Bhullar had earlier filed a mercy petition before the President on Jan-14, 2003; but it was rejected after a lapse of over eight years. He was convicted and awarded death penalty for triggering 1993 New Delhi bomb blasts.
