RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son and Bihar Minister, Tej Pratap, has formed an organisation named Dharmnirapeksh Sevak Sangh (DSS) to counter Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). "It'll offer strong resistance to RSS and its divisive ideology. The DSS has members from all religions and communities," he said. "We are planning to organise its yatra on April 2," he added.
