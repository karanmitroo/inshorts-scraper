Congress on Tuesday slammed Home Minister Rajnath Singh for his reported "maa ka doodh piya hai" remark at a rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Congress said it is sad that Rajnath, who is responsible for national security, is using "pathetic and provocative" language. "It tells us that BJP will stoop to the lowest common denominator for votes", Congress added.
