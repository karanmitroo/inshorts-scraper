Considering Kamal Nath's alleged involvement in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today called his appointment as Congress General Secretary in-charge of Punjab, "the ultimate insult to Sikhs". AAP and BJP also criticised Congress over the appointment. Kamal Nath, however, rubbished the allegations and said he had been given a clean chit in this regard.
