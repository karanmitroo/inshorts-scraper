Continuing his attacks on PM Narendra Modi over the Reliance Jio advertisement, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the PM wants to say he's a Reliance man and doesn’t care about people's opinion. “Congress was also in Reliance pocket. But they helped them secretly,” he tweeted. No Indian PM sold himself so "brazenly" to a corporate house, he added.
