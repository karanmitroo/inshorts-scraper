AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, who quit on Feb14 last year just 49-days after swearing-in as Delhi CM, has again apologised for his actions to people promising not to quit again. "In May (last year), we apologised to the people of Delhi for the disappointment caused, and in case you missed it the first time, I do so again," Kejriwal said.
