Slamming Rahul Gandhi for calling GST 'Gabbar Singh Tax', Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Friday said that Gandhi was making a mistake and his body language resembled the character Gabbar Singh. "Behind closed doors, your Finance Ministers extend support to the GST, but outside, you term it as Gabbar Singh Tax. These are double standards," he added.
