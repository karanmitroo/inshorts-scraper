During a Lok Sabha discussion on high-value commercial disputes on Wednesday, BJP MP Kirti Azad referred to the acquittal of actor Salman Khan and asked whether a deer was driving the vehicle. Clarifying that he wasn't speaking ill of the judge, Azad added, “I am talking of those judgments. A poor man died… there’s no word about him."
