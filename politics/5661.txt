The BJP has slammed comedian Kapil Sharma for addressing a tweet to PM Narendra Modi, stating that he has to pay ₹5 lakh bribe to municipality despite paying ₹15 crore income tax. BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said, "Kapil shouldn't have dragged PM into this. He should've filed a written complaint...It's another thing if he's targeting BJP with a bad intention."
