Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday said that Narendra Modi was holding the post of Prime Minister of India because the people of the country found him capable of holding the top position. "I'm not a fool...not in race for 2019 PM post. I was elected as party (JD-U) president as Sharadji (Yadav) couldn't continue on the post," Nitish added.
