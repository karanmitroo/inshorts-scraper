BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Shatrughan Sinha may not campaign for the party in Bihar elections in spite of their names being on the list of star campaigners, as per reports. A party leader said that it was not expected that any candidate would request for Advani since the senior leader was no more a crowdpuller.
