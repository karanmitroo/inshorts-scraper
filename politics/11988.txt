AAP MLA Madan Lal alleged on Monday that he had been approached many times by BJP leaders, including Modi, in an attempt to buy him off for Rs. 20 crore. â€œThey told me to wean away nine AAP lawmakers and form a party and align with BJP," said Lal. However, Madan said he has no proof to back his allegations.
