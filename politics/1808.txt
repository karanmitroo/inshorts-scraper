A tribal woman in Assam will file a defamation case against Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath after her 10-year-old photo, showing her running across a street stripped naked, surfaced on a Facebook account bearing Adityanath's name. The post claimed that the Hindu woman was stripped by Congress workers for allegedly raising slogans in support of BJP.
