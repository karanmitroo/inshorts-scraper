Activist Anna Hazare on Saturday said that in the coming Lok Sabha elections he would campaign for 50 independent candidates, who had accepted a 17-point agenda proposed by him. He added that the candidates supported by him, if elected, would support neither Congress nor BJP. However, he denied any support to AAP, as the party had not accepted his agenda.
