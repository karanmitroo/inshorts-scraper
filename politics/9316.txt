AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi Monday questioned the Modi government's move to confer the Bharat Ratna on former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, alleging that Vajpayee was involved in the Babri Masjid demolition. Vajpayee was awarded the Bharat Ratna on March 27 this year. Owaisi also objected to the government's decision of conferring Padma Vibhushan to the BJP patriarch LK Advani.
