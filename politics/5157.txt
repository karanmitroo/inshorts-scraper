Asserting that Uniform Civil Code is not merely a Muslim issue, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said people in parts of North-East would also oppose it. He alleged that UCC was BJP's design to "finish" the country's pluralism and diversity. "For BJP, Muslims have to be made an enemy so that they can have polarisation around that issue," he added.
