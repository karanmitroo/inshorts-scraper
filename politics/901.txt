Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections, Chirag Patel, a former close aide of Hardik Patel, joined the BJP on Thursday. Talking about the recently leaked alleged sex tape of Hardik, Chirag said it was a blot on the Patidar community. Chirag was among the six Patidar leaders against whom a sedition case was filed during the 2015 agitation.
