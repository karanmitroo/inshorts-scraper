The Congress party on Saturday asked the Election Commission to register an FIR against PM Narendra Modi and BJP leaders for allegedly violating the model code for holding a roadshow in Varanasi. The roadshow was held without required permits from the authorities, Congress claimed. During the roadshow, Modi also went to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Kaal Bhairav Temple.
