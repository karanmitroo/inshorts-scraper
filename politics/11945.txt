A chaotic situation prevailed in Delhi assembly on Thursday forcing the speaker to adjourn the proceedings twice. BJP MLAs demanded resignation of law minister Somnath Bharti that was supported by Congress leaders also. Accusing both the BJP and the Congress of conniving to disrupt the Assembly, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that the nexus between both the parties stands exposed.
