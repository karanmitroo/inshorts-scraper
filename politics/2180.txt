Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister Swami Prasad Maurya has remarked that Muslims resort to triple talaq to change wives and satisfy their "lust". "If someone...forces his own wife and children on the streets to beg...no one will call this right," he said. Maurya, however, added that BJP stands with Muslim women who have been unreasonably and arbitrarily divorced.
