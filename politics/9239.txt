BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday ruled out a nationwide ban on beef, saying it is for the states to take a decision on it. "Wherever there is BJP government, we will consider sentiments of the people before imposing ban on beef. We have not said that we will be banning beef across the country," Shah said.
