The Election Commission on Tuesday cancelled Anantnag Lok Sabha by-poll, stating that the situation isn't conducive for a free and fair election. The election in the constituency was earlier postponed from April 12 to May 25 due to violence. Furthermore, the Home Ministry told the poll panel it could spare around 30,000 soldiers against the panel's demand for 74,000 soldiers.
