After Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated Muslim Rashtriya Manch announced to hold an Iftar party on July 2, the Shiv Sena on Thursday termed the move as 'pure hypocrisy'. "It's surprising that such Iftar parties are organised by the RSS, but at the same time, not surprising also, because the RSS and the BJP seem to be losing Hindutva agenda," Sena added.
