Charges have been framed against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal under sec-499 (defamation) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the IPC after he refused to withdraw the allegations of corruption he had leveled against Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari. The court, however, exempted Kejriwal from making a personal appearance in the court on the day of hearing.
