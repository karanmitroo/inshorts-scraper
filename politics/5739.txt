The Election Commission on Friday confirmed that the Mamata Banerjee-led All India Trinamool Congress is now a 'National party'. Trinamool Congress became India's seventh national party after it was recognised as a 'State party' in West Bengal, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. The party will now be allotted its flower and grass symbol exclusively to contest elections across India.
