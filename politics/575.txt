Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on Monday said that no state minister had met former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa during her hospitalisation. Adding that only nurses and jailed AIADMK leader Sasikala and her family had access to her, Panneerselvam said, "We didn't go (to her room) out of good intention that she should not contract infection."
