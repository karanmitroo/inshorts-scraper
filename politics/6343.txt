MoS for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said the benefits of Centre-sponsored schemes don't reach the public in the states ruled by opposition parties. He said, "We don't want to encroach on the state governments' rights, but we appeal…schemes by the Centre must reach the people." Rijiju further asked the people to “raise their voice” if they don't receive the schemes.
