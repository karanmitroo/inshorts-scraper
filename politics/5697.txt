Commenting on the appointment of Gurpreet Ghuggi as AAP Punjab convenor, Congress leader Manish Tewari said the party would provide stand-up comedy instead of governance if voted to power. "The Aam Aadmi Party mocks the people of Punjab by trying to substitute governance," he added. Notably, Ghuggi is the second stand-up comedian to joinâ€‹ the party after Bhagwant Mann.
