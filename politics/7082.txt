The Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday removed Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar from his post, after the BJP and Congress accused him of "snooping" on opposition leaders, bureaucrats and journalists. They also accused Kumar of being close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. "ADG (CID) Soumen Mitra will replace him," said an EC source quoted by The Indian Express.
