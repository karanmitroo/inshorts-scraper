The BJP will organise a 24-hour 'Go Raksha Asthayama Yagna' in Bengaluru on February 2, in a bid to promote the protection of cows across India. Cows need to be protected to strengthen the rural economy at the grassroots, BJP Cow Protection Cell officials said. The event will be followed by a 24-hour 'Akhanda Ramayana' programme.
