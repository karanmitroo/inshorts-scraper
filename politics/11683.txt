AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has given his blue Wagon-R car to Navin Jaihind, who is contesting from Rohtak, a seat represented by two-time MP Deepender Singh Hooda, son of Haryana CM BS Hooda. “Arvind has asked me to use the car (for campaigning) until I arrange one for myself,” said Jaihind, who has been associated with Kejriwal since 2007.
