Addressing businessmen in Karnataka, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has claimed that decisions such as demonetisation were taken as the RSS had the power to influence the central government's policies. Claiming that demonetisation was proposed by the RSS and not Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Gandhi said, "The RSS presses an idea into Prime Minister's mind and PM launches that idea."
