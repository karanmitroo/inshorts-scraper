The Election Commission on Friday challenged the political parties to try to hack its Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) this Sunday or Monday. The decision was taken after the poll panel held an all-party meeting over the EVM tampering issue. Several political parties, including AAP, Congress, Samajwadi Party and BSP, have raised doubts over the reliability of the EVMs.
