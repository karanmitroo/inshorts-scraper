Shiv Sena MPs on Wednesday threatened to disrupt Parliament proceedings if no action was taken against Air India for banning the party's lawmaker from Osmanabad Ravindra Gaikwad from flying on its planes. Gaikwad had last month assaulted a 60-year-old Air India Duty Manager with his slipper. Following this, Air India and four other airlines had barred Gaikwad from their flights.
