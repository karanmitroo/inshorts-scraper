Senior JD(U) Legislator Chhedi Paswan was suspended by party president Sharad Yadav from the party for six years after he met BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. Paswan, who was denied ministerial berth in Nitish Kumar's second-inning as Bihar CM, described the meeting as only a courtesy call. Earlier two Congress leaders were expelled from Congress on the same ground.
