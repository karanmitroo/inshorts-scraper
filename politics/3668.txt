Reacting to the physical attack on filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Saturday said that self-styled vigilante groups run amuck in the BJP-ruled state. "It's clear which side the govt is on. Why is there silence from those in power?" he asked. "Dabholkar-Pansare-Kalburgi: we know how far fanning such intolerance can go," he added.
