A photo caption in a magazine published by the Haryana government describes 'ghoonghat' as "the identity of the state." The magazine says, "Ghoongat ki aan-baan, mahra Haryana ki pechchan (pride of the veil is the identity of my Haryana)." Defending the post, Haryana Minister Anil Vij said, "We are not forcing anyone to wear ghoongat. It is not like burqa."
