The assassin of former Punjab CM Beant Singh has been arrested by the police in Thailand. The Thai police arrested Jagat Singh 'Tara' Monday from the house of a man who was sheltering him at the instruction of Pakistan's ISI agency. Tara, who assassinated Beant Singh in 1995, escaped from the Burail jail (Chandigarh) by digging a tunnel in 2004.
