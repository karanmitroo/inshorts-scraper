BJP MP Vinay Katiyar on Thursday said that over 3.5 lakh people have lost their lives for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya which is more than the death toll recorded in India-Pakistan battles. “This is an old issue. It's not an issue that has cropped up today and until Lord Ram’s temple is not constructed, it will go on,” he added.
