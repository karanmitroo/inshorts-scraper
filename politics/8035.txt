Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is "still a child" after the latter commented on the demolition of slums in Delhi's Shakur Basti by railway authorities. Kejriwal added that Rahul was unaware that Railways are under the Centre's control. Rahul had earlier asked, “Why is AAP doing dharna? They are in power in Delhi.”
