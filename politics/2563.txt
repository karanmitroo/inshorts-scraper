Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Friday met Tamil Nadu farmers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for over two weeks and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of neglecting the farmers while helping the rich. "The PM has given debt relief to richest people in the country, why not for the people who have built this country - the farmers," he added.
