Citing BJP's victory in general elections, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, "[Atal Bihari] Vajpayee made the government with 182 seats, [Narendra] Modi has 282...These seats came because of a very clever packaging of development message."  "People who are willing to attack others for marrying into another faith or allegedly eating beef is gaining more acceptance than it should," Tharoor added.
