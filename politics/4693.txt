The JD(U) on Sunday hit back at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for her 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe at party chief Nitish Kumar over his support for government's demonetisation move. "She looks good in the role of didi...she should not behave like a bully," said JD(U) leader KC Tyagi. Notably, JD(U) had refused to participate in Mamata's protest against note ban.
