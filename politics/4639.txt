The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's 'unconditional apology' for his alleged remark on the Bulandshahr gangrape case. The court has asked Khan to file a fresh affidavit by December 15 after noting that his previous affidavit contained certain errors. Khan had earlier termed the Bulandshahr gang-rape incident a 'political conspiracy'.
