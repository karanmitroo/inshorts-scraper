Responding to BSP Supremo Mayawati's allegations of EVM-tampering in the Uttar Pradesh civic polls, CM Yogi Adityanath said they can have re-elections with ballot papers in Aligarh and Meerut, where BSP won the mayoral seats. The BJP would win those two seats as well, CM Yogi added. Notably, BJP won 14 out of 16 mayoral seats in the state.
