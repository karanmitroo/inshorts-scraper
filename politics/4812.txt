Responding to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for criticising PM Narendra Modi's absence from the Parliament, BJP on Saturday said he was not "worthy" to question Modi. "It is a joke because Rahul Gandhi has been adjudged...one the worst parliamentarians," BJP's GVL Narasimha said. Congress should ask Rahul to learn basics of Parliamentary responsibility and accountability first, he added.
