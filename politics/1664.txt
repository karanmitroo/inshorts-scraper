RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has not asked for his son Tejashwi Yadav's resignation after the CBI raided him over corruption allegations. "We will not tolerate any disrespect towards him (Nitish Kumar). We have formed the grand alliance, made Nitish CM. Why will we break the alliance," Lalu said.
