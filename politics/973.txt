Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday tweeted, "The difference between UPA and NDA- The ease of doing corruption has been replaced by the ease of doing business." This comes after India jumped 30 places and ranked 100 among 190 countries in the World Bank's 2018 ease of doing business report. GST will improve India's rank in near future, Jaitley added.
