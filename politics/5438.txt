Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday slammed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader P Chidambaram for their remarks on India's surgical strikes in PoK. Kejriwal was 'making headlines in Pakistan' for seeking proof of the strikes, he said. Prasad also criticised Chidambaram for saying that similar strikes were conducted by the UPA too but were never made public.
