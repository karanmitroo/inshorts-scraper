Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday prohibited the inscription of names of any government functionaries, including ministers and MLAs, on foundation stones and inaugural plaques. This comes after Cabinet Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot was caught on the camera threatening to suspend a school principal after he found that his name was third on the inaugural stone.
