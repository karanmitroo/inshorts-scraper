In a rally in Azamgarh on Tuesday, the head of Samajwadi Party, Mulayam Singh Yadav projected himself as a tough leader for the post of PM and dumped BJP's PM nominee NaMo by taunting that he is only available in Gujarat and TV. If SP forms a government at the Centre then developments will be seen in India, said Mulayam.
