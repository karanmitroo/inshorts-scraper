The CPI has supported the West Bengal government's proposal of changing the state's name. “We agree. It’s alright. No problem,” CPI General Secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said. The state assembly had on Tuesday passed a resolution proposing to rename the state as 'Bengal' in English and 'Bango' or 'Bangla' in Bengali, as the current name figures towards the end alphabetically.
