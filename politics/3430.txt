BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday said former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cannot run away from the various irregularities that took place during the UPA regime. "PM Narendra Modi is speaking the truth that Manmohan Singh didn't take responsibility of any of the scams," Shah said a day after Modi said that "only Singh can bath while wearing a raincoat".
