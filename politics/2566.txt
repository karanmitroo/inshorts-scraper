Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday thanked Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for "doing nothing" and failing to prove Congress' majority in the state despite the party winning the largest number of assembly seats. While attending a Rajya Sabha session, Parrikar also thanked the house for its support during his tenure as the Defence Minister.
