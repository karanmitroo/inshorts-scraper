The Bombay High Court on Friday permitted the Shiv Sena to hold its annual Dussehra rally on October 22 at Shivaji Park in Mumbai. It asked political parties involved to "keep their enthusiasm at a low level and ensure residents are not troubled by excessive noise pollution". The court warned of severe action if the conditions were not met.
