PM Narendra Modi Saturday targeted the AAP by asking convener Arvind Kejriwal to join the Naxal movement if wants to be an anarchist. "Have you ever seen a leader who openly admits that he is an anarchist...", said Modi. Further, he said while AAP were masters in protesting, the BJP "has the mastery in running a good government".
