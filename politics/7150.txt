No Kashmiri Pandits have found a place in the new PDP-BJP coalition government's council of ministers that assumed office in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, according to Hindustan Times. Kashmiri Pandits have not been part of the state's council of ministers since 2005, when an independent candidate from Habba Kadal constituency of Srinagar became a minister in the PDP-Congress coalition.
