Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa has expelled K Malaisamy, a leader from her party (AIADMK) for suggesting that she will ally with Narendra Modi, widely expected to be India's next PM. He has been charged with "bringing disrepute to the party." However, Jayalalithaa didn't contradict him and told reporters "Let's wait for the results."
