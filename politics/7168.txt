BJP's Uttar Pradesh Women Wing Chief Madhu Mishra was on Monday expelled from the party for six years over a statement she reportedly made. She had allegedly said, "People who once used to polish your shoes are now ruling you, thanks to the Constitution." The party distanced itself from the statement and sought a written explanation from Mishra.
