Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said in his Independence Day address that politicians should keep their "errant sons" indoors instead of imposing restrictions on women. Referring to the Chandigarh stalking case, he said, "son of an influential leader was caught for committing crime against women. Another leader commented that women shouldn't venture out at night. I wish to slap that leader."
