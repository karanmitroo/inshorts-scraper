Following a flop show of the much-hyped joint rally of Anna Hazare and Mamata Banerjee in Delhi, Trinamool cancelled its Thursdayâ€™s Haryana rally, and Mamata is returning to Kolkata. The Delhi rally was a huge embarrassment for Mamata, as Hazare backed out at the last moment and only a few hundred people turned up at Ramlila Maidan.
