Slamming the bus yatra organised by the Congress in Telangana, state IT Minister KT Rama Rao said the party leaders reminded him of 'Alibaba and the 40 Thieves'. He added that he considered Opposition leader Kunduru Jana Reddy as Alibaba. Claiming that the yatra had no popular support, Rao alleged that police cases were registered against several Congress MLAs.
