The Election Commission (EC) on Saturday issued show cause notices to AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa and DMK President M Karunanidhi for violating the Model Code of Conduct. The notices say that prima facie the manifestos of the parties “have not substantially fulfilled the guidelines of the Commission”. The poll panel has given them till May 15 to explain their "stand".
