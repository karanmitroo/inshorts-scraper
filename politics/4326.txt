Lawyer and Congress Spokesperson Manish Tewari has asked activist Anna Hazare whether the latter wanted Lokpal or Lokpal Act. "Three years since Lokpal Act was passed but no Lokpal? Did you Annaji Hazare want a Lokpal or just a Lokpal Act? Letâ€™s fast together for Lokpal?," the former Union Minister tweeted. Notably, Hazare had demanded a strong Lokpal.
