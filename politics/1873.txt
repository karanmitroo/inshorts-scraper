Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged there was an atmosphere of fear across the country and the minorities were feeling threatened under Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government. "My friends from the press are feeling uncomfortable, they are scared to write what they want to. This is the spirit of the RSS-BJP and not of the Congress," he added.
