A BJP delegation on Sunday met President Pranab Mukherjee over alleged attacks on party workers by the CPI(M) supporters in Kerala. "Our worker Pramod was killed. Houses of more than 100 workers have been vandalised", said Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who was part of the delegation. He also questioned the silence of Congress, saying it is not good for democracy.
