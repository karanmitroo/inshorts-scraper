Around 50 Congress party members in Mumbai got tattoos on their hands to protest against the Centre's demonetisation move. The tattoos read, 'humara pradhan mantri rishwatkhor hai' (Our Prime Minister is corrupt). "It is our way to protest against PM who is still silent on such serious charges," said Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam.
