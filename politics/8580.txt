Addressing an election rally in Bihar on Sunday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj warned people against the 'Mahagathbandhan' (RJD-JDU-Congress grand alliance). "If the grand secular alliance is able to form the government, it will be nothing but the return of Jungle Raj-2 and hence you (people) should beware of such Mahagathbandhan," she said.
