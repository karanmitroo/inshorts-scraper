Yoga Guru Ramdev was not considered for the Padma awards this year, an RTI response has revealed. Activist Subhash Agrawal had filed a query seeking the names of persons who were shortlisted for the civilian honours but turned it down. The list revealed in response didn't have Ramdev's name. In January, Ramdev had claimed to have declined the Padma honour.
