Union minister VK Singh on Thursday said the deceased ex-serviceman, who committed suicide over OROP scheme, had fought a Sarpanch election on a Congress ticket. Amid allegations of delay in OROP implementation, Singh said, "If he had reached out to us and didn't get help, then it was our fault." Singh had earlier asked to probe the ex-serviceman's "mental state".
