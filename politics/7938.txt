Trinamool Congress (TMC) Secretary-General and West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday called PM Narendra Modi “a non-resident (NRI) prime minister”, saying that he and his ministers “have created a record in travelling abroad”. The remarks came after BJP, earlier in the day, raised questions over the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government’s claims of development in the state.
