Dalit BJP MP Udit Raj on Sunday asked members of the Scheduled Castes and backward communities to use social media to demand reservation in private sector jobs. Claiming that both Arvind Kejriwal and Kanhaiya Kumar are "products of social media", Raj asked the backward classes to look at the strategies of the Delhi CM and the JNU student leader.
