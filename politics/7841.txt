Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay on Monday said that the "double standards" of the AAP government have been exposed with the alleged sale of over one lakh CNG stickers to non-CNG cars in Delhi. Upadhyay also termed the bringing up of the alleged scam with Sunday's ink throwing incident on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, a "cheap publicity stunt".
