In wake of the Dadri lynching incident, the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday issued an advisory to all state governments stating "zero tolerance for any attempt to weaken the secular fabric of the nation". The statement further asked the states to take "strictest action as per law" against those elements who exploit "religious emotions or sentiments".
