The Congress on Sunday said Jammu and Kashmir witnessed normalcy under the tenure of ex-PM Manmohan Singh. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policy has been a failure and a disaster. He has no road map in engaging with Pakistan," said Congress leader Anand Sharma. "Singh's tenure saw a record arrival of tourists in Kashmir. Today there is no tourism," he added.
