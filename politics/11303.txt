Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said Narendra Modi would have been in jail had Lokayukta and RTI commissioners been in place in Gujarat. "The day when Lokayukta comes, the day when RTI commissioners are appointed, your chowkidar (watchman) will go inside (jail)," Rahul said. He also accused BJP's PM nominee of distributing huge tracts of land to Adani "for a pittance".
