Minister of State (MoS) for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Giriraj Singh, on Wednesday reportedly made a racist comment against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. "What if Rajiv Gandhi had married a Nigerian and if she was not white skinned, then would Congress have accepted her as the party chief?" media reports quoted him as saying.
