Incumbent Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav will be the Samajwadi Party's chief ministerial candidate in the 2017 state Assembly elections, party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Agarwal said on Thursday. This comes amid reports of a rift between Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal Yadav, after the latter replaced the former as the party's UP President.
