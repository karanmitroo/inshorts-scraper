The Opposition on Monday protested in the Parliament against PM Narendra Modi's remark at an election rally that an Italian court had named Sonia Gandhi in the AgustaWestland chopper bribery case. This resulted in two adjournments in the pre-noon session, as the Congress called Modi a 'liar', raised slogans, and demanded an apology from him for making the statement.
