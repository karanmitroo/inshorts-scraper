The Swaraj Abhiyan has written a letter to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s wife Sunita over AAP government’s liquor policy, asking her to give some “good sense” to the CM. A group of women from the outfit has also sought to meet her at the CM's residence. Swaraj Abhiyan has been attacking the Kejriwal government for allegedly issuing 399 alcohol licenses.
