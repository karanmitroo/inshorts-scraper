CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Monday called for a nation-wide protest against the Centre's demonetisation move. "In Kerala, a human chain would be formed to mark the protest against demonetisation. The Left will stage a protest when the PM's new announcements are launched," Yechury said. He further termed demonetisation as a complete diversion from the promises made to the people.
