Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Tuesday claimed that Christians are "silently" converting people at a large scale in India. "In 1947, Hindus were almost 90% of the population. But as per a latest media survey, we are only 72% at present," he said. "If opposition parties extend their cooperation, a law can be brought to control the population," he added.
