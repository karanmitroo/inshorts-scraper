NCP chief Sharad Pawar has said that the armed forces are constantly being attacked by Pakistan-based terrorists under Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's watch and the welfare of soldiers is not being taken care of. "How can they claim to be protecting India's common people when they cannot ensure the safety of soldiers," Pawar asked during a rally in Goa.
