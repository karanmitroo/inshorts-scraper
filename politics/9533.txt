'Charaiveti', a magazine published by the BJP in MP, has called social activist Anna Hazare a foreign agent. Further, it says that Hazare is not in favour of development and his NGO is run by foreign funds. Opposition parties, Congress and AAP, have alleged that the BJP is doing this purposely to shift the focus from the Land Bill issue.
