Delhi CM and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal Saturday said he would not contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Earlier in the day, AAP leader Prashant Bhushan had said the party would make public its PM candidate only after the election commission announces the election schedule, adding that the party would contest from as many seats as possible across the country.
