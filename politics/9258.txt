Lashing out at the Congress vice president Rahul Gandhiâ€™s 'suit-boot ki sarkar' comment, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday said, "suit boot is definitely more acceptable than suitcase." Attacking the Congress party, the PM said, "...the Congress has suddenly remembered the poor. People of this country have suffered and remained poor due to the shortsighted policies of the Congress."
