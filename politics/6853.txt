Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday called the Centre's assertion of a non-corrupt government as "just a slogan" and questioned the source of BJP's "huge" election expenses. BJP spent much more than Congress during the Assam polls, he asserted. "Who has given them so much money for election campaigning? Will someone give money without any benefit?" Gogoi further questioned.
