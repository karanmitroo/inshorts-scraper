After Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched mobile payments app BHIM, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that naming a "lottery app" after Bhimrao Ambedkar shows the Centre's "crude mentality", and it is an "insult to the backward classes". The newly launched application is an Aadhar-based app which would allow people to transact with their fingerprints, according to reports.
