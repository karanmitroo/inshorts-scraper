BSR Congress founder B Sreeramulu Wednesday announced his 20-month-old party's merger with the BJP. "I am returning to the BJP to help Narendra Modi become PM. At the moment, the nation is more important to me than my party," he announced. The move follows the decision of former Karnataka CM BS Yeddyurappa merging his Karnataka Janata Party with BJP.
