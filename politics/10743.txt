The UP govt ordered a probe against Ghaziabad senior superintendent of police(SSP) Dharmendra Yadav for misbehaving with union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi. The incident took place when the SSP not only refused to take Maneka's calls but also used derogatory language. The minister called the SSP after an inspector refused to lodge a complaint of her organisation.
