The residents of three out of 19 buildings of MIG Colony in Mumbai's East Bandra have claimed that their names were missing from the voters' list for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. The polling officer has asked the voters, who had reportedly cast their votes in the previous elections, to lodge a complaint in this regard.
