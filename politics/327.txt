Urging Telugu Desam Party members to pressurise the Centre, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu has asked party MPs to disrupt the Parliament even at the cost of suspension, according to party leader KR Rao. This comes after the party slammed the Centre for not allocating the funds promised during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the 2018 Budget.
