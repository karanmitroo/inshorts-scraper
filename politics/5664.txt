In the run-up to the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu on Thursday launched a new party, Aawaaz-E-Punjab. The party is the "resurrection" and "redemption" of Punjab which is in dire straits, he said. Sidhu announced the party's formation last week along with former hockey player Pargat Singh and independent MLAs Simarjeet Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains.
