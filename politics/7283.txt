The Election Commission (EC) will install video cameras in vulnerable booths during the upcoming West Bengal Assembly polls. The live surveillance will serve as an additional security measure along with poll observers and central armed forces. The EC has identified 14,000 vulnerable pockets across the state, and all polling booths in such areas will be classified as vulnerable polling stations.
