Former PM Deve Gowda on Saturday began a hunger strike in Bengaluru protesting against the Supreme Court’s order over the sharing of Cauvery water between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Karnataka isn’t a habitual offender but its people have been suffering because of this impasse for the last 130 years, he said, urging the matter be discussed in the Parliament.
