Expressing dismay over Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government's rule, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray said that the PM's three-and-a-half years' tenure has been an utter failure. "I believed in Modi and was first to say he should be the Prime Minister of India. I thought he would steer India to progress but...he showed no results," Thackeray added.
