Reacting sharply to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's remarks that the Opposition will be embarrassed once names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public, the Congress Wednesday dared him to "name the traitor". It also accused Jaitley of "bluffing" people."A traitor is a traitor... What is stopping Jaitley ji from naming the traitors?" Youth Congress President Rajeev Satav tweeted.
