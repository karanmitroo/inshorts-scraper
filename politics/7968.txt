An article published on Monday in the Congress party's mouthpiece in Maharashtra, 'Congress Darshan', criticised former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru and party President Sonia Gandhi. The article accused Sonia's father of being a member of Italy's fascist forces. Another article read, "Had Patel been heard (by Nehru) then, the problems of Kashmir, China, Tibet and Nepal wouldnâ€™t have existed now".
