Tamil Nadu on Saturday witnessed a trust vote for the first time in 30 years as the last time it happened was when the former state CM MG Ramachandran's party split after his death. While state CM Edappadi Palanisamy has claimed the support of 124 MLAs and asserted his government will stay, O Panneerselvam has the backing of 11 MLAs.
