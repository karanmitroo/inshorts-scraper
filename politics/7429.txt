On the day BJP's Yogi Adityanath called Anupam Kher a real-life villain, 'Yogi Adityanath' was an Indian Twitter trend on Wednesday. Users supported Adityanath with tweets like, "There are certain people for/with whom Hindus should stand unconditionally, and one of them is Yogi Adityanath" and "One shud not try to act neutral by castigating leaders of masses like Yogi Adityanath".
