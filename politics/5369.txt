BJP MP Chaudhary Babulal has called Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi a ‘traitor’, stating that the latter doesn’t have proof of his own lineage. This was Babulal's response to Gandhi’s ‘Khoon ki Dalali’ remark against PM Narendra Modi. “Legal action should be taken against all those who are asking for proof of the surgical strike,” he added.
