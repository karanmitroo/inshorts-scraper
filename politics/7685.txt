Former PM Manmohan Singh has criticised PM Narendra Modi for keeping "quiet" over issues like the beef controversy and the Dadri lynching. The PM is expected to "take the lead in managing public opinion" but Modi "has never spoken", he said. â€œ[Modi] must give every Indian the confidence that... we have a PM who cares for our well-being," Singh added.
