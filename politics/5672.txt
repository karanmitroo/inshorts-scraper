The BJP on Wednesday said the Congress is trying to launch and re-launch its Vice President Rahul Gandhi, but failing in every attempt. Taking a dig at Rahul’s “Khaat Sabha” in Uttar Pradesh, BJP’s Spokesperson Sambit Patra said people of UP are taking cots more seriously than Rahul Gandhi. “What has Congress done...for poor people...in...65 years old Yatra?” he asked.
