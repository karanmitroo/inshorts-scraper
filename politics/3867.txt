A day after joining Congress, former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday said he is a born Congressman and has come back to his roots. "People say Sidhu used to call party (BJP) mother; even Kaikeyi (in Ramayana) was a mother. Everyone knows who is Manthara in Punjab," he added. He also remembered his father who was a Congressman.
