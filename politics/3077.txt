BJP MP Vinay Katiyar on Monday said that though there are development, education and employment in Ayodhya, without Ram Temple everything is useless in the city. He further asserted that people in Ayodhya want the Ram Temple which will be constructed soon. Backing PM Modi for his "cremation-graveyard" remark, Katiyar said PM was talking in favour of both the communities.
