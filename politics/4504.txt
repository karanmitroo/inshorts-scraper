Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said that the extra space in jails in the state may soon be used for cow shelters. "This is to enable the inmates to work in gaushalas and earn money," he said after presiding over a monthly review meeting. The Haryana government is considering the proposal in this regard.
