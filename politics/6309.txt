BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday said he will post "few tweets for 1 week" to "concentrate" on cases like Ram Temple, National Herald, and Aircel-Maxis. This comes after PM Narendra Modi said that breaking party line to seek publicity is wrong, when asked about Swamy's tweets criticising Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan.
