Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday claimed the "real opposition" to the Goods and Services Tax Bill was within the government and the Congress was being used as a "smoke screen". He said the Congress was ready to lend support if its three recommendations are accepted. Ramesh also questioned the credibility of current GDP figures of 7.6%, calling them suspicious.
