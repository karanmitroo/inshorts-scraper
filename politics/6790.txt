Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi cancelled his visits to Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday saying he is "down with a highâ€‹ fever". He was scheduled to tour the union territory and states, ahead of the May 16 elections. This comes after the party's Puducherry unit received a death threat against Rahul.
