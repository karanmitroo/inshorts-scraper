Rejecting the 135-seat sharing formula offered by BJP for upcoming Maharashtra polls, Shiv Sena on Monday said it will fight on at least 150 seats in the 288- member Assembly. The BJP had offered the compromise formula after the Sena threatened to break their ties. Earlier on Saturday, Thackeray had expressed his desire to become the next Maharashtra CM.
