Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa has reportedly put her thumb impression on the election affidavit of an AIADMK nominee in an Assembly bypoll as her right hand is swollen and inflamed. Her thumb impression was authenticated by Dr P Balaji, a professor at Madras Medical College. Earlier, expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa had alleged that Jayalalithaaâ€™s signature might be misused.
