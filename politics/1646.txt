PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said everyone needs to rise above political differences and fight corruption together for India's bright future, especially Bihar. "This is the need of the hour and the nation," Modi tweeted. This comes after JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar resigned as Bihar CM following corruption charges on his alliance partner, RJD's Lalu Yadav and his family.
