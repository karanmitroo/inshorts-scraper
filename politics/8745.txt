Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan on Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was "incapable" of managing the affairs of the nation as he "could not douse the fire in his home state Gujarat". Azamâ€™s statement came while he was responding on the recent Patel reservation stir in Gujarat where nine people died in clashes with police.
