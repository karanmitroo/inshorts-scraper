BSP supremo Mayawati on Monday called PM Narendra Modi's Parivartan rally in Lucknow a flop show, alleging that the crowd at the rally was a "Bhade ki Bheed" (rented crowd). This comes after PM Modi hailed the crowd as "largest ever in his entire political career". Further, Modi had alleged that SP and BSP have joined hands to remove him.
