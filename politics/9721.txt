In yet another controversial statement, Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi said in an interview with the India Today group that more than 90% men go out on dates with other men's wives, and only 2-5% go with their own wives. He made the statement to defend his son, who was caught having an affair with a married policewoman in 2014.
