In a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari on Tuesday said Modi talks about 'Mann ki Baat' but does not do 'Kaam ki Baat'. Expressing unhappiness over Uttar Pradesh not being given adequate representation in PM Modi's Cabinet, Tiwari said, "[T]his is pure discrimination as several lawmakers have been inducted from Gujarat and other states."
