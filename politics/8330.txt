Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said that Amit Shah will continue as BJP’s president, regardless of the Bihar assembly election result. Adding that it was illogical to link assembly elections to the party's national president, he said, “Even when I was party president, the party won and lost assembly elections. But I was not evaluated on that basis.”
