Five more AIADMK parliamentarians have declared their support for Tamil Nadu's interim CM O Panneerselvam (OPS), taking the total number of MPs in his camp to ten. One of these MPs, R Lakshmanan, was later "relieved" from the post of district secretary of Villupuram (North) by CM-elect Sasikala Natarajan. Several star campaigners and actors, including Kamal Haasan, have backed Panneerselvam.
