Sehaj Umang Singh Bhatia, a 23-year-old Sikh youth, on Saturday attacked Congress leader Jagdish Tytler at a wedding in Delhi. Bhatia hurled verbal abuses at Tytler, who is an accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot case, and threw a glass at him. While the Congress leader escaped unhurt, the youth was detained and later released.
