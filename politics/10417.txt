The Supreme Court Tuesday disposed off Aam Aadmi Party's petition seeking dissolution of assembly and holding early elections. The SC said, "This is for Election Commission to decide the election schedule".  Delhi has been under the President's Rule since February, after Kejriwal's government quit on the issue of Jan Lokpal Bill. Polls are likely to be held by February 2015.
