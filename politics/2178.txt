BJP MP Giriraj Singh on Friday said that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's dream to turn India into Pakistan will not come true. His remark came after the Trinamool Congress chief vowed to "capture Delhi". "Why are you scared of Trinamool? That's because you know Trinamool will capture Delhi in the coming days," Mamata told BJP.
