The BJP Core Committee will meet at Nitin Gadkari's residence in Delhi on Tuesday, over the seat-sharing issue for upcoming  Maharashtra Assembly elections. The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance looks strained since Shiv Sena rejected the 135-seat sharing formula offered by BJP. Instead, it has demanded at least 150 seats in the 288 member Assembly.
