Attacking PM Narendra Modi over his "shamshan and karbristan" remarks, the Congress on Sunday alleged that he had "pulled down" the stature of the high office. "BJP is staring at an imminent defeat in Uttar Pradesh...and in desperation, Modi unleashed his divisive agenda," Congress leader Manpreet Badal said. It was high time that Modi behaved like a PM, he added.
