Finance minister Arun Jaitley was on Monday discharged from AIIMS and he went straight to his new official residence on Krishna Menon Marg. The 61-yr-old was admitted to the isolation unit of AIIMS last week after he had complained of respiratory problems following his stay in a private hospital. Jaitley is expected to attend office in the next few days.
