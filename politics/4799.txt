Samajwadi Party leader and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said there is nothing better than cycling during "notebandi". Yadav was inaugurating a 207-km bicycle highway from Agra to Etawah, touted as Asia's longest. Taking a jibe at opposition leaders, Yadav said if BSP leader Mayawati and BJP members came on cycles, it will add to Samajwadi party's publicity.
