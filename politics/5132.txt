On the 32nd death anniversary of ex-PM Indira Gandhi, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Monday led a march from party headquarters at Akbar Road to Indira Gandhi memorial museum at Safdarjung Road. “She laid down her life, fighting for India's unity... we salute her martyrdom,” said the party. Indira Gandhi’s memorial, Shakti Sthal, is closed due to bird flu scare.
