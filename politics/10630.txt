Prafulla Chandra Gahdai, senior leader and vice president of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), was expelled from the party "with immediate effect" on Saturday, by Odisha Chief Minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik. The move comes as a result of Ghadai's statement, against the party and its leadership, that he gave to a local newspaper.
