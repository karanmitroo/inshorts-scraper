Assam Assembly Speaker Pranab Gogoi suspended six BJP MLAs and nine Congress MLAs after they tried to disrupt Question hour and demanded a discussion on "deteriorating law and order situation" in the state. A BJP MLA alleged that "Hindi-speaking people are being tortured and Jehadi activities are on rise". The suspended Congress MLAs had recently declared their allegiance to BJP.
