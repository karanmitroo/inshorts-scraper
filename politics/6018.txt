JD(U) MP Sharad Yadav has said that the crowd seen during Kanwar Yatras is due to unemployment. “If they had employment, they would not have been on the streets,” he said. His remarks, later, drew flak from various spiritual leaders and entities. During Shravan month, Kanwariyas carry Ganga water on their shoulders and offer it to Lord Shiva.
