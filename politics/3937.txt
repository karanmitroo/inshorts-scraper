Union Minister Uma Bharti on Friday said PM Narendra Modi doesn't intend to make Ganga a BJP poll plank in poll-bound UP. "The issue of the Ganga is such that all political parties, the media and people of all castes and communities are involved in it," she stated. "He (PM) has always told me Ganga is beyond politics," she added.
