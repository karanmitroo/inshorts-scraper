With not a single Muslim elected as MP from Samajwadi Party, party supremo Mulayam Singh has reportedly aborted plans of fielding the grandson of his late elder brother, from either of the two seats from which he won. Instead, Mulayam is now planning to field either Azam Khan or Shafiq-ur-Rehman Burq after vacating one of the two seats, sources said.
