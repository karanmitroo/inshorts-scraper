Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday alleged that the Election Commission has "completely surrendered" before PM Narendra Modi. He further termed the poll panel as "completely shameless and spineless". Kejriwal further tweeted, "As per EC notification, polling time in Goa is 7 am to 5 pm but in Punjab, it's from 8 am to 5 pm (one hour less). Why?"
