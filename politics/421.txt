AIADMK leaders and Tamil Nadu CM K Palaniswami and Deputy CM O Panneerselvam sacked over 140 party functionaries on Saturday for bringing 'disrepute' to the party. The office bearers belonged to different organisational units in Tuticorin district. This comes a day after 53 party workers were expelled from Kancheepuram Central unit and five from AIADMK's trade union wing.
