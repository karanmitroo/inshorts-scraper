Speaking at a party rally in Kolkata Wednesday, BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi blamed the Gandhi family for twice denying the opportunity to Pranab Mukherjee to be the country's PM. Modi said that in 1984 (when Indira Gandhi was assassinated) and in 2004, Pranab should have been sworn as the country's PM, as he was the senior-most minister.
