JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Friday said talks with Hurriyat leaders can ensure a return of peace to the Kashmir valley. "The Hurriyat don’t have (a) single view, they have different views...if they want peace then they should talk with all kinds of peoples,” he said. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has not brought much change in the situation, Yadav added.
