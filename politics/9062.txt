Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday said it was not fair to link all the unnatural deaths in the state with the Vyapam scam. Chouhan's statement came hours after the death of a lady cop who got into police force through an exam conducted by Vyapam. Earlier, the Congress had demanded an SC-monitored CBI probe into the scam.
