Amid speculations of being made a prime ministerial candidate by a non-BJP front, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said he has no "dreams" to become Prime Minister. â€œI had only desired to become an MP at least once," he said. Kumar added that people were "uselessly" trying to defame him, as he has no "ambition" to be PM.
