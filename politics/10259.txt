J&K CM Omar Abdullah and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Sunday skipped the meeting for chief ministers chaired by PM Narendra Modi to discuss the structure and role of the new body that will replace the Planning Commission. While Abdullah cited ongoing J&K polls as his reason for absence, Mamata's decision comes amidst the ongoing stand-off between BJP and TMC.
