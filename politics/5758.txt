Punjab's Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has slammed the AAP by alleging that one-third of Delhi AAP MLAs, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had criminal cases pending against them. This comes after AAP minister Sandeep Kumar was removed following a sex-tape scandal on Wednesday. The SAD leaders also questioned AAP if "this was the leadership they aimed to replicate in Punjab."
