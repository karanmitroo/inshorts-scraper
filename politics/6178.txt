Telangana BJP on Wednesday launched a signature campaign against terrorism and demanded AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s arrest for offering legal aid to alleged IS members. BJP reportedly expects to collect one lakh signatures. Earlier, a case of sedition was registered against Owaisi on July 15, stating that his remarks are “boosting the morale of anti-nationals” and “giving oxygen to terrorists”.
