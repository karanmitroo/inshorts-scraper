AAP chief Arvind Kerjiwal Friday replied to a complaint filed by Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhay to the Election Commission, saying it was malafide and motivated. Kejriwal said he had documents to support his claim of ‘conflict of interest’ over the supply of electricity meters by Upadhyay’s company to Delhi discoms. He added that he did so in “public good”.
