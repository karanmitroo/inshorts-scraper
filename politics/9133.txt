Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said that the Emergency (1975-1977) was the darkest phase of independent India and that such kind of dictatorship is not possible now. "I think, today the global awareness is in favour of the democracy," Jaitley added. His statement came days after senior BJP leader LK Advani said that Emergency-like situation could emerge again.
