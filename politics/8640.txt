Minister of Human Resource Development Smriti Irani on Saturday claimed Subramanian Swamy wasn't young enough to be made JNU Vice-Chancellor, dismissing allegations that the BJP leader was being considered for the post. She added that nominations for the post were made by a "search and select committee". Swamy had earlier said that there had been "no formal offer".
