Posters claiming that Union Minister Sushma Swaraj was 'missing' have come up in her constituency in Madhya Pradesh's Vidisha. The posters list the problems of the people in the district and were reportedly put up due to Swaraj's long absence in the constituency. Similar 'missing' posters of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi were put up in their constituencies as well.
