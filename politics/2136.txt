Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Tuesday condemned Pakistan's move of mutilating Indian soldiers and said their families should be adopted by the nation for social and moral support. "In this situation when we are at war, the families of the martyred soldiers become the family of the nation...I'd want to tell them that, they are not alone," Bedi added.
