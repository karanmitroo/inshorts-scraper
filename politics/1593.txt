Rajya Sabha MP and former Samajwadi Party General Secretary Amar Singh has likened SP chief Akhilesh Yadav to Aurangzeb and said his father Mulayam Singh Yadav was like Shah Jahan. "One who cannot honour his father loses trust of people as well," he added. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb had held his father Shah Jahan captive after a tussle for the throne.
