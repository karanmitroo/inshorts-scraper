A Cabinet meeting chaired by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday approved the release of â‚¹1,137.25 crore, towards the payment of salaries of 2.66 lakh contractual teachers. Education Minister Ashok Choudhary said the funds had to be taken from the state's treasury as the Centre refused to provide its share and the payment was being held for the same reason.
