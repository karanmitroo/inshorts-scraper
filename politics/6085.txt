The Patna High Court on Thursday cancelled the Lok Sabha membership of Chhedi Paswan, the BJP MP from Bihar’s Sasaram parliamentary constituency. The court held Paswan’s election as “null and void” for "suppressing" details of criminal cases pending against himself while filing his election affidavit. Paswan had defeated the then Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar in the 2014 general elections.
