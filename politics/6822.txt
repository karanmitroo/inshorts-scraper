The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP, on Monday called for a shutdown in Bihar's Gaya city over the killing of a trader's teenaged son. He was allegedly murdered by a ruling party legislator’s son for overtaking his car. The BJP workers burnt tyres, blocked roads and claimed that “jungle raj” had returned to the state.
