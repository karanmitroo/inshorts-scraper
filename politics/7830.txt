Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday claimed that the CBI is now formulating plans to raid the office of either Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia or Health Minister Satyendra Jain. Citing PMO sources, Kejriwal tweeted, "Officers under them being pressurized to get something wrong signed from them". Last month, the CBI had raided Kejriwal's Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar's office.
