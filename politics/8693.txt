The Election Commission has denied Congress’ request to ban PM Narendra Modi’s radio programme Mann ki Baat until the Bihar assembly elections are over. The EC said that it can take “cognizance” of such a demand only if the programme is found violating the Model Code of Conduct. Congress had made a similar demand during the Haryana polls last year.
