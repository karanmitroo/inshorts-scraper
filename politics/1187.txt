Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that the problems with Indian Railways are not one or two years old, but accumulated over the years and were given as inheritance in 2014. Goyal further questioned those opposing the bullet train asking them if they want people to be unsafe and whether they still believe in a 100-year-old technology.
