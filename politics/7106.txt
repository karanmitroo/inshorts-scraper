MNS Chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday challenged AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi saying, "Come to Maharashtra, I will put a knife to your throat." This comes after Owaisi's statement that he would not chant 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' even if a knife is put to his throat. Thackeray further alleged that the Owaisi brothers were being "financed by BJP".
