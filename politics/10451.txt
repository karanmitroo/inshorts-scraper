In a major political faux pas, the Aam Aadmi Party on Friday put a banner on its website with a slogan "Delhi Speaks: Modi for PM, Arvind for CM", asking people to vote for their party in the Delhi elections. However, the party later removed the banner from its website, after facing much social media outrage.
