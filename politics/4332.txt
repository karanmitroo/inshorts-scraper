The Left, JD(U), NCP, and SP has reportedly refused to attend the joint press conference scheduled to be held in Delhi by the Congress and the TMC against the Centre's demonetisation move on Tuesday. "We don't know what is the agenda of the press briefing. There's no common minimum programme. So how can we participate," JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said.
