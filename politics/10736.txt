The government has given BJP leader Subramanian Swamy around 40 CRPF commandos as a Z-category security under the central protectee list, said a home ministry official. Swamyâ€™s security has been enhanced after threats which come from his political activity, official added. Till now, Swamy enjoyed Z security in Tamil Nadu, but now his security cover has been extended across India.
