A day after asserting that he would ensure supply of "quality beef" if elected, BJP candidate in the Kerala's Malappuram by-poll, Sreeprakash, on Monday clarified he was against cow slaughter. "My words have been distorted...What I meant was quality food should be provided to the people," he said. Kerala BJP leadership, however, said a clarification would be sought from Sreeprakash.
