Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav slammed former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju for insulting the state by asking Pakistan to take both Kashmir and Bihar or nothing. "Bihar has always shown the way to the country in good and bad times. The state may be devoid of resources but it does not mean anyone can lambast it," Yadav said.
