Following alleged police action against Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum (Karnataka) on Sunday, Shiv Sena members created uproar in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, leading to disruption of the Question Hour. They shouted slogans against Karnataka govt and demanded suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue. However as the pandemonium continued, the speaker adjourned the House till noon.
