Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday asked PM Narendra Modi where the â‚¹55,000 crore meant for the Vanbandhu scheme for tribal population went. This was the tenth in the series of questions Gandhi has started posing to PM Modi daily. The tribal population doesn't have schools or hospitals and they haven't been provided houses or jobs, he added.
