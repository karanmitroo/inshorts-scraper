Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was heading for a split in the state as it was being run by the 'outsiders' (non-Punjabis). "The way tickets were announced while ignoring the state chief, only showed the arrogance the AAP leaders from UP and Haryana were exhibiting towards the Punjabi leadership," he added.
