Gujarat Congress President Bharatsinh Solanki on Sunday said he will not be contesting the Assembly elections in December. Solanki denied reports he was unhappy with party high command's selection of candidates. Reports said Solanki's declaration is significant since the Congress has delayed releasing its first list of candidates, with only two days left for filing nominations for the first phase.
