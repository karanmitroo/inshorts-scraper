Janata Dal (United) spokesperson KC Tyagi said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar would have become the Manmohan Singh of UPA-2 if they had continued with the 'Mahagathbandhan', after charges of corruption surfaced against Tejashwi Yadav. Slamming Sharad Yadav's stand on secularism, he said, "Yadav won from Madhepura with the BJP's support in 1999. Why wasn't communalism an issue then?"
