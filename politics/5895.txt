Recalling his short attempt in singing during his high school days, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that it’s been 34 years now and he still can’t sing. “I didn't know how to sing…until someone shouted, "Arre sing something yaar”…I finished and…someone shouted: "That's not music that's just noise”," he shared.
