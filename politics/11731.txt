Baba Ramdev on Sunday took a dig at BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi by terming him as a man in a hurry to be PM, and by expressing disappointment over party nominations going to "tainted" candidates. The move came after BJP reportedly did not field Ramdevâ€™s candidates stating that they cannot sacrifice the party's interests to appease "someone's outsize ego".
