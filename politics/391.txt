Congress MP Jairam Ramesh has said that the senior leaders in the party should act as "mentors and not tormentors". He added that the party should ensure that young leaders take over the party's reins before the 2019 general elections. "The old people in the Congress...are the people who can advise, guide. They have seen the world," he said.
