Over a month after the death of former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, her niece Deepa Jayakumar on Tuesday confirmed that she would enter politics. Jayakumar asserted that "a landmark announcement" would be made on February 24, Jayalalithaa's birthday. "AIADMK cadres are already welcoming me," she asserted. Notably, Jayakumar was allegedly not allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was hospitalised.
