Congress on Thursday demanded PM Narendra Modi apologise to the nation for the "suffering" caused to the people by demonetisation, when he speaks on the New Year eve post the end of the 50-day period. Adding that PM Modi's announcements are far from reality, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said note ban has turned out to be Deshbandi (lockdown of country).
