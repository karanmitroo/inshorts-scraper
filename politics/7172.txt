The BJP on Monday slammed the RJD over the induction of murder convict Mohammad Shahabuddin in its national executive. "It is unfortunate that a party which is ruling Bihar has entrusted the party role to Shahabuddin," BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Notably, Shahabuddin has been serving a life sentence after being convicted for several cases of murder and kidnapping.
