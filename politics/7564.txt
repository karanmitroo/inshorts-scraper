The newly sworn-in Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Kalikho Pul, will on Thursday face a floor test to prove his majority in the assembly. A new speaker will also be elected as the position is vacant since December 16. President's Rule was earlier imposed in Arunachal after 21 dissident MLAs led by Pul revolted against the then CM Nabam Tuki.
