The AAP will “annihilate” the drug supply chain in Punjab within a month of getting elected, the party claimed in its Youth Manifesto for the 2017 Assembly election. The manifesto also promised 25 lakh jobs in five years, free WiFi in villages, a special law for ensuring imprisonment till death for drug dealers, new incubation centres, and a corruption-free administration.
