On the first day of the Parliament's Winter Session, Opposition leaders protested against the disqualification of rebel JD(U) leaders Sharad Yadav and Ali Anwar from the Rajya Sabha. As Rajya Sabha's proceedings convened, the Opposition began raising slogans of "Taanashahi nahin chalegi" (Dictatorship will not work), forcing Vice President Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the House till 12 pm.
