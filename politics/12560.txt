Around 12 crore youths will be eligible to vote for the first time in the 2014 Lok Sabha  elections, according to the 2011 census. Since no single party garnered more than 12 crore votes in the 2009 polls, the first time voters may play a key role if they all vote. Currently the national total is under 79 crore votes.
