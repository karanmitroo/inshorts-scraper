Jammu & Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President Mehbooba Mufti Sayeed on Saturday demanded a check on "fringe elements" acting in the name of Hinduism in India. She drew parallels to the misuse of “the name of Islam… in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq”. Mufti further said that the Bihar elections did a "great job" to the "fringe elements" misusing Hinduism.
