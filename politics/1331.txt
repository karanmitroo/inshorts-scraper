The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday demanded that the BJP-led Maharashtra government waive farmers' loans before October 1, failing which it threatened to stage a statewide agitation. The party has also demanded a comprehensive list of farmers who are eligible for the waiver. Notably, 51 lakh farmers in Maharashtra have applied for loan waivers.
