BJP leader Ananth Kumar on Saturday accused Congress and CPI(M) of engaging in "politics of convenience and opportunism" in West Bengal and Kerala, and said their days are numbered. While there is a direct alliance in Bengal, in Kerala there is an “indirect, underground and hidden” alliance, he said. "In this election, they have shown their real colours", Kumar added.
