Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi on Wednesday said she was ready to become the BJP's CM nominee in Delhi if such an offer was made to her. The former team Anna member was asked if she would become the BJP's CM candidate in case of fresh elections in Delhi. BJP had projected Harsh Vardhan as its CM nominee last year.
