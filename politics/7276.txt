Sikh leader Simranjit Singh Mann has said followers of the Sikh religion "cannot" say 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' or 'Vande Mataram' as "Sikhs do not worship women in any form". He added that "Hindu religious scriptures like the Geeta should not be imposed on people from other religions as has been done in BJP-ruled Haryana".
