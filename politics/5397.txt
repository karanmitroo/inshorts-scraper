Samajwadi Partyâ€™s Uttar Pradesh President Shivpal Singh Yadav on Thursday announced the merger of the Quami Ekta Dal (QED) with his party to which CM Akhilesh Yadav had objected three months ago. The decision was taken after consultations with top party leaders, said Shivpal. Notably, QED was floated by gangster Mukhtar Ansari who was convicted in a murder case.
