Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday said he would have to take a bath if he even utters Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's name. "The Uttar Pradesh government works and discriminates on communal basis. To create their vote bank, the government plays the politics of appeasement and that is why the state's situation is poor," he added.
