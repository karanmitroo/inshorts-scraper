Following AAP's defeat in Delhi's MCD elections and the recently held Punjab Assembly polls, the party's Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh and his deputy Durgesh Pathak resigned on Thursday. This comes after AAP's Delhi unit Convenor resigned on Wednesday following the announcement of the results of the MCD polls. Notably, BJP won 181 of the 270 wards in the MCD polls.
