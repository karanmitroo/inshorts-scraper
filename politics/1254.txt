All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen President Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said that Rohingya refugees are entitled to the protection of fundamental rights after the Centre filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court terming Rohingyas as "illegal" immigrants. Calling it "an old propaganda of this government", he added that the affidavit "has no legal leg to stand" as it violated the constitution.
