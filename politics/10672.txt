The transparency watchdog, Central Information Commission (CIC), has issued notices to six political parties for failing to comply with its order, which brought them under RTI. The parties include BJP, Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, CPI (M), Communist Party of India and the BSP. In June 2013, CIC had declared the parties as public authorities and brought them under RTI.
