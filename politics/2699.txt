As many as 400 Trinamool Congress members, including 16 of the total 65 state committee members, joined the BJP in Tripura on Thursday. The members included former Chairman of TMC's state unit, Ratan Chakraborty. "BJP is the only political party in the country, which attached maximum importance to developing the backward North Eastern region," Chakraborty said.
