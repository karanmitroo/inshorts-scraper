BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain on Wednesday called Lalu Yadav the 'Super CM' of Bihar for acting as proxy for his health minister son Tej Pratap Yadav. Hussain was reacting to Lalu's direction to the civil surgeon of Darbhanga to reinstate four discontinued workers. This was "bound to happen", as CM Nitish Kumar's party has lesser seats than RJD, Hussain added.
