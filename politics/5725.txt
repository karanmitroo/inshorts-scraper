AAP MLA from Bijwasan, Colonel Devinder Sehrawat, in a letter to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, has claimed that the party's Punjab representatives are ‘exploiting women’ in return for tickets. However, the AAP has denied the allegations, calling them "absurd and baseless". Sehrawat also wrote to activist Anna Hazare, stating ministers and party convenors are involved in cases of “moral turpitude”.
