While addressing a rally in Bundelkhand on Monday, PM Modi said, "Let's break the cycle of SP-BSP and choose instead to make Uttar Pradesh an Uttam Pradesh." Asking people to get over this "trap", Modi added, "The SP and BSP both loot in their own turns, and when the other comes to power they never take action against the other."
