AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday chanted ‘Jai Patidar, Jai Sardar’ slogan during a public gathering in Gujarat’s Mehsana district. He also raised the issue of police firing on protesters in August 2015 in which 13 Patidar youths were killed. “Whoever ordered the firing should be booked,” said Kejriwal, prompting a “General Dyre…General Dyre” response from the crowd.
