BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday reportedly said the perception that intolerance was increasing in India was limited to “Lutyens' Zone”. Shah said, "Had such incidents taken place because of the BJP, RSS or VHP, then why are there no protests in Gujarat, MP, Rajasthan and Goa?" Authors returning awards were protesting the Samajwadi Party and Congress governments, he added.
