Speaking at a session on India's fiscal reforms, Congress leader P Chidambaram has alleged the Centre's 56-inch chest approach was responsible for the degrading law and order situation in Jammu and Kashmir. "Graph of violence in Jammu and Kashmir came down from 2010 to 2014...Only when they started adopting the macho, muscular 56" chhaati approach, things turned worse," he said.
