AAP has reportedly given ticket to retired IAS officer YS Khayalia to contest Lok Sabha from Hissar, Haryana). Khayalia is alleged to have overturned whistleblower IAS officer Ashok Khemkaâ€™s cancellation of mutation of land parcels allotted to Robert Vadra. The step has disillusioned supporters who joined AAP as part of its anti-corruption campaign. However, Khayalia vehemently denied overturning Khemka's decisions.
