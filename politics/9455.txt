Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday objected to the VIP treatment and large security cover provided to him. "I do not need so much of security, one security vehicle is enough for me. Anything more than that causes inconvenience to people," Parrikar said at a press conference after attending a BJP programme in Kanpur (UP).
