Congress leader P Chidambaram has called BJP a "cat on the wall", stating it should have learnt a lesson from its Bihar defeat. He further said that while Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance is strong and Mayawati-led BSP is surging ahead in Uttar Pradesh, BJP will be relegated to the third place. He also criticised the Centre's demonetisation policy.
