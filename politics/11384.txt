"Congress has a president and a vice-president, who is not only functioning but also active. Off course, Priyanka Gandhi is campaigning in two LS constituencies," Congress spokesperson Shashi Tharoor said Saturday, adding that she herself had restricted her role to the two seats. Asked if this meant Priyanka was not required, Tharoor said "there is no vacancy at the moment".
