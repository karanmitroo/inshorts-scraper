Late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa’s close aide Sasikala Natarajan was on Sunday formally appointed as the AIADMK’s General Secretary. "Amma is not with us now but our party will rule here for the next 100 years," Natarajan said while addressing the party workers. She also broke down while recounting her days with Jayalalithaa.
