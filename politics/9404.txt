Congress Saturday launched a website "Zameen Wapsi," in both Hindi and English, to provide information on the Land Acquisition Bill and counter the BJP government's claims on the issue. Party leader Jairam Ramesh, who launched the website, said, "This is our attempt to reach the people. We invite people to seek clarifications or air grievances on land issues."
