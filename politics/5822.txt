The SAD-BJP councillors have urged Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal to replace Kulwant Singh as the mayor of Mohali. They said they don’t trust Kulwant as he had earlier joined the Congress to become the mayor. They also requested Sukhbir to give the posts of deputy mayor and senior deputy mayor to the councillors who contested elections on the SAD-BJP symbol.
