Congress on Sunday attacked the Narendra Modi government over the forests fires in Uttarakhand, saying it has "miserably failed" to tackle one of the biggest environmental tragedies recently. On the other hand, the government is "fuelling the fire of political defection" in the peaceful state, Congress alleged. Over 5,500 hectares of valuable flora and fauna have been lost, it claimed.
