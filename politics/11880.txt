BJP on Wednesday appointed Harshvardhan as party president of its Delhi unit replacing Vijay Goel from the post. Harshvardhan will hold the dual charge of leader of the opposition and party chief, against the party's 'one-man-one- post' principle. His appointment is aimed at projecting a united leadership in Delhi thus ending the infighting in the party's unit.
