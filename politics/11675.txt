DMK chief M Karunanidhi on Tuesday expelled elder son MK Alagiri from the primary membership of the party for criticising the party and its leaders. "He continued the criticism despite getting several notices seeking explanation for his anti-party activities, which forced us to take the decision," Karunanidhi said. Alagiri was suspended for anti-party activities on January 23.
