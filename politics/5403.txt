BJP President Amit Shah on Friday condemned Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's remarks on the Indian Army and said, "Is 'dalali' a word to refer Indian army and their efforts to save the country?". "Some parties tried to question the surgical strikes, some even raised doubts. I condemn all those who have insulted our Indian Armed Forces," Shah further said.
