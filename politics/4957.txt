CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said that his political party does not demand a rollback of demonetisation, but a proper implementation of the same. "The consensus is that whatever has been done in demonetisation, is done without any preparation. If it'll take you 50 more days then what are the people going to do in that period?," Yechury questioned.
