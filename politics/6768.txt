The Congress Party has ruled out the possibility of a ban on the sale of alcohol in Puducherry saying it is not "feasible", after the party's manifesto was released. Notably, AINRC party's leader and Puducherry Chief Minister N Rangasamy had earlier said there is no scope for total prohibition as most of the state's revenue comes from liquor trade.
