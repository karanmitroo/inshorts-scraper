Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel has said he will take charge after BJP President Amit Shah assured him that he will be assigned portfolios suitable to his "stature". Patel, who had handled Finance and Urban Development departments in the previous government, was reportedly upset after being allotted road and building, health, medical education among other departments in the new government.
