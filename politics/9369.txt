Yoga guru Ramdev on Tuesday turned down the status of Cabinet minister offered to him by the Haryana government. Thanking the state government for the honour it offered, Ramdev said, "I want to serve you by remaining a ‘baba’ and a ‘fakir’. What you have given... very respectfully I want to hand it back to you."
