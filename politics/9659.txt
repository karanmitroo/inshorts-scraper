Minister of State (MoS) for External Affairs VK Singh Saturday said that activist Anna Hazare's platform is no more a social platform as it has become more political. "Hazare now shares the stage with leaders from Congress and Aam Aadmi Party, thus it cannot be called merely a social platform," said Singh.
