The Income Tax department on Thursday issued a notice to AAP asking why it should not be prosecuted for alleged falsification of account books and "wilful attempt" to evade tax on donations received by it. Issuing the show cause notice to AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal and three others, the department has sought reply by the first half of this month.
