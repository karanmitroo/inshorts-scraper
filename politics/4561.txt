BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Saturday led a delegation to Kashmir to continue the efforts to "empathise with the people of Kashmir" and also met the separatist leaders. This is the second visit of the Sinha-led delegation to Kashmir since late October. The delegation had earlier clarified that it carried no official brief to discuss the prevailing situation in Kashmir.
