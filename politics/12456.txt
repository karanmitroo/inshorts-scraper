Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi who wrote Sardar Patel's biography, said Patel wouldn't have recognized Modi as his ideological heir and been very "pained" with his behaviour towards Muslims. He added Mahatma chose Nehru over Patel as Nehru was better known internationally and Patel was 14-year older and in poor health. Gandhi, however, accepted that Congress has forgotten Patel.
