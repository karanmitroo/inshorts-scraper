The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday appointed comedian-actor Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi as the party's Punjab Convener. Ghuggi will replace Sucha Singh Chhotepur, who was removed from the post over a sting video that showed him allegedly taking bribes in exchange for poll tickets. Notably, Ghuggi had joined the AAP in February this year.
