A local court on Thursday directed police to book Samajwadi Party MLA Bheem Prasad Sonkar despite being given a clean chit by Uttar Pradesh Police earlier. The police had not registered an FIR claiming that Sonkar was in Lucknow on the day of the incident, following which the victim, his late brother's wife, approached the court.
