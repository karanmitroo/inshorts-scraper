The Assam unit of the Congress filed a police complaint against BJP MP Kamakhya Prasad Tasa for allegedly equating Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi with garbage. “The Congress washed the brains of people with garbage like Gandhi and Nehru without knowing the ideologies of Deendayal Upadhyaya,” Tasa had reportedly said at a public rally.
