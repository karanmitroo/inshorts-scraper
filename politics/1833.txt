The Congress sacked one of its leaders from Uttar Pradesh for referring to party Vice President Rahul Gandhi as 'Pappu' on WhatsApp. He praised Gandhi's visit to Mandsaur saying "Pappu could have been a minister or even the Prime Minister, but he did not go down that road. Instead, he put his life on the line by going to Mandsaur".
