Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) MP Tariq Hamid Karra on Thursday resigned from the party and Lok Sabha,Â accusing the Jammu and Kashmir government of failing to deal with the current unrest in the state. "I was feeling suffocated by the alliance and new avatar adorned by the PDP... The PDP has become a collaborator for fascist RSS-governed BJP," Karra said.
