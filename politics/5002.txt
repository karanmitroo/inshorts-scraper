West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has written a 32-line Bengali poem which criticises the government’s demonetisation policy. In the poem, she has referred to a ‘ruler’ as an ‘autocrat’ and asked whether he is deaf to the agony of the workers. “Be ready for a triple talaq from those who lost all following your decision,” the AITMC chief wrote.
