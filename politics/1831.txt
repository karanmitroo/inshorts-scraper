Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday offered to dissolve the state assembly and hold fresh elections if BJP was ready to do the same in Uttar Pradesh. This comes after UP Deputy CM KP Maurya had called for mid-term polls in Bihar. Notably, BJP and its allies had won 325 out of 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh earlier this year.
