A DSP, who served as the security in-charge at former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hoodaâ€™s residence from 2005 to 2014, has written a letter to the CBI, claiming he knows "a lot" about the Congress leader. He also stated that he is ready to testify against Hooda in alleged Manesar land scam. Hooda has, however, denied such allegations.
