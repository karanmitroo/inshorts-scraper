Baba Ramdev on Tuesday alleged that the crowd outside ATMs and banks have been sent by "Opposition parties" to defame PM Narendra Modi. Urging people to help the government to clean the system, Ramdev asked, "Can't we people face this difficulty for some days in nation's interest?" Earlier, Ramdev had said that the government could have handled demonetisation better.
