Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Sunday attacked the BJP government for giving a clean chit to MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the audio tape controversy, wherein he was seeking favours from other party leaders. "The BJP has always been giving a clean chit to their members. It can give a clean chit to Dawood Ibrahim as well," Digvijay said.
