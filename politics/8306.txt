BJP’s district secretary for Karnataka’s Shimoga city, SN Chanabasappa, has threatened to behead CM Siddaramaiah for supporting beef eating practises. Chanabasappa said, “Let him kill a cow and show, we will separate his head from his body and play football with it”. Siddaramaiah had, on Thursday, said that no one had the right to stop the practise of eating beef.
