Asserting that the Lord Ram issue would not benefit BJP in Uttar Pradesh, CPI(M) on Tuesday said people would vote for 'roti, kapda and makan', not for Ram museum. Party leader Sitaram Yechury alleged that the people of the state were well aware of BJP's gameplan. This comes after the government announced the construction of a Ram museum in Ayodhya.
