Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday asked PM Narendra Modi to stop writing love letters to Pakistan. Seeking political opportunism in the surgical strikes should be avoided, he said. “Take whatever action’s required against Pakistan…we as a nation are behind you,” he added. Please remember you are nation’s PM and not just a leader of your party, he further stated.
