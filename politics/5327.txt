Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman has explained that a complete ban on Chinese products was not possible because of the World Trade Organisation's rules. "This is regardless of problems India may have with any country at the political, diplomatic or military levels," she said. Sitharaman's comments came in response to demands from several politicians demanding boycott of 'Made In China' goods.
