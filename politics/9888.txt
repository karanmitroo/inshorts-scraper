Following the alleged conversion of over 100 tribals in West Bengal, an FIR has been lodged against VHP chief Pravin Togadia and functionary Jugal Kishore. The TMC had alleged that the VHP conducted a 'ghar wapsi' ceremony at Kharmadanga village in Birbhum district and ‘forcibly’ converted nearly 150 Christians. However, the Hindu outfit has refuted the charges of conversion.
