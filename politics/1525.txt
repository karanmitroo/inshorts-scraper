The Opposition has slammed BJP led Maharashtra government for removing the chapter on Mughals from classes VII and IX textbooks. The new textbook focuses on Maratha history, with a chapter called 'Ideal Ruler' dedicated to Shivaji. "The Removal of the Mughal chapter from text book is nothing but the saffron agenda of BJP and RSS," said SP MLA Abu Azmi.
