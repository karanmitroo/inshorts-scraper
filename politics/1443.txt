The Shiv Sena slammed Goa CM Manohar Parrikar for saying that he has the option of returning as Defence Minister if he loses the Panaji by-poll. Uddhav Thackeray said in the editorial that Parrikar's statement has "insulted" Goa's CM post and "degraded" Defence Minister's post. "Is the defence minister's post so cheap and orphaned?" he questioned in the editorial.
