The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday alleged that the Uttarakhand government headed by former Chief Minister Harish Rawat had supported "land and liquor mafias" and had indulged in "corrupt activities" like "Baghdadis". Uttarakhand BJP President Ajay Bhatt said that Rawat had turned a blind eye towards such activities and that the Congress legislators were minting money.
