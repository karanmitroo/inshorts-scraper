Rebel AAP leader Prashant Bhushan Tuesday said that the AAP was not just Arvind Kejriwal's party. "Yes he worked hard, but so did thousands of other people," Bhushan said, while addressing "Swaraj Samvad" (or self-rule dialogue) meeting. "Today we have heard that we have been thrown out of AAP for organising this samvaad," Bhushan added.
