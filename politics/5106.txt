Addressing a gathering over the protest for the missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said, “The BJP does not belong to anyone…if needed they will even sell their father”. He further accused the BJP of polarising the society by dividing Hindus and Muslims. “The government is always scared of people’s unity,” he added.
