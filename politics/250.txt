Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has said he knew from the beginning that his Grand Alliance with RJD and Congress "wouldn't last for more than a year and a half." "I still managed to carry on for 20 months," he added. The alliance ended after Kumar resigned as the CM last year and allied with BJP to form the state government.
