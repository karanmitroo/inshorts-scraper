The CPI(M)-led LDF government in Kerala, on Wednesday, criticised the demonetisation of ₹1,000 and ₹500 currency notes by the Centre, saying the move would not wipe out black money from the country. "It is an absurdity to think that unaccounted money in the country is only kept in ₹1,000 and ₹500 denominations," Kerala Finance Minister TM Thomas Isaac said.
