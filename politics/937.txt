Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's speech terming demonetisation as "an organised loot and a legalised plunder" was scripted. "We have seen Manmohan Singh work for 10 years...These are not his words," Prasad said. Incidents of stone pelting have declined in Kashmir and Naxal activities have dipped due to demonetisation, Prasad added.
