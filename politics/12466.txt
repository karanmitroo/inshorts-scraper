The Election Commision, on Monday, clarified that candidates securing most votes would be declared elected even if the None of The Above (NOTA) option (available this year onwards) had a majority. Also, if the number of contestants equals the number of empty seats, the Returning Officer would declare all of them duly elected. The NOTA-option is irrelevant in such cases.
