Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday accused PM Narendra Modi’s government of being “arrogant” for signing a peace accord with the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland without consulting the chief minister of the state. The peace treaty was in the offing for almost two decades and is said to have ended six decades of insurgency.
