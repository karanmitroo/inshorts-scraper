Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said GST (Goods and Services Tax) means 'growing stronger together'. GST shows that good can be achieved when all parties come together and work for the nation, he further said. "Just as rain brings typical fragrance from the earth, GST's successful launch would give new enthusiasm to the Monsoon Session," he added.
