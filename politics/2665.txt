Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who allegedly assaulted an Air India staffer, on Friday refused to apologise, stating "It's not my mistake, first they (Air India) should apologise". Meanwhile, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said that the incident occurred outside the Parliament, hence she will ascertain details and act on any complaint.
