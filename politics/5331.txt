The BJP on Saturday said that Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav has no confidence in his son, UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, as he has sensed his party's 'sinking ship'. This comes after the SP chief said the party will decide its UP CM candidate after the Assembly elections. People want to get rid of family politics now, BJP added.
