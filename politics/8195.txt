BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday called Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi a 'rising star' even as he tweeted his best wishes to RJD chief Lalu Yadav and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for the swearing-in ceremony on Friday. Apologising for not being able to attend it, Sinha said it was a "victory of democracy" and Nitish-Lalu will remain his "friends".
