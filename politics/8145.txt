AAP spokesman Raghav Chadha retaliated to Prashant and his father Shanti Bhushan's comments regarding the Janlokpal draft, and said on Saturday that Prashant Bhushan should join the BJP. Chadha claimed, "This is the same bill which was introduced by the AAP government" in 2014. The father-son duo had earlier accused the AAP of diluting the provisions of the draft.
