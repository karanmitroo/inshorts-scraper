The Shiv Sena on Monday said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' that the BJP should clarify its policy towards its allies on whether their friendship is needed or not. The Shiv Sena further said that those who speak against the BJP should not be termed as anti-nationals or else whatever is left of democracy will also be lost.
