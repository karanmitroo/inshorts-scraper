The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice to the Madhya Pradesh high court judge, who is accused of sexual harassment by a Gwalior woman judge. The apex court stayed a committee appointed to probe the allegations against the HC judge, who has refuted all accusations, and has even claimed to accept a "death penalty" if the charges are proved.
