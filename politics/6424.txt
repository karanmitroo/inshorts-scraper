Congress leader Sheila Dikshit on Friday said that she was ready to play "any role" in the poll-bound states of UP or Punjab. "Time is running out...decisions regarding our strategy in both Punjab and Uttar Pradesh should be taken as soon as possible,” she added. This comes amid speculations of her being the party's chief ministerial candidate for UP.
