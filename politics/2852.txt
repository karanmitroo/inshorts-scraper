After BJP's landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh, the Janata Dal (United) on Sunday urged all the forces which are against the BJP to unite. "We want the politics of divide should be responded with the unison of all the parties. If anti-BJP parties are divided...they cannot respond to divisive politics by the BJP," said JD (U) leader Ali Anwar.
