AAP Convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged all Dalit MPs of BJP to resign in protest against the assaults on the community by ‘BJP goons’. His remarks came a day after BJP MP Udit Raj said that the Hindu religion is in danger not because of conversion but because of its "so-called protectors".
