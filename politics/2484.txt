National Conference President Farooq Abdullah on Wednesday said, "Tourism is our (Kashmiris) life no doubt about that but a stone pelter has nothing to do with tourism." "They'll risk starvation, but will throw stones," he added. His remarks came after PM Narendra Modi urged youth of Kashmir to choose between tourism and terrorism.
