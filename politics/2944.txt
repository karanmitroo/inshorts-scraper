Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav has reportedly hinted at the possible alliance with Mayawati-led BSP. He said he's open to all possibilities to prevent BJP from forming a government. "As I have always referred to the BSP chief as a relative, it is natural for people to think we might take their help or might go with them," he said.
