Amid mounting rumours about Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa's health, the AIADMK has launched a social media campaign to counter the speculation that the 68-year-old leader is seriously ill or has an incurable disease. The party tweeted a link on Monday that allows users to change their profile photos on twitter to say "My CM is fine" and "No more rumours".
