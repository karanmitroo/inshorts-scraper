Aligarh BJP MP Satish Gautam has asked the Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) not to allow students to follow students at JNU and organise "anti-national" and "anti-BJP" activities. Recently, only those personalities with anti-BJP views have been invited to the AMU campus, he added. Vice-Chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah, however, denied any anti-national activities inside the campus.
