"Over half" of the "ministers and legislators" of the Grand Alliance in Bihar are "habitual boozers", BJP leader Sushil Modi alleged on Tuesday. His comments follow a Congress MLA being caught on camera, allegedly offering liquor to his guests. Notably, the Nitish Kumar government had recently ordered a total prohibition on the production and sale of liquor in the state.
