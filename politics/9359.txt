The right-wing Hindu nationalist group VHP on Tuesday offered to rebuild temples, shrines and residential buildings in Nepal which have been damaged following Saturday's strong earthquake. The organisation has also said that it will bring orphaned children from Nepal to India and will provide free boarding and education to them in its numerous educational institutions spread across the country.
