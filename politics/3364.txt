Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday campaigned for his brother Shivpal Singh Yadav in Etawah and also sought votes for a Lok Dal candidate. He, however, didn't mention UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's name. This came amid reports that some Mulayam's loyalists, who were denied tickets by the SP, are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket.
