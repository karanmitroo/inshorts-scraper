AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal made MP Bhagwant Mann the party's Punjab chief, on the condition that he would quit drinking. Mann was reportedly told that he would be removed from the post if he is found drinking in the future. Notably, Mann has repeatedly slammed the party leadership for functioning like a "mohalla cricket team", among other things.
