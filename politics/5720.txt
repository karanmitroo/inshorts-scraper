The BJP has questioned Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's silence over party leader Ashutosh's blog controversy. Demanding an apology, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra termed the blog's content as "shameful and inexcusable". In the blog, Ashutosh cited Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee to defend AAP minister Sandeep Kumar who recently landed in an 'objectionable' CD row.
