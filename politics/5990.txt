Calling slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani "great and pious", ruling PDP MLA Mushtaq Ahmad Shah has said he was "not a terrorist". His party has “no ill will or grudge against the people mourning Wani’s death”, the MLA from Wani's hometown said. "I know how much people loved and respected him. Their mourning is justified," he added.
