Speaking on the issue of alleged EVM tampering, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, "I am an engineer from IIT, I can tell you 10 ways to tamper with EVMs." He further said, "When an independent candidate in Pune, who got zero votes, is asking where his vote has gone, why shouldn't we question EVM? We cannot shut our eyes."
