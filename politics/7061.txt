The Congress, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), and a section of intellectuals in West Bengal on Thursday demanded that the Election Commission remove state Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Sunil Gupta. Other opposition parties, including the BJP, also complained against Gupta. “We never found CEO’s office taking any stern action against the misdeeds of the ruling party," a CPI(M) leader alleged.
