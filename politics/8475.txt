Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda's plea to summon ex-PM Manmohan Singh in the coal block allocation scam case was rejected by a special court on Friday. â€œIn the facts and circumstances of the present case, this court does not find any prima facie case to summon Dr. Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister, as an accused," the court said.
