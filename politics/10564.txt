Attacking its former ally BJP, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray Monday likened the ongoing poll campaign in Maharashtra by PM Narendra Modi's Cabinet, to an assault by Bijapur general Afzal Khan's army on Shivaji's dominion in the 17th century. He alleged that their whole intention is "to break the state into pieces" in the name of bringing progress and development.
