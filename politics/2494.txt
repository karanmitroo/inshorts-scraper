Stating that the split in the Samajwadi Party was now complete, expelled leader Amar Singh on Wednesday said he will never return to the party. "Once I was expelled by the father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and then by the son (Akhilesh Yadav)...I would prefer sitting at home than going back to them," Singh added.
