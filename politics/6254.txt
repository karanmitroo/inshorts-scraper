Punjab Congress' President and ex-CM Amarinder Singh on Thursday said the party should contest the 2017 Assembly elections on its own. However, he added that the final decision on contesting the polls will be taken by All India Congress Committee President Sonia Gandhi. Further, he said he would invite Priyanka Gandhi to address rallies in Punjab, as she's a 'crowd-puller'.
