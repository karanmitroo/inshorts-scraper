Former AAP Punjab convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur on Saturday launched a regional political party, Aapna Punjab Party (APP). This comes after Chhotepur was removed from the AAP Punjab chief post over a video that allegedly showed him accepting a bribe. Chhotepur said APP would contest on all the 117 seats in the Punjab Assembly elections under the Punjab Progressive Alliance.
