Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria on Sunday referred to ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as ‘sa**’ during a meeting of BJP workers in Churu. Post this, Congress leader and former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot sought action against Kataria, saying, “[H]e should be sacked...the BJP’s leaders…have literally crossed all limits”. Kataria later apologised​ for the “inappropriate” word.
