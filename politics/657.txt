After formally taking over as Congress President, Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that Congress took India to 21st century, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking the country back to the medieval times. "And if there is anyone who can stop what the BJP is doing, it is the 'pyara karyakarta and neta' (leader and workers) of Congress," he added.
