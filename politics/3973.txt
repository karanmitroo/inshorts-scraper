Rashtriya Lok Samta Party's MLA in Bihar, Lallan Paswan, on Monday posed some questions to an alleged rape victim's friends. He asked them, "from where was the blood coming out?" When the girls murmured "from the bottom," he asked, "what do you mean by bottom?" "If you don't reply properly, it's possible you may also get raped," he said.
