Playing his last card before resignation, Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi Saturday recommended the dissolution of state assembly in the Cabinet meeting. Two thirds of the ministers opposed Manjhi's proposal. Manjhi is likely to resign soon to make way for former CM Nitish Kumar. Manjhi and Kumar met earlier in the day amidst reports of an effort to patch-up.
