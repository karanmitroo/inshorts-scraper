Nothing is impossible, the Supreme Court said Friday, as it asked the BJP and Congress whether they could "join hands" and form a government together in Delhi. The court asked both parties to explore the possibility and issued them notice, while hearing an AAP petition challenging President's rule in Delhi. The matter has been posted for further hearing on April-1.
