Dukhtataran-e-Millat, a separatist outfit in Kashmir, has asked the people in Gulmarg to refrain from New Year celebrations, calling them a "cultural onslaught". "A night-long programme is being organised by some unknown group 'Kashmiryat'... these programs are being organised under an agenda devised by RSS to thrust upon Kashmir, the shameless and lewd culture," Chairperson of the outfit said.
