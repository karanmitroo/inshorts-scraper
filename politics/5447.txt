Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday praised Indian Army's strikes on terror launch pads and called it PM Narendra Modi's first step in two-and-half years worthy of a PM's stature. "I want to thank Modiji. My party and I stand with him, as what he has done is right... All of us stand firmly united against terrorism," Gandhi added.
