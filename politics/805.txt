Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday took a dig at Congress party, saying the party is slowly becoming extinct, while BJP has maintained its credibility. "The 10 years of governance before (Narendra) Modi Ji's government was the most corrupt government we have ever seen," Jaitley said, calling the then UPA government "a leaderless government".
