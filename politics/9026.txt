Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday accused the BJP and the Sangh Parivar of trying to create communal tension in Bihar to polarize the people on communal lines in the upcoming Assembly polls. The CM further added that he had seen a pattern in this regard ever since the JD(U) walked out of the NDA in 2013.
