J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the "most focused" PM as far as the issues of Jammu and Kashmir are concerned. Comparing former PMs, Mufti added, "He is so focused that he called Chief Secretary of J&K twice to know about rehabilitation of people due to Krishen Ganga Power Project in Valley."
