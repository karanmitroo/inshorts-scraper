Jat leaders on Thursday said they would protest and work for the "defeat" of the BJP in 2017 assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. One of the leaders alleged the party has "cheated the Jats" over the reservation issue in Haryana. However, Jats will not ask the community to vote in favour of any particular party, another leader added.
