When asked by a reporter, as to whether he was planning to resign from the post of the Delhi law minister, Somnath Bharti Saturday commented on the reporter saying, "How much money were you paid by Modiji?" While Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal condemned Bhartiâ€™s words, the minister later apologized for his statement, saying he did not mean that.
