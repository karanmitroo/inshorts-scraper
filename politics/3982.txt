Puducherry Congress chief A Namasivayam has said Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi is trying to be the union territory's "Super CM". This comes after Bedi said she has powers to overlook the legislature and that she is the final power in certain affairs of Puducherry. She cannot enjoy final power when there is an elected government in place, Namasivayam said.
