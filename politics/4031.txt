Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday asserted that he is the party chief while his son Akhilesh Yadav is the Uttar Pradesh CM. This comes after Akhilesh Yadav was declared the party chief in SP's national convention. Mulayam said the convention was "unconstitutional" as it had been called by Ram Gopal Yadav, who was expelled from the party.
