The Congress on Wednesday alleged that terrorist activities in the country increased whenever BJP came to power at the Centre. Comparing the Pathankot attack with the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, former Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde slammed Modi's hypocrisy. "Modi ji used to say UPA ministers serving Biriyani to Pak, what now? He himself went to meet Nawaz Sharif," Shinde tweeted.
