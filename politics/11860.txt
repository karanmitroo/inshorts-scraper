Questioning former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's links with foreign agencies, BJP Delhi unit chief Harsh Vardhan on Monday said, "Is he a CIA agent or working for other foreign agencies including CIA? He already has received lakhs of dollars from the Ford Foundation." Vardhan's attack comes a day after the AAP leader attacked BJPâ€™s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.
