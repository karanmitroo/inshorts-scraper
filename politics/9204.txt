Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Wednesday attacked PM Narendra Modi by saying that he is camouflaging his failures by 'nautanki' or drama. Digvijay tweeted, "Don't understand the logic of mass yoga events by GOI (Govt of India)? Modi running out of ideas and camouflaging his failures by such nautanki." He further questioned why Yoga is being made a “religio-political” issue.
