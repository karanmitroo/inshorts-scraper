Former Home Minister P Chidambaram has claimed that a major surgical strike across the LoC took place in January 2013 during the UPA regime, but the then government chose not to go public about it. The Congress leader further added that it would be premature to describe the recent surgical strikes as a "paradigm shift" in India's policy towards Pakistan.
