The Congress on Sunday announced a 'Dalit Manifesto' ahead of the 2017 UP Assembly elections which promises free education to Dalits 'from KG to PG'. The manifesto also promises free houses equipped with toilets, drinking water, and electricity. The party also launched its 50-day 'Shiksha, Suraksha, Swabhiman' campaign that plans to reach out to Dalits in about 3,000 villages.
