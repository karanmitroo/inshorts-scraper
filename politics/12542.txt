Following criticism by Rahul Gandhi, Congress has decided to withdraw the ordinance that allows convicted parliamentarians to stay in office. "It's collective wisdom. We got feedback from across the country," said Congress spokesperson Renuka Chowdhury on the withdrawal of the ordinance. Earlier today, Rahul met the PM and apologized for the timing and language of his scathing censure.
