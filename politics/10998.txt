PM Narendra Modi's office has put on hold the appointments of private secretaries to ministers over debate whether to retain staff that has worked for ministers in the previous Congress-led regime. Those who are on hold include Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani. The appointments will be cleared only after scrutiny.
