Bahujan Samaj Party Chief Mayawati on Friday accused the current NDA government and the previous UPA government of helping businessman Vijay Mallya. "It seems like a conspiracy of the two entities. The NDA now has helped him to escape from the nation," Mayawati said. She also questioned the granting of a "heavy amount" loan to Mallya during the UPA regime.
