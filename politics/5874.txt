RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has advised the habitual drinkers to consume toddy, also known as tadi in Bihar, to avoid incidents like the hooch tragedy. Earlier, CM Nitish Kumar had banned the sale of toddy in the state, but after opposition from Lalu, the ban was lifted. At least 16 people were killed in Gopalganj hooch tragedy.
