The Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax department on Tuesday raided some firms associated with Congress leader P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram after one company Vasan Group transferred 1.5 lakh shares to Karti at a very low rate. Meanwhile, P Chidambaram has called the raid  a "malicious onslaught" against his family and asked the government to target him instead of Karti.
