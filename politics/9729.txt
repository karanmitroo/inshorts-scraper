The JDU workers staged a protest against PM Narendra Modi in Patna Sunday, blaming him for the political instability in the state. The protestors raised slogans against the PM and also burnt his dummy. "India is a democratic country and anyone who attacks democracy will meet the same end," said JDU's Ghulam Rasool Balyavi while signaling at the burnt dummy.
