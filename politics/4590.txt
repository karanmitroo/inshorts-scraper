President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday slammed the politicians for disrupting the Winter Session of the Parliament, saying, "For God's sake, do your job. You are meant to transact business in Parliament." Terming the practice of repeated adjournment 'totally unacceptable', Mukherjee added that people send their representatives to Parliament to work for the country and not to agitate.
