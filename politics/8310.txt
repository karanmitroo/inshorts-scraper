BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday sparked a controversy by comparing Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. "[T]here is no difference between the language of Shah Rukh Khan and Hafiz Saeed", Adityanath said. He added that if people boycott SRK's films, "he will also have to wander on streets like a normal Muslim".
