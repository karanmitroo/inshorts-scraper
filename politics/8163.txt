At a Parliamentary debate on Friday to celebrate the Constitution, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley referred to Emergency and the suspension of Article 21 (Right to life and liberty) to hit back at the Congress for 'intolerance' protests. Jaitley recalled Hitler's usage of the constitution to subvert democracy while adding that suspension of Article 21 was "dictatorship at its worst".
