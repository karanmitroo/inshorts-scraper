The Aam Aadmi Party cried foul after Amethi district administration on Monday night reportedly asked the family of Kumar Vishwas to leave the district. The district administration cited Election Commission rules to ask the AAP candidate's wife, children and others to move out of the constituency by 11 pm as they were not its "registered voters".
