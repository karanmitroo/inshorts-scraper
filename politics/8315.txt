Attacking Shah Rukh Khan for saying that there is "religious intolerance" in the country, yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Wednesday said the actor should give up his Padmashree Award if he feels so. "[H]e must also make a draft of all the money he made after winning the award and donate it to the Prime Minister's (relief) fund", Ramdev said.
