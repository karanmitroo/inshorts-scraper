Responding to reporters over law and order problems in UP, Samajwadi supremo Mulayam Singh said on Friday: " How can you expect a better law and order in a state with 21 crore population. Don't compare UP with Delhi. UP is ten times larger than the national capital. But in comparison to UP, Delhi has got ten times more crime."
