After her meeting with Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Greenpeace India campaigner Priya Pillai said on Friday that Rahul had assured them that he was with her organisation in their struggle. "He is really concerned about the way all this is happeningâ€¦ he will definitely join the fight to save democracy," Pillai added. The BJP, however, mocked Rahul Gandhi's move.
