Addressing a rally in Ghaziabad, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said he had thought UP CM Akhilesh Yadav is young and would work, but the latter disappointed him. "Girls are scared to go to schools. Your (Akhilesh) party has hooligans," he said. "What Akhilesh has done to his father, uncle and other relatives, everyone knows," he added.
