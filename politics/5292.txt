Police have slapped attempt to murder charges on four youths who attacked BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini with ink and allegedly manhandled him in Haryana's Kurukshetra district on Sunday. The accused reportedly said that they did not support any political party but were agitated over Saini's statements which 'disrupted social harmony'. Notably, Saini is a strong opponent of Jat reservation.
