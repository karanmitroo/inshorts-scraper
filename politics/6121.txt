Days after resigning from the Rajya Sabha, former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday said he resigned because he had been asked not to concentrate on Punjab. It was the third or the fourth time this had happened, he asserted. Sidhu, however, didn't comment if he has resigned from the BJP or if he would be joining the AAP.
