Suspended AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa's husband and lawyer were attacked outside AIADMK headquarters on Wednesday by party workers in Chennai. Pushpa recently said she will contest late CM J Jayalalithaa's aide Sasikala Natarajan for the party General Secretary post, which has remained vacant after Jayalalithaa's demise. Condemning the attack, Pushpa said, "I'm being denied an opportunity."
