The Uttarakhand government has "a close nexus with the mining, narcotics, liquor and timbre (sic) mafia," said BJP spokesperson Munna Singh Chauhan on Saturday. Chauhan said that Chief Minister Harish Rawat had withdrawn Governor KK Paul's decision to set up a police station in Tyuni, Dehradun district. The government did so to promote the interest of the mafia, Chauhan claimed.
