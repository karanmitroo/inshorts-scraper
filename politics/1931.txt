The Uttar Pradesh government today removed Saharanpur District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police after fresh clashes broke out in the area where a Dalit had been killed. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said, "No one will be spared, including politicians." Notably, the suspended police officer had taken charge of the post less than a month ago.
