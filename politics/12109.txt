AAP was exposed of doublespeak on Wednesday when senior leader Kumar Vishwas, on the Danish woman gang-rape issue, said that Delhi Police doesn't report to the Delhi CM. Previously Sheila Dixit was censured by AAP when she pointed that Delhi Police reported to the Centre and not the State government. Kejriwal refused to talk on this.
