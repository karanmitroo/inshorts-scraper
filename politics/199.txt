The Income Tax Department has sent a notice to Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi's wife seeking an explanation about â‚¹6-crore worth jewellery purchased from PNB fraud-accused Nirav Modi's showroom. Refuting any wrongdoing, Singhvi said he was being harassed as he was in the Opposition. Earlier, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said a firm linked to Singhvi's wife had dealings with Modi's firm.
