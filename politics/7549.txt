Former Union Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav on Thursday accused the BJP-led NDA government of derailing the railway sector, which acts as a "lifeline for all". He added that the Railways, which was made a 'Jersey cow', has seen a rise in expenditure and fall in income. He was reacting to the Railway Budget presented by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu.
