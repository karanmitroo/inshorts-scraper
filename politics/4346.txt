Congress leader Sheila Dikshit on Monday denied reports of withdrawing her name as the Congress CM candidate for the 2017 UP Assembly elections, reports said. This comes after reports suggested that Dikshit would withdraw her candidature as her name appeared in Congress' "Sahara list". The list mentioned the names of the politicians who received payments from Sahara Group in 2013-14.
