The BJP on Tuesday warned the Congress to cease playing politics over Kashmir, stating the fight is between India and the separatists, hence, it shouldnâ€™t be given communal colour. Further criticising the Congress, BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said, our government has got the Kashmir 'problem' in legacy as Congress has been doing politics over it for the past 68 years.
