Most of the Congress candidates, who had faced defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, have reportedly urged the party to contest the upcoming UP civic body polls alone. The party workers also blamed the alliance with Samajwadi Party for the party's poor performance in the Assembly election. Notably, the Congress won only seven seats in the 403-member UP Assembly.
