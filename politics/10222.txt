Senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Praveen Togadia said that efforts will be made to increase the population of Hindus in the country. "We're going to take percentage of Hindus to 100 in the country. Currently there are 82% Hindus in India, and we don't want this number to be halved. We won't tolerate Hindus becoming a minority," he said.
