Several miscreants hurled a petrol bomb at the residence of Padmanandan, a BJP functionary from Thiruverkadu in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The 48-year-old member of BJP's SC/ST wing was sleeping when he heard the sound of window panes breaking, following which the bombs were hurled into his house. The sofa, chairs, BJP flag, and other objects in the house were burnt.
