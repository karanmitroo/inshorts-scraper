Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said he would prefer to die than tolerate wrongdoings and added, "We will never ever compromise on our core values." He further said, "Sandeep Kumar betrayed the party, he betrayed the AAP movement and the trust people across the country have reposed on AAP." Kumar has been sacked over an 'objectionable CD' row.
