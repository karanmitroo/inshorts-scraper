The Election Commission has imposed several cuts in an AAP video before allowing the party to use it for the election campaign in Punjab. The video raises issues including drug problems, farmers suicides, and Dalit atrocities. The party was ordered to delete content depicting "personal attacks" on Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal and Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, among others.
