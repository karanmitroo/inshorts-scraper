West Bengal Governor KN Tripathi today said that every person should take care in making allegations against a responsible organisation like Army. "Don't let down the Army. Don't defame the Army," Tripathi added. His statement came after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioned the deployment of Army across the state and termed it as the Centre's revenge because she opposed demonetisation.
