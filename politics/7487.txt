External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Wednesday clarified that PM Narendra Modi had sought her opinion before visiting Pakistan in December last year, rejecting Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's remarks that even she was unaware of Modi's detour. "I told [PM Modi] that it would be an 'out of the box initiative' and he should go to Lahore," Swaraj added.
