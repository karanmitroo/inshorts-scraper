Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad reportedly booked a ticket on an Air India flight after it revoked the ban on the parliamentarian, but travelled by Rajdhani Express instead. Gaikwad's private secretary Krishna Nama said, "He travelled from Mumbai to Delhi in a train. He did it because he found it convenient. There is no other complexity in this issue."
