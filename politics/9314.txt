Addressing the Indian community in China, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday replied to the oppositions' criticism of his foreign trips. "People are asking why is Modi travelling to so many countries... it is my bad luck that I am being criticised for working more", he said.  Further, the PM asserted, "If working more is a crime, I'll keep doing it".
