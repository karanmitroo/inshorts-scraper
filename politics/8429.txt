Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief and ex-Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has said that the opposition's attack over Dalit killings and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s comments on reservation have created pressure on the NDA. “The opposition’s aggression has brought on the pressure of explaining these remarks; sometimes it becomes difficult, but people will ultimately see through this ruse,” he added.
