National carrier Air India on Thursday said an FIR has been lodged against Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad for hitting an airline staffer "25 times" with a slipper. Further, Air India also mentioned it was examining the creation of a 'no fly' list of unruly passengers. However, Gaikwad has asserted that the staffer had first misbehaved with him.
