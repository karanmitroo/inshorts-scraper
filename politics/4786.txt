Amid protests over demonetisation by Opposition parties in the Parliament, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said, "If the Opposition is so adamant, Prime Minister will come to the House and will intervene." Terming demonetisation as 'a fight against corruption', Rajnath added, "If you (Oppn) have a complaint on implementation then we're ready to debate, but don't doubt our integrity."
