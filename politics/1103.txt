Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said, "BJP's main organisation is the RSS. How many women members does it have? Have you seen a woman in shorts at their shakhas?" Addressing poll-bound Gujarat, Gandhi added, "Their thinking is that as long as women are silent, they are okay. As soon as a woman speaks out, they silence her."
