After BJP veterans blamed party's core team for Bihar poll debacle, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said that issues like these should have been raised in a party forum and not publicly. Acknowledging LK Advani's contribution to the party's growth, Naidu added, "They have not come out against Narendra Modi...The section of media has highlighted it as a headline."
