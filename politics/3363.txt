Late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's nurse in 2001, R Piramila Visagan, has said "blind allegations" were being levelled that AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan was behind Jayalalithaa's death. "Thirty-four years [Sasikala] was with [Jayalalithaa]...They were true companions, [and] loved each other," Visagan added. She also affirmed Sasikala holds the majority of MLAs and will carry Amma's legacy.
