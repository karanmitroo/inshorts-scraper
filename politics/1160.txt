BJP President Amit Shah took a jibe at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, saying that he should wear Gujarati spectacles and not the ones made in Italy to see the development in Gujarat. "If Rahul dreams of Gujarat, then to realise those dreams, he must visit Porbandar and not Italy," Shah further said.
