While celebrating his 59th birthday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday promised to bear the education cost of differently-abled children. "If these children want to get admission in medical college, engineering college, IIT, IIM, polytechnic or wherever they want; I will pay their education fee," the Chief Minister said.
