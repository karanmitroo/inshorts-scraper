PM Narendra Modi will launch BJP’s poll campaign for Haryana and Maharashtra by addressing rallies from Oct 4 to 13 where the party is seeking to form government on its own. Union Ministers and senior party leaders will also campaign for the party candidates in both the states. BJP has coined a slogan “chalo chalein Modi ke saath” for its campaign.
