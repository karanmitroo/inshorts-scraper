Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh on Sunday blamed the NDA government at the Centre for "causing instability" in the state. Singh added that the government's Act East policy has not changed anything in the last two years. Manipur, since last year, has been experiencing agitation over implementation of the Inner Line Permit that regulates the entry into the state.
