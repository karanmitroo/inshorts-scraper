The CPI(M) and TMC MPs on Tuesday hit out at each other in the Rajya Sabha over alleged strip-searching of female student leaders in West Bengal. Instead of treating them as activists, they were subjected to torture, a CPI(M) MP said. However, TMC objected to the issue's raising in the Parliament saying it didn't fall under the Centre's primary responsibility.
