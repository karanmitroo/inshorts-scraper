Hours after wishing PM Narendra Modi on his birthday, Congress leader Manish Tewari tweeted, "Is Se Khate Hain Ch***yon Ko Bhakt Bana Na or Bhakton Ko Permanent Ch***ya Bana Na -Jai Ho. Even Mahatma can not teach MODI Deshbhakti." This was in reply to a user who wrote, "Don't teach patriotism to Modi as it is in his DNA."
