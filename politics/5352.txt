In preparations for Lucknow's Vijay Dashami celebrations to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, a poster hailing him and Rajnath Singh as "avengers of Uri" has been put up at the venue. The banner also has the movie dialogue, "Yuva udna chahta hai, daudna chahta hai, girna bhi chahta hai bas rukna nahi chahta", written on it.
