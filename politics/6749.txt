The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the constitutional validity of the criminal defamation law which wasâ€‹ challenged by politicians including Subramanian Swamy, Rahul Gandhi, and Arvind Kejriwal. The three, who've been sued for political speeches, had argued against certain provisions of the defamation law, saying that the Constitution's Article 19(2) imposes reasonable restriction on free speech.
