Jashodaben Modi, wife of BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi, wishes to offer prayers at Ambaji along with her husband, but only if he agrees, says her brother Ashok Modi. "She gave up eating rice 40 years ago in the hope of reuniting with her husband - if not in this birth, then the next," Ashok added.
