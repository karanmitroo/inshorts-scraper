AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has strongly decried the new BJP poster which severely mocks his party, and has been printed in all major dailies in the city. Kejriwal has reacted sharply to a picture of Anna Hazare in the background, which has been garlanded- implying his death. He says that the BJP poster has been made in extreme bad taste.
