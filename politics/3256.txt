Criticising PM Narendra Modi for his "false promises", Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Thursday said, "Badshah (king) never tells lies and if he does, he isn't a badshah". "The Prime Minister made a false promise to people that (black) money (stashed in foreign banks) will be deposited in their bank accounts but nothing of the sort happened," he added.
