The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has launched its Nagaland unit in Dimapur in the presence of National Executive Committee member Habung Payeng. The party also elected a 13 membered executive body for the state. AAP would prove to be the alternative party for the Naga people who are fed up of regional parties, Payeng claimed.
