Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan has slammed RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav for comparing himself with Nelson Mandela and Ambedkar, saying they made sacrifices in national interest while Yadav was in jail for corruption. This comes after Yadav tweeted, "Had people like Nelson Mandela...failed in...efforts, history would have treated them as villains," after being convicted in the fodder scam case.
