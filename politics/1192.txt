BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday backed former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha for criticising the BJP-led Centre, saying, "He has shown the mirror to the government on economic condition." "[E]verything written by Mr Sinha is entirely in the party's and national interest. Only recently our PM Narendra Modi has reiterated that the nation is bigger than the party," Shatrughan added.
