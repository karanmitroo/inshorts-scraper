Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee challenged Narendra Modi, without taking his name, to deport any resident of West Bengal saying, "Let him touch any person, I will rock Delhi." She also accused the BJP's prime ministerial candidate of doing politics of division to disintegrate the region. Modi had earlier said that Bangladeshi migrants would be sent back.
