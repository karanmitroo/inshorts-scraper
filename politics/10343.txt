Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani was told by a Rajasthan-based astrologer on Monday that she will one day go on to become the President of India. The astrologer was the same person who had predicted some time back that Irani would become a minister. The 38-year-old minister was on a visit to Bhilwara (Rajasthan), where she met the astrologer.
