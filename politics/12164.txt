The Aam Aadmi Party Sunday declared its intention of contesting the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections by throwing open its primary membership to all citizens for free. A countrywide decentralised membership drive -- “main bhi aam aadmi” -- will be held from January 10-26. The party plans to contest at least 250 to 300 seats in 15 to 20 States.
