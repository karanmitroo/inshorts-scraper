The AAP and BJP have come together to set up a Bird Rescue Centre â€” a project first proposed by BJP MP Maneka Gandhi and being taken forward by AAP Minister Kapil Mishra in Delhi. The hospital will be spread over two acres of land and will treat the birds that fall prey to firecrackers and glass-coated kite manjha (strings).
