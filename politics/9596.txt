Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said Monday that J&K is a disputed territory and "not a part of India". Calling CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's praise of Hurriyat a 'political stunt', Geelani said, "No change would come to Kashmir, regardless of the government in power." He added that the accusations against separatist leader Masarat Alam are not true.
