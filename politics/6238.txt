BJP leader and ex-Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday said the government should issue a clarification regarding the GDP growth rate after a report by India's "best friend" US claimed that its 7.5% growth may be "overstated". Sinha added that "discrepancies" worth â‚¹1.4 lakh crore went into the GDP calculation in 2015-16 which may have inflated the growth.
