Slamming the ruling BJP, former Bihar CM Nitish Kumar Saturday said the party has put its senior leader LK Advani in cold storage by placing him in 'margdarshan mandal'. Nitish's statement came after BJP President Amit Shah blamed him for the return of "jungle raj" in Bihar as the JDU leader has joined hands with RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
