BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday said that BCCI President Shashank Manohar resigned owing to a Special Leave Petition filed by Swamy in the Supreme Court, alleging Manohar's "complicity" with former IPL Chief Lalit Modi. Manohar resigned as BCCI President today, seven months after taking over from late Jagmohan Dalmiya. He had in November replaced N Srinivasan as ICC Chairman.
