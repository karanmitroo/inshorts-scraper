With AAP attracting anti-incumbency votes, BJP leaders have decided to anoint Dr Harshvardhan as its CM candidate for the Delhi Assembly elections instead of Vijay Goel, India Today reported. Goel, who earned negative ratings in party's internal polls, also had meager 12% approval rating, much behind Kejriwal(21%) and Sheila Dixit(40%) in the India Today Opinion-polls.
