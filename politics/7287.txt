Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday said that "strongly committed atheist" and "fan of Lenin" Bhagat Singh would not have supported the BJP. Tharoor made the comments after his statements comparing Bhagat Singh to JNU's Kanhaiya Kumar. ".. I don't think that the BJP should have many ideas about Bhagat Singh. Perhaps they got them from Bollywood movies!", Tharoor said.
