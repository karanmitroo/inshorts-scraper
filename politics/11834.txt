Questioning Narendra Modi's handling of the post-Godhra riots in 2002, Union minister Salman Khurshid said, "Hamara aarop hai ki tum 'napunsak' (impotent) ho. (Our accusation is that you are impotent). You couldn't stop the killers". Khurshid's remark has invited sharp condemnation from BJP leaders, who have called it an "absolutely indecent comment", reflecting the "frustration" of the Congress leaders.
