Assam Governor Padmanabha Balakrishna Acharya on Monday criticised the Centre saying that it has cut down the Central fund released for the state's economic and industrial development. However, Acharya acknowledged the Centre's contribution in the growth of Assam and requested the Centre to provide 100% funding or to continue the Centre-State funding on 90:10 pattern.
