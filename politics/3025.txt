The NDA has called for a statewide dharna to demand the ouster of Bihar minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, for calling PM Narendra Modi a "Naxal" and a "dacoit". NDA hasn't allowed the state Assembly to function for three days over the issue. BJP accused CM Nitish Kumar of shielding the minister despite maintaining that he never frames or protects anyone.
