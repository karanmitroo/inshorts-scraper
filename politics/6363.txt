Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal who asked for a referendum on full statehood of Delhi on the lines of UK's referendum on Brexit was mocked on Twitter. "Sir forget UK, lets save America first. If there is anyone who can challenge Trump, its you!", a user wrote. "Should AAP exist or not!! Please ispe bhi referendum karwana," another user tweeted.
