Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday promised to end the economic blockade in Manipur if BJP is elected to power in the upcoming elections. He further accused Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh's government of colluding with those responsible for the blockade. "Manipur has been ruined in 15 years. Who is responsible? Congress did no development," PM Modi said.
