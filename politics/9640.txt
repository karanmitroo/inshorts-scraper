Nearly a week after he resigned as Bihar CM, Jitan Ram Manjhi on Saturday formed a political front called 'Hindustan Awaam Morcha' (HAM). After launching the party, Manjhi leveled allegations against CM Nitish Kumar. He said Nitish got the Bihar Nivas building in New Delhi washed with holy water from the River Ganges after he stepped down as Bihar CM.
