BSP President Mayawati has accused the BJP of “attempting to break its rival parties by using money power” and said the move will neither help the BJP politically nor “hurt the BSP's rising popularity”. “They should have learned their lesson from the result of Bihar,” Mayawati added. This comes after two senior BSP leaders left the party in two weeks.
