BSP supremo Mayawati on Sunday said that to divert the attention from its failures, the BJP government at the Centre can wage a war with Pakistan over Kashmir and terrorism. “The BJP can trigger Hindu-Muslim riots in UP before or during the Assembly elections,” she added. She further accused that the Modi government's schemes are benefitting only rich people.
