The Union Environment Minister Anil Dave on Tuesday said that the Central government cannot take a decision right now on Jallikattu, the bull-taming sport played in Tamil Nadu as part of the harvest festival Pongal. This comes after Centre was requested to pass an ordinance allowing Jallikattu, which was banned by the Supreme Court in 2014.
