While BJP MP Yogi Adityanath is campaigning for his party in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, his supporters are working to defeat BJP in the state, a report has claimed. Hindu Yuva Vahini, an outfit formed by Adityanath in 2002, has reportedly decided to field candidates in 64 constituencies of eastern UP against BJP for not projecting Adityanath as partyâ€™s CM face.
