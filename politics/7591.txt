Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah today said that being a Kashmiri Muslim is a "crime" enough to warrant questioning. His comment came after a BJP supporter demanded interrogation of JNU Students' Union Vice President Shehla Rashid, who is a Kashmiri Muslim. Abdullah further added that he would prepare for an interrogation as he is also a Kashmiri Muslim.
