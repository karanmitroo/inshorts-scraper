Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said that Make in India and hatred against minorities cannot go hand in hand as "outrageous" statements made by ruling party members could spoil India's image overseas. Speaking at Harvard University's annual Indian convention 2016, Tharoor added that enough progress is not being made and called for domestic problems to be addressed first.
