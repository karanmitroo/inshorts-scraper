The Times Now-C Voter poll, ABP-Nielsen poll and India Today-Cicero exit poll have put BJP ahead but short of a clear majority in Maharashtra and Haryana on Wednesday. A survey by Today's Chanakya, which had correctly predicted the Lok Sabha results, gave the party a clear majority (151 seats in Maharashtra, 52 in Haryana) in both states.
