Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Tuesday claimed that US First Daughter Ivanka Trump's remark stating that India has lifted 130 million citizens out of poverty was a compliment to the UPA regime. "She was referring to the UPA government's period of 2004 to 2014 (the number was 140 million)," Chidambaram tweeted.
