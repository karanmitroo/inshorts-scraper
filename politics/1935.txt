The Election Commission on Saturday threw an open challenge to political parties, who contested the five-state Assembly elections held recently, to hack the EVMs and announced to hold a hackathon for the same June 3 onwards. The EC said that the participants can pick any four EVMs of their choice from the recently-held state polls to tamper during the hackathon.
