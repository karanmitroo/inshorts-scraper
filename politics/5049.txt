Responding to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's criticism of the demonetisation of old high-denomination currency notes, BJP on Thursday said that he cannot understand currency demonetisation. "That is why people call Rahul Gandhi Pappu," party leader Prem Shukla said. "The fake currencies and black money will come to an end. The new money will be accounted," he added.
