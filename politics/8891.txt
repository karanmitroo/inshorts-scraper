The Vice-President of the Samajwadi Party's Maharashtra unit, Mohammed Ghosi, has been suspended for asking party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to nominate Yakub Memon’s widow as a Rajya Sabha MP. In a letter to Yadav, Ghosi had described Raheen Memon as “helpless”. "He will be asked to explain his stand, following which necessary action will be taken," the party said.
