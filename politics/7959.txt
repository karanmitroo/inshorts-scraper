The Indian National Congress was founded on December 28, 1885, during the British Raj in Bombay Presidency. Its founders included a prominent member of the Theosophical Society, Allan Octavian Hume, along with Dadabhai Naoroji and Dinshaw Wacha. Congress became India's dominant political party after independence in 1947 and has headed the central government for about 54 years since then.
