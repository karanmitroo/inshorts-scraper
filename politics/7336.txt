Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday asked Captain Amarinder Singh, Congress' chief ministerial candidate for the Punjab elections, to fight the "nexus of the government, police and drug peddlers" after coming to power. Gandhi said, "your first job should be to fight this nexus," as Punjab's youth would resort to drugs if they were not shown a "positive dream."
