Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "leave" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's side if he did not want to lose the support of traders. Kejriwal warned the BJP of "erosion" in its traders' support base. Notably, gold traders, jewellers, and artisans have been observing a strike demanding rollback of excise duty on non-silver jewellery.
