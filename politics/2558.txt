The Communist Party of India on Saturday slammed the Centre for replacing English signboards with those of Hindi along National Highways in Tamil Nadu and questioned it for not following three-language formula. Further, DMK leader MK Stalin said, "If the BJP government tries to prioritise Hindi and give less importance to Tamil language, then a movement against Hindi could start."
