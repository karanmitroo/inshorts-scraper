Congress leader Randeep Surjewala on Monday said, "Why is the Prime Minister suffering from Rahul Gandhi phobia? Why is he so much stressed?" He further slammed PM Modi and the BJP President Amit Shah saying that they should also tell their "conspiracies against LK Advani, Keshubhai Patel, Murli Manohar Joshi...who have been made a part of the party's history."
