Reacting to AAP minister Sandeep Kumar's removal over an 'objectionable CD', CongressÂ on Thursday described the party as 'Ali Baba and 40 chors committee', where every other MLA is removed for wrong reasons. "AAP was launched... to come up with clean people... but it clearly exposes the party once again," Congress added. Kumar was the youngest minister in Delhi Cabinet.
