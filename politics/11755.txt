In a huge embarrassment for AAP, its candidate from Moradabad (UP) - Khalid Parvez - has been declared a defaulter by the Bank of Baroda for failing to pay up Rs 12 crore in dues. Parvez had taken the loan two years back for setting up a college, officials said. However, Parvez has refuted the charges levelled against him.
