West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee met PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday over the quick release of pending central funds for the state’s projects including funds towards flood relief and rehabilitation. "It was not a political meeting,” she said. She added that she was  seeking solutions as the current Trinamool government continued repaying the previous CPI(M)-led government's debts to the Centre.
