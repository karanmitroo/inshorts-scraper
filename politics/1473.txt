After visiting Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College Hospital today, a teary-eyed UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath promised that those guilty for the children's deaths won't be spared. He further said that nobody could be more sensitive to those children than him. This comes after 30 children's deaths were reported within 48 hours, allegedly due to shortage of oxygen supply.
