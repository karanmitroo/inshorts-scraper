Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government for putting a limit of â‚¹1 lakh on farm loan waivers in the state. "BJP had promised a full loan waiver without any limit," the SP leader tweeted. "Crores of farmers are feeling cheated with the decision. This is a betrayal of the poor farmers," Yadav added.
