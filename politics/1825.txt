The Puducherry Assembly on Friday passed a resolution, seeking curtailment of the powers granted to Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi. The resolution came nearly a week after Chief Minister V Narayanasamy appealed Ministry of Home Affairs to resolve the governance crisis in Puducherry. Narayanasamy has accused the former IPS of "running a parallel government" in Puducherry.
