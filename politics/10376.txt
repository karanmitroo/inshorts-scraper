Odisha Assembly was stalled for the second consecutive day, Friday, as the opposition members stormed the well alleging the involvement of ruling BJD leaders in the ponzi scam and demanding immediate discussion on the issue. Both Congress and BJP members shouted slogans and waved placards and banners, slamming the BJP govt. The house was adjourned twice earlier in the day.
