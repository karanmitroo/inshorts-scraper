DMK Chief M Karunanidhi on Monday said the Tamil Nadu government is lacking "proper direction" as CM J Jayalalithaa is in the hospital. He added that "no all-party or Cabinet meeting or special assembly session" has been organised to resolve the Cauvery water issue, which requires immediate attention. Notably, Jayalalithaa was admitted to hospital on September 22.
