As Hindu seers and opposition parties objected to 'Har har Modi' slogan, Narendra Modi on Sunday asked his supporters not to use it. "Some enthusiastic supporters have been using the slogan 'Har har Modi'. I respect their enthusiasm, but request them not to use this slogan in the future," the BJPâ€™s PM candidate said on Twitter.
