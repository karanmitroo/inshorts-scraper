BJP’s IT cell head had asked the party’s social media cell to pressurise e-commerce platform Snapdeal to drop actor Aamir Khan as its brand ambassador, an ex-volunteer of the party has reportedly claimed. Sadhavi Khosla, who quit the BJP social media cell in 2015, has shared a WhatsApp message which read, "Appeal Snapdeal to drop Aamir Khan from their ads."
