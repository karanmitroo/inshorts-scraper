The Election Commission on Thursday reportedly asked the Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav and Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav to respond by January 9 to each other's petitions. Both the party factions had staked a claim on the party and its symbol 'cycle'. Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi earlier refused to comment on the freezing of the party's symbol.
