BJP worker, Remith, was beaten to death at Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan's hometown, Pinarayi on Wednesday, two days after a CPI(M) worker was killed in the same manner. The BJP has accused the CPI(M) of his murder, stating Vijayan acts as a 'gunda' leader. Notably, in May 2002, Remithâ€™s father was hacked to death near Keezhur in Kerala.
