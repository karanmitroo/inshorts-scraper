Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday made AAP's newly-elected councillors swear an oath to never ditch the "pure" political party. "BJP will make all efforts for you to defect. Keep your phones always on record. If any of you betrays our andolan (movement) then you'll be betraying god. This andolan and the people associated with it are pure," Kejriwal said.
