The Aam Aadmi PartyÂ on Saturday suspended its MLA and ex-minister Sandeep Kumar from the party over an 'objectionable CD' showing him in a compromising position with two women. Earlier this week, he had also been sacked from the Delhi Cabinet over the issue. The 36-year-old MLA, however, defended himself saying he was being attacked for being a Dalit.
