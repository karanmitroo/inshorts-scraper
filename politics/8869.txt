Former Delhi Minister Somnath Bharti on Monday faced flak for making a derogatory comment on Delhi women. "I am fully confident that if Delhi government is given full freedom (over security), beautiful women will be able to go out even after midnight without any fear", Bharti said. "It is highly objectionable remark of Bharti", Senior BJP leader Vijendra Gupta said.
