Attacking PM Narendra Modi on Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said, "Somebody tell him (Modi) about my election record. I have fought 14 elections so far. Will I shirk from polls." Earlier, Modi had said that Pawar chose the Rajya Sabha route and did not contest national polls as he was aware that the UPA govt was sinking.
