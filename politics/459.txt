Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday accused the BJP of a "discriminatory mindset" after the central government decided to issue differently coloured passport jackets to those with and without an 'Emigration Check Required' status. "Treating India's migrant workers like second class citizens is completely unacceptable," he tweeted along with a news report on the new passport rules.
