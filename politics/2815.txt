Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday dismissed BSP supremo Mayawati's allegations of Electronic Voting Machine tampering and asked her to "gracefully accept the people's mandate". "When you win, EVMs are right. When you lose, EVMs are wrong. This shows that there are some defects in you," Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said. He also said the people have rejected Mayawati's party.
