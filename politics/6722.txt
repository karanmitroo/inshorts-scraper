Kerala CM Oommen Chandy on Saturday said that the BJP would not win a single seat in the state in the May 16 Assembly polls. "The mind of Kerala will never gel with the divisive politics of the BJP", he said. Kerala would give a fitting reply to the PM's recent remarks comparing the state with Somalia, he further added.
