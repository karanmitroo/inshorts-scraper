Social activist Anna Hazare Thursday accused Arvind Kejriwal of being power hungry after the AAP leader failed to respond to his 17-point agenda. “It is now very clear that these (AAP) people are thinking of power more than of the nation,” Hazare said. If AAP comes to power, there will be no difference between them and other parties, he added.
