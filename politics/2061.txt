Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav has said it was his fault to endorse Akhilesh Yadav as the CM of Uttar Pradesh in 2012. "I should have become the Chief Minister. We would have won the UP polls with full majority if I was the Chief Minister,"  Mulayam added. He also slammed his son for forming the alliance with Congress.
