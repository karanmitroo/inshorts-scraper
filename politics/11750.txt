Venting her anger over entry of BSR president B Sreeramalu in BJP, senior leader Sushma Swaraj Friday tweeted, "I want to make it absolutely clear that B.Sriramulu has been admitted in the party despite my stiff opposition." Earlier, Swaraj had written to party chief Rajnath Singh, saying such 'tainted' leaders should not be allowed to be associated with the party.
