In a letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi following Friday morning's meeting, Shashi Tharoor reportedly said the party leadership did not appreciate his "sincerity". Tharoor also distanced himself from media reports that he disagreed with the party on stalling Parliament. "I was dismayed, indeed distressed, by our exchange at the morning meeting," Tharoor reportedly said in the letter.
