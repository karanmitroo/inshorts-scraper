West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday demanded that the central government declare Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's birthday on January 23 a national holiday. She added that if Mahatma Gandhi was the 'father of the nation', Bose was also the 'neta' of the nation. Earlier, Bose's family had demanded that his birthday be observed as 'Patriots' Day' (Desh Prem Divas).
