BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday said the SC's verdict of barring the nine rebel Uttarakhand MLAs from participating in floor test was not a setback for the BJP, as some political parties had termed it. "They are Congress' MLAs and they have got nothing to do with the BJP... The BJP hadn't gone to the court," he further said.
