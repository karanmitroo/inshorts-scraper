Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma accused the Gujarat government of inaction during the 2002 Godhra riots adding that the "army was not called in Gujarat". PM Modi earlier levelled charges of non-intervention against the Congress during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sharma added that in 2002, the BJP Government in Gujarat did not heed the advice of the then PM AB Vajpayee.
