Reacting to the killings of army personnel in Kashmir over the past three days, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the Centre's Kashmir policy is a total failure. "An absolute lack of acknowledgement or meaningful political action by this government is shocking," he added. "Why is PM Narendra Modi and his government silent about these deaths," Yechury asked.
