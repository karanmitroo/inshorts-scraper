A BJP MP, Mansingh Ram Patel, on Wednesday questioned the relevance of TV programmes showing self-styled godmen. Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Parliament, Patel said, "In the age of science and technology, when people are hooked to television for latest updates, they see these 'babas' asking people to wear certain types of clothes for good luck."
