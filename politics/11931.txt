Lt governor Najeeb Jung has given consent to AAP government's recommendation for a probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday. Slamming the move, the Delhi Congress Chief Arvinder Lovely said the decision was aimed at wooing the Sikh community by AAP ahead of Lok Sabha polls.
