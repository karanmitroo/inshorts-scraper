The RSS joint general secretary Krishna Gopal has said that using caste as a vote bank is not good for a democratic system, and people must vote on the basis of a candidate's abilities. Differences due to caste are deep-rooted in our country, Gopal added. Speaking on Hindutva, the RSS leader said it is about continuity, new ideas and innovations.
