Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Sunday launched an attack against the Modi-led government at the Centre, accusing it of diluting tribal land rights and reducing health care budget allocations for them. “The government’s plan to dilute environmental governance and Tribal Land Rights is a serious threat to the welfare of Adivasis,” Ms. Gandhi said in a statement in New Delhi.
