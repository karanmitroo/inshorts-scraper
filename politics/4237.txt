Following UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's expulsion and then reinstatement in the Samajwadi Party, BJP's UP President Keshav Maurya on Saturday called the whole incident a drama. Maurya said Samajwadi's cycle has been punctured and BJP's lotus will rise now in the 2017 Assembly polls in UP. BJP had earlier called SP's infighting a scripted drama to divert people's attention.
