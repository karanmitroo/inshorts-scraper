Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav has said that though party supremo Mulayam Singh was his “guru” in politics, he will side with UP CM Akhilesh Yadav in this “dharma yudh” (war of ethics). He further added that Mulayam has been surrounded by "evil spirits”. Ram Gopal has been expelled from the party for six years.
