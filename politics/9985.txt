Former Aam Aadmi Party MLA Vinod Kumar Binny joined the BJP on Sunday, ahead of Delhi assembly elections. "AAP is responsible for emotional blackmailing. They use people... I thank the BJP for giving me this honor," Binny said after joining the party. Binny's move came few days after former AAP leader Shazia Ilmi and Kiran Bedi joined the saffron party.
