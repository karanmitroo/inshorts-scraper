BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has said that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir would soon be a part of India. Reacting to Congress leader Digvijaya Singh's reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'India-occupied Kashmir', Adityanath said, "It reflects the values of his party." He added, "If Sardar Patel would have got the responsibility in place of Jawaharlal Nehru, J&K issue would have not arisen."
