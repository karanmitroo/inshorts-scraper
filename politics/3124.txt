Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said, "The voice of PM Narendra Modi is not of a roaring lion, but even feebler than that of a mouse." Gandhi's remark comes after BJP President Amit Shah said, "Rahul Baba, we have given a PM who speaks. You had given a PM who did not speak for 10 years."
