BJP vice president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday said that a solution needed to be found to the Ram temple issue within the constitutional framework. When asked if the demolition of Babri mosque in 1992 was in the constitutional framework, he said, "Ask this question to Congress - those who were the custodians of the site."
