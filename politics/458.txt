RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tej Pratap has launched the Lalu Prasad (LP) movement to seek justice for Lalu, who was awarded a 3.5-year jail term after his conviction in a fodder scam case. Reports claimed that the movement has been planned along the lines of the JP movement, which was launched by Jayaprakash Narayan to oppose the Emergency.
