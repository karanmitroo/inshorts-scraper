RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday sparked a controversy by saying that the upcoming Bihar assembly election is a fight between the backward and the forward castes. He called out to people of the Yadav and other backward castes to support the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance. "Does Yadauvanshi mean you and your family", an NDA minister said, criticising his remarks.
