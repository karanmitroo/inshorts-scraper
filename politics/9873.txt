Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Sunday accused PM Narendra Modi of "U turn" on policy issues. Digvijay said, "Another U Turn by Modi! Biggest critic of Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme now supports!" His statement came as PM Modi Saturday touted the govt's move to transfer LPG subsidy directly to people's bank accounts as a major drive to curb corruption.
