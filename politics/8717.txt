Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday slammed the meat ban in Mumbai, announced by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to be imposed during the 'Paryushan' fasting period of the Jain community, starting September 11. "We will ensure there is no ban on sale of meat for the eight days", Thackeray said. Notably, Sena and BJP together rule the BMC.
