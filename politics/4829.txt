PM Narendra Modi on Friday said water that belongs to India cannot be allowed to go to Pakistan. Referring to the Indus Waters Treaty, he said, "My farmers have the right over the water that flows through Indus, will strive to get that water back". This comes after Pakistan warned India against using water as an "instrument of coercion".
