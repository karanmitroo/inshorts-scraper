In a controversial statement, Samajwadi Party leader Tota Ram, who is chairman of Processing and Construction Cooperative Federation Ltd, Saturday said that “rape happens when women mutually agree to get raped.” "People blame the government and law and order after rapes happen. But what can one do if people get raped with their consent," he further said.
