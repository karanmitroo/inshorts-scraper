Vishwajit Rane, Congress MLA from Valpoi and leader of opposition in the outgoing Goa Assembly, has announced he is quitting the party. Rane slammed the way Congress failed to form a majority in Goa despite emerging as the single-largest party with 17 seats. He said, "Certain senior leaders should be hanged, those who scuttled the demands of the Goa Forward."
