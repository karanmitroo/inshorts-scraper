AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said his party, which is making its debut in UP polls, is "twinkle twinkle little star" while other parties are stars without glow or shine. On being asked why there are no stars to campaign for AIMIM, he said, “I’m 6' 2 tall. Is there a bigger star than me in UP polls?"
