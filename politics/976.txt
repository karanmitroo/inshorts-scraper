Union Minister and BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday claimed that 'love jihad' was part of a drive by terrorists to radicalise youngsters. Warning the Kerala government not to compromise on the issue of national security by being lenient in radicalisation cases, Prasad added that such 'love jihad' cases need extensive investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).
