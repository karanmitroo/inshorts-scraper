The Congress Monday accused the Modi government of making repeated U-turns during the six months it has been in power. Congress general secretary Ajay Maken released a booklet listing 25 U-turns of BJP govt in the past 6 months. "This government has made 25 U-turns in last 6 months. That's an average of 1 U-turn every 7-8 days," Maken said.
