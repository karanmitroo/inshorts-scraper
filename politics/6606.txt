DMK chief M Karunanidhi on Monday alleged that his party was "insulted" in a planned manner at the swearing-in ceremony of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. His son and DMK leader MK Stalin was made to sit "among the crowd" in the 16th row, while even a losing candidate like Sarath Kumar was given a front row seat, he alleged.
