BJP leader Anil Vij on Wednesday said Congress leaders were unafraid of committing wrongdoings, and their DNA was "the same". He added, “This is the same Indira Gandhi who crushed all democratic rights to impose Emergency. Her soul is still alive among all Congress leaders.” Congress president Sonia Gandhi earlier said she was unafraid and “the daughter-in-law of Indira Gandhi".
