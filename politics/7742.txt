Disagreeing with President Pranab Mukherjee's "error of judgement" statement, Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Friday said that it was not Rajiv Gandhi's decision to open the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya. "It was a decision of the court", said Singh. Mukherjee, in his memoir 'The Turbulent Years: 1980-96', has stated the opening of the site as an "error of judgement".
