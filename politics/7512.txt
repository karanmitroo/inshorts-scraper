Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday criticised the Budget calling government's black money policy just a "Fair & Lovely scheme". “Nobody who has black money will be jailed under Modi’s ‘Fair & Lovely’ scheme ... who have black money can make it white under this scheme,” said Gandhi. He further attacked the government on issues including inflation and intolerance.
