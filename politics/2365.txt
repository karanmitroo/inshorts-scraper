National Conference President Farooq Abdullah on Saturday won the Srinagar Lok Sabha by-poll after defeating PDP candidate Nazir Ahmad Khan by around 10,000 votes. Abdullah had faced his first electoral defeat in his over 35-year-long political career when he had lost to PDP's Tariq Hameed Karra in 2014 General Elections. Karra had later resigned from Lok Sabha.
