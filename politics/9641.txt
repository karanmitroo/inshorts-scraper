AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday demanded reservation for backward Muslims in government jobs and educational institutes in Maharashtra. The 45-year-old Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad claimed that 'injustice' has been done to Muslims in the state over 50 years of rule of Congress at the Centre. He added that backward Muslims lack access to even basic amenities in Maharashtra.
