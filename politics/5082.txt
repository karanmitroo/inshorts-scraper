Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the democracy is going through one of its darkest hours under PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government. "Hiding behind the cloak of national security, civil society is being intimidated for asking questions," Gandhi said. "Television channels are being punished... The opposition is being arrested for holding the government to account," Gandhi added.
