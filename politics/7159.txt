Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday ruled out the possibility of a separate statehood for Marathwada region of Maharashtra. The party, however, reaffirmed its commitment to accord separate statehood to Vidarbha at an appropriate time. The issue of statehood for Marathwada came to the fore recently, following former Advocate General Shrihari Aney's support for the cause leading to his resignation.
