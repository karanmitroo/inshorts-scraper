Reacting to the violence in West Bengal’s Dhulagarh, TMC MP Derek O’Brien has tweeted that the BJP and RSS talk about Digital India but promote "Divisive India". "All the old SM (Social Media) tricks 'n habits of the BJP-RSS combo. Amplify a local issue. Give it a communal twist. Spread hate even after arrests (sic)," he tweeted.
