Union Minister Kiren Rijiju escaped unhurt on Tuesday after his chopper made an emergency landing on a small field due to bad weather. The helicopter, carrying seven other passengers and crew members, was flying from Assam's Guwahati to Arunachal Pradesh's Ziro. "I was lucky enough to be landed safely, thanks to the BSF pilots who are very experienced," Rijiju said.
