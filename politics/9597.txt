Days after former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg released an audiotape against Arvind Kejriwal accusing him of horse-trading, Shahid Azaad, convener of AAP's minority wing, Friday released another audiotape creating fresh trouble for the party. The audiotape alleges that Kejriwal gave party tickets on the basis of religion saying that if Muslims are given tickets then BJP might win.
