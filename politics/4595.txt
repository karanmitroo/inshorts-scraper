Amid disruptions and protests over demonetisation, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said, "Everyone agrees to a holiday", as politicians unanimously said 'yes' to the request of a holiday on account of Eid-e-Milad. While Mahajan had earlier warned the Parliament of strict action if it attempted to disturb any member speaking in the House, she smiled seeing unity over a holiday.
