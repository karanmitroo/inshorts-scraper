Ahead of the Delhi civic polls, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, "If you (citizens) vote for the BJP and if your child falls prey to dengue or chikungunya, then you will be responsible, because you voted for a party that spreads mosquitoes." He further said, "BJP is in MCD for the last 10 years but still it cannot clean Delhi."
