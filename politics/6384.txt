Former Chhattisgarh CM Ajit Jogi, who recently quit Congress, on Tuesday named his new political party as 'Chhattisgarh Janta Congress'. Jogi floated the party earlier this month and had sought suggestions from the public for its name. Notably, he had resigned from Congress after his removal from the Congress Working Committee over his son's alleged involvement in fixing a by-pollâ€‹.
