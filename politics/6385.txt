BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has alleged that Mother Teresa was part of a "conspiracy for Christianisation of India". He said, â€œIncidents of Christianisation had led to separatist movements in parts of North-East, including...Tripura and Nagaland." Further, he alleged that the exodus of Hindus from Kairana resulted from "pseudo-secularism and appeasement policies" by different governments in UP.
