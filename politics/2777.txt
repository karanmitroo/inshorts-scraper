After facing defeat in recently held Punjab and Goa Assembly elections, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to party cadre, stating "hum honge kamyab" (We shall overcome) and they shouldn't lose faith. The 65-year-old BJP hasn't given up in Karnataka, 130-year-old Congress hasn't given up in Maharashtra, hence there's no reason for us to give up, he wrote.
