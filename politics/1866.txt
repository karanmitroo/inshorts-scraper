Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday met Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to discuss a proposal to penalise power distribution companies by making them compensate consumers for unscheduled power cuts. The Delhi government had passed the order earlier in 2015, but it had been struck down by the High Court as AAP had not sought clearance from former L-G Najeeb Jung.
