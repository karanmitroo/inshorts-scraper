Former Home Secretary RK Singh on Tuesday claimed that the affidavit in the Ishrat Jahan case was changed due to political reasons. Singh, now BJP MP from Bihar, asked the reason for the change when the Intelligence Bureau had said Ishrat had links with Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists. Singh's predecessor, GK Pillai had also claimed irregularities in the changing of the affidavit.
