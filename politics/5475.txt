PM Narendra Modi on Sunday invoked the ideology of Jan Sangh ideologue, Deendayal Upadhyay, stating Muslims shouldn’t be rewarded and rebuked, but empowered. “They are not items of vote market nor are they substance of hate. Treat them as your own,” he added. He also said that ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' is not a mere slogan, but a commitment.
