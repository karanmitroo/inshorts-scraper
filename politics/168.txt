Congress leader Sunil Jakhar on Thursday said Canadian PM Justin Trudeau should respect the sentiments of the Indian government and especially the people of Punjab. Jakhar's remark comes after convicted Khalistani terrorist Jaspal Atwal was photographed with Trudeau's wife at a Mumbai event recently. Atwal was also invited to a formal dinner with Trudeau, but the invitation was later rescinded.
