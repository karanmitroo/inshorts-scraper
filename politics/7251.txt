Reacting to the BJP fielding former Indian Cricketer S Sreesanth in the upcoming Assembly elections in Kerala, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Saturday said that this indicated that the BJP has already accepted defeat for that seat. "Thiruvananthapuram is a place where you have an educated electorate," Tharoor added. The BJP had on Friday decided to field Sreesanth from Thiruvananthapuram.
