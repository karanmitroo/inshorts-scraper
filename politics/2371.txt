Hoardings asking people to chant Yogi-Yogi if they want to live in UP were put up at various parts of Meerut. Though the district administration has now removed the hoardings, the Hindu Yuva Vahini officials have said their name was used in hoardings to malign their image. The hoardings also had pictures of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.
