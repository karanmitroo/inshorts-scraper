Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's remarks that Pakistan's ISI had contacted Muslim youths after Muzaffarnagar riots, have received heavy criticism from parties such as BJP, SP, CPI, and JD(U) as well as from Muslim leaders, for raking up issues that sought to link Muslims to terrorism. Moreover, Home Ministry, Intelligence Bureau, and UP government have also denied receiving any such information.
