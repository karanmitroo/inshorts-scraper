BJP MP Varun Gandhi Thursday said that the Bharat Ratna conferred on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not big enough, compared to the work done by him for the country. Vajpayee is big-hearted and he even forgave his opponents in the interest of the party, he further said, adding that he joined BJP only due to Vajpayee.
