Senior BJP MLA and former Maharashtra minister, Raj Purohit, has been served a show-cause notice by the party after he was allegedly ‘caught on tape’ criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party’s central leadership. “There is nothing called collective leadership," Purohit had allegedly said. However, he has denied that it was his voice in the tape.
