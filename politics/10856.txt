Delhi's ex-CM Arvind Kejriwal moved back to his Kaushambi apartment Tuesday, as he had to vacate the CM’s Tilak Lane residence. He wanted the official residence to be transferred in his wife’s name as she was IT commissioner but that couldn't happen. Kejriwal searched for several other accommodations in Delhi, but even that didn't work out.
