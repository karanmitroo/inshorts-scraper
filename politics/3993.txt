Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal has termed Congress' manifesto for the Punjab Assembly polls as a bundle of lies. Congress has never implemented any of its previous manifestoes, Badal claimed. This comes after former PM Manmohan Singh presented Congress' manifesto and said the document will repair the damage done to the state's economy by the SAD government.
