The NDA government on Wednesday blamed the previous UPA regime for the "decline" in the financial condition of state-owned telecom operators BSNL and MTNL. In 2004, BSNL and MTNL were earning profits of around ₹10,000 crore and ₹900 crore respectively, but were incurring a collective loss of about ₹10,000 crore in 2014, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.
