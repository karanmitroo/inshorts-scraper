Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Sunday said that the Election Commission should not allow political parties to use flags bearing resemblance to the national flag. "Congress, NCP, and TMC are using...flags with three colours in...background which look similar to the national flag," the BJP MLA said. He added he would soon take up the matter with the Election Commission.
