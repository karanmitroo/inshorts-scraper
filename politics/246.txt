BJP's Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini has slammed the Haryana BJP government for "bowing" before the demands raised by the Jat community by withdrawing 70 FIRs filed during the violent agitation in 2016. Accusing his own party of playing vote bank politics, the MP said he will not be attending BJP President Amit Shah's bike rally on Thursday.
