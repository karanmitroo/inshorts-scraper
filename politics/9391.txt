AAP leader Ashutosh Wednesday sparked a controversy by making a bizarre comment about the farmer who committed suicide at the party's rally. "This was Arvind Kejriwal's mistake. He should have got down from the stage. He made a mistake. Next time I will tell Kejriwal to get down and climb the tree and save people", he said sarcastically.
