Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday criticised PM Narendra Modi over the transfer of senior officials of the Delhi government by Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung. “Is this Modi's model of democracy? Modiji is hell bent on destroying Delhi through L-G,” he said. The AAP government had earlier requested Jung not to transfer officers working on Mohalla clinics and educational projects.
