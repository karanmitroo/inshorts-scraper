After the upper caste remarks, Bihar CM Jatin Ram Manjhi has made yet another controversial statement. Manjhi Sunday admitted that due to vote bank politics he once refused to help a lady harassed by Yadavs. "I kept mum because Yadavs had 50,000 votes in that area. I would have lost that vote had I acted," he said.
