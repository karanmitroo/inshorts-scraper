Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa Jayakumar's husband has announced that he would be quitting his wife's party to start his own political outfit. Madhavan said the party could not function independently as some "evil forces" had taken over. Notably, Jayakumar had launched her party, 'MGR Amma Deepa Peravai', on the eve of Jayalalithaa's 69th birth anniversary.
