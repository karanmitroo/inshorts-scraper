Hitting back at the party leadership, AAP leader Yogendra Yadav on Tuesday accused it of forcing Delhi MLAs to sign papers against him and Prashant Bhushan. "They should not put pressure on members to speak out against us," said Yadav. He also challenged the party leadership to make their response to the allegations public and said the truth will prevail.
