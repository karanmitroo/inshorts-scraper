Commenting on PM Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech that lasted less than an hour, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi today said Modi is reducing the duration of his speeches as he has nothing to talk about now. Gandhi criticised Modi for not talking about the recent Gorakhpur deaths in his speech and the Chinese forces that "are still sitting inside Bhutan."
