BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav has said that 12 MLAs of the party in Arunachal Pradesh are "strongly" supporting the government led by suspended PPA leader Pema Khandu. Khandu, along with 42 other MLAs, had quit the Congress to join the PPA in September. This comes after Khandu and six other PPA MLAs were suspended temporarily for alleged anti-party activities.
