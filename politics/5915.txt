After being suspended en masse for a week, DMK MLAs led by MK Stalin on Thursday staged a protest outside the Tamil Nadu Assembly. The protesters alleged that they were denied entry into the Assembly premises. They were suspended on Wednesday following an uproar in the Assembly when DMK members protested over remarks made against Stalin by an AIADMK member.
