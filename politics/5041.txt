BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said that “2014 Modi wave, Brexit sweep and Trump knock out,” has proved that the end of hypocrisy in politics is near. “Tell it like it is! Lutyens to go for six!” he tweeted. Swamy had earlier openly favoured Donald Trump over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the 45th US President.
