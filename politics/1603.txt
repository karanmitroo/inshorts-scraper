Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday took a jibe at the recent political development in Bihar and said people are watching the political corruption of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). "I am surprised to see that people who objected about 'DNA', have joined hands with NDA (National Democratic Alliance)," the Samajwadi Party leader said.
