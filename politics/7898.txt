BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday formed a three-membered fact-finding team which will visit Malda district in West Bengal where communal violence had erupted last week against blasphemous comments by a right-wing leader. The team will be headed by BJP National General Secretary Bhupender Yadav and will submit its report to Amit Shah after visiting the violence-hit areas.
