Karnataka Congress is mulling over a liquor ban in Karnataka, ahead of the state Assembly elections in 2018. Several Congress legislators reportedly visited Bihar to meet CM Nitish Kumar and to study how the liquor prohibition process was implemented in the state. The Congress believes liquor prohibition would help the party woo women voters ahead of the polls, reports said.
