Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal Monday declared that special investigation teams will be set up to investigate 23,500 cases of rioting across India if his party comes to power at the Centre. "If even one case is solved and an instigator of the riot is put behind bars, no further riots will take place in the country," he added.
