Less than two days after BJP leader Kundanika Sharma joined the Samajwadi Party (SP), the BJP on Monday announced the entry of SP candidate from Agra (Rural) Hemlata Diwakar into the party fold. Hemlata said the SP has become a dictatorship and lacked internal democracy. Only BJP can get a complete majority in the 2017 Assembly election, she added.
