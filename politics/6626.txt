The Congress has demanded a probe into a hacker's claims that Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse's name has appeared on Dawood Ibrahim's wife's call logs. The hacker stated that he had obtained the call details from a Pakistan Telecom firm by impersonating Dawood's wife. This comes after the AAP demanded Khadse's resignation while the Maharashtra Police rejected the allegations.
