The Supreme court on Monday upheld the conviction and 10-year jail term of former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala and his son Ajay Singh Chautala in teachers' recruitment scam case. The SC made the decision after dismissing the father-son duo's plea challenging the Delhi HC's verdict on their conviction and sentence.
