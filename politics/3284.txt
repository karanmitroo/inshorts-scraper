Photographs of PM Narendra Modi and Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on the website of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna are in violation of the model code, the Election Commission has ruled. The poll panel directed the Centre to take down the photographs immediately. The EC also asked the Centre to "ensure" that other government websites do not contain such photographs.
