Upset with the distribution of tickets for the upcoming Uttarakhand Assembly elections, the supporters of Congress leaders Navin Bisht and Aryendra Sharma vandalised the party office in Dehradun on Sunday. They also raised slogans against CM Harish Rawat and Congress, reports said. "Not a single person is going to vote for the Congress," one of the party's supporters said.
