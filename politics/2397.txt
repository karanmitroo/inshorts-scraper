After a BJP youth leader declared a ₹11 lakh bounty on her head, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee responded by saying that she was "regularly targeted" with such offensive words. "[T]he more they say such things, the more we will progress," she added. Earlier, a Kolkata-based cleric made a counter-offer of ₹22 lakh on the BJP youth leader's head.
