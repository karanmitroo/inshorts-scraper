AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has alleged that ATMs have been deliberately kept without cash in Muslim-majority areas. He has further claimed that barely 2% Muslims have access to credit cards. "In our areas, bank branches are not openedâ€¦But in other areas, money is flowing. Why should we opt for cashless economy?" he said while addressing his supporters in Hyderabad.
