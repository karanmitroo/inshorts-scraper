The Aam Aadmi Party, which dissolved its Maharashtra unit two weeks ago, has made six people in charge of looking after the everyday political affairs of Maharashtra. The six 'prabharis' include three Delhi MLAs, namely, Rituraj, Girish Soni and Rakhi Bidlan. Criticising the move, AAP leader Mayank Gandhi on Friday said, "Now Maharashtra will be run by Delhi. How strange".
