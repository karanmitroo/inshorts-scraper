Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Sunday said it was the "appropriate time" to impose President's rule in Bihar, as the recent murders of a teenager and journalist in the state reflected a "breakdown of law and order." He said, "The situation appears to be worse than 'jungle raj' or 'rakshasa (demon) raj," and demanded CBI probes into the cases.
