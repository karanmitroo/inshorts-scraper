Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday said reservation based on caste should be scrapped and be given to the economically backward. He added that he would put forward a request for the same to PM Narendra Modi. Thackeray further alleged that former Prime Minister VP Singh was the "culprit" who introduced the reservation system and "poisoned" the country.
