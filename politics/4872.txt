BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said that “Islamic terrorism” is trying to create chaos and anarchy in India and also polarising communities. “We had successfully fought LTTE, Tamil Tigers, Bodo, Naxals…and in the same manner we should fight and root out Islamic terrorism from the country,” he added. He also claimed the Islamic State is now active in southern India.
