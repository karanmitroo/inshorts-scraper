Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said no individual has the right to kill people in the name of Gau Raksha. He also said the actions of organisations like Hindu Mahasabha and Hindu Yuva Vahini have nothing to do with BJP. If someone is hurting or slaughtering a cow, it must be reported to the nearest law enforcement agency, he added.
