BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday supported demand for 80% reservation of seats for the locals in state jobs and admission in state-run professional colleges. Slamming the Bihar government, Modi added, "It seems both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad are more interested in making statements in this regard for political grounds but not doing anything concrete on the ground."
