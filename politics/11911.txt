While addressing a rally in Himachal, Narendra Modi said, "Mere liye na koi aagey, na peechhey. Kiske liye bhrashtachar karunga? (I have no family ties. Who will I be corrupt for?), adding, "this mind and body is totally devoted to the nation." Mr Modi has never commented on reports that he was married at an early-age and separated soon after.
