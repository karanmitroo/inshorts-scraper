Shiv Sena Youth brigade President Aditya Thackeray on Thursday distanced the party from the 'slap Aamir Khan' row and said the remark was personal. "Shiv Sena has clearly stated that it has absolutely nothing to do with statement of offer of the slapping", he said. Punjab Shiv Sena had earlier announced â‚¹1 lakh for anyone who slaps Aamir Khan.
