Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Friday dared the BJP government to make it compulsory to sing national song (Vande Mataram) and national anthem thrice a day everywhere. He further said, "Why are they trying to create division in the country? If they are so much concerned about this, then should just turn it into a law."
