Janata Dal (United) President Sharad Yadav said on Saturday that the “Prime Minister and Chief Minister have no caste as they are constitutional authorities”. Yadav's comment came in response to a recent statement by Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh that a person from upper caste cannot become the CM of Bihar.
