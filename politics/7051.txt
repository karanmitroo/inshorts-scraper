The Madhya Pradesh government directed 200 private colleges in Indore to send 100 "students" each to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Mhow on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti. Authorities later claimed that the order was "misinterpreted" and that they required NCC and NSS "volunteers" for crowd control. Meanwhile, Congress criticised the order, calling it a "Tughlaqi diktat".
