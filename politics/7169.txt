Seven Ministers in Congress-led Manipur on Friday threatened to resign if CM Okram Ibobi Singh reshuffled the Cabinet. Meanwhile, Congress appointed MLA TN Haokip as the state's party President. This comes after 25 dissident Congress MLAs met party President Sonia Gandhi and demanded that 10 of the Cabinet's 12 Ministers be dismissed and the state's Congress President be replaced.
