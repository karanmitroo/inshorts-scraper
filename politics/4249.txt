Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav has directed state DGP Javeed Ahmed to ensure adequate security is deployed outside the residences of Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. This comes after a large number of Akhilesh supporters gathered outside Mulayam's house to protest the expulsion of the UP Chief Minister from the party.
