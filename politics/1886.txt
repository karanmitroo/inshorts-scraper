BJP leader Vijay Jolly was robbed of his laptop, camera and other important documents while he was having golgappas on the roadside in Delhi's Lado Sarai area on Wednesday evening. Jolly claimed that he spotted the two motorcycle-borne suspects soon after the crime, but he could not chase them down because of a traffic jam.
