BSP supremo Mayawati on Wednesday asserted that the people of Uttar Pradesh and even the entire country had started calling BJP as the 'Bharatiya Jumla Party'. "If the BJP comes to power, all reservations will go away. I have got this information from sources," she further asserted. The former CM had earlier also accused BJP of exploiting Dalits.
