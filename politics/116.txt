Congress Spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi on Wednesday said P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram's arrest is PM Narendra Modi-led government's "classic diversionary tactic" to hide their "own corrupt governance model". "BJP government continues it's vendetta and vindictive politics to target opponents, however, it will not stop the Congress from bringing the truth out to the people," she added.
