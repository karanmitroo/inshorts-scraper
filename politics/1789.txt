MLA Subhash Tripathi's son and a mining contractor have been booked for allegedly burying alive two children, including a Dalit, in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich district after locals resisted sand mining there. While Tripathi refuted the allegation levelled against his son and termed it as a conspiracy, a three-member committee has been constituted by the district administration to probe the matter.
