BJP's UP President KP Maurya on Sunday said the party will win the 2017 UP Assembly elections even if Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) joins Samajwadi Party and Congress' alliance. This comes after SP and Congress announced an alliance for the UP elections. Meanwhile, BSP has also asserted that Congress and SP will not win in UP despite the alliance.
