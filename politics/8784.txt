Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is facing flak over students spelling out his name in a visual formation at the Independence Day celebrations in Delhi on Saturday. "I wish they had written Jai Hind instead. Today's day of the nation, not any one person", a Twitter user wrote. Defending himself, Kejriwal tweeted, "I was not... aware that students wud do this".
