The Samajwadi Party on Sunday backed the Narendra Modi government on the issue of NSA-level talks with Pakistan and said that talks and terrorism cannot go together. "Pakistan's NSA Sartaj Aziz's insistence on meeting separatist leaders was not right and SP completely backs the Central government on this issue," the party's national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav said.
