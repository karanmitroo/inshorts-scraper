CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said that Modi government "which claims to be Indian" has subverted Netaji Subhas Chandra Boseâ€™s slogan Jai Hind to "Jio Hind". "He (Bose) believed in Indian nationalism, not in a narrow idea of nationalism based on religion," he said. "Jai Hind shall be reclaimed by all of us," he added.
