BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has compared Congress President Rahul Gandhi with a 'barking dog' after Rahul Gandhi slammed PM Narendra Modi over the â‚¹11,000-crore PNB scam. "As there is a saying that dogs bark but elephant keeps on walking. Prime Minister Modi is serving the country, so whoever wants to bark should bark," he said.
