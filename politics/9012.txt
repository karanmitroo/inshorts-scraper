BJP secretary Siddharth Nath Singh on Saturday ridiculed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi by asking him to "grow out of diapers". "He has to grow out of diapers he is wearing. His remarks and behaviour remind us he remains a baby in diapers", Singh said. Singh's remarks come a day after Gandhi criticised PM Narendra Modi over the Land Bill.
