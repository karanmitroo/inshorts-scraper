Amid reports of a rift with his uncle Shivpal Yadav, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said it was a fight in the government and not a family tussle. Akhilesh had earlier divested Shivpal of all important ministerial portfolios. This came after the Samajwadi Party removed Akhilesh as the state president and replaced him with Shivpal Yadav.
