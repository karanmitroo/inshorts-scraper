Hitting out at the BJP, Delhi CM and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that it will lose the upcoming Bihar polls like it lost Delhi. The CM further said that some parties and leaders do "poisonous" politics in the name of religion for votes. "We want to do politics of love and sweetness," Kejriwal added.
