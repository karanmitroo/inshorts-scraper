The BJP on Saturday accused Uttar Pradesh's government of being "insensitive" and "not serious" about tackling drought in Bundelkhand. "It has a right to seek fund from the Centre... but it had spent only 5 per cent of a previous package of ₹850 crore," the BJP alleged. This comes after CM Akhilesh Yadav sought ₹11,000 crore relief from the Centre.
