President Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday said Indira Gandhi is the most acceptable Prime Minister to the Indians even today. Referring to the Operation Blue Star, Mukherjee recalled that Indira had told him that sometimes history demands action which may not prove correct later on but is relevant. He also recalled her decisiveness in reorganising Congress after facing defeat in 1977.
