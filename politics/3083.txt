Shiv Sena candidate Haji Halim Khan, who won in the recently concluded BMC elections, has said the party is a true well-wisher of Muslims. "Sena's projection of Muslims in a bad light is a handiwork of certain sections of the society," he added. Shiv Sena had fielded five Muslim candidates, out of which two have won in the BMC polls.
