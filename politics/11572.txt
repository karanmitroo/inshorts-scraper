BJP leader Varun Gandhi issued a clarification Wednesday on his statement related to development work in Amethi, denying that he had in any way endorsed any political party or candidate. "We require small scale industries, like the ones Rahul Gandhi has set up in Amethi," earlier Varun had stated, which was welcomed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.
