Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati's resignation was accepted on Thursday by Hamid Ansari, the Chairman of the House. She had resigned from the House on Tuesday saying she "wasn't allowed" to speak on the Dalit issue. It was after Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien reminded her of the three-minute-limit as she spoke during the Zero Hour.
