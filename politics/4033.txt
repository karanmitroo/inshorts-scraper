AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said his party did not have "a single penny" to contest the Punjab and Goa elections. "Our bank account is empty...We are in power in Delhi for the last two years, we also could have minted money," he said. "AAP is an honest political party while the rest are corrupt," Kejriwal further said.
