Soon after Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's 'Khaat Sabha' ended in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria district, the locals began fighting for the 'khaats' (wooden cots). The farmers who attended the Sabha were seen leaving with the cots. Rahul Gandhi started the party's 2017 Uttar Pradesh poll campaign on Monday with a 2,500 km-long 'Kisan Yatra' across the state.
