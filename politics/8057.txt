Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday said that the Sikh community will never forgive the Congress for conspiring 1984 anti-Sikh riots. “The wounds of 1984 Sikh carnage will remain afresh in the psyche of every Sikh," he added. It is a well-known fact that the then Congress at Centre "planned and executed" the “heinous crime” of genocide, he claimed.
