Home Minister Rajnath Singh Monday called for an anti-conversion law. "There are sometimes rumours and controversies about 'Ghar Wapsi' and conversions. Why should there by any conversion at all?", Singh said. "In other countries it is the minorities which ask for anti-conversion law... we are only saying there should be an anti-conversion law", he added.
