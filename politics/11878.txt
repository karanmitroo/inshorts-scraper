CPI(M) stalwart VS Achuthanandan on Thursday rejected AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's invitation to him to join his party. "It seems that Kejriwal had not properly understood my politics and my struggles based on the philosophy of dialectical materialism and Marxism-Leninism. If he (Kejriwal) was aware of that, he would not have made such a statement," he said.
