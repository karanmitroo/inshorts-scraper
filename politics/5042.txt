Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav has said the “sudden ban” on high denomination notes showed that the NDA-led government took the decision with an eye on Assembly elections. Further, he added that the demonetisation has caused "immense hardships to commoners, farmers and the poor." Mulayam also said his party will protest against the demonetisation in the Parliament's winter session.
