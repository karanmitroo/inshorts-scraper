Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government has taken away the happiness of people instead of bringing good days. She further said, "Have you ever seen a government that works against its people and make them weak? Sadly, the Modi government is doing this. It is working for a handful of industrialists."
