Reacting to the "remote control" remark by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, the Shiv Sena on Monday said that he should concentrate on "charging the batteries" to fight ISIS. During an event held to commemorate late Bal Thackeray, Fadnavis had said that the remote control of power which late Bal Thackeray gave to Uddhav Thackeray, was handed over to him.
