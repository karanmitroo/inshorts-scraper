Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said that allegations against BJP President Amit Shahâ€™s son, Jay, have no basis and there is no need for any investigation. "Such allegations have surfaced in the past too. They are levelled from time to time," Rajnath added. Reportedly, Jay's firm saw a huge rise in turnover after BJP came to power in 2014.
