Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday claimed that the party's victory in the Punjab elections would be his gift to "Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Ji and Sonia Madam". "From here, politics of hope will triumph...I am giving congratulation in advance to Sonia madam and Rahul," he added. Congress' win in Punjab will act as the party's revival, Sidhu asserted.
