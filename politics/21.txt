After a statue of Russian communist revolutionary Lenin was taken down in Tripura, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy termed him a "foreign terrorist" and questioned why his statue should be displayed in India. Stating that the statue was not broken while being brought down, Swamy asked communist leaders to install it at their party headquarters and worship it.
