Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday said that the BJP-led NDA government is "just as terrible" as the previous UPA government. The party further said, "The real agenda of the BJP is intolerance and the purpose is dividing society for political gains," adding that the "manufactured intolerance" was first rejected by the people of Delhi, and later Bihar.
