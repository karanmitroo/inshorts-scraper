The Lok Janashakti Party (LJP), an ally of the BJP-led NDA, has demanded that an independent agency probe the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar of the University of Hyderabad. "Definitely, (Bandaru) Dattatreyaâ€™s letter had a vital role in the whole affair. But to what extent... should be thoroughly probed", LJP MP Chirag Paswan said.
