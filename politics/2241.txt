For changing the names of the Central government schemes, BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose compared West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to Mughal Emperor Babur who demolished Ram Temple in Ayodhya and built Babri Masjid. "I think it's very foolish of Mamata to...give a name at the state level for the same scheme which the Centre has actually adopted," Bose added.
