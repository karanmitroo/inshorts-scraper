Attacking his rival and BJP's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal Monday said if she becomes the CM, she will be like Manmohan Singh in Congress party without a voice. Bedi is fit for police, and not the CM's post, he added. Further, Kejriwal said the BJP is resorting to “politics of poison” to win the elections.
