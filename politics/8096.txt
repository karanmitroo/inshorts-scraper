Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh on Saturday appreciated the even and odd-numbered cars policy of Delhi government and said that he had suggested the idea to former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit. Admitting that Congress couldn't implement it, Ramesh said "such kind of restrictions...has paid off" world over. Ramesh added that better public transport system will ensure that it doesn't fail.
