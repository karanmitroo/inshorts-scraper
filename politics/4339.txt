Criticising the demonetisation policy, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday tweeted that PM Narendra Modi should choose his favourite "chauraha" (roundabout) where people could punish him for creating a chaotic condition. "If elections are held in the country today, BJP would draw a nought," he stated. He also claimed that BJP would bite the dust in UP.
