The AAP's student wing Chatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti will not be contesting the Delhi University Students' Union elections this year. The party claimed that recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee, which set the expenditure at â‚¹5,000 per candidate, weren't followed. "DUSU polls have become all about giving movie tickets, organising fresher's parties and not about raising issues," the party said.
