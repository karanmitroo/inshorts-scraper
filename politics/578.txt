BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Sunday slammed the BJP as it was trailing behind NOTA (None of the Above) option in Tamil Nadu's RK Nagar bypoll. Swamy tweeted, "TN BJP record: A national ruling party gets a quarter of NOTA's vote. Time for accountability." After the eighth round of counting, rebel AIADMK leader Dhinakaran was leading with nearly 40,000 votes.
