Following MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s statement that one shouldn’t pay toll tax even if demanded at toll booth in Maharashtra, his workers Sunday went on a rampage vandalising the state toll booths. The workers vandalised four toll booths in Nagpur, one in Thane and one in Mumbai. Party sources said that they will intensify the agitation on Tuesday.
