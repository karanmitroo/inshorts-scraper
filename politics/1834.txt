The BJP government in Gujarat distributed around 12,000 school bags with Samajwadi Party leader and former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's photo on them. The school bags had the government's 'Jilla Panchayat Shala Praveshotsav' stickers, but a picture of Akhilesh Yadav beneath them. The bags were purchased from a Surat-based company, through an e-tender.
