RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Friday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the scrapping of reservation for OBC candidates for the posts of professors and associate professors. “It is a well-known fact that there has been an organised attempt to deprive people of reservation,” Yadav wrote. He also threatened to start a movement against the decision.
