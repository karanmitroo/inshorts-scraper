Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath on Monday said many initially thought PM Narendra Modi had nominated a 'namoona' as the CM. He defended his government's crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses and asserted that it was a part of a 2014 NGT order. Adityanath further said most of his Cabinet colleagues were vegetarians and asked if they were inferior to non-vegetarians.
