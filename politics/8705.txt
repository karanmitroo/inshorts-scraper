The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) would be contesting only from the Seemanchal region of Bihar, party President Asaduddin Owaisi told the media from Hyderabad. The backwardness of the region would be the main poll issue for AIMIM, he added. Earlier, the Hyderabad-based party had contested and won two seats in the Maharashtra Assembly.
