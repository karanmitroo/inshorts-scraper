Fifty-two AAP MLAs, including Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, were released by the police on Sunday. They were detained earlier in the day during their protest march towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi's residence after a police complaint accused Sisodia of intimidating businessmen. In reply, Sisodia had offered to surrender before Modi and asked the Centre not to interfere in Delhi’s governance.
