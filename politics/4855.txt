Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Monday, in an interview, defended dynastic politics stating, "In a family of doctors, professors or business people, one or the other within the family will choose the path of the father, right?". She, however, refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi's elevation as Congress President. "I'm not the one to decide on it," she said.
