Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday claimed West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has "accepted defeat". Modi said, "Earlier when polls ended, we used to hear it was largely peaceful... after the end of the third phase today, we hear news that many were beaten up, killed and of booth capturing." He added, "one does... everything as the end comes near."
