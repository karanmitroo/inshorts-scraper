Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the living conditions of minorities in poll-bound West Bengal were "extremely inadequate" despite political stability. Jaitley said the model followed in the state causing slow growth levels could be a factor for the condition. He was referring to a report ‘Living realities of Muslims in West Bengal’ released by Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen.
