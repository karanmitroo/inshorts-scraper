Tamil Nadu CM and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa on Thursday  deplored the restrictions imposed in calculation of poll expenses. Coming down heavily on the Election Commission’s methodology of calculating expenses of election rallies, she said, “It is nothing but mockery of democracy. Because of this rule, I cannot even introduce my party candidates. I cannot even mention the candidate’s name.”
