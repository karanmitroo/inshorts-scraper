The Chief Election Commissioner's office on Monday ordered transfer of 5 SPs and 1 DM ahead of the Lok Sabha poll in West Bengal. Reacting to EC's order, CM Mamata Banerjee declared, "I challenge the EC to remove anybody while I am in charge. How can the EC transfer and name new officers without consulting the state government?".
