Two hundred DMK workers, including four candidates, have been booked for allegedly violating the model code of conduct by causing public nuisance and gathering in groups without permission. They earlier entered into an argument, as one group began raising slogans praising DMK chief M Karunanidhi. Another group countered the action by shouting slogans praising late DMK leader Veerapandi Arumugam.
