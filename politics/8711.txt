CPI leader Atul Anjan has sparked a row for holding Sunny Leone's condom advertisement responsible for the increasing rape cases. "This ad develops a sexually infected mindset and demolishes your sensibility," Anjan said during a rally in Ghazipur, UP. Reacting to this, comedian Vir Das tweeted, "[I]f ads for safe sex cause rape, then ads for refrigerators should cause starvation."
