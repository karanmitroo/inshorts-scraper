Punjab Home Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday said that the AAP has very close links with radical organisations while terming its MP Bhagwant Mann's act of filming Parliament's security a 'very serious lapse'. The SAD leader also said that his party is not bothered by the emergence of AAP in Punjab. “People will reject them,” he added.
