Following her conviction by the Supreme Court in the disproportionate assets case, ex-AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan on Wednesday surrendered before a Bengaluru Court. Sasikala was handed a four-year jail term by the apex court and was also barred from contesting elections for ten years. The Supreme Court had earlier refused to give Sasikala additional time to surrender.
