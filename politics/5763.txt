Referring to attempts by opposition parties to forge a Dalit-Muslim allegiance, BJP General Secretary P Muralidhar Rao on Wednesday said that unity between the two is not sustainable. He added that Dalits cannot “grow” under Muslims and that it has been “historically proven” that whenever the two communities got together, Dalits got “wiped out”.
