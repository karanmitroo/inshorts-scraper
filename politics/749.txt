Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University has cancelled BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's talk titled 'Why Ram Mandir in Ayodhya?' scheduled on the 25th anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition on Wednesday. While university authorities have not divulged the reason for cancelling the talk, Swamy said the left-wing must have pressurised Vice Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar to take the decision.
