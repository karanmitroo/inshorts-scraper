Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday urged the Centre to permit the use of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes until December 30 citing that the move has caused people "inexplicable hardships". Questioning Centre's argument that demonetisation would check black money, Vijayan claimed that black money lobbyists had prior information about it. "There is total chaos in the country", he asserted.
