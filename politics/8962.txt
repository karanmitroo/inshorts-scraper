Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday targeted PM Narendra Modi in his tweet saying his "party won't let PM take away the land of farmers.'' Rahul undertook a 10-km long 'padyatra' from Andhra to highlight issues faced by farmers and women self-help groups. This is Gandhi's first visit in the state after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.
