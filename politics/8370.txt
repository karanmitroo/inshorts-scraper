DMK chief M Karunanidhi on Saturday criticised Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha and said that the arrest of 45-year-old folk singer C Kovan was an example of democracy being stifled under ‘Amma’s’ rule. Kovan was charged with sedition on Friday and picked up by TN police over songs criticising CM. DMK supremo's statement reportedly asked for Kovan's release.
