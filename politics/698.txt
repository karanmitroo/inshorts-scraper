A video of Karnataka BJP leader KS Eshwarappa asking party members to "lie if you have to, but don't admit you don't know" has emerged online. "When it comes to PM Narendra Modi, tell that the Pakistanis are never spared...The entire world accepts...that Modi is a strong man, so what's the harm in hyping it?" he says in the video.
