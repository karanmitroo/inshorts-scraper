Opposition parties have launched protests after the Haryana government installed a statue of RSS ideologue Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya at Haryana Raj Bhawan in Chandigarh, a city that doesn't permit installation of any statues. "Raj Bhawan is above party politics and hence any attempt to politicise it, is reprehensible," opposition party leader Abhay Chautala said in a letter to the government.
