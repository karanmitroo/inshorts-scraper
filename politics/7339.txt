Uttarakhand Assembly Speaker GS Kunjwal on Saturday issued a notice under the anti-defection law to nine rebel Congress MLAs. This follows political turmoil in the state with the opposition BJP staking a claim to form the government after nine Congress MLAs switched sides. Under the anti-defection law, the Speaker can suspend the Congress legislators if charges of defection are proved.
