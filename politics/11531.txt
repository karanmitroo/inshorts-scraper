Following SP supremo Mulayam Singh’s comment on rape, SP leader Abu Azmi Friday said that any woman who has sex outside marriage should be hanged, including rape victims. "Rape is punishable by hanging in Islam. But here, nothing happens to women, only to men. Even the woman is guilty... it should be punished as prescribed in Islam,” he added.
