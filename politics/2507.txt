The Election Commission on Monday asked the Sasikala faction of AIADMK to stop using the 'two leaves' symbol on its website and social media accounts. The poll panel has sought a reply from the faction by 11 AM on April 6. The commission had earlier directed the Sasikala and Panneerselvam factions to choose new symbols for upcoming by-polls.
