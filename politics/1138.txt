Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi on Saturday said that CM Nitish Kumar-led state government wants to build "a school or college or orphanage" on RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav's controversial land. Lalu should accept before the CBI that he is involved in corruption and hand over the three-acre plot to the state government, he added.
