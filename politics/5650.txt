BJP leader Sushil Modi on Monday said the party will carry out massive protests to pressurise the Bihar government to approach the Supreme Court and get former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin's bail cancelled. BJP had earlier said that the Bihar government paved the way for Shahabuddin’s release. Shahabuddin has been in jail since 2005 in connection with a murder case.
