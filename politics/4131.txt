Former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said, "I am a soldier first and then a politician. One shouldn't forget his/her first love and mine is Army." Singh was addressing a press conference in Delhi, ahead of the upcoming Punjab Assembly elections, wherein he asked everyone present to observe a two-minute silence for soldiers who die for the country.
