The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday released video footage which showed the Delhi BJP Vice President Sher Singh Dagar attempting to poach AAP MLA by offering him Rs.4 crore.
AAP's chief Arvind Kejriwal said they will lodge a complaint with election commission in the matter. However BJP has dismissed these allegations questioning the authenticity of the video.
