Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday dared the BJP to arrest Congress President Sonia Gandhi in connection with her alleged links in the multi-crore AgustaWestland chopper deal. "BJP’ll never do it. BJP’S intentions are bad. For five years, BJP will engage in political rhetoric. There is a strong relationship between Congress and BJP," Kejriwal added.
