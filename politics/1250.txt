The Congress on Monday posted a poll on Twitter, asking which Indian Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the Sardar Sarovar Dam. People responded to the polls with their own polls like "When did construction start - a) Day of foundation stone, b) 1 year later, c) Cong forgot about the project, d) 1987".
