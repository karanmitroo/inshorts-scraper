Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said that the financial year may soon begin from January in sync with the calendar year. "The matter of changing financial year is under consideration of the government," he told the Lok Sabha. In May, Madhya Pradesh became India's first state to shift its financial year format to January-December from the present April-March cycle.
