BJP's Assam leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, who quit Congress to join BJP, has said Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi has no political knowledge and doesn't even know where Manipur is on the map of India. "His comments are based on the lines and statements fed to him by others," Sarma said. "We plan to wrest Tripura from the Left," he added.
