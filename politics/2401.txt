An Assam court has issued an arrest warrant against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after he failed to appear before it in connection with a defamation case concerning his tweet on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The case is related to Kejriwal's tweet that said, "Modi has studied up to class 12. His degrees after that are fake."
