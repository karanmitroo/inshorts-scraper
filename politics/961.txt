In an indirect reference to PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday said the party must stop being a "one-man show and a two-man Army". Stating that the BJP should stop taking its opponents lightly, Sinha said that the party's veterans including Lal Krishna Advani and Yashwant Sinha should not have been sidelined.
