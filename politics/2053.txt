Sacked Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra on Sunday claimed that he saw Health Minister Satyendar Jain give ₹2 crore to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at his residence on Friday. Mishra further alleged that Jain had told him that he had "settled" a ₹50 crore land deal for a relative of Kejriwal. Mishra also targeted the CM for avoiding the media.
