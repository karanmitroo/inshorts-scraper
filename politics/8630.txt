Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday dared the Central government and the RSS to scrap reservations. "You are talking about ending reservations. We'll increase the reservation percentage for different communities... If you have drunk 'mai ka dudh' (mother's milk), scrap it," Lalu said after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat pitched for a review of the reservation policy.
