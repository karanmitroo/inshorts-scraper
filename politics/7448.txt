CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday said that the present regime at the Centre would resemble Adolf Hitler's model of fascism if a parallel was drawn with history. Yechury added that the BJP and RSS had manufactured an "aggressive nationalism debate" to force their agenda on the nation, and convert a democratic, secular country into a "Hindu rashtra."
