Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said, "Except our Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley), no one in the world says that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will not be hit." Further slamming the Centre's demonetisation move, Chidambaram added, "There is no record of a cabinet meeting on November 8. Ministers were kept as prisoners when the Prime Minister announced demonetisation on TV."
