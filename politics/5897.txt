Congress has claimed PM Narendra Modi is not the first to voice concern over the Balochistan issue as the UPA government did it too. The first time the UPA condemned human rights violations in Balochistan was on December 27, 2005, it said. The party's statement comes after it distanced itself from its leader Salman Khurshidâ€™s remarks on the Balochistan issue.
