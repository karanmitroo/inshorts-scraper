RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's son and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, who is accused of corruption in land-for-hotel deals, said, "I was only 13 when the sale of railway hotels took place in 2004." He added, "I did not even have a moustache at that time. How can a 13 or 14-year-old do all this?"
