A Bajrang Dal leader from Agra, Govind Parashar, has announced a â‚¹1-lakh cash reward for "anyone who can bring the head" of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah. Parashar dubbed Abdullah as an anti-national for allegedly defending those who pelt stones and attack the security forces. Notably, Abdullah was declared winner in the Srinagar by-polls on Saturday.
