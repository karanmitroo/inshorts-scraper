The Supreme Court on Wednesday criticised the BJP government for not showing any urgency in protecting the river Ganga, a project which was one of Modiâ€™s pet promises. It said that, some issues that ought to be on backburner, are being put on the front burner. The solicitor general appearing for the centre sought two weeks adjournment on the issue.
