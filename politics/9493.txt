Congress president Sonia Gandhi visited rain-hit farmers in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday and assured them complete support along with adequate compensation. She told the farmers, who suffered severe crop loss, that she will fight for their rights. Sonia also walked half-a-kilometer in the fields to survey the damaged crops.
