The Shiv Sena on Saturday criticised PM Narendra Modi saying that the promises given by him remain unfulfilled. "There was a sprinkling of 'achche din' (good days) but none of this reached people", said an editorial in Sena's newspaper 'Saamana'. Sena also said that issues like corruption, unemployment and terrorism remain, though it's Modi government's second year in power.
