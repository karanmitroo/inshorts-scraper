Congress on Sunday called "Awaaz-e-Punjab", the new party launched by cricketer-turned-politician and former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, a "BJP-sponsored programme" to divide the anti-incumbency vote. "We have to wait and see how many BJP people board Sidhu's bandwagon," it added. Congress also called AAP, a "bunch of opportunists" whose real face was exposed in the wake of various controversies.
