With MNS chief Raj Thackeray keeping up the heat over flawed toll collection system, Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan has agreed to shut down 22 toll plazas immediately. Seemingly, Chavan admitted serious irregularities in toll collection and said a new policy awaits cabinet's nod. Meanwhile, Thackeray is reportedly exhorting citizens not to pay toll till the new policy is in place.
