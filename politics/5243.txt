National Conference President Farooq Abdullah has said that it's a pity to see some people selling soldiers’ blood to win elections and by doing so they are mocking the soldiers' lives. “This is not good for India. If you want to win elections, win it by speaking truth and not on things which are out of your hold,” he added.
