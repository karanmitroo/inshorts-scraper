In the first public statement following her conviction in the disproportionate assets case, AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan has said she feels "satisfied" that party MLAs are supporting her despite facing troubles. "I'm sure we'll get the invitation (to form the government)... soon," she added. She also asked AIADMK workers to not cry over her conviction and keep working without fear.
