The wedding venue for Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi's son has been changed from Shakha Maidan to Veterinary college ground for "security reasons" as "some leaders" were "threatening to disrupt the marriage". RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tej Pratap had allegedly said he will expose and thrash Modi if he attends his son's wedding ceremony on December 3.
