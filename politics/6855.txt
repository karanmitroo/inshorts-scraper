The Shiv Sena on Wednesday said that the way the BJP has changed their stand on Hurriyat and Kashmir, allowing Hurriyat leaders to hold talks with Pakistan's government, can be compared to a chameleon's nature. The party, in its editorial mouthpiece 'Saamna', stated that PM Narendra Modi had earlier said he will discuss anything and everything with Pakistan except Kashmir.
