In a major security scare on Wednesday, Home Minsiter Rajnath Singh's helicopter lost its way during his poll campaigning in Jharkhand. Instead of landing in Singhbhum districtâ€™s Badajamda town, the helicopter landed in Majhgaon, which is considered as a highly sensitive zone. The pilot will now be investigated over how he lost his way and went on the wrong route.
