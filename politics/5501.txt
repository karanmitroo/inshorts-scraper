Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Amey Khopkar on Sunday said that the party’s 48-hour ultimatum to Pakistani artists and actors is over and none of them is in Mumbai now. The party had on Friday warned Pakistani artists and actors to leave India immediately or they will be ‘pushed out’. It had also threatened those who cast these actors.
