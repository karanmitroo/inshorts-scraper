Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will finally settle for two big adjacent duplex houses on Bhagwan Dass Road, which is nowhere near as grand as the previous CM's residence. However, this is larger than the area of bungalows allotted to many SC judges and Union Cabinet ministers, sources say. Currently, Kejriwal stays in an IRS flat allotted to his wife.
