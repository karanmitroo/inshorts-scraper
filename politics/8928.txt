AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has alleged that the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi had saved former minister Mayaben Kodnani and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi, convicted in 2002 post-Godhra riot case. Modi had asked the prosecution not to press for death sentence of Kodnani and Bajrangi, Owaisi said. He further questioned, "Shouldn't those who killed 92 persons get death sentence?"
