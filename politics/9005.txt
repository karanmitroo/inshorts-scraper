The BJP on Thursday suspended its leader and chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Backward Class and Minority Welfare Commission, Gulab Singh Kirar, after the CBI filed an FIR against him in the Vyapam scam. Gulab, who was serving as minister of state, was also named an accused by the SIT, Gwalior, in the same case a year ago.
