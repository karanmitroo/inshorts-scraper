BJP President Amit Shah on Wednesday said that the "CPI(M)-Congress understanding is not a ‘joth’ (alliance) but a ‘ghot’ (nexus)." "In Bengal, the two parties (Cong-CPI-M) are in alliance while they are opponents in Kerala. We are waiting to see what these parties do in Rajya Sabha," Shah said, while addressing a rally in poll-bound West Bengal.
