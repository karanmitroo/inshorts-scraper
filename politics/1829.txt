A case was registered against three people, including two Samajwadi Party leaders, on Monday for announcing a ₹1 crore reward to kill UP CM Yogi Adityanath. The case was filed by a BJP leader after he saw the post on Facebook. SP's Sushil Yadav had uploaded Yogi's photoshopped image, on which another leader had announced ₹1 crore to kill him.
