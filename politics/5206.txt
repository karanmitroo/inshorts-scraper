Asking if local MP Rahul Gandhi was busier than Union Ministers, Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Saturday slammed him for not attending two Central government functions in his constituency Amethi. Rahul Gandhi had earlier released a letter saying he would have attended the inauguration of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology had it been scheduled on a "mutually convenient" date.
