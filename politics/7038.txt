Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on Friday slammed DMK Chief M Karunanidhi over the issue of Katchatheevu island being ceded to Sri Lanka. She alleged that Karunanidhi was a "party" to the issue because he did not move court against the ceding. "By doing so (not moving the court), he had betrayed Tamil Nadu and its fishermen," she said.
