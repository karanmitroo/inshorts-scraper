Bihar Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi on Wednesday asked CM Jitan Ram Manjhi to prove his majority on the floor of the House on Feb 20. The Governor's direction to Manjhi came after JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar took 130 MLAs to the President's House to show that he enjoys majority support in the state Assembly.
