Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said BJP had lost a "staunch supporter" and warned that the upcoming elections would not be "friendly matches". "The BJP President says this is a friendly match...while the state leaders call this a 'Mahabharat' between 'Kauravas' and 'Pandavas'," he added. Thackeray said he did not want to play the politics of alliance anymore.
