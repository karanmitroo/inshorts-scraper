Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary Sudhakar Reddy has expressed surprise over PM Narendra Modi calling on Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at her residence during his Chennai visit on Aug 7. "There should be some dignity and decorum, he should have asked Jayalalithaa to come to Raj Bhavan to meet him," Reddy added.
