After cricketer-turned-politician and ex-BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu formed a new political party named 'Awaaz-e-Punjab', a Twitter user posted, "#TOKOTHALI would have been apt (name) for Sidhu." Another user tweeted, "I hope Kapil Sharma would be its vice president." Further, one of the users asked why he adopted a Persian name and added, "Why Awaaz-e-Punjab and not Punjab-di-aawaaz?"
