The Delhi Cabinet on Thursday asked Lt. Governer Najeeb Jung for a Special Investigation Team to probe the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Arvind Kejriwal had been demanding SIT ever since Rahul Gandhi admitted the involvement of Congress men in the riot. Congress Leaders Sajjan Kumar, Jagdish Tytler, HKL Bhagat were among the few names accused of instigating the mob during riots.
