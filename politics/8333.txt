PM Narendra Modi on Monday slammed Congress for lecturing the Centre on tolerance by reminding them of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. "Do you remember what happened in Delhi on November 2, 1984? Sikhs were killed. There were serious charges against Congress leaders," Modi said at a rally in Bihar. "It's ironical that Congress is now talking about tolerance," he added.
