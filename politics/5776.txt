Criticising Union Minister Mahesh Sharma over his comment that foreign female tourists must refrain from wearing skirts, Congress on Monday said if he has his way, every woman in India would wear a burqa. The Culture Minister at times comes out with the most uncultured remarks, Congress added. Sharma later clarified that his statements were in reference to religious places.
