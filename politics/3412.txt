BJP MP Uma Bharti has claimed she had got rapists tortured in jail when she was Madhya Pradesh CM, and had let victims watch. Referring to the gang-rape of a mother-daughter duo in Bulandshahr in 2016, Bharti said, "Rapists should be hung upside down and beaten till their skin comes off. Salt and chilly should be rubbed on their wounds".
