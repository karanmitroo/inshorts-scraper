Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday criticised the Centre for not including any city from UP and Bihar in the 20 smart cities list and termed it ungrateful. Kumar reminded BJP it had won 104 Lok Sabha seats from UP and Bihar, and promised 100 smart cities nationally. Meanwhile, Yadav pitched for smart villages.
