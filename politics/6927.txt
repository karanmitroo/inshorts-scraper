Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that the people of India have a choice between the AAP model of governance and the "discredited" Gujarat model, which has "cheated" Indians. Kejriwal claimed the people are "so satisfied with AAP’s model of governance in the national capital that if elections are held today BJP won’t win even a single seat".
