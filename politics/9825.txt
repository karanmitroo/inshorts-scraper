According to sources, Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi may recommend the dissolution of the House on Friday with Manjhi camp-follower, Shakuni Chaudhary, saying, "Manjhi is fire, and whoever tries to touch him would burn his hands." Adding to adversary Nitish Kumar's problems, at least 25 JD(U) MLAs are backing Manjhi and would vote for him should the need arise.
