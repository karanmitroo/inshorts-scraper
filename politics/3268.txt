Responding to PM Narendra Modi's attacks on the ruling SP regime in UP, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said, "I think the prime minister should try the Agra-Lucknow expressway once. After that, he too will vote the SP." Akhilesh added that he will build a 350 km long expressway from Lucknow to Ballia in 30 months if re-elected.
