Union Minister Uma Bharti on Tuesday said the use of red beacons, stopping traffic and delaying flights was acceptable if a minister was on official duty. A minister missing an official meeting might delay projects and cause losses worth crores to the exchequer, she added. Notably, this comes after Uttar Pradesh and Punjab CMs barred ministers from using red beacons.
