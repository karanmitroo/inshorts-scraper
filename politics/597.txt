Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said that the Parliament working on and off is not good for the country. This comes after Congress' demand for an apology over PM Narendra Modi's remarks on former PM Manmohan Singh led to repeated adjournments of the Rajya Sabha. PM Modi had earlier suggested Singh colluded with Pakistan to defeat BJP in Gujarat.
