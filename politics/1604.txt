Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday took to Twitter to suggest that JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar is a "murderer of trust & dacoit of mandate". This comes days after Nitish Kumar resigned as Bihar's Chief Minister to form a new government with support from BJP. Notably, 14 JD(U) and 12 BJP leaders were inducted into the Bihar Cabinet on Saturday.
