While speaking at the BJP National Executive on Sunday, PM Narendra Modi said the party's leaders need lessons on keeping quiet. "Every time I switch on television, I see a BJP leader making one or the other statement," Modi added. Further, he told the leaders that there was no need to speak every time a mike was put before them.
