A day after Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi reportedly entered Somnath Temple as non-Hindu, party leader Kapil Sibal claimed that PM Narendra Modi was not a "real Hindu". Adding that PM Modi quit Hinduism and imbibed Hindutva which has nothing to do with Hinduism, Sibal said a real Hindu is one who considers every Indian his brother, sister or mother.
