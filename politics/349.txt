BJP MLA T Raja Singh has said that those who do not go to RSS shakha cannot be Hindus. "I do believe that those who do take part in a shakha can work for the betterment of the country and religion," he added. However, Congress criticised his statements, saying people don't need an RSS "certificate" to prove they are Hindus.
