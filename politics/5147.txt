Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has asked Rahul Gandhi to not do "partisan politics" over the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme and to check his facts regarding its implementation. This comes after Rahul accused the Centre of reducing the pension of disabled soldiers. Prasad also asserted that OROP is in place and in tune with the Seventh Pay Commission.
