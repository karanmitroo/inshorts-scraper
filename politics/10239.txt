Vishwa Hindu Parishad's (VHP) working president Pravin Togadia added fuel to fire in the recent conversion-row, saying ancestors of Indian Muslims and Christians were Hindus. Togadia further added, "History says that many people converted to Islam due to atrocities and by the force of the swords of Mughal emperors." He also stood in support of re-conversions.
