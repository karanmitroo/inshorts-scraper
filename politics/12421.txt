Kerala CM Oommen Chandy on Wednesday said that the main objective of both CPI-M and BJP is to ensure that Congress gets less seats in the coming Lok Sabha polls, hence, CPI-M would not hesitate to join hands with BJP to target their common enemy, Congress. CPI-M had earlier joined hands with BJP in 1977 and 1989.
