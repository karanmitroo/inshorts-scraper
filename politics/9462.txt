Goa minister Dipak Dhavalikarâ€™s wife Lata has sparked a row by asking parents not to send their children to a convent school. Lata, a functionary of right-wing organisation Sanatan Saunstha, also asked Hindu men and women to sport a tilak and kumkum respectively, while leaving from home. Furthermore, she said females adopting Western culture are responsible for increasing rape incidents.
