Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief, Raj Thackeray, has expressed his displeasure over a poster (having his photo) installed on an air-conditioned toilet in East Kandivli (Mumbai) and asked his men to remove it immediately. Thackeray said, "People using the toilet will get embarrassed. They'll think I'm looking at them."
