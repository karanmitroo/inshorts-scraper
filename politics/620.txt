The Congress party's chief ministerial candidate and current CM Virbhadra Singh has conceded the party's defeat in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections. "I accept the victory of BJP. I, being the CM, take full responsibility of our performance here," he said. This comes after the BJP secured a lead in nearly two-thirds of the state's 68 Assembly seats.
