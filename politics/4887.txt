Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that he does not agree with anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare's views on demonetisation. Notably, Hazare had supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move saying "it could lead to the beginning of a new Indian marching towards a corruption-free society". Kejriwal had earlier said that the Centre's demonetisation move is a big scam.
