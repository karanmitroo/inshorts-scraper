Irom Sharmila, also known as Manipur's 'Iron Lady', on Sunday said there is no change in her decision to join politics despite people opposing her decision to end her 16-year-old fast. She hoped this will make a "new beginning" in her campaign against AFSPA. "Yes, I want to become CM. If I am CM I can repeal... AFSPA", she asserted.
