Shiv Sena has supported singer Sonu Nigam's tweet against 'azaan on loudspeakers', stating, "noise pollution is like slow poison which should be stopped". "Whoever has tweeted isn't important, talking about noise pollution and its effects on people is an important matter," said Sena MP Manisha Kayande. There should be no noise between 10pm to 6am in the city, she added.
