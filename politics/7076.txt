Congress leader Jagmeet Singh Brar on Saturday said 'Coffee with Captain' is a Western concept and he would prefer to 'have a glass of Lassi' instead. Brar, whose expulsion has been recommended by Captain Amarinder Singh, said he would not leave the party just to satisfy Singh's ego. Notably, 'Coffee with Captain' is Singh's campaign to engage with the public.
