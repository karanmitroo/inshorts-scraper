NCP on Tuesday said that it can sue Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for calling party President Sharad Pawar a black market trader. "But we have no time to waste on this man," NCP leader Majeed Memon said. "Kejriwal is not a rational person; his statements are not mature statements. He makes allegations without bothering about consequences," Memon added.
