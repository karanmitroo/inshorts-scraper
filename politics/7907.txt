The Shiv Sena on Wednesday said the BJP was repeating Congress' mistakes, and asked what had changed in the policy against Pakistan, the Ram temple issue and Hindutva since the BJP came to power. Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said, "The questions that were being asked after Mumbai terror attacks, the Kargil war, are being asked after the Pathankot incident as well."
