Tamil Nadu's ruling AIADMK on Saturday criticised arch rival DMK for enacting what it called a "drama" over the remission for the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. Referring to DMK Chief Karunanidhi's statement backing the government's stance on the remission, AIADMK alleged that the DMK was instigating its ally Congress to raise its voice against the remission.
