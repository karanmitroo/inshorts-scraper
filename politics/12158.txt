Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Saturday declared that his support to BJP’s PM nominee Narendra Modi is “conditional” and “issue based”. Asking the BJP to explain its policies regarding issues of black money, inflation and unemployment, Ramdev demanded scrapping all existing taxes, the implementation of a single bank transaction tax to tackle corruption and withdrawal of high denomination currency notes.
