Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Thursday called for the inclusion of educationally backward Muslims in OBCs and Christian Dalits in Scheduled Castes, for giving them reservation in education and jobs. Aiyar said that while Muslims cannot be included in Scheduled Castes as "the Muslim community says that they donâ€™t have Dalits", Christian Dalits should certainly be included.
