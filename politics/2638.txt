Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Rakesh Sinha on Saturday slammed CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury saying, "I think by the next elections, the CPI(M) would be marginalised as Kerala is on the path of saffronisation." His remark came after Yechury said that the saffron brigade is desperately trying to expand its base in the state through violent means.
