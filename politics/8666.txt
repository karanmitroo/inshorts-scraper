The Election Commission has issued an advisory asking "political parties and candidates to refrain from any deeds...[which] may be construed as being repugnant to honour and dignity of women". Forewarning that breach of the Model Code of Conduct may lead to "action" against offenders, the poll watchdog said the advisory had been issued after noting candidates' conduct during previous elections.
