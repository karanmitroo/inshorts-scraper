Opposing the appointment of BJP member Kiran Bedi as Puducherry Lieutenant Governor, JD(U) on Sunday alleged that such 'political' appointments are made to serve the interests of the ruling party. Pointing out that Bedi was BJP's CM candidate in Delhi, JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said, "They are first appointed and then misused. Even during Congress time... political appointments were made."
