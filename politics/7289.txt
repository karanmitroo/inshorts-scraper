Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday reportedly decided to stop the long-standing practice of giving gifts to Bihar legislators. Kumar claimed he has never accepted such freebies during his political career. This comes after two state BJP leaders returned the gifts given to them by the Education Department in protest against non-payment of salaries to lakhs of school teachers.
