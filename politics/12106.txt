India Today Groupâ€™s C-Voter survey shows, AAP has already hit the Congress in Haryana; next could be BJP. Currently BJP seems to be sweeping but if AAP enjoys the same growth in the run-up to elections, contest might become bipolar between them. If AAP crosses 25% vote share in triangular/multicorner contest, the amount of seats will start increasing massively.
