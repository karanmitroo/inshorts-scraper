With only 31% vote share, BJP is now the party with the lowest vote share to cross the magic number of 272. The previous lowest vote share for a single-party majority was in 1967, when the Congress won 283 out of 520 seats with 40.8% vote share. The 2014 results show just how fragmented the vote is.
