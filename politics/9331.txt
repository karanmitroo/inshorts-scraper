Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government has decided to monitor the content of all news channels closely between 9am to 11pm daily. The statement, made on Tuesday, comes days after he accused the media of accepting a 'supari' (contract) to finish off his Aam Aadmi Party. "This is being done for the first time by the Delhi Government," said a govt official.
