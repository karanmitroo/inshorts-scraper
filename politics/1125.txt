Bihar building construction department (BCD) has served notices to former ministers, including former deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, to vacate their officially allotted bungalows or pay rent 15 times the market rate. Earlier as well, BCD had asked some ministers to vacate houses after CM Nitish Kumar parted ways with the Grand Alliance comprising RJD and Congress in July.
