Uttar Pradesh Youth Congress workers have announced that they will hoist the national flag at all BJP and RSS offices across the state, apart from the residences of BJP MPs and MLAs. Last week, Congress workers hoisted the tricolour at RSS' office in Indore. Earlier, the HRD Ministry had directed all central universities to hoist the tricolour to "instill nationalism".
