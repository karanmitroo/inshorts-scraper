Criticizing PM Narendra Modi, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh Sunday said that the PM has failed to prove himself as a delivering leader so far and has only shown his conceiving side. Using Twitter, Singh further wrote, "Would Modiji now do something in UP which he represents and which has given him maximum seats in 2014 General Elections."
