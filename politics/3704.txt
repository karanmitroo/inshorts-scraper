DMK Working President MK Stalin on Wednesday urged the Tamil Nadu Government to take steps to get the full quantum of drought relief from the Centre and sanction â‚¹25,000 per acre to the affected farmers. Stalin claimed that while "225 farmers committed suicide" due to drought, it was "shocking" that the AIADMK had said only 17 had ended their lives.
