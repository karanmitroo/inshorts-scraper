Tamil Nadu on Thursday passed a bill seeking the indirect election of Municipal Corporation mayors by councillors and not by the people, as is the current practice. The state's Municipal Administration Minister said the bill's objective was to ensure better delivery of services to the public. However, the opposition claimed the bill was aimed at "stifling the voice of democracy".
