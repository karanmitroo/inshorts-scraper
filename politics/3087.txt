Reacting on the recent political scenario in Tamil Nadu, former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju wrote in a Facebook post that he would rather be dead than accept a jailbird's puppet as Chief Minister. "I am no longer a Tamizhan. I refuse to be a member of the people who don't mind living in disgrace and dishonour," he added.
