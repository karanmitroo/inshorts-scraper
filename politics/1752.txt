BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said that the party will have functional offices in all districts of India by December 2018. "The party's existence is through the smallest of the booth-level cadre. The party office is not less than a temple for workers," added Shah. He made the comments while inaugurating new premises of BJP's South Goa district headquarters.
