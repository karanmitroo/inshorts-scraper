Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Monday boycotted Bihar government's programme to honour freedom fighters. The BJP claimed that Singh skipped the felicitation because RJD leader Lalu Prasad, convicted in fodder scam case, had been invited to the function. Reportedly, Rajnath called up Bihar CM and spoke to him before calling off his visit.
