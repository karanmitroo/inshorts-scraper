Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Ashutosh on Saturday said that he would go to poll-bound Bihar to expose the BJP's "Gujarat model of governance" in front of the public. The journalist-turned-politician further alleged that PM Narendra Modi's men attacked Dilip Pandey and other AAP workers for opposing the PM. "The PM has made Delhi a police state," he added.
