BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said that he will move to the Supreme Court against the recent acquittal of AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa in a political corruption or grafts case. "I have decided to file Special Leave Petition in SC after June 1st if K'taka govt does not file. So no need to go to Karnataka High Court," he tweeted.
