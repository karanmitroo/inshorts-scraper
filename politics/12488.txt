With past records of assassination in Gandhi family, security agencies acknowledge Rahul Gandhi to be the highest-value target in India for terrorists. A source has revealed that Jaish-e-Mohammad militants had planned to kidnap Gandhi in 2007, but the plot was foiled after police arrested the militants. A kidnap plot by LeT was also thwarted during the UP polls in 2007.
