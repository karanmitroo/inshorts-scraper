BJP's Madhya Pradesh unit president Nand Kumar Singh Chouhan on Sunday backed CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the Vyapam scam controversy and said that he was "as holy as river Ganga". He also said that the CBI probe will prove his 'holiness'. "All attempts of the Congress to defame Chouhan will ultimately lead to its further downfall...," Nand Kumar added.
