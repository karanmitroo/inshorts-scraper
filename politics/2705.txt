The speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly on Wednesday suspended 19 legislators from opposition benches for nine months for creating a ruckus in the House. The opposition alleged that the action was taken by the ruling side to avoid defeat over a cut motion which requires voting. Later, Congress and NCP leaders also protested against the government at Vidhan Bhavan.
