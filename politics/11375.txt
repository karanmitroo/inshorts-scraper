Vishwa Hindu Parishad president Pravin Togadia fuelled controversy in Bhavnagar (Gujarat) Saturday evening with hate speech that targeted Muslims for buying properties in Hindu areas. Togadia even joined a group of protesters outside a house purchased by a Muslim businessman, and asked them to take complete control of the house and put a 'Bajrang Dal' board on it.
