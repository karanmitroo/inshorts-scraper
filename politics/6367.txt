The Muslim League, a member of the Opposition United Democratic Front, on Tuesday slammed Kerala Health Minister and CPI(M) leader KK Shylaja's remarks against chanting a Sanskrit shloka before Yoga Day celebrations in Thiruvananthapuram. Saying that "yoga crosses all barriers", former Kerala CM Oommen Chandy said it was unfortunate that the minister opposed the Centreâ€‹-approved shloka.
