Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday said that if he had to go to jail in the railway tender scam case, there would only be an increase of votes for him. Speaking at an event, Yadav termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as "desh ka badshah", under whose leadership democracy was being mocked.
