Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said the government will put the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill in Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon Session even if Congress continues to oppose it. Jaitley asserted that Congress' opposition was only "political" and not "ideological". Notably, the bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha, but is pending in the Rajya Sabha.
