Drawing reference from Hindu epic Mahabharata, Patidar leader Hardik Patel on Monday called Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan 'shakuni mama', adding that he is no more acceptable to the youth. Recalling the farmers' agitation in the state last year, Patel alleged the government is against farmers. He added he will campaign against the BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections.
