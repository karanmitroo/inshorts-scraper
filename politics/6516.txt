Meghalaya CM Mukul Sangma has written to the Congress leadership that the BJP has been trying to create trouble for his government since the NDA came to power at the Centre. Sangma warned against "black sheep" in the Congress' state unit who have been in touch with BJP leaders. However, Meghalaya's BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav denied the allegations.
