Amid the ongoing Lalit Modi and Sushma Swaraj row, it has emerged that the former had offered a board seat to the latterâ€™s husband, Swaraj Kaushal, in one of Modi's family-run firms. Reportedly, Kaushal was offered the position of director in an integrated chemical company in April this year, months after Swaraj helped the ex-IPL chief obtain UK travel documents.
