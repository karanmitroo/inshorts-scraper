BJP leader Anil Vij slammed Mamata Banerjee on Sunday, for her 'being an Indian' remark. "I feel bad when I see that this is my country," Mamata had said. Vij responded, saying, "If she is ashamed of being born as Indian then why doesn't she jump into the sea. It is also near to Kolkata, she should jump into it."
