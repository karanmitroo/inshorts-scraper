Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh is set to enter Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh, thus ending his 10-year-long self-imposed exile from active politics. He has also offered to contest the Lok Sabha elections from anywhere in the country and against any candidate, sources said. He took exile after he was defeated in 2003 at the hands of Uma Bharti.
