The Kerala government has ordered an investigation after the Congress-led Opposition alleged that the state budget was leaked from state Finance Minister Thomas Issac’s office on social media. Congress legislators read out details of the state budget even as Issac was presenting the document in the Assembly. "It has never happened in the legislative history of the country,” said Congress.
