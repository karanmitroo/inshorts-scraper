Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa is likely to skip PM Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony, sources said. The decision comes in the wake of the Narendra Modiâ€™s invite to Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa to attend his oath-taking ceremony. Earlier, the AIADMK supremo said Modi could have avoided the 'ill-advised' move of inviting the head of the island republic.
