Condemning Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's criticism of the Nehruvian development model, Congress on Monday alleged he was trying to please 'narcissist' PM Narendra Modi. "It's very clearly a part of the process of the Prime Minister trying to project himself as a demigod," it added. Jaitley is an admirer of Nehru and people know what he really believes, Congress said.
