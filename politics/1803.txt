Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray announced on Tuesday that his party will be supporting NDA's presidential nominee Ram Nath Kovind. Notably, Thackeray had earlier slammed the NDA saying, "Why you want a Dalit president? Is it just to get Dalit Votes? Such kind of petty vote politics ultimately ruins political parties. Shiv Sena has never done so."
