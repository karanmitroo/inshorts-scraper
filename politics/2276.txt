Reacting to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's 'dengue-chikungunya' remark, the BJP said that his statement reflects his frustration and disappointment. "It seems like he has accepted his failure. Public has been giving vote to the BJP for last ten years... Kejriwal government has lost all the elections... He thinks people of Delhi are fools," BJP leader Vijay Goel said.
