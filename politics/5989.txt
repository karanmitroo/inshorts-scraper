Mumbai Mayor and Shiv Sena politician Snehal Ambekar on Tuesday demanded the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) should be kept out of the ambit of the GST. Ambekar made the statement after chairing a meeting with 26 Mayors of Maharashtra. She claimed that GST will result in delaying of BMC projects, as getting grants from the concerned government will be hampered.
