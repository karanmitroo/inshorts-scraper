Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar on Monday claimed that the state has become backward due to the "hateful politics based on caste, creed and colour" played by 27 years of non-Congress governments. Addressing a publicâ€‹ meeting, the actor-turned-politician assured people that if Congress comes to power, Uttar Pradesh will see new dimensions of development in every aspect.
