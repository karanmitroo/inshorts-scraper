Arvind Kejriwal, who was born on August 16, 1968, worked with Mother Teresa at the Nirmal Hriday Home in Kalighat, Kolkata for two months after resigning from Tata Steel. "Mother Teresa kissed my hand...It was a divine moment for me," said the Ramon Magsaysay Awardee in an interview. Reportedly, Kejriwal will also attend Mother Teresa's sainthood ceremony in September 2016.
