Over three weeks after Pehlu Khan (55) was lynched by cow vigilantes in Rajasthan's Alwar, CM Vasundhara Raje on Tuesday said such incidents won't be tolerated and the culprits won't be spared. "Investigation is on and some people have been arrested," she added. On Sunday, 23 ex-bureaucrats had written a letter to Raje demanding justice in the case.
