The Opposition parties on Thursday demanded the Budget be presented after March 8, when the polling for the upcoming state Assembly elections ends. This comes after the parties like Congress, Trinamool, and DMK, among others met the Election Commission. "Populist measures could be taken in budget, so a just and fair election can't be held," Congress' Ghulam Nabi Azad said.
