In a mega political bender, rookie politician Arvind Kejriwal, with 38,000 votes, has defeated three-time CM Sheila Dikshit in her constituency of New Delhi by whopping 22,000 votes. The margin is so huge that even if BJP had not fielded its candidate (11,000 votes), the outgoing CM would still have not been able to catch up with Kejriwal.
