The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to conduct a probe into the sale of 21 sugar mills in 2010-11, which happened during the Mayawati-led BSP's rule. The state government suspects a â‚¹1,100-crore scam over the sale, and a CBI probe may also be ordered, an official spokesperson said. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath.
