TMC chief Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said the party, which won 211 seats in the West Bengal Assembly elections, would have won 10-12 seats more had there been no "infighting". She also promised strict action against those indulging in infighting. Further, she formed a committee to look into the reasons behind the defeat of eight sitting ministers in the polls.
