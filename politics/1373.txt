Around 100 BJP activists in West Bengal's Midnapore threw rotten eggs at JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar as he arrived for a rally. The activists also waved the Tricolour and asked him to "shift to Pakistan". Further, they also called him an agent of the Islamic State group and an "anti-national".
