Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi makes ill-mannered statements habitually. This comes after Gandhi termed the GST as 'Gabbar Singh Tax', citing the villain in 1975 Hindi film 'Sholay'. "However, I can understand his (Rahul's) mental condition after the Congress' embarrassing defeat in 2014 Lok Sabha elections," Pradhan added.
