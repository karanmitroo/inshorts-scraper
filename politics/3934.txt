BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said that he supports Jallikattu, but does not like anti-national elements in Tamil Nadu trying to go against the Constitution. Swamy had earlier suggested that the President’s Rule be imposed in Tamil Nadu if the state defies the Supreme Court’s ban on Jallikattu. Notably, Jallikattu is the traditional bull taming sport practised in the state.
