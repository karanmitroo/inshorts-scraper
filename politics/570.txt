Congress has called the government's policy to secure former Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav's release from Pakistan "inconsistent" and "flip-flop", adding that it will go against an early release. Asking the government to clarify its policy on bringing him back, the Congress condemned Pakistan for the treatment it meted out to Jadhav, saying that he looked under a lot of stress.
