Days after being removed from the post of Samajwadi Party state chief, supporters of UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav staged a protest on Saturday in Lucknow demanding his reinstatement. The supporters gathered outside party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav's residence and raised slogans like "netaji nyay karo". Notably, Akhilesh was replaced with his uncle Shivpal Yadav as the party's state President.
