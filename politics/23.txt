Referring to Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah as "Sultan", BJP MP Nalin Kumar Kateel on Monday called him a terrorist and accused him of supporting the alleged killing of 24 Hindu activists in the state. Alleging that the Congress has created terrorists, Kateel claimed that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi created terrorists through Khalistani separatist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.
