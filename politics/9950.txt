Responding to a question as to why not many among the Muslims join BJP,
Union Minister Gen.(retd) VK Singh Friday said that there is a "large section" among Muslims which does not feel that BJP is a Hindutva party, even though a false picture has been painted vis-a-vis the outfit. Narendra Modi government wants "everybody to be together", he added.
