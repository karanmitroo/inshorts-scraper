Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that the AAP government's actions suggest that it is anti-democratic. "We may have lost the election in Delhi due to a vote shift of few percent but now we are gaining this back," he said, while addressing the Delhi BJP's executive meeting. Jaitley also questioned claims of work done by the Kejriwal government.
