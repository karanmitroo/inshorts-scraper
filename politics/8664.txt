HRD Minister Smriti Irani on Sunday said the legal notice issued by Congress against her would not work as a deterrent. Congress had earlier issued a notice against Irani for claiming the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust had snatched farmers' land in Amethi. Daring Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi to have her imprisoned, Irani said she would "continue to raise Amethi's voice."
