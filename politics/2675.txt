Amid criticism of Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad over alleged assault of an Air India staffer, a video of ex-Congress MP from Telangana, Hanumantha Rao, reportedly abusing a policeman has surfaced. I wasn't allowed to hold a press conference in the Assembly premises, Rao alleged. Only MLAs, MLCs can speak at the designated area, the cop had told him.
