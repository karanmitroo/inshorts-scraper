The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed that the poster saying "Delhi Speaks - Modi for PM, Arvind for CM" was uploaded by an 'outsider', and not any party member. "It looks like some mischief; someone intruded our website, we are investigating the matter," said AAP leader Ashutosh. The poster, on the party's website for some hours, got much criticism.
