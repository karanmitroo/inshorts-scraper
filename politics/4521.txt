Following their outburst against the BJP-led government in the state, Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar on Monday sacked two ministers belonging to the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP). With the removal of Sudin Dhavalikar and Deepak Dhavalikar, the number of ministers in the Goa cabinet has reduced to 10. Notably, MGP had fought the 2012 Assembly elections in alliance with the BJP.
