The BJP on Tuesday objected to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's decision of sending 10 lakh litres water per day to Maharashtra's drought-hit Latur area. Asserting that one-third of Delhi's own population was being denied supply of potable water, leader of opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said that sending water to such a distance would be "unfeasible and uneconomical".
