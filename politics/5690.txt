Aam Aadmi Party’s volunteers in Barnala have accused the party observer Vijay Chauhan of “sexually assaulting” his domestic help and “hushing up the matter by paying ₹1 lakh”. In an audio clip released on Tuesday, a ticket aspirant from Dhuri, Rajwant Singh Ghulli, was reportedly heard trying to convince a woman not to press rape charges against Chauhan.
