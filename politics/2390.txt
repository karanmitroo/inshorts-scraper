The re-polling at 38 booths for the Srinagar Parliamentary seat on Thursday recorded a voter turnout of 2.02%, the Election Commission said. This is the worst turnout for an election in the history of Jammu and Kashmir, it added. The re-polling was ordered after 8 people were killed and 100 security personnel injured in clashes during the Sunday by-poll.
