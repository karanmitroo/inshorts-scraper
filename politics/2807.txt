BSP supremo Mayawati has said that her party will observe black day on the 11th of every month to protest against the alleged tampering with the Electronic Voting Machines in the recently concluded Uttar Pradesh polls by BJP. "I don't think... anyone will agree to the fact that BSP got such less votes in Muslim and Dalit-dominated areas," Mayawati added.
