Reacting to the resignation of senior Congress politician SM Krishna, BJP leader S Prakash on Monday said that 'misguided youth' in party Vice President Rahul Gandhi's leadership is neglecting the loyal services of Congress veterans. "He (Krishna) has clearly stated that Rahul is incapable of leading Congress. I think Congress is going to pay in the coming days," Prakash added.
