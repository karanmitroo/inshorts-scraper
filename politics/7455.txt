PDP President Mehbooba Mufti on Monday said her father's decision to ally with the BJP is 'patthar ki lakeer (carved in stone)'. However, she added that the agenda of the alliance was equally important and a forward movement on its implementation was a prerequisite for government formation. The decisions taken by my father were always in people's interest, she asserted.
