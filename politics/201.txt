The Election Commission (EC) has issued a notice to BJP MP Yashodhara Raje Scindia for making "statements amounting to threatening/intimidating of electors". This comes after a video showed Scindia telling people that they would not get the benefits of a centrally-funded scheme if they voted for Congress. This may amount to use of "undue influence" in elections, the EC added.
