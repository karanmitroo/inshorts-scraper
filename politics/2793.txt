Manipur got its first BJP-led government as N Biren Singh took oath as the Chief Minister of the state in Imphal on Wednesday. This comes after Governor Najma Heptulla invited the BJP to form a government. The BJP emerged as the second largest party in the 60-member Assembly, securing 21 seats, after elections results were declared on March 11.
