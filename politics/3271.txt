Human rights activist Irom Sharmila has declared that she will marry her partner, Desmond Coutinho, after the Assembly elections in Manipur are over. Sharmila in August 2016 ended her 16-year-long fast, which she had undertaken to protest over the misuse of Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA). She is contesting the elections as an independent candidate.
