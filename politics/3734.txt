Congress leader Sheila Dikshit on Sunday withdrew her CM candidature after the Samajwadi Party and Congress forged an alliance for Uttar Pradesh polls. She said it's time for the younger generation to take over and there cannot be two CM faces in an alliance in the politically crucial state. "I'll take up whatever role is given to me," she added.
