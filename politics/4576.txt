Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti on Friday reportedly walked out of a Cabinet meeting midway, following opposition from a BJP minister over restructuring of the Kashmir Police Service (KPS) officers cadre. Later, a delegation of ministers, including the deputy CM, reportedly met Mufti at her residence. Notably, BJP and PDP are coalition partners in the state government.
