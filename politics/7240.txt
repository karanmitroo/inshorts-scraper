Assam CM Tarun Gogoi has claimed that he was a 'real' Hindu and that those in the BJP were 'fake' and were only contractors out to protect Hinduism. "The BJP and RSS are trying to impose their own brand of Hinduism which the people do not like. Our real Hinduism does not teach us to hate other faiths," Gogoi added.
