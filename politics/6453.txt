Congress on Monday moved the Election Commission to demand cancellation of the elections to both Rajya Sabha seats from Haryana. It accused the BJP-led state government of "misusing" government machinery to defeat the Congress-backed candidate, RK Anand. Notably, 14 Congress votes had been declared invalid, leading to the election of the BJP-supported independent candidate, Subhash Chandra.
