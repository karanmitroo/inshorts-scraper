Tamil Nadu Cooperatives Minister Sellur Raju has said the government will help only those who are AIADMK cardholders and their families. "Party card is what identifies us and is equal to our life itself," he said. This comes even as state Deputy CM and party leader O Panneerselvam said benefits of government welfare schemes will be available to everyone.
