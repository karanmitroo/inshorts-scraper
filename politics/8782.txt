The Enforcement Directorate has reportedly decided to close the National Herald case, in a big relief for Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi. Both were summoned in the case in June 2014 after BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy filed a complaint that the duo misappropriated funds to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore when acquiring the now-defunct National Herald.
