Asserting that there is complete freedom of expression in India, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said those who complained about it should remember the Emergency. Every Indian has the freedom to call even the Prime Minister anything, he added. Media was censored and fundamental rights were broken during the Emergency under Congress rule, Naidu added.
