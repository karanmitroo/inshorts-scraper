Anna Hazare has asked the Election Commission (EC) to stop printing symbols of political parties on ballot papers and electronic voting machines. He said the practice was initially started to aid illiterate voters, but is now redundant as the EC has decided to print the contesting candidates’ photographs instead. He added that symbols can provide “unfair advantage” to some parties.
