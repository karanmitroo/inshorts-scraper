A worker of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), who failed to defend Lalu Prasad Yadav on a TV debate, has said that he fears for his life now. Sanoj Yadav had appeared on a TV debate during which he couldn't put up a defence for Lalu in the corruption and benami cases. He was beaten by Lalu's son later.
