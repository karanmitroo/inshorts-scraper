Ishrat Jahan, one of the five Muslim women who petitioned against the practice of instant Triple Talaq, was inducted into the BJP on Saturday, the party's West Bengal General Secretary Sayantan Basu said. Jahan had moved the Supreme Court after her husband broke their 15-year marriage by uttering 'talaq' thrice over a phone call from Dubai.
