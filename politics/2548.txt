Former Samajwadi Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia on Sunday officially joined BJP in presence of party President Amit Shah. "I gave so many years to the Samajwadi Party, but now when the 'samajwaad' (socialism) has gone missing there, I decided to move on," Bhatia said. Further, Bhatia praised Shah's leadership and said PM Modi has given a new vision to India.
