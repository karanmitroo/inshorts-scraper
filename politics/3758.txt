Newly-anointed Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu surprised reporters at the Chandigarh Press Club on Friday when he carried his portable temple to the press conference. The cricketer-turned-politician carried a small wooden box to the venue and opened it reverentially before addressing the media. The box contained two tiny idols, a Shivling with naag and a Nandi, along with some flowers.
