The Congress on Thursday said that the AAP is endorsing itself in the name of Mohalla Clinics. "Mohalla Clinic that is being run in New Delhi is just a type of advertisement," Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said. He further claimed that the clinics run for four hours a day, after which people sell milk and curd at the venue.
