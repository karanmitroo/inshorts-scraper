BJP MLA Vijay Bahadur Yadav was on Sunday suspended from the party for cross-voting during the Uttar Pradesh Rajya Sabha polls. Action has been sought against him as his act comes under "voluntary anti-defection law", BJP leader Suresh Khanna said. Notably, Yadav had voted for a Samajwadi Party candidate, saying he was "ready to make any sacrifice" for his act.
