Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Friday termed PM Narendra Modi as the "biggest patron of black money". Surjewala further said, "Modi is flouting all Income Tax rules to get black money converted into white using welfare schemes for the poor." He demanded that details of money deposited in banks between April-November by BJP leaders and RSS functionaries be made public.
