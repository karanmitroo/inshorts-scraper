Samajwadi Party leader Rajendra Chaudhary labelled both PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah as "terrorists", accusing them of spreading terror in a democracy. "They want to scare the voters...at some places even their own workers got scared," he said. "They're trying to defame UP. They will face bigger defeat in UP than they faced in Bihar," he added.
