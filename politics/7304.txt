Comparing the BJP-led NDA government with the Hitler regime, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Monday alleged that it wanted "to convert the secular, democratic republic of India into a rapidly intolerant, fascist Hindu Rashtra". Yechury further alleged that ruling dispensation is using 'nationalism' as an 'ideological weapon' just like Hitler used nationalism for the rise of fascism in Germany.
