Describing talks of an alliance with the Samajwadi Party as "hypothetical", Congress leader Raj Babbar on Monday said it will contest the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls alone. Stating that alliance talks "demoralises" workers, he said no such tie-up was "under consideration". CM Akhilesh Yadav recently commented that Congress and SP can together get over 300 seats in the polls.
