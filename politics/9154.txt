Union Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday said that Pakistan should reconsider its stand about not observing the International Yoga Day. "I would request them to rethink as we feel that yoga would help them bring in peace there in their country," Prasad said. "Yoga is not a symbol of any particular faith," he added.
