Maharashtra Health Minister Deepak Sawant has termed chewing tobacco as 'poison' and said, "We shouldn't sell this poison to people. We are making efforts to bring in a ban on chewing tobacco in Mumbai and Maharashtra." "We are working on a concept of 'cancer warrior', wherein government health workers will be trained to detect oral and breast cancers," he added.
