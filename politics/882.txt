Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said that dynasty is a lazy word used to describe political succession. Speaking at the 100th birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi, Ramesh said, "the same electorate which gave Mrs Gandhi a huge mandate in 1971, threw her out in 1977. And the same electorate brought her back in 1980."
