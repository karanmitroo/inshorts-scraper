Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao is set to present a gold moustache worth â‚¹75,000 to Lord Veerabhadra Swamy temple in Kuravi. Rao has been making such donations at various temples to fulfil a vow he had made for realisation of separate state Telangana. However, opposition parties have been accusing him of using public money to fulfil his personal vows.
