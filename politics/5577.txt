The BJP will reportedly launch four ‘parivartan yatras’ in October in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh with party’s top brass’ public meetings to counter the election campaigns of the ruling SP and Mayawati-led BSP. The yatras are expected to stretch for 100 days and conclude with PM Narendra Modi’s rally. As per reports, the yatras will start after the ‘inauspicious Shradh’ period.
