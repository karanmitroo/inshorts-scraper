BJP secretary Shrikant Sharma on Saturday took a jibe at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi by calling him "a baby of Congress". "People do not take him seriously. Even Congress does not take him seriously as it did not make him its president", Sharma said. His comments came after Gandhi, at the Bihar rally, accused the Modi-govenment of being pro-rich.
