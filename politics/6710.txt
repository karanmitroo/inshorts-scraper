The Election Commission on Monday claimed it is for the first time that it deferred polls due to use of money power in two Tamil Nadu constituencies â€“ Thanjavur and Aravakurichi. EC said polls were postponed to May 23, so that the "vitiating effect" of money power created by distribution of gifts and money to the electors loses its intensity.
