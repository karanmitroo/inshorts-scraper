Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday sacked two state corporation officials, known to be loyalists of his uncle Shivpal Yadav. This comes after SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav announced that the party would contest the 2017 polls without a chief ministerial candidate. He also chose the list of candidates proposed by Shivpal Yadav over the one sent by Akhilesh.
