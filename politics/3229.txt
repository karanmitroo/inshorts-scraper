Former Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam has made an appeal to AIADMK MLAs to vote against the trust vote in the state Assembly on Saturday and safeguard the interests of Amma (Jayalalithaa). Newly appointed CM Edapaddi K Palanisamy will seek to prove his majority in the house in the floor test. "Please think wisely before casting your vote," Panneerselvam said.
