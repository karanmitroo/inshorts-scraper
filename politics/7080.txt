The Congress on Monday expelled former MP Jagmeet Singh Brar from the party's primary membership with immediate effect for alleged "gross indiscipline and rebellious activities". Several party leaders from Punjab had earlier sought the expulsion of Brar from the party for allegedly hampering the party's interests in the state. Brar had reportedly challenged the party to expel him.
