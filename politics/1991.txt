Tamil actor Rajinikanth on Monday said, "If god is willing, I'll enter politics tomorrow. If I enter, I'll be very truthful and won't entertain people who are in this to make money." He added, "God decides what we have to do in life at every phase. Right now, he wants me to be an actor and I'm fulfilling my responsibility."
