Twitter slammed BJP MP Hema Malini for tweeting her film shoot photographs, even as 24 people were killed in her constituency Mathura when police tried to evict encroachers from a park. "While law and order isn't Hema Malini'sâ€‹ domain, expecting sense & sensitivity isn't asking for much!" a user tweeted. The actress deleted her tweet after criticism from users.
