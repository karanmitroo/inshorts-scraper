Congress on Thursday announced that former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu will contest the upcoming Assembly elections from Amritsar (East) constituency as a party nominee. "Navjot Singh Sidhu will contest from the constituency of his wife, Navjot Kaur Sidhu," state party chief Amarinder Singh said. The cricketer-turned-politician had resigned from the BJP in September 2016.
