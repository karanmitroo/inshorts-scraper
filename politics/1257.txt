Former Gujarat Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela, who quit the Congress in July, on Tuesday said that he has joined Jan Vikalp, which is a party formed by his supporters in the poll-bound state. "I will not criticise Narendra Modi or Amit Shah, but will criticise the BJP government in the state. Similarly, I will not criticise Sonia either," Vaghela added.
