Rashtriya Janata Dal Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said that people are "jealous" of Yoga guru Baba Ramdev because he is "highly successful". Yadav, who met Ramdev in Delhi, also said that he is a permanent brand ambassador of the latter's products. Earlier in April, Yadav had described Ramdev as a "capitalist and industrialist of the country".
