AAP leader Somnath Bharti's wife, Lipika Mitra, has accused him of domestic violence and assault. AAP MLA's wife also approached the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) which has summoned Bharti to appear before it on June 26. "Can't explain in couple of words. It's been going on since 2010. I want to get out from this marriage," Lipika said.
