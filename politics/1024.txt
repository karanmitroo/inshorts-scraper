West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre, saying she will not link Aadhaar to her phone number and dared authorities to disconnect her phone if they wanted to. She also urged an audience of about 3,000 party workers and leaders not to link the two and said, "How many telephone connections will they disconnect?"
