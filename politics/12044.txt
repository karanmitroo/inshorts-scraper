The Election Commission on Friday cautioned Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for violating the model code of conduct in the run-up to the recent assembly elections, by distributing pamphlets appealing for votes on grounds of religion. Kejriwal, who had appealed Muslims through pamphlets to vote for AAP, said it was part of the exercise for maintenance and promotion of communal harmony.
