Shiv Sena leader Manisha Kayande on Wednesday said that any comment made by BJP against its party chief Uddhav Thackeray will not be tolerated. Shiv Sena has never made any personal remarks regarding any of the BJP leaders, Kayande added. Her statement came after BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari compared Thackeray with actor Asrani's famous character as a jailor in 'Sholay'.
