BJP spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh said on Sunday that Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi was just trying to prove his presence to the nation after his vacations, and his rhetoric goes without any substance. Rahul Gandhi had said on Saturday that it will take "15 minutes" to pass the Goods and Services Tax bill if the government agrees to Congress' conditions.
