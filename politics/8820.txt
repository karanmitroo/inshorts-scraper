Maharashtra Transport Minister Diwakar Raote fined his son Rs 1,000 for interfering in an on-duty government servant's work. Raote said his 38-year-old son began arguing with policemen in Mumbai when they suspected he would be driving while drunk. When Raote learned of the incident the next morning, he asked his reportedly teetotaler son to go pay a fine.
