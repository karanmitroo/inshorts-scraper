The Congress on Friday clarified that Sonia Gandhi is only retiring from the post of party President and not from politics. Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also requested the media "not to rely upon innuendos". This comes after reports suggested that Sonia Gandhi would retire from politics once her son Rahul Gandhi officially takes charge as the Congress President.
