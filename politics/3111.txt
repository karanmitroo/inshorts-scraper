Condemning former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah's statement, BJP leader Nalin Kohli asserted that militants who kill innocent people in the state will be neutralised. "What he is saying is trying to create a justification for terrorism," he asserted. Abdullah had earlier said that the Kashmiri youth were sacrificing their lives for Kashmir and not for political posts.
