West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday slammed the Centre for wanting states to provide 40-50% funds for most schemes and yet naming them after the Prime Minister or other BJP leaders. Having said that, Mamata took a jibe at the PM by saying, "Will Narendra Modi buy new suits with that money and get into the Guinness records."
