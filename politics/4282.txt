AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi and four others were acquitted by Medak district's Sangareddy Court in Telangana on Thursday in connection with the 2005 Muthangi Masjid demolition case. After the court's verdict, Owaisi tweeted, "Will Congress leaders have courtesy to apologise... they were in power when 2005 false case was registered... they allowed masjid demolition without due process of law."
