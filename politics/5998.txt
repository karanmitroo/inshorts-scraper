Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has said that he is open to pondering over scrapping​ national capital’s Legislative Assembly if such a proposal was brought before him. He further criticised CM Arvind Kejriwal for ‘calling PM names’. Condemning his statement, AAP leader Kumar Vishwas asked if Jung would have reacted the same way, had 67 MLAs were of BJP.
