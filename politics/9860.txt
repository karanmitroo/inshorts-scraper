Speaking about the alleged 'funding-scam' in Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Tuesday said that the party has been caught red-handed. "The facts relating to this dubious funding of AAP are self-evident," said Jaitley. "I am sure the state authorities will do their job when this is brought to their notice," he added.
