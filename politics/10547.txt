Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday attacked PM Narendra Modi for "inaction" on ceasefire violations by Pakistan. Addressing a poll rally, Udhhav said, Sena would have been finished had he accepted BJP's demands regarding seat sharing for the Oct-15 polls. He also said, had Balasaheb been alive with Vajpayee at the helm, the 25-year-old alliance would not have collapsed.
