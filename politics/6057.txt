BSP supremo Mayawati on Monday criticised the UP government over ‘poor’ law and order situation in the state. "Bulandshahr gangrape incident proves there is ‘Jungle Raj’ in UP," she said. UP government should resign on moral grounds if it can’t handle the state’s affairs, she added. On Friday, a woman and her daughter were gangraped near a highway in Bulandshahr.
