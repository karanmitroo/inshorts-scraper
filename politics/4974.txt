Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam on Monday slammed PM Modi for branding Opposition parties 'corrupt' for opposing demonetisation and asked if Modi would do the same to its ally Shiv Sena. "When the government says 86% of the currency is in ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, how can that much amount of money be scrapped in four hours time," Nirupam asked.
