After JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar's resignation as Bihar CM, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday said, "We aren't in favour of mid-term elections in Bihar." Stating that a three-member committee has been constituted for deciding on a plan of action, Modi added, "We are happy that Nitish didn't compromise on issue of corruption and didn't kneel down before RJD."
