In a move to bring women to the forefront of national politics, BJP has fielded a woman, Darkshan Andrabi against Omar Abdullah in the Sonawar constituency. Andrabi was the Chairperson of the Social Democratic Party, which has now merged with BJP. However, the overall situation remains grim, with only two tickets being given to women by the BJP in Kashmir.
