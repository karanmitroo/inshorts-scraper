Hitting out at AAP, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar Sunday said, "People who are thinking of degrading India's Republic Day should be driven out by civil society." Taking on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Parrikar said that as the custodian of the Indian Constitution, the chief minister had no business to violate prohibitory orders during his recent protest in the national capital.
