A day after joining BJP, Kiran Bedi said that she is ready to fight against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal if the party wants. Bedi said, "The constituency selection is always a decision of party. I will go by their decision. If they want me to fight against him, I will do so. Because they know better than I do."
