Addressing a gathering of over 500 women at Talkatora Garden (Delhi), AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday promised two-lakh pubic toilets across the city for women. During the second round of its 'Delhi Dialogue' programme, AAP's women-centric poll promises also included 100 fast-track-courts for rape cases, Wi-Fi connected CCTVs & the power to decide where liquor vends can or cannot stay.
