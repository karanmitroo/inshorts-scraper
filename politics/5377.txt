An audio clip of Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde has surfaced in which she is heard 'threatening' a priest of the Bhagwangad shrine to allow her to make a speech on Dussehra. She was also heard saying that false cases would be lodged against the supporters of Namdev Shastri Maharaj, who is opposed to her.
