Varun Gandhi was dropped as general secretary by BJP chief Amit Shah, who announced his new team of party office bearers on Saturday. While dropping Varun, Shah has retained general secretaries JP Nadda, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Murlidhar Rao and Ramlal. Varun has not been included because his mother has been inducted in the Modi Cabinet, party sources said.
