AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday announced that if his party comes to power in Punjab then a Dalit candidate will be appointed as the state's deputy CM. He announced this while unveiling AAP's 19-point manifesto meant exclusively for the Dalits. "AAP is not here to exploit you (Dalits) for votes. We will share the power with you," he stated.
