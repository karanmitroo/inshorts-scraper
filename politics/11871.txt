Condemning the UPA government's decision to bifurcate Andhra, 
CM Kiran Kumar Reddy on Wednesday resigned from his post.
'I can't continue. I am resigning from the post of CM, MLA and membership of the Congress party. What kind of democracy is this? Both Congress and BJP joined hands to betray Telugu people. I strongly condemn it", Reddy said.
