BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday called Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa unpatriotic for demanding the release of the seven convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination case. "Rajiv Gandhi did not die alone, 18 policemen [also] died. Jayalalithaa does not have a drop of patriotic blood in her, very selfish woman she only thinks of herself," Swamy said.
