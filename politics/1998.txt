After levelling allegations against AAP over its donations, sacked AAP Minister Kapil Mishra on Sunday threatened Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to resign or else he would drag him by collar to Tihar jail. "It is established that Kejriwal is corrupt," he said. He also said that Kejriwal was hand-in-glove with the mafia and hawala dealers.
