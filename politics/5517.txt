The Kerala BJP, which started off the year-long birthday centenary celebrations of Pundit Deendayal Upadhyaya on Friday, referred to him in a photograph as Rajnath Singh at the party's national council meeting at Kozhikode. While the Kerala BJP reportedly corrected the mistake quickly, it was captured and uploaded on Twitter by one of the social networking website's users, DK Singh.
