Congress has dropped its ‘aam aadmi’ slogan, which helped it come into power in 2004 and 2009, after it was successfully hijacked by AAP. Congress’s first campaign slogan for 2014 polls reads “Har Haath Shakti, Har Haath Tarakki”, while UIAI, a key project of UPA government, has replaced its tag-line ‘Aadhaar Aam Aadmi Ka Adhikar’ with ‘One India One Identity’.
