Over 100 tribal Christians Wednesday were converted to Hinduism in West Bengal's Birbhum district. Allegations have been raised against VHP following the fact that the reconversions took place just a day after VHP chief Praveen Togadia held a public rally in the area. Trinamool Congress (TMC) has condemned the incident and demanded an investigation into the matter.
