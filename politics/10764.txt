The govt on Friday denied claims made by Uttrakhand governor Aziz Qureshi against Centre, asking him to quit. The statement  came as a response to Supreme Court's notice to Centre on Qureshi's plea challenging the Modi government's move. "There was no purposeful move. He holds the constitutional post with the pleasures of the President" said Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
