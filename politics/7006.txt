Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said that the Congress is fighting TMC Chief Mamata Banerjee in the Assembly polls as she did not keep her promises after becoming Chief Minister. â€œMamataji had promised to set up factories and provide jobs to the youth...But no factory was set up...Is there a single person who got jobs?" Gandhi questioned.
