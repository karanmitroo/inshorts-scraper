As per AAP member Manish Sisodia, Arvind Kejriwal received a call from the Ghaziabad police to provide security for him, after they received a letter from Home Ministry of India citing some threat to Kejriwal's life. Kejriwal refused the offer saying, "when the safety of crores of citizens was at stake, how can a leader think of taking security cover".
