The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to revisit its two-decade-old verdict on the anti-defection law holding that a Member of Parliament is bound by his party's whip (orders) even after expulsion from the party. The court was hearing a petition filed by Uttar Pradesh politician Amar Singh and actor-turned-politician Jaya Prada against over their expulsion from the Samajwadi Party.
