Janata Dal (United) legislators today removed Sharad Yadav as their leader in Rajya Sabha and replaced him with RCP Singh, Bihar JD(U) President said. Yadav had opposed the party's decision to ally with the BJP in Bihar, after breaking the 'Grand Alliance' with the Congress and RJD. This comes a day after JD(U) sacked another Rajya Sabha member Anwar Ali.
