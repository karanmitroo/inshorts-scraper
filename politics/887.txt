A video allegedly showing Patidar leader Hardik Patel in a compromising position with an unidentified woman surfaced online on Monday. Denying the authenticity of the video, Patel blamed the incident on BJP's "dirty politics" and said it was tarnishing the image of Gujarat's women. Patel had claimed a week ago that BJP would employ a "sex CD" to discredit him.
