The Election Commission on Thursday advised Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar to be more careful while making statements in future, following his bribe remark during a rally in Goa. Parrikar, in that rally, had allegedly incited people to accept bribes from other parties but vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Parrikar was also served a notice over the matter.
