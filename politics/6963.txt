CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury claimed on Saturday that "violence has been unprecedented in West Bengal" and so far "seven of our workers have died" during the elections. "We will meet the challenge. Intimidation will not work as far as the CPI-M is concerned," Yechury asserted. He further claimed that such violence cannot happen unless "patronised" by the ruling dispensation.
