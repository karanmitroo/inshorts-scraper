Congress MP Shashi Tharoor along with other Congress leaders was detained and later released by Kerala Police on Friday for protesting against demonetisation outside the RBI office. "The lack of planning in something as basic as making the new notes the same size as the old so that they can fit in the ATM is mind-boggling," Tharoor had said earlier.
