BJP on Monday suggested that Bakr-Eid should be celebrated in an "eco-friendly" way and called upon the intelligentsia for discussions. Responding, AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi said the party was trying to impose Hindutva ideology through innuendos. Meanwhile, the Awadh unit of RSS-backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch decided not to sacrifice a goat, but celebrate the festival by cutting a goat-shaped cake.
