Suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad has attacked Union Minister Arun Jaitley, stating the one who can’t win ward election, is the Finance Minister today. I’m winning the elections since 1999 when Modi wasn’t even Gujarat CM, he added. Azad was suspended from the BJP after he levelled charges against Jaitley over irregularities in Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).
