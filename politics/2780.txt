Urging to bring changes in Congress' leadership, senior party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Friday said that election should be held on every level, even for Congress' President post. "I would be surprised if someone would like to stand against Rahul Gandhi," he added. Aiyar had on Thursday admitted that Congress' position in national politics is "shrinking".
