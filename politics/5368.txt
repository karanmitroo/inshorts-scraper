The Congress on Tuesday backed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement that there is a need to differentiate between real and fake 'gau rakshaks'. "Yes, I agree that there are some people who have created tensions in the name of 'gau raksha'," Congress leader Meem Afzal said. Bhagwat said the nation needs to unite so that such elements don't take advantage.
