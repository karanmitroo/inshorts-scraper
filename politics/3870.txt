Actress Zaira Wasim has said that she has no idea why her Facebook post, where she apologised for her recent actions or for people she had met, was being turned into national news. She added that she was not forced to write such a post. Earlier, reports speculated that Zaira was apologising for meeting Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti.
