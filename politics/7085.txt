Congress Vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said it is the RSS which is running the nation and not the ministers of the BJP. He further accused the RSS and BJP of “practising and professing” Manusmriti's ideology, which Dr BR Ambedkar had held responsible for the caste system in India. Gandhi was addressing a rally marking Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary celebrations.
