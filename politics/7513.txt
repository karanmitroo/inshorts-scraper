Congress MP Rajeev Satav on Sunday favoured holding Parliament sessions alternately in three major metros besides Delhi. Satav said such a move would help promote national integration. The idea was first mooted by former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee to hold Parliament sessions in Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai besides Delhi, and the present government can help fulfill his dream, Satav added.
