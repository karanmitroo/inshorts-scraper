Indian politician Shashi Tharoor has penned an open letter to political leaders and workers as part of 'Let's talk about rape' initiative, wherein he wrote, "[P]oliticians talk about everything under the Sun, but not rape." Tharoor also wrote, "Why do politicians place the onus on the girl to dress in a certain way rather than the boy to behave properly?"
