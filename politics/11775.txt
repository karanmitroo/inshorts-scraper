AAPâ€™s candidate Savita Bhatti, widow of comedian and satirist Jaspal Bhatti, on Sunday opted out of Lok Sabha polls from lone Chandigarh parliamentary seat. While Savita refused to give out details for her decision, party sources said that she was unhappy as she was not getting much support from the AAP activists at local level after her candidature was announced.
