Lalu Prasad Yadav's son and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday accused Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government of conspiring to poison his food and claimed that his phones were being tapped. He said the Bihar CM is hatching a "serious conspiracy" to derail his 'Samvidhan Bachao Nyay Yatra'. "The entire country knows that Nitish Kumar is an undemocratic opportunist," Tejashwi added.
