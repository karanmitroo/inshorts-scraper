Expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh’s wife, Swati, has accused the BSP supporters of traumatising her 12-year-old daughter over her husband’s remarks on Mayawati. “He got expelled, yet Mayawatiji not satisfied. She'll even demand that he be beheaded,” she said. "Shouldn't she take action against her people for traumatising my daughter?," she asked.
