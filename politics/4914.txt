Over ₹91 lakh cash, mostly in denominations of old demonetised ₹1,000 notes, has reportedly been seized from Maharashtra Cooperative Minister Subhash Deshmukh's vehicle. While  Deshmukh said that it was meant for payment to workers in a sugar factory affiliated to the Lok Mangal group, opposition parties Congress and NCP have demanded the sacking of the minister.
