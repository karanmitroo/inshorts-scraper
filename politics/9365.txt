On his 15-km 'sanvad padyatra' in the Vidharbha region on Thursday, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi lashed out at Haryana Agriculture Minister OP Dhankar. "Some people in Haryana have called farmers cowards. It is because of statements like these that I have come here," he said. Further, he blamed the BJP government for abandoning the farmers of the region.
