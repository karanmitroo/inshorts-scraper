Addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Congress party and corruption can never separate from each other. He further slammed the Congress saying that the party was only involved in corruption, spreading lies, casteism, and nepotism during its 70-year rule. Congress does not like that an ordinary "chai-wala" became the PM, he added.
