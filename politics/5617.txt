Cricketer-turned-politician and former Rajya Sabha member Navjot Singh Sidhu formally resigned from the BJP on Wednesday. He resigned from the Upper House of the Parliament in July claiming he was being asked to stay away from poll-bound Punjab. Earlier this month, Sidhu formally launched a new political party 'Awaaz-e-Punjab', which will possibly contest the Punjab assembly elections next year.
