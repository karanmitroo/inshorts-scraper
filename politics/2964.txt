PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday said it is unfortunate that some people link 'adhyatma' (spirituality) with religion. Modi made the statement while addressing a programme on 100th anniversary of the Yogoda Satsang Society. Stating that India's spirituality is its strength, Modi added that once people develop an interest and start practicing Yoga, it always remains a part of their lives.
