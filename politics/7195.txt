BJP Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Friday released a booklet titled 'Chargesheet', listing the misdeeds of Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC). "From Sarada to Narada, it contains the list of corruption charges and lawlessness that TMC has ushered in Bengal," Naqvi said. This comes ahead of the five-phase polls in West Bengal that start from April 4.
