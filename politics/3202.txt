Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday said that it is the Congress that stands to benefit from the alliance for Uttar Pradesh Assembly election and not his party. "Congress had no footing in Uttar Pradesh. This alliance has revived their chances to win some seats. The contest was otherwise between the SP and the BJP," he added.
