Congress MLA Asif Muhammad Khan Thursday disrupted Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's press conference, demanding a probe into the Batla House encounter case. Despite promising a special investigating team (SIT) probe into the case, Kejriwal is now refusing to do so, said Khan, "I will vote against the AAP government in the assembly, even if Congress expels me from the party."
