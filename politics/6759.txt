Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Friday said the former UPA government had coined terms like 'Hindu-terror' and 'saffron terror', tarnishing the entire community. He further cited the 2008 Malegaon blasts case chargesheet filed by the National Investigative Agency, which had no mention of Sadhvi Pragya and said the Congress gave a communal direction to the issue.
