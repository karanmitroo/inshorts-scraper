Stating that five of the seven people killed in the terror attack on Jammu and Kashmir's Sunjwan Military camp were Kashmiri Muslims, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday questioned RSS' silence on the issue. "They call us Pakistani, but we are the ones dying for the country," he added. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Pakistan will pay for the attack.
