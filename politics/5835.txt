The Supreme Court on Wednesday criticised CM Jayalalithaa while hearing a defamation case filed by her, stating no other state misuses state machinery like Tamil Nadu. “As a public figure you must face criticism,” the court told the AIADMK chief. Notably, this isn’t the first time Jayalalithaa has been pulled up by the SC over filing of a defamation case.
