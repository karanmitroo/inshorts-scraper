Telangana CM Chandrashekar Rao on Monday expressed his support for PM Narendra Modi over demonetisation and said, "He is the PM, and he won't take such a huge step just like that." Asserting that most farmers don't operate their bank accounts, Rao suggested that they may be allowed to make appropriate deposits, over which only nominal taxes will be levied.
