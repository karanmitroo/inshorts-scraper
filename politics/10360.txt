Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani dismissed reports of her having been to an astrologer, Sunday, and slammed the media over the issue. "I realise I contribute to your TRPs and I am glad I could be of help. What I do in my personal life doesn't come under responsibility of media," Irani said. She was criticised for her visit earlier.
