The CBI on Saturday conducted searches at former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda's residence at Rohtak in a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The case pertains to the selling off of land acquired by the Congress government from villagers. Reacting to the searches, Hooda said, "I am open to probe. Its just political vendetta. Nothing else.”
