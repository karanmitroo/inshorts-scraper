Congress president Sonia Gandhi led a solidarity march from the party headquarter to former PM Manmohan Singh's residence on Thursday. Defending the ex-PM, who has been summoned as an accused in the coal scam, she said, "Manmohan Singh ji is a former PM. He is known not only in our country but the world. He's a man of integrity."
