BJP leader and former Union Health Minister Shatrughan Sinha on Friday said the Union Health Ministry was "not making sufficient" efforts to prevent health ailments. "Though certain steps have been taken, we still have long way to go, especially in the BIMARU (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and UP) states where tobacco consumption has emerged as the biggest killer," Shatrughan added.
