BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj on Monday said that no power in the world could stop the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. Claiming that the issue is also getting support from Muslims, Sakshi Maharaj said, "Over 60 lakh Muslims have already pledged their support to the cause. I don't think anyone will object to our plans."
