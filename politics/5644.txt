Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday said Muslims had helped his party form the government after the BJP demolished the Babri Masjid. "Muslims are not against us... we did not kill anyone in Ayodhya yet case was lodged against us," he added. Yadav also regretted that women are not associated with the party in good numbers.
