BJP national Secretary Shrikant Sharma on Saturday said that the Congress is making "false and baseless" allegations against PM Narendra Modi in the Gujarat land allotment issue in order to cover up its own corruption and fraud. Sharma also added that the opposition is creating conditions before the Budget session to stop the developmental process.
