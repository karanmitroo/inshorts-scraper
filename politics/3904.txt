Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik on Saturday disqualified BSP MLA Uma Shankar Singh from the state Assembly for an alleged violation of the Representation of the People Act. A petition was filed before the Lok Ayukta in December 2013, complaining that he had been taking government contracts for road construction even after being elected as an MLA.
