Union Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday took a jibe at AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for picking up fights with everyone, including the Lt Governor. Giving Kejriwal an 'uncalled-for friendly advice', Prasad said that he should focus on governance instead of fighting. "Governance is serious business, please keep it in mind," he urged.
