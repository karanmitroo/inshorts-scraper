After receiving flak for referring North Eastern people as "immigrants," BJP tried to correct its mistake saying it was a "printing error." In a damage-control mode, BJP spokesperson MJ Akbar called the northeast people the "pride of Delhi." Later, MoS for Home Kiren Rejiju, who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, said the word was a "typo" and a "clerical error".
