The AAP Government on Thursday informed the Delhi High Court that it had spent money on advertisements to "inform the public about the policies and priorities of the current government". The submission came in response to a petition seeking to restrain the AAP Government from using taxpayers' money for publishing 'confrontationist' advertisements as an image building exercise for Arvind Kejriwal.
