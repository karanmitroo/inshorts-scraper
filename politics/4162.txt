Addressing a Parivartan rally in Lucknow on Monday, PM Narendra Modi slammed the Congress, BSP and SP by making a 'beta, paise, parivar' remark on them. "One party is trying to establish a son (beta) for the last 15 years, another party is trying to save money (paisa). And the third party is worrying about family (parivar)," he said.
