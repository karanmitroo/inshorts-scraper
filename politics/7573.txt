BJP secretary H Raja on Sunday targeted CPI leader D Raja saying he should prove his patriotism by asking his comrades to shoot his daughter for participating in "anti-national protests" in JNU. "I would have done the same, if my child was taking part in anti-national protests,” H Raja added. He later clarified he "did not mean to kill anyone".
