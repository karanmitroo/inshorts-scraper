Former Defence Minister AK Antony on Tuesday called the BJP as a 'transitory' government and said that the Congress will return to power. He added that the BJP came to power only because of the showmanship and marketing technique of PM Narendra Modi. "Only statements are coming from the government... Nothing concrete is happening at the ground level," Antony said.
