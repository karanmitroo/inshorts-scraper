Former Punjab DGP Shashi Kant claimed that some policemen tried to abduct him Saturday morning while going to join AAP in Chandigarh. Kant alleged that police pressurised him since he reported of drug mafias being patronized by politicians from Akali Dal and Congress and certain senior policemen. Later, he joined AAP at his residence in presence of senior AAP leaders.
