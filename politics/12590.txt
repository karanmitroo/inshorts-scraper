Narendra Modi attacked Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif in a rally in Delhi saying that he has no right to insult the Prime Minister of India. Sharif had reportedly commented on India's frequent complaints to the US against Pakistan.  Modi also wondered if Manmohan Singh would be able to take a tough position when he met Sharif later in the day.
