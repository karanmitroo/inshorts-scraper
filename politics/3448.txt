Amid ongoing political turmoil in Tamil Nadu, the Election Commission on Wednesday said no rules were followed by AIADMK to select its temporary General Secretary Sasikala Natarajan. The poll panel has asked for a copy of resolution about her elevation as General Secretary. Earlier, sacked AIADMK leader Sasikala Pushpa had alleged Natarajanâ€™s elevation was carried out in an "undemocratic manner".
