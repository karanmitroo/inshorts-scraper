The Supreme Court on Monday favoured a speedier joint trial against people involved in the Babri Masjid demolition and said it will not accept dropping of charges against LK Advani and others on technical grounds. The SC is likely to give its final ruling on the matter in the next hearing on March 22 wherein the politicians may face trials.
