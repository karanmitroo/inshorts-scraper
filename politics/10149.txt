Senior JDU leader Nitish Kumar Friday slammed BJP for breaking the tradition of a tribal heading the govt in Jharkhand. By making a non-tribal as the next Jharkhand CM, the BJP has not only broken a long standing tradition but has also sent out a message that it has no faith in the tribal people of that state, he said.
