Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday demanded special status for Bihar in his Independence Day speech. “Special status is a must for the development of Bihar as it will attract private investors on a large scale to set up industries that will generate jobs for youths. It will also speed up development in other sectors,” he said.
