Asserting that there was no rift within the party, AIADMK General Secretary Sasikala Natarajan on Tuesday accused Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam of acting at the behest of DMK. Calling AIADMK a united single family, Sasikala removed Panneerselvam from the post of the party's Treasurer. This came after he claimed that he was forced to step down as the CM.
