Mumbai Congress chief Janardan Chandurkar has said legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar should be stripped of her Bharat Ratna as she had endorsed Narendra Modi's prime ministrial candidature. He also demanded taking back Padma awards from those supporting Modi. BJP reacted strongly questioning why Congress asked Sachin Tendulkar to campaign for their party and said Chandurkar's demand showed Congress's double standards.
