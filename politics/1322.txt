Congress MLA Randeep Singh Surjewala has slammed Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath over the death of 49 children in a state-run Farrukhabad hospital, reportedly due to insufficient oxygen supply. "Adityanath has turned the whole state into 'rogi' (ailing) and the BJP has remained ignorant all this while," Surjewala said. Congress leader Raj Babbar urged PM Narendra Modi to replace Adityanath.
