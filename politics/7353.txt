Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Monday admitted to having made "editorial" changes to the affidavits filed in the Ishrat Jahan case. Chidambaram was replying to a question at the launch of his book "Standing Guard - A Year in Opposition". Earlier, Chidambaram had been accused of "political interference" in deletion of Ishrat Jahan's terrorist links from an affidavit.
