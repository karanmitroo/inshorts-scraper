Speaking over farmer suicides, BJP MLA in Madhya Pradesh Rameshwar Sharma on Friday said the ones who are committing suicides are not real farmers. "The ones who die are those who depend on subsidy," said the politician. Sharma further stated that the profession of agriculture has been maligned by those who have taken loans, or those who consume alcohol.
