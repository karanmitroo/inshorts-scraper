After controversial campaigns from the saffron brigade like "love jihad" and "ghar wapsi", the Bajrang Dal has introduced the "Bahu Lao Beti Bachao" campaign, drawing flak from political opponents. The idea is to bring daughters-in-laws for Hindu families from Muslim and Christian communities. The Opposition views these campaigns as frivolous, and an attempt to deviate from more important issues.
