BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said that he expects Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to win, stating the sexual misconduct charges against the latter don’t stand as former US President Bill Clinton was "much worse". Reacting to the tax evasion charges against Trump, he said “Trump has not broken any law. The law which allows such things may be unethical.”
