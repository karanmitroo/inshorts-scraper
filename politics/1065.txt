Former J&K ruler Maharaja Hari Singh's grandson and PDP legislator Vikramaditya Singh has resigned from the party citing differences over Jammu-centric issues. Some of the issues he listed were the demand to declare a state holiday on his grandfather's birth anniversary and the issue of Rohingya settlers in Jammu. He further claimed the party neglected the aspirations of the public.
