The youth wing of the Congress, called Indian Youth Congress (IYC), has launched ‘Adhikar’, a free legal aid centre for the poor. The centre comprises a team of around 100 advocates who will provide legal advice to those who can’t afford it. The IYC has also launched a helpline number (011-23329636) for providing legal assistance over the phone.
