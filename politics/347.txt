Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader YS Chowdary has said that TDP will not pull out of NDA "immediately", but will continue raising the issue of Centre's failure to allocate funds for Andhra Pradesh in the Budget. "If there is still no response from the Centre, our party president will take an appropriate decision (on continuing in the NDA)," he added.
