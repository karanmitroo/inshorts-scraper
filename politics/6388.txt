BJP MP Maheish Girri, who was on a hunger strike outside Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's residence since Sunday, called off his protest after three days. This comes after Union Minister Rajnath Singh visited Girri, requesting him to end the fast. Girri has been demanding that Kejriwal apologise for accusing him of being involved in NDMC official MM Khan's murder.
