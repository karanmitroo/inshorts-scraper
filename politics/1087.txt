Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections, BJP has used the 'Mauka Mauka' advertisement that went viral during the ICC World Cup 2011, to mock the Congress' electoral performance in the state. The edited video clip which was first tweeted by BJP leader Vijay Chauthaiwale and then retweeted by Union Minister Smriti Irani has gone viral on social media.
