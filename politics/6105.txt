Congress has started ‘Dard-e-Benares’ campaign to highlight the 'lack of development’ in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi. The party website has several videos projecting problems of the city. In one video, a man named Ajit Singh says, ”Modiji comes here only for photo opportunities.” "Plight of people is worsening with the growing price rise," said another.
