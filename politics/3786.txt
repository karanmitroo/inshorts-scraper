After Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi showed his torn kurta to the public at a rally, BJP Yuva Morcha workers from Karnataka have sent him a new one. "Rahul withdrew â‚¹4,000 from the bank 40 days ago. He never returned to banks. So he doesn't have money to buy new kurta and we have sent him one," a BJP worker said.
