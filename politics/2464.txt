Uttarakhand Minister Dhan Singh Rawat, during a function at a college in Roorkee on Wednesday, said, "If you want to stay in Uttarakhand, you have to sing Vande Mataram". He, however, later clarified that his statement was taken out of context. "I said that there should be Vande Mataram and national anthem in all education institutes," he stated.
