Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy was on Monday asked to leave from Rajya Sabha for the day following protests over the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal. Alleging 'differential treatment', Roy said, "The chairman allowed Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad to speak, Arun Jaitley was allowed to speak, Subramanian Swamy was allowed to speak, but I was not allowed to speak."
