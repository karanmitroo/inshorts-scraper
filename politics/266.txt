Jat groups in Haryana have called off their rally in Jind, which was reportedly aimed at disrupting BJP President Amit Shah's bike rally. The decision came after a six-hour meeting with CM Manohar Lal Khattar who assured the Jat leaders of taking steps to fulfil their reservation demands. Recently, the government withdrew 70 cases filed during the 2016 Jat agitation.
