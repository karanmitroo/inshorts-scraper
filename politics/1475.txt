The JD(U) on Saturday said that senior party leader Sharad Yadav was replaced by Ramchandra Prasad Singh in the Rajya Sabha due to his anti-party activities. "The whole party agreed to Nitish Kumar's decision to dissociate itself from the grand alliance in Bihar," MP VN Singh said. Sharad Yadav had opposed JD(U)'s decision to ally with the BJP in Bihar.
