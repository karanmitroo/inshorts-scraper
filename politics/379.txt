After an FIR was filed against the Army over the killing of two Jammu and Kashmir civilians, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy warned that the state government would be toppled if it doesn't withdraw the complaint. "Why are we even running that government?" he questioned. The Army said it had opened fire at the mob in self-defence.
