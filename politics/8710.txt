Rahul Gandhi, Vice-President of Congress, on Thursday began a 7km “save farmer march” padyatra in Odisha, starting from Bargarh's Debahali village, where he met the family of a farmer who killed himself last year. This year, Gandhi has been campaigning toward farmers' rights and meeting troubled farmers in various parts of the country.
