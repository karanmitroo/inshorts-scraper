Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit's son-in-law Syed Mohammed Imran has been arrested under the Domestic Violence Act. The domestic violence case was filed against him by his wife Latika, who had separated from Imran 10 months ago. "He was arrested from Bangalore and brought to Delhi on transit remand," a senior police official said.
