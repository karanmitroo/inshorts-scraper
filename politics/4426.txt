BJP National Secretary Sidharth Nath Singh has asked West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to break her "silence" over alleged communal riots in the state's Dhulagarh area. "The minority wing leaders of TMC led by Lok Sabha MP Idris Ali are targeting Hindus," Singh added. About 100 such communal riots have taken place since TMC came to power, he claimed.
