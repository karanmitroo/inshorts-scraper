Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Chandra Agrawal on Wednesday said that India should treat terrorists in an equally strict manner as Pakistan is treating former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav. "If Pakistan considers Kulbhushan Jadhav as a terrorist, then that is how it has treated him," Agrawal added. The BJP has termed Agrawal's comments as a "betrayal of national interest".
