Former Uttarakhand BJP chief Tirath Singh Rawat was on Saturday appointed as the party's national secretary. He was earlier denied a ticket for the February 15 Assembly polls. The sitting MLA Tirath had expressed his discontent over allocation of ticket to the Congress rebel Satpal Maharaj from his Chaubattakhal seat in Pauri Garhwal district.
