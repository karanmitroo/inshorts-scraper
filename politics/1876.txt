Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday pushed a policeman as he was trying to enter violence-hit Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where five farmers were killed in police firing on Tuesday. Gandhi further stormed out of his jeep, rode pillion on a bike to dodge the cops, and angrily said, "Aap kaise mujhe rok sakte ho? (How can you stop me?)"
