Addressing a Jan Sabha, in New Delhi, on Sunday, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal said that he won't quit again. "There's one thing I have learnt about politics. Whatever happens, one should not resign from their post and I am definitely not doing that again," assured Kejriwal. Kejriwal had resigned as Delhi CM after 49 days of power in February, 2014.
