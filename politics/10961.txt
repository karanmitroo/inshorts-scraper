Senior Congress leader Aslam Sher Khan on Monday said that Priyanka Gandhi should be appointed as the head of the committee set up by Congress to review its debacle in the LS elections. The committee is presently headed by AK Antony. Khan added that, Congress leaders and workers are more likely to openly talk to Priyanka rather than Antony.
