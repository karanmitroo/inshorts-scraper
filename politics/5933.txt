Uttar Pradesh minister Shivpal Singh Yadav has said that while the Samajwadi Party government has done a lot of state development, the common man was still not smiling. He blamed “the wrong acts of some party workers and office-bearers involved in illegal land grabbing and harassment of public” for this. Such people will be expelled from the party, he added.
