Supporters of Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay staged a sit-in protest outside party's Delhi office on Tuesday evening and demanded that he be fielded from Mehrauli constituency. They were upset after the top leadership denied a ticket to Upadhyay. The BJP leader tried to calm his supporters but they kept on shouting slogans against the leadership.
