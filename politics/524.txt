Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has accused Congress of having double standards regarding the Triple Talaq bill and trying to stall it in the Rajya Sabha after supporting it in the Lok Sabha. This comes after Congress demanded that the bill be sent to a parliamentary committee. "The House is taken by surprise that a motion is suddenly moved," Jaitley added.
