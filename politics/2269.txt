CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury has asked if Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is doing some charity by giving "sanctity". Prasad had earlier said Muslims don't vote for BJP, but the government has given them "proper sanctity". "Sanctity is provided by the Indian Constitution...Indians who are Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs or Atheists (like me) are all Indian citizens," Yechury added.
