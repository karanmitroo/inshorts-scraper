Newly appointed Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has slammed the Congress while asking why didn't the party approach the Governor if it had the required numbers to prove majority in the Assembly. "The support extended to BJP to form government...is only for Goa's development. No MLA wanted to support Congress," Parrikar added. Congress is the largest party in Goa Assembly.
