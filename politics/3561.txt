On the last day of campaigning for the Punjab Assembly polls, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said Delhi CM and AAP Convener Arvind Kejriwal is backing extremists. "A few days ago, six people were killed in a bomb blast. Kejriwalji, who is the CM of Delhi, is helping these negative forces to flourish in the state," Gandhi said.
