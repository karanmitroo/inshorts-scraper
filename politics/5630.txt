BJP leader Sidharth Nath Singh today said that there is 'jungle raj' in Bihar's grand alliance itself as the RJD and JD(U) are blaming each other for Shahabuddin's bail. He added that the release of Shahabuddin, who was in jail since 2005 in connection with a murder case, has made it clear that 'jungle raj' is back in Bihar.
