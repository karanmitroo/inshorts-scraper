Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh on Saturday said that the political party will think about forming a pre-poll alliance in Goa ahead of the upcoming Assembly election due in 2017. "Our fight is against BJP... During the forthcoming polls, if any group wants to join us against communalism, we will think about it," he said.
