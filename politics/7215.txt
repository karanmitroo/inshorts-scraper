BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday slammed Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi over his remark 'We have Gandhi, you have Savarkar' made in the Lok Sabha recently. "Your (Rahul’s) grandmother Indira Gandhi had donated ₹11,000 from her savings to Savarkar Pratisthan. You don’t know about this," Shah said while addressing a farmers’ rally in a Surat village.
