The Election Commission, on Friday, directed candidates and political parties to provide all details, including financial statements, of social media accounts of candidates contesting elections. Besides web-campaigns requiring authorized pre-certification, the model code of conduct will also become applicable on the social media. The order comes after the EC was informed of campaigning using social media and electoral-law violation online.
