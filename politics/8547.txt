The Congress party will not come out with a manifesto for the upcoming elections in Bihar for the first time in many years. Instead, the party will provide inputs to the Common Minimum Programme (CMP), which the grand alliance (The RJD, the JD (U), and the Congress) will release soon. The five-phase Bihar elections begin on October 12.
