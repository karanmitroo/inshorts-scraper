Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said that PM Narendra Modi-led government has failed abysmally to deliver the promises it made. "The economy is on a downslide while prices continue to rise," Gandhi said while addressing a Congress Working Committee meeting. She added that most of the pledges made by the PM during election campaigns were 'hawa baazi' (hot air).
