BJP President Amit Shah will skip his public meeting in Kolkata on November 30 and will visit West Bengal in late December. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit poll-bound Bengal in January 2016. BJP said the decision to postpone Bengal events was made before Bihar results, but media reports claimed that it was a result of the Bihar defeat.
