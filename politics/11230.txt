Rejecting Narendra Modi's assertion that "Mother Ganga has called me", Karuna Shukla - former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece - on Tuesday said that Modi had come to Varanasi to wash off his sins. Shukla, who had switched sides before the parliamentary polls, is contesting from Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh) as a Congress candidate.
