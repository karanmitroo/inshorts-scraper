BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that those people who are opposing Surya Namaskar in the schools should leave India. He further added that such people should sink in the sea or live in a dark room. His statement came after the Muslim law board launched a campaign against the government's move to make Surya Namaskar compulsory in schools.
