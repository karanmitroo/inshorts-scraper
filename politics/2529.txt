Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday ordered an investigation into the Gomti riverfront project within 45 days. Adityanath was unhappy that although two years had lapsed, and over â‚¹1,427 crore had been spent, only 60% of the work was complete, an official release said. The project was launched to channelise the river by the Akhilesh Yadav government.
