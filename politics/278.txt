After the inauguration of a conference on Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi, BJP MP Maheish Girri said that Aurangzeb was a "terrorist" and didn't receive the punishment he deserved. "At least, the road named after him (Aurangzeb), has been changed," Girri added. The MP also hailed Aurangzeb's brother Dara Shikoh as a 'scholar' and true to Islamic values.
