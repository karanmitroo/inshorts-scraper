Accusing BSP chief Mayawati of selling party tickets for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the party's General Secretary Swami Prasad Maurya submitted his resignation on Wednesday. Maurya said, "Mayawati Dalit nahi, daulat ki beti hai (Mayawati is not a Dalit's daughter, but of wealth)," alleging that Mayawati was misusing the names of BSP founder Kanshi Ram and Bhimrao Ambedkar.
