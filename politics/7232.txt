Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday attended the Pakistan Day function in Delhi where Hurriyat factions allegedly denounced the "brutal attitude" of the Modi government on the Kashmir issue. They further advised the Centre to follow the "Vajpayee policy" towards Kashmir. Notably, the presence of Union Minister VK Singh at the event last year had drawn criticism from the media.
