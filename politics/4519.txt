Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made economy 'cashless' as people do not have cash now. Claiming that the whole world is crying over the demonetisation move, Gandhi added, "The PMâ€™s narrative has changed. First, it was a fight against black money, then terrorism and now it is about making society cashless."
