Opposing the claim made by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal about a CBI officer informing him regarding an alleged order to the security agency to target 'opposition parties,' the CBI called it 'completely false' and 'baseless.' The security agency further urged Kejriwal to name the officer "so that further process as per law can be initiated."
