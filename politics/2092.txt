BSP chief Mayawati on Saturday said, "Murder, violence and playing with law and order has become a common sight in the name of saffron appeasement of the BJP government." She added, "It has become a sort of fashion to set new traditions by taking out processions without permission and create violence...the BJP government has totally failed to control such elements."
