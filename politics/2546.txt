The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has decided to roll back all the ration cards bearing photographs of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. The new UP government will not distribute around 60 lakh ration cards printed by the previous regime. The ration cards could not be distributed earlier as Model Code of Conduct came into force before the elections.
