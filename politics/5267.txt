Union Minister of State for Agriculture and BJP MP Sanjeev Balyan on Tuesday said that the proposed Ayodhya Ram Museum has nothing to do with the upcoming Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Balyan claimed that the decision to construct the museum was taken much earlier and blamed the Samajwadi Party of politicising the issue.
