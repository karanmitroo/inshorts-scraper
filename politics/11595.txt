Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's application to issue him a proof of residence has been rejected by the Amethi district administration saying that he wasn't even an occasional resident there. It was rejected for instead of personally submitting the application, he sent a lawyer and also there was no voter card accompanying the application.
