A Congress MLA has lodged a complaint of molestation in the West Bengal Assembly during the scuffle on February 8. Following her complaint, the opposition parties protested and walked out of the Assembly on Monday. "I being a female SC member of the House was attacked... My modesty and chastity was outraged in full public view," the MLA complained.
