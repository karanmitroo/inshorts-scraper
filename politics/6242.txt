A case was registered against Aam Aadmi party leader Ashish Khetan on Wednesday for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. In a campaign rally, Khetan had compared the AAP manifesto for the 2017 Punjab polls with the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib. AAP also faced criticism for its manifesto cover, which sported a photo of its symbol broom with the Golden Temple.
