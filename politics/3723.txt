The Election Commission on Tuesday directed political parties to not use pictures of the President and Vice President on election posters. This comes after Congress violated the model code of conduct and used the photograph and name of President Pranab Mukherjee on a campaign poster. Mukherjee's picture was used along with photos of Punjab's ex-CM Amarinder Singh and other leaders.
