AAP Minister Sandeep Kumar, who was sacked over an 'objectionable CD',Â on Thursday denied his presence in the video, claiming he was bearing the brunt of being Dalit and poor. "Like Eklavya... when people from our community rise then some plot is hatched to destroy us," said Kumar. The video reportedly shows Kumar in a 'compromising position with two women'.
