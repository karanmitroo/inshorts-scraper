DMK MLA and former Tamil Nadu Minister KN Nehru on Tuesday said they would allow students to cheat in the NEET exam if his party was in power and failed to get an exemption. Speaking at an anti-NEET demonstration, Nehru said cheating was done openly in Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. "For how long will Tamilians remain honest?" he questioned.
