A day after senior Punjab Congress leader Jasmeet Singh Brar asked Sonia Gandhi and Rahul to take a break in the wake of the crushing election defeat, Congress on Saturday issued a show cause notice to him. Punjab PCC Chief Pratap Singh Bajwa issued this notice to Brar after being asked to do so by AICC General Secretary Shakeel Ahmed.
