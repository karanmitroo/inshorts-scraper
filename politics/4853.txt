Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday said that he backed the party's merger with Quami Ekta Dal (QED) though some people in the party "opposed" it. "Shivpal worked openly for their joining. The party will win with strong majority after the arrival of both brothers," added Mulayam. Notably, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had opposed the merger.
