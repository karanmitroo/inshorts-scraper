After the expulsion of DMK leader MK Alagiri from the party, three MP's of the party - KP Ramalingam, D Napoleon and JK Ritheesh - have declared support to Alagiri. "I will abide by whatever decision Alagiri takes," said Napoleon. However, Alagiri said he was yet to decide on his next course of action.
