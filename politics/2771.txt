Congress leader Raj Babbar on Friday said that if anyone can defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is party Vice President Rahul Gandhi's "simplicity". Offering to resign as the Congress Uttar Pradesh Chief taking responsibility for poor State Assembly performance, Babbar had said, "Party leadership only prepares a team to lead, and this team is responsible for winning or losing."
