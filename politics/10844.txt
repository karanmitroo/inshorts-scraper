Slamming Congress’ Rahul Gandhi for disrupting Lok Sabha proceedings Wednesday, FM Arun Jaitley said, "It is a time for the Congress party to introspect itself,” adding that ‘Congress has been facing a coup within their own party’. He said, “It is an internal compulsion within the party…you need not drag the house of the presiding officer into the debate”.
