Reacting to Union Minister VK Singh's demand of renaming Akbar Road as Maharana Pratap Road, Congress on Wednesday said renaming roads "is the job of the Municipal Corporation". "If they have the penchant of renaming roads... They should have got elected to the Municipal Corporation," Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said. They should instead work for people's welfare, he added.
