Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and tribal activist Soni Sori on Sunday said there was danger to her and her children's security. She has been transferred to Delhi from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh for further treatment after she was attacked with a grease-like chemical on Saturday. This is the latest in a series of attacks on tribal rights activists, she added.
