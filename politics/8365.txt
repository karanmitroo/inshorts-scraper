In response to Bihar Chief Minister calling him a “bahari,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked whether Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who stays in Delhi, would also be called the same. During a rally in Bihar, he said, "Am I not the Prime Minister of India? Is Bihar not in India? How am I a 'bahari' then.”
