RJD leader Ashok Sinha on Tuesday resigned from the party, stating that jailed RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tejashwi cannot lead the party like his father. "RJD has become irrelevant in today's times, better to leave party respectfully than to waste time here," he added. Lalu was awarded a 5-year sentence in a fodder scam case earlier this month.
