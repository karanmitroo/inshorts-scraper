The Aam Aadmi Party on Friday moved the Delhi High Court against Election Commission's recommendation to disqualify 20 of their MLAs. This comes after the EC submitted a recommendation to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking disqualification of lawmakers on the grounds that they allegedly held offices of profit. However, AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj said there is "no credible information".
