Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has accepted Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's invitation to attend the latter's swearing-in ceremony in Patna on November 20.  However, Thackeray himself will not attend the event and will send two Maharashtra Cabinet ministers. “Uddhav Thackeray wanted to attend the oath-taking ceremony, but he is preoccupied with other events”, said Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe.
