Speaking up in support of Shashi Tharoor, Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh Thursday tweeted, "I see nothing wrong in Shashi Tharoor accepting to be Brand Ambassador for Swachhta Abhiyan. It is Congress Party programme adopted by Modi." Congress party, however, distanced itself from his remarks with spokesman Anand Sharma saying that "Digvijaya speaks for himself".
