A look-alike of the Uttar Pradesh government website has initiated a poll seeking opinion on whether Babri Masjid or Ram Mandir should be built in Ayodhya's disputed land. The website has a similar URL like the UP government's official site and suggested it was CM Yogi Adityanath's initiative. This comes after Supreme Court suggested an out-of-court settlement on the issue.
