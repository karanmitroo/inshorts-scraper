BJP MP Harsh Vardhan has said that for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, EVM means "Everyone Votes Modiji", adding the AAP Convenor will soon demand the Election Commission be handed over to Delhi government. His remark came after Kejriwal alleged irregularities in EVMs over some reports that claimed the VVPAT machine dispensed slips of BJP on pressing other buttons on EVM.
