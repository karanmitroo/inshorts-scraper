Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday said at the launch event of his biography 'Anything But Khamosh' that the BJP could expel him if it wants though he had not done anything against the party. He further blamed the party's strategy of giving tickets to outsiders in Bihar Assembly polls, sidelining him from the ad campaign and consequently losing the elections.
