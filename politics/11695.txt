BJP on Friday snubbed senior leader Jaswant Singh by denying him a ticket in the elections from Barmer (Rajasthan) which Singh was seeking and instead decided to field Col Sonaram Choudhary from there. Choudhary had recently defected from the Congress. Speculations say that Singh might contest as an independent but there was no confirmation.
