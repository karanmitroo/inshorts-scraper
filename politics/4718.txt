Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday said it was saddening that a routine army exercise was being politicised. The exercise has been continuing since last 15-20 years and was being conducted in West Bengal and other northeastern states, he added. Notably, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has been demanding an immediate withdrawal of the army from the state.
