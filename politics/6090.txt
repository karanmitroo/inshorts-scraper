BJP on Friday said that Sheila Dikshit is too old to deliver victory to the Congress in the 2017 UP election. “I think Rahul Gandhi should himself come forward for the chief ministerial post as he can never be the PM,” said BJP UP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya. His remarks came after Rahul made a pitch for Dikshit in UP.
