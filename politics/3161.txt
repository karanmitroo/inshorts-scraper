Union Minister Uma Bharti said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being targeted as he comes from a poor family. Further, reacting to Modi's "graveyard, cremation ground" remark, Bharti said, "I fully endorse the statement of Modi. There is no problem taking welfare steps for the minority community, but it should not be at the cost of majority."
