Union Minister Uma Bharti has said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is a 'chhote dimag ka aadmi' (small-minded person) who will flee to Bangkok on March 11 when Assembly elections' results are out. "Congress President Sonia Gandhi should send Rahul for a course on how to conduct himself," she added.
