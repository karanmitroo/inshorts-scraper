Swaraj Abhiyaan leader and ex-AAP member Prashant Bhushan and his father Shanti Bhushan on Saturday accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal of playing “a big fraud with people” by diluting the Jan Lokpal draft’s provisions. “Even the Centre’s Lokpal Act, which has been termed as jokepal by Kejriwal, is stronger than this Bill. This is a mahajokepal,” senior Bhushan said.
