In contrary to what BJP termed as 'revolutionary', the Opposition Congress has called Rail Budget as 'disappointing'. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla said, "Noting that no single announcement was made about new trains, I was expecting reduction in rail fares." Another Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, "The Budget is full of imaginary ideas and it's impossible to implement it practically."
