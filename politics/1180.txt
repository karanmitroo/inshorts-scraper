Congress leader and former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Tuesday said that the BJP-led Centre is not providing a "very supportive" environment for India's growth. Demonetisation and GST have caused a severe setback to the economy which is now becoming visible, he added. "There are too many distractions, and there has been a few major disruptions," Chidambaram further said.
