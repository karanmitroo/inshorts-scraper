The Indian Pirates Party, founded by Praveen Arimbrathodiyil, will contest in the upcoming Kerala Assembly elections. The party grew out of a movement that started in 2013, which advocated free knowledge, digital rights, and direct democracy. Arimbrathodiyil said that winning the election is not their immediate target and that they aim to spread the word about their movement through elections.
