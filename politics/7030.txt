BJP leader Tarun Chugh on Saturday challenged Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to project himself as the chief ministerial candidate in Punjab Assembly polls and test his political strength and popularity. He asserted the "bubble of artificial charisma" of Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh has burst much before the polls and even an "erstwhile Maharaja" can't revive Congress' fortunes.
