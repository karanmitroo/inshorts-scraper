In an apparent attack on Congress chief ministerial candidate for Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal has urged the voters not to vote for those who are saying it's their last election. Such leaders wouldn't be accountable to people and if voted to power, they will only loot the state in their last term, he added.
