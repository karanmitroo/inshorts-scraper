A Delhi court has framed defamation charges against Arvind Kejriwal in a case filed by Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit's political secretary Pawan Khera for alleged remarks against her during power-tariff hike protests in October-2012. The court fixed 18-Jan-2014 for recording of evidence after Kejriwal pleaded not guilty saying Khera wasn't an aggrieved person and the complaint against him was false.
