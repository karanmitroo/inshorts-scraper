Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said that ministers look like waiters “in coat and tie”. He tweeted, “BJP should direct our Ministers to wear traditional and modernised Indian clothes while abroad.” Earlier, Swamy had demanded the removal of Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian for the latter’s purported 'anti-India stance', even as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley defended him.
