Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) members have demanded a ban on actor Kamal Haasan starrer 'Uttama Villain', claiming that it will hurt the sentiments of Hindus. VHP alleges that the lyrics of a song 'Iraniyan Nadagam' in the film, mocks the conversation between Prahalad and Hiranyakashipu. The Ramesh Aravind directorial is about an 8th century theatre artist and a modern-day superstar.
