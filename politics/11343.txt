In a blatant display of muscle power, a group of BJP supporters beat up AAP leader Somnath Bharti during an election-related programme on a news channel in Varanasi on Wednesday. After getting first aid, Bharti registered a complaint against his assaulters. AAP’s Atishi Marlena said that it’s not the way the cadre of BJP’s PM candidate should behave.
