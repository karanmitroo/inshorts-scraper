During the Lok Sabha session on Thursday, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy called Assam's National Register of Citizens a conspiracy to drive out Bengali-speaking citizens from the state. He pointed out that names of 1.3 crore people who had applied for the registration were left out from the first draft of the register, which is aimed at identifying illegal immigrants.
