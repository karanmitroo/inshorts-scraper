CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday demanded that the government make public the cost of withdrawing currency notes and replacing them with ₹2000 notes. “What are the estimates of black money that will be curbed by this move?” he further asked. “If no such data exists, as one fears, it only proves that it is another jumla,” he added.
