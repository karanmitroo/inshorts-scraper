Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday criticised the Modi government over the alleged suicide of ex-Army jawan Ram Kishan Grewal. “It means PM is lying that OROP has been implemented. Had it been implemented, Grewal wouldn’t have to commit suicide,” he stated. “Soldiers fighting on border against external enemy and fighting within for their rights,” he added.
