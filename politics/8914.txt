Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and BJP veteran LK Advani met on Monday at the latter's residence. Though both maintained that the meeting was a courtesy call, reports said that the challenges faced by Delhi, the Centre being "unsupportive" and national politics were discussed. Last month, the meeting between the two leaders was cancelled at the last minute.
