Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday accused the Congress party of practising "ideological intolerance towards BJP" and said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been the "worst victim of these ideological intolerance" since 2002. In a Facebook post, Jaitley further wrote that despite the "unfortunate" Dadri lynching case, India continues to remain a "highly tolerant and liberal society".
