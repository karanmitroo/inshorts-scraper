The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Wednesday sacked its two members who were arrested for allegedly attacking some students over the Ramjas College issue. It also asked the police to take stern action against the duo, Prashant Mishra and Vinayak Sharma. "The two students didn't adhere to the ABVP's rules and indulged in violence," said the student group.
