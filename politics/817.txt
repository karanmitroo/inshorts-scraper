Patidar leader Hardik Patel on Wednesday asked the people in Gujarat not to forget and forgive the BJP for the atrocities they committed on Patidars. Dismissing BJP's charge that he's a 'Congress agent', Hardik said he is opposing BJP because Patidars were beaten up and killed and the party failed to create jobs and education opportunities for the youth.
