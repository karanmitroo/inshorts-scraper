Commemorating the demolition of Babri Masjid on December 6 1992, BJP workers in Faridabad and Ayodhya urged people to display saffron flags atop temples and houses, to mark Saffron Day (Bhagwa Diwas). BJP leaders of Uttar Pradesh distanced themselves from the campaign, but said that they “can’t stop local residents from celebrating” since “it comes naturally”.
