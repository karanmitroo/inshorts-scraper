Tamil Nadu interim CM O Panneerselvam on Wednesday asserted that he has recommended an inquiry commission to probe Jayalalithaa's death. A sitting Supreme Court judge will head the inquiry commission, he said. There were health queries regarding Jayalalithaa raised in the recent past and it was the state's duty to inquire about them, he added.
