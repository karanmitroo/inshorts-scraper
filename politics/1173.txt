Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that a million jobs can be created in less than 12 months in the railway ecosystem. "My own sense is that jobs may not necessarily be directly in the railways, but certainly through engaging people and working in a variety of areas across the ecosystem," he added.
