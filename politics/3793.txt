AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi has asked Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to exercise caution while increasing Muslim reservation to 12% as it may give rise to legal complications. He added that it can also cause Muslims to lose the existing 4% quota. Rao had said on Wednesday that the State would introduce the Muslim Reservation Bill in the budget session.
