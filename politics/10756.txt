The BJP, on Saturday, demanded Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's resignation on moral grounds, after the anti-corruption bureau requested the state government to begin an 'open enquiry' against him. Pawar has been alleged of corruption in 12 irrigation-projects in the last decade, by an activist. "(Ajit) Pawar should take moral responsibility and resign immediately," said state BJP-chief Devendra Fadnavis.
