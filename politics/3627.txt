Congress' chief ministerial candidate for Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, has admitted his party can't take AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal for granted. "Kejriwal is a sneaky little fellow but I'm little wary of him as we can't take him for granted considering 2014 polls," he stated. There was resentment among people, so they thought of a new party (AAP), he added.
