Union Minister Maneka Gandhi has slammed Kerala Local Administration Minister KT Jaleel over culling of dogs to address the issue of stray dog menace in the state. Gandhi recommended sterilisation of the animal instead of culling them. Reacting to her suggestion, Jaleel said, "How can those who do not have love for human life have love for animal life."
