BJP is likely to submit a formal proposal on govt formation in J&K to the state Governor NN Vohra on Thursday, a day after receiving friendly signals from PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, the leader of the largest party. A government has to be formed in the state by Jan 19, failing which Governor's rule will be imposed.
