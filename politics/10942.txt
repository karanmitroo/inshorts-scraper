President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit Mukherjee, who defended controversial TMC MP Tapas Pal seeking forgiveness for the latter's rape comments, went on to describe Pal's comments as "slip of tongue". "At times, such slips of tongue happen although it shouldn't happen. Many of us have made similar mistakes in the past,” said Mukherjee.
