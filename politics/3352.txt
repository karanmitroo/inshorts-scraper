BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya has tweeted a picture saying Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi should not level allegations like 'peeping into bathroom' on anyone, because if someone actually started peeping then Rahul's foreign trips will stop. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi had said Prime Minister Narendra Modi likes to peep into bathrooms over the latter's 'raincoat' remark on ex-PM Manmohan Singh.
