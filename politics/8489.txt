Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal "the Nelson Mandela of India". "The only crime of people like Badal Sahib was that they had political views different from those in power", Modi said at a BJP gathering. As soon as he said so, #YoBadalSoMandela began trending on Twitter, with people poking fun at the remark.
