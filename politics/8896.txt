RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's plan to take out a procession with 1,000 horse carts for a poll campaign has been challenged by PETA.  "We have approached the Election Commission and demanded it stop the plan," PETA said. The move is against the EC's 2012 advisory that asks political parties to refrain from using animals for political campaigns, it added.
