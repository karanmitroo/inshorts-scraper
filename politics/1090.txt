Jammu and Kashmir Deputy CM Nirmal Singh said that the houses of MLAs were being attacked with grenades to create fear among people. "Anti-national elements are trying their best to create a turmoil-like situation. In this proxy war, terrorists, stone pelters, and others are busy and so are the police, government, and security forces (to counter them)," he said.
