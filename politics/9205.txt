The Parliament has reportedly expunged the names of Mother Teresa and Shah Rukh Khan from the Lok Sabha for being “reference[s] to a stranger”. During the last one year, about 206 words and expressions including the names of Indira Gandhi and Hitler were deemed “derogatory”, “allegatory” or “unparliamentary”, and were not recorded in the House proceedings.
