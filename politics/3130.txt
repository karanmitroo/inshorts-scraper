Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said "if BJP keeps this new Hindutva Prachar" in Uttar Pradesh then it may get a majority. "See most westernised city Mumbai is 90% seats for Hindutva," he added. On BMC results, he said, "BJP and Shiv Sena must combine as being Hindutva blood brothers. I will get to work on that".
