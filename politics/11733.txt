In another seat-related controversy within BJP, actor-turned-politician and sitting MP Shatrughan Sinha Friday said that he’s ready to vacate his seat, but only for Narendra Modi, if he agrees to contest from Bihar. Sinha was not included in the list of 25 candidates announced Thursday, with some saying that he’s been "punished" for opening mouth against Modi in the past.
