Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has announced that he would quit politics if less than 5 lakh people turn out at the proposed HAM rally in Patna Gandhi Maidan on April 20. Manjhi claimed that the turnout for his recent Muzaffarpur meet was more, as compared to Sonia Gandhi's rally at the same venue a few months back.
