Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who addressed the 'Swabhiman Rally' in Patna on Sunday, accused the Narendra Modi-led government of "doing nothing other than 'show-baazi'". "Modi-government has completed one-fourth of its time. Till now, what has it done other than show-baazi", Gandhi said. Further, Gandhi attacked Modi for his DNA remarks by saying, "Some people take pleasure in mocking Bihar".
