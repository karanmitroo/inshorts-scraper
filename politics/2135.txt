Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has reportedly said the Mumbai Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) tortured her for 24 days in custody and regularly forced her to name top RSS leaders in the 2008 Malegaon blast case. "I was beaten brutally throughout my custody. I was beaten so much that my hands and fingers regularly developed swelling," she alleged.
