Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers on Saturday stopped the New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani express at Cooch Behar in West Bengal to protest against the arrest of party's MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay. Sudip was arrested by the CBI on Tuesday in connection with the Rose Valley chit fund scam. Earlier, TMC workers had also set BJP's office in Hooghly on fire in protest.
