Minister of State (Home) Kiren Rijiju on Monday said that Hindu population is reducing in India because Hindus never convert people and minorities in India are flourishing unlike some countries around. He was reacting to an allegation by Congress that Modi government is trying to convert Arunachal Pradesh into a Hindu state. Congress shouldnâ€™t make such provocative statements, he added.
