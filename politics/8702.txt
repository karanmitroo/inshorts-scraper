Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has requested for an OROP-like special bailout package for farmers to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking at Modi's Chandigarh rally on Friday, he said, “Like OROP, it is high time that you helped the beleaguered farmers … they are on the verge of economic disaster.” Modi, however, did not promise any such financial relief.
