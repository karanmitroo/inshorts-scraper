The Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), an NGO, has moved the Supreme Court seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the Delhi and Tamil Nadu governments for "disobeying" the court’s guidelines on public advertisements. CPIL claimed that the AAP-led Delhi government used "22 times more funds for ads" and AIADMK-led TN government used CM J Jayalalithaa’s photo in its ads.
