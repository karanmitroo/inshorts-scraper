BJP has reportedly accused the ruling Congress government in Karnataka of trying to impose Ahinda and Leftist agenda on school children. This comes after CM Siddaramaiah preponed the printing of revised textbooks for as many as 75,000 state board schools to January next year. The textbooks were revised following allegations of saffronisation in textbooks when BJP was in power.
