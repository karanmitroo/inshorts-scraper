Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh has said the party will announce its candidates for 2017 polls by September. Singh said the Congress has set August 15 as the deadline for applications after which scrutiny will begin to rule out non-serious candidates. The party has also done away with the application fee of ₹10,000 and ₹5,000 for candidates, Singh added.
