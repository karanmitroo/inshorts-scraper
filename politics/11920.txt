Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi Saturday broke his security cover to meet his eight-year-old fan, Dushyant, waiving an NSUI flag at him while he was leaving after an interaction with students in Bangalore. After his brief talk with Rahul, Dushyant said, "I told him - you will become PM... he replied to me - you will also become PM".
