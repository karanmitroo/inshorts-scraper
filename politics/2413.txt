Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said writing off farm loans is not the ultimate solution to end farmers' woes but one of the many. Referring to the UPA government's loan waiver for the farmers, Fadnavis added, "The CAG report states that the farm loan waiver of 2008 barely helped 30-40 per cent farmers."
