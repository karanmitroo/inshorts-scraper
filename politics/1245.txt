While hearing a case against former Finance Minister P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram, the Supreme Court on Friday said that he cannot leave the country. This comes after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) informed the apex court that Karti Chidambaram was closing several of his foreign bank accounts.
