AAP leader Somnath Bharti has been booked by the Amethi (UP) district administration for overstaying in the constituency, as the deadline for campaigning had come to an end at 6 pm Monday. Bharti, along with other AAP supporters, including members of Kumar Vishwas' family, had been asked to leave the constituency on the ground that they were not registered voters.
