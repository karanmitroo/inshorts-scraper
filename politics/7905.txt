Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday asked the Congress party to keep aside  "petty politics" when it came to national security and termed terrorism as an "international challenge which the world is trying to fight." Naqvi urged the Congress from making comments that would "bolster the confidence of the terrorists" and asked them to support the Centre's endeavours.
