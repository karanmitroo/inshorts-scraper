Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister on Sunday said that like Bihar polls, grand alliance against the BJP is possible during Assembly elections due in 2017. "We will contest the 2017 assembly polls on the plank of development," he said. A grand alliance between Samajwadi Party and Mayawati-led BSP for upcoming polls was earlier suggested by the state's minister Fareed Mahfooz Kidwai.
