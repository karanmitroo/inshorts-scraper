Punjab Agriculture Minister Tota Singh has blamed the Centre for the agricultural crisis in the state. "[T]he Centre...urged us to bring more area under pulses cultivation but at the same time...imported pulses from foreign countries which decreased the price of dal," he said. Singh also slammed the state government for “lacking resource[s] to bail out farmers from the crisis”.
