Criticising BJP for allegedly inducting "goons" in the party, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray has said, "Sometimes I feel now there is an easy way for Dawood to come to India, that would be to join BJP." "The BJP has started sporting goons on their posters instead of stalwarts like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani," he added.
