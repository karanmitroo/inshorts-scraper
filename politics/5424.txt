The Election Commission on Tuesday launched a mobile application for more transparency and effective monitoring of the ongoing revision of voters' list before the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. The app will provide details regarding addition and deletion of names from the electoral roll. "Soon the ECI would come up with an online grievance redressal information system," officials said.
