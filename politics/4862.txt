In a veiled attack on West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said that those who looted poor people with chit fund scam are doubting government’s intention on demonetisation policy. “I had said that inconvenience is going to happen, but I can assure you all that your sacrifice won’t go in vain,” he added.
