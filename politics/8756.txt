Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said on Saturday that the party would lose in Uttar Pradesh if Assembly polls were held now, as per reports. “I have all the reports. There is no silver lining from anywhere.. If polls are held today, we may not be able to win them,” Mulayam reportedly said during a meeting.
