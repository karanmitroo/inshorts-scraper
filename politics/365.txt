BJP Karnataka leader KS Eshwarappa on Tuesday said good Muslims support the BJP while the "Muslims who have killed 22 BJP and RSS activists" are with the Congress. This comes while the BJP has been accusing the ruling Congress in Karnataka of encouraging political organisations like Popular Front of India to target Sangh Parivar activists.
