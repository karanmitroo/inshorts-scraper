Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Monday said that not just Muslims, but even secular Hindus are scared, further implying that the Narendra Modi-led government is creating an atmosphere of fear in India. "The situation is getting worse," Azad said. "This is jungle raj. No action is being taken against the defaulters." Azad earlier wrote to Modi over communal violence.
