RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said the ruling BJP could be best defined as the 'Bharat Jalao Party' (Burn India Party). Yadav also slammed PM Narendra Modi for claiming that he was Uttar Pradesh's adopted son. "Are the people of UP childless that they would go for adoption, or is Modi an orphan?" Yadav asked.
