Talking at a college in Meghalaya, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has said the RSS ideology is aimed at disempowering women and pointed out that the organisation has no women in leadership roles. Claiming that Mahatma Gandhi always had women accompanying him, Rahul said, "If you see pictures of (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat, he'll be alone or surrounded by men."
