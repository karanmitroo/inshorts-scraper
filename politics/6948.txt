JD(U) on Sunday suspended Rajya Sabha MP Anil Sahani from its parliamentary board, over his alleged role in the Leave and Travel Concession (LTC) scam. "Anil Sahni has not been able to satisfy party or the Rajya Sabha chairman with his answers," JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said. The party had earlier sent a show-cause notice to Sahani seeking his explanation.
