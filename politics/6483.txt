Congress MLA Nitesh Rane on Tuesday alleged that 72 out of total 94 police stations in Mumbai are made to operate "illegally" due to government apathy. "These... do not have proper water, electricity or telephone connections, and police officers posted there have no option but to work," he said. Some stations are not even recognised by civic bodies, Rane added.
