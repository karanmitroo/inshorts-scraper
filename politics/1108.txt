After resigning from the Trinamool Congress on Wednesday, party founding member Mukul Roy said, "Mamata may be the leader, but we are comrades and not her servants." Expressing displeasure over the TMC's closeness with Congress, he added, "We had formed TMC to fight against the Congress. So, what is the point if TMC becomes the Congress' ally?"
