AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Monday said - "257 out of 280 public meetings have been in favour of AAP forming govt in Delhi. Hence, we have decided to stake claim to form the government in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal will be our Chief Minister." The party has requested the lieutenant governor to hold the swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan.
