Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that breaking the party line and seeking publicity is wrong. The statement comes after he was asked about the controversy over RBI governor Raghuram Rajan's removal and BJP MP Subramanian Swamy's attacks on Finance Ministry officials. "No one is bigger than the party…this fondness for publicity is never going to do any good,” Modi added.
