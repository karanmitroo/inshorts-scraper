TMC leader Mukul Roy on Friday claimed that six party workers have been killed since the West Bengal Assembly elections were announced. He threatened that if next time there is a murder, they would bring the body to the Chief Electoral Officer's (CEO's) office as law and order was the responsibility of the Election Commission once the polls are announced.
