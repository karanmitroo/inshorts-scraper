After BJP formed the government in UP, posters of BJP MLA Brijesh Singh surfaced in Saharanpur naming Deoband as Deovrind. Notably, Deoband is known for its historical significance and Darul Uloom Deoband â€” a centre of Islamic learning from Mughal era. "We want all those places to be renamed which were once under the Mughal rule," said a VHP leader.
