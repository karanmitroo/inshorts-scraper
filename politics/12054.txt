Making their foray into Gujarat, the Aam Aadmi Party launched what it called a 'jhadu' or broom yatra across the state on India's 65th Republic Day. In Ahmedabad Sunday, the yatra was led by TV journalist-turned-politician Ashutosh who said the intention behind the campaign was to highlight the "anti-people and pro-corporate stand" of the Narendra Modi government.
