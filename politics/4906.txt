Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday ordered its Rajya Sabha MPs to be present in the Parliament sessions for three days starting Monday, reports said. This comes amid discussions on demonetisation in the ongoing winter session. The ruling NDA lacks a majority in Rajya Sabha and the MPs' presence may be necessary in case of voting.
