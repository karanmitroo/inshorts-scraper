Opposing Centre's demonetisation move, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Thursday said, "Pakistan terrorists didn't kill even half of our people in Uri than those who have died due to government's wrong policy." Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu reacted to this saying, "Leader of opposition is insulting nation by making such remarks by comparing this with Pakistan terror attacks, should apologise."
