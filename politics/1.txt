A statue of Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the Founder of BJP's parent party Bharatiya Jana Sangh, was vandalised in West Bengal's Kolkata on Wednesday. Police have arrested at least six people in connection with the vandalism. This comes after people razed two statues of Russian communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in Tripura post CPI(M)'s defeat in the state assembly polls.
