Sonia Gandhi reassured Manmohan Singh that there is no intention to undermine his position, after Rahul Gandhi called the ordinance to protect convicted-legislators "complete-nonsense". Rahul issued a statement later, saying that he has the highest respect for Singh. Also, the PM said that the issues raised by Rahul will be considered by the Union-Cabinet when he returns back to India.
