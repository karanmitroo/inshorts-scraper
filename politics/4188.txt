For the second time in three days, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday expelled senior leader Ram Gopal Yadav from the party for six years. Mulayam also termed all the proposals passed in the National Executive meet convened earlier in the day as "unconstitutional" and "invalid". Notably, Ram Gopal Yadav's suspension was earlier revoked by the party.
