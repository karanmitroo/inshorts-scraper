Criticising the Centre's demonetisation move, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday called it a "big cheating" with the nation as it halted India's entire trade sector. "Money is not black or white. It is just the trade of cash which is in black or white," he said. Yadav further criticised the government for playing politics over Ganga.
