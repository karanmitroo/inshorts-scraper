After Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's claims of a CBI raid inside his office, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that "It has become a fashion for Delhi CM to quarrel with Central government" and drag PM into everything. Naidu added that CBI is an "independent agency" and can't be misused like in the "days of the Congress".
