AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, who was on a tour to study conditions in Gujarat, Friday questioned Gujarat CM Narendra Modi's claims on farm growth, job creation and clean governance in the state. "What is your development model? What we've seen in the last two days is quite shocking," Kejriwal said. BJP leaders condemned Kejriwal's remarks.
