Akal Takht (Sikh religious authority) on Monday awarded religious punishment to 39 Sikh politicians from the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party for seeking votes from Dera Sacha Sauda during the recent Assembly polls. The leaders violated the 2007 directive of the Takht, excommunicating the Dera head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, for impersonating Guru Gobind Singh.
