Large number of people, especially BJP supporters, are being attracted by a temple dedicated to PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat's Rajkot village. The PM’s idol has been installed in the temple, which initially had his photograph. Sources have said that the temple rose to prominence after Modi’s win in 2014 general elections.
