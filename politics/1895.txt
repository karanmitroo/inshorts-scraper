The CPI(M) on Friday suspended its Rajya Sabha MP Ritabrata Banerjee for three months after receiving complaints about his 'luxurious lifestyle'. Party workers spotted him wearing an Apple Watch and carrying a Montblanc Meisterstück pen in public, after which they lodged their protest. Notably, a CPI(M) MP said in a debate that party lawmakers keep only ₹7,500 from their salaries.
