Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu today rejected Leader of Opposition YS Jaganmohan Reddy's demand for resignation over "failing" to secure special category status for the state. “Why should I resign?... Will you get funds (from the Centre)?” he asked. Apart from the resignation, Reddy had also demanded that Naidu pulled out of the NDA government at the Centre.
