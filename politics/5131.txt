Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said that he would be happy if ex-Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse returned to the Cabinet. Khadse was forced to resign in June over allegations against him for misusing his position for a land deal. Stating that Khadse could return soon, Fadnavis, however, said that his comeback would depend on ongoing probe into the matter.
