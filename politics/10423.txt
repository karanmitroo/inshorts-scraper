Sena sources said that Udhhav has convened a meeting in Mumbai Sunday evening where he could decide to pull his party out of the Central govt and also sit in opposition in Maharashtra. Also, Shiv Sena MP Anil Desai failed to take oath as Union minister, Sunday, apparently because BJP failed to address Sena's demands for ministerial berths in Maharashtra.
