Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said the Samajwadi party provides 24-hour power supply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi. "Modi should speak the truth and accept the fact that it is the SP government, which has ensured electricity to Varanasi," Akhilesh said. This comes after Modi claimed that Uttar Pradesh faces severe power shortage.
