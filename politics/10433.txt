Suresh Prabhu on Sunday resigned from Shiv Sena and joined BJP, hours before being sworn-in as Cabinet Minister in the expansion of the Narendra Modi govt at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The 61-year-old is expected to be made the next Railway Minister, replacing Sadananda Gowda. Notably, Prabhu was the power minister during former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s regime.
