Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday in the Lok Sabha said the previous UPA government made efforts to favour the multi-crore AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal. Alleging that concessions were given to a single vendor, Parrikar added, "The field trials of the chopper were initially opposed by (then defence minister) AK Antony. But he was later convinced to change his stand."
