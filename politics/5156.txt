Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Thursday said, "AAP has zero performance in Delhi and Congress is zero across India, so Navjot Singh Sidhu will also be zero whoever he joins." Notably, Sidhu, who recently formed a political party 'Awaz-e-Punjab' after resigning from BJP, is reportedly in talks of an alliance with AAP or Congress for 2017 Punjab Assembly polls.
