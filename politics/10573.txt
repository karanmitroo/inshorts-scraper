The final post-mortem report of Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, says that she died because of the presence of “poison” in her body. This is in contrast to earlier reports which said that the death was due to the overdose of Alprax (an antidepressant drug). The report also questions the police investigation so far.
