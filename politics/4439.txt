Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday said PM Narendra Modi has firebombed the poor by demonetisation and added, "Only 6% of India's black money is in cash." Gandhi said, "94% of the black money is stashed away in foreign banks, real estate and investment in land deals and gold, but why is the PM running only after the rest."
