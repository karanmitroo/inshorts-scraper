The BJP on Wednesday released its list of 88 candidates for the upcoming Assam elections, including nine Muslims and six ex-Congress MLAs. While the BJP has given away 24 seats to AGP, it has kept 13 seats for its other ally, the Bodoland People's Front (BPF). State party President and Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal will contest from the Majuli seat.
