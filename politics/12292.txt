Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Friday once again turned down the Delhi Police's offer of a security cover, urging the police to provide the security to the aam aadmi of Delhi. Earlier in October, Kejriwal had turned down a security cover, offered by the police in wake of a threat to his life.
