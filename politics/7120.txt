The BJP on Saturday alleged that the records of Uttarakhand Assembly proceedings were tampered on the command of former CM Harish Rawat. The BJP further demanded a CBI probe into the matter. BJP state president Ajay Bhatt also announced that it will launch a 'Save Uttarakhand' yatra next, countering Rawat's foot march in the state.
