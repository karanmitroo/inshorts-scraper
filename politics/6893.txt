Congress leader AK Antony on Saturday said that the BJP's goal was to ensure defeat of the ruling UDF-Congress regime in Kerala and to weaken the party at the national level. The BJP should not get a single seat to ensure communal harmony in Kerala, he said. Antony also criticised the CPI(M), saying it was 25 years behind in development.
