The Election Commission has barred Madhya Pradesh Minister Narottam Mishra from contesting elections for three years over paid news allegations during 2008 Assembly polls. The complaint was filed by former Congress MLA Rajendra Bharti in April 2009. While Mishra had earlier approached the MP High Court seeking to quash the inquiry by the EC, his plea was rejected.
