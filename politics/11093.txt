Japanese PM Shinzo Abe - who has over 3 lakh followers - follows only three people on Twitter, Akie Abe (his wife of 27 years), Naoki Inose (Japanese journalist) and Narendra Modi. Shinzo had called up Modi soon after it became clear that he was coming to power. Notably, there are striking similarities in the rise of the two leaders.
