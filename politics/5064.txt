Anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare praised the Centre's decision of scrapping the currency notes of ₹500 and ₹1,000 and termed it as a "revolutionary step to fight corruption". Hazare further said, "The decision to issue the new currency notes of ₹2000 denomination needs to have adequate safeguards to ensure it does not generate black money in future."
