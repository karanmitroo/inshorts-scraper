Vijay Rupani (60) was on Friday named the new CM of Gujarat while Nitin Patel was declared the Deputy CM. The decision was made after BJP national President Amit Shah held a meeting with party MLAs in Gandhinagar. Rupani was made BJP's state President in February and held several ministries including transport and employment in former CM Anandiben Patel's cabinet.
