BJP President Amit Shah has compared the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party with ‘Rahu’ and ‘Ketu’ and said that their governments have caused “an eclipse on the development” of Uttar Pradesh. “Lotus (BJP) should rise like the sun...to remove that eclipse,” Shah said. The SP is itself grabbing land instead of giving it to the poor, he added.
