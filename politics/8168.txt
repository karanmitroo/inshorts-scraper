After drawing criticism for hugging RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s swearing-in ceremony in Patna, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that he had no intention of doing so. "Lalu Yadav shook my hand, pulled and hugged me. I did not take any initiative… We are against his record of corruption," Kejriwal added.
