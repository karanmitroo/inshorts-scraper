Gujarat MLA and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani on Wednesday tweeted that he doubts if anyone has ever said 'I love you' to PM Narendra Modi. Wishing a happy Valentine's Day, Mevani said several people had professed their love to him. He added that the popularity of Malayalam actress Priya Prakash Varrier's video is an "answer to RSS' Valentine's Day protest".
