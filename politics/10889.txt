Questioning TRS government's decision to appoint tennis star Sania Mirzaâ€™s as brand ambassador of Telangana, BJP leader K Laxman on Thursday termed her as "daughter-in-law" of Pakistan. Sania was born in Maharashtra and settled in Hyderabad only later and, hence, is a "non-local", Laxman said, adding that she had never participated in agitation for a separate state of Telangana.
