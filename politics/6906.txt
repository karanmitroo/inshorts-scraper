MNS Chief Raj Thackeray on Monday sought Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' resignation over his support for the formation of a separate Vidarbha state. "A person who espouses the cause of splitting Maharashtra... has no right to continue" as the Chief Minister, Thackeray asserted. "Fadnavis has supported separate Vidarbha and mentioned so in his Facebook post of 2013," he alleged.
