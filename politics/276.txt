During a discussion on the Sunjuwan Army camp attack which killed 5 jawans, National Conference MLA Mohammad Akbar Lone on Saturday raised 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans in the J&K Assembly. Lone said he was provoked when the BJP members started raising anti-Pakistan slogans during the discussion. Meanwhile, the National Conference said they disowned and condemned the legislator's actions.
