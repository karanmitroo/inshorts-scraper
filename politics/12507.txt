Responding to a PIL accusing Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal and others of violating 'Foreign Contribution Regulation Act-2010', Delhi HC has directed the central government to once again check AAP's account records. FCRA prohibits funding from foreign countries for political parties. However AAP denied the charges saying that earlier also, the government had not found anything against AAP.
