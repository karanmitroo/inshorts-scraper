Delhi high court on Friday provided clean chit to former Maharashtra CM, Ashok Chavan in the "paid news" case. "I am happy that truth has prevailed," Chavan said. The ruling came after a complaint was filed against Chavan, alleging him of filing incorrect expenses for the 2009 assembly elections, also known as the "paid news" case.
