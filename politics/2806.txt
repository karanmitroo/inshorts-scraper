Raising doubts over the counting of votes, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday cited the Supreme Court's earlier observation that stated EVM is vulnerable to tampering. He also said that even the BJP leaders had raised questions on EVMs. I know people will make fun of me after this statement, but even developed countries have given up EVMs, he added.
