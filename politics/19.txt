While addressing the Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said, "I am a Hindu and have no reason to celebrate Eid." "But my government would continue to work for a peaceful celebration of Eid," the CM added. This comes days after he was asked where he was planning to celebrate Eid after celebrating Holi in Vrindavan.
