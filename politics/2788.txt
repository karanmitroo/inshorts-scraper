The BJP on Thursday distributed laddoos, reportedly flown in from the Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh to Delhi, to its leaders. The party had ordered about 1,000-1,200 laddoos on Tuesday night, but the temple was able to deliver only about 600, a report stated. BJP President Amit Shah was offered a laddoo by BJP UP unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya.
