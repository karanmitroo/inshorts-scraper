The Punjab police on Friday booked Youth Congress leader Kamaljit Singh Brar and his supporters for allegedly maligning the image of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal through defamatory posters with “derogatory language” on public buses. The posters featured statements like “we failed to arrest the culprits who desecrated Sri Guru Granth Sahib” and “farmers are committing suicide in my state”.
