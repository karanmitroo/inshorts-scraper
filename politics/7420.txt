Criticising Raj Thackeray's remarks on non-Marathis getting autorickshaw permits, the Congress and NCP on Thursday accused him of pursuing "hate politics". They further demanded that the BJP-Shiv Sena government take legal action against him. Claiming that 70% of new autorickshaw permits were given to non-Marathis, Thackeray had earlier directed his party workers to set fire to these vehicles.
