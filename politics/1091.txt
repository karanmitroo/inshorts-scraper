BJP National General Secretary Saroj Pandey on Sunday said if attacks on the party's workers don't stop, the eyes of the attackers will be gouged out. This comes after BJP President Amit Shah blamed the ruling CPI(M) for the murders of BJP-RSS workers in Kerala and alleged that over 120 party workers were killed after "communists came to power".
