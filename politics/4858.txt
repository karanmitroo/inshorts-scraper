Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said “note nahi PM badlo” (don’t change currency notes, but change the PM) while criticising the government over its demonetisation policy. "There’s a rise in Paytm’s business ever since old currency notes were banned and Modiji appeared in their advertisement also. He must tell what is the deal between him and Paytm,” he added.
