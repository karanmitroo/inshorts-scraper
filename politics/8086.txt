Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday said, “Let him say what he wants,” after Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised the continuous disruption of the Parliament. Modi had earlier termed the disruption a “matter of sorrow” and said “democracy cannot function at the whims... of anyone”. The Congress has been protesting an alleged 'political vendetta' in the National Herald case.
