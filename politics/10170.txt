The Congress is celebrating its 130th Foundation Day on Sunday. The celebrations will be held at the All India Congress Committee headquarters in the national capital. Top party leadership including Congress President Sonia Gandhi will preside over the function. However, the mood at this year's celebrations might be somber, due to the Congress' unimpressive electoral performance this year.
