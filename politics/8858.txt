Police on Friday arrested about 200 Tamil Nadu Congress workers in Chennai for attempting to show black flags to PM Narendra Modi during his Chennai visit. The Congress workers were protesting against the suspension of 25 Congress MPs in Parliament. The police, however, released the workers in the evening after keeping them in custody for some time.
