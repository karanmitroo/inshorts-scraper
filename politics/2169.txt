Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday criticised Farooq Abdullah's remark which claimed that the Kupwara attack was being highlighted to spread hatred against Muslims. "Hearing such an irresponsible statement from a politically mature person like Abdullah is disheartening," Naqvi said. Naqvi added that Abdullah's remark on a national security issue raised doubts on his political thinking.
