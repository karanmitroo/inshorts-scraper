BJP, the ruling party in MP, sparked a controversy after its state executive member Daulat Bhawsar said they were reciting 'Hanuman Chalisa' twice every week near the 2000 polling booths of Ratlam Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP’s step comes ahead of bypoll in Ratlam constituency. However, Congress criticised the BJP’s move by alleging that they were trying to polarise voters.
