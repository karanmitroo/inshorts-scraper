Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said in Amethi that PM Narendra Modi is spreading hatred as he knows the BJP has lost elections in UP. "You can see his expressions have changed, he used to be happy and now he is all tensed. Now he is doing what he does the best, which is dividing people," Gandhi added.
