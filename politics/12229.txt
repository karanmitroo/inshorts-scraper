Following Aam Aadmi Party's strategy, BJP has asked its workers to approach people for donations ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 1,000 to deepen its connect with voters ahead of Lok Sabha elections. The party has also created the slogan of 'One vote, one note' for this initiative. BJP hopes Modi's appeal will drive people to donate for it.
