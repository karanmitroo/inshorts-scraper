AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has said that his party will contest from 25 seats in the upcoming Assembly elections in Bihar. "Some parties have been getting Muslim votes in the name of secularism and by creating fear among Muslims,” Owaisi said while addressing a rally in the Kishanganj district. He also asked Muslim voters to identify those parties.
