West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team are like Ali Baba and his gang of thieves who rob people to make themselves rich. Terming the Centre's demonetisation move as the biggest scam in world history, Banerjee said, "Bank is cashless, the government is faceless. Remove Modi, save the country."
