The EC has issued a notice to Rahul Gandhi following a complaint by the BJP. The party stated that Rahul violated the model code of conduct by falsely blaming it for communal violence in Muzaffarnagar. During rallies in Rajasthan and MP, Rahul had accused BJP of practicing "politics of hatred" and igniting a Hindu versus Muslim situation in UP.
