The BJP today criticised Jadavpur University (JU) Vice Chancellor Suranjan Das for his "failure" to identify the students who raised "anti-India slogans", and accused him of "acting" as a Trinamool Congress appointee. BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh further questioned Das for not submitting a report in this regard even after the Governor, who is the University Chancellor, sought it.
