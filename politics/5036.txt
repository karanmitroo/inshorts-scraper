Amidst unrest over celebrations of Tipu Sultan’s Jayanti in Karnataka, state’s Education Minister Tanveer Sait was allegedly caught watching porn on his mobile during an event celebrating Tipu Jayanti in Raichur on Thursday. A footage has reportedly surfaced that shows him viewing pictures of ‘skimpily-clad’ women while he was on stage during the celebrations. The BJP has demanded his resignation.
