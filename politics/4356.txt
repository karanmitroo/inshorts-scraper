Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has expressed ignorance about the charge that his firm paid bribes to PM Narendra Modi when he was the Gujarat CM. “I don’t even know about it and I do not wish to talk on that issue,” Birla said. Earlier, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said Modi had accepted ₹24 crore from Birla.
