Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday called PM Narendra Modi a “selfie-machine”, stating the PM only takes selfies with world leaders and not with a farmer or a labourer. Addressing a road show at Urai in UP, Gandhi further said that Modi government has launched a “fair and lovely scheme” to turn black money into white.
