Samajwadi Party on Friday said it had not got any "positive response" from the Congress on alliance ahead of the Uttar Pradesh polls. If Congress wants to defeat BJP, it should accept SP's formula for seat-sharing, it added. "Congress will get 54 seats...maximum seats we can give to them will be 85," SP National Vice President Kiranmoy Nanda said.
