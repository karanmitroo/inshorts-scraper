West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday took part in a protest march by TMC against the demonetisation move and said, "PM Narendra Modi suddenly came up with this decision acting like God." Banerjee further said, "He (Modi) never asked who may need ₹500, ₹1,000 and made the decision to demonetise these notes. He didn’t care about the common people."
