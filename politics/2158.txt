BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini on Sunday said that Congress leaders should be beaten up with shoes for not developing Haryana. "Congress has formed government in Haryana on multiple occasions. It has turned people into beggars. And now, when BJP is in power in the state, Congress leaders are alleging that people are being wronged," he added.
