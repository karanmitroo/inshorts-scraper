The BJP-led Assam government on Thursday changed the names of all the major roads of Guwahati. The existing names were in use since the colonial times, hence we decided to change them, said Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. While GS Road has been renamed as Mahapurush Srimanta Sankerdev Path, Beltola-Khanapara Road is renamed as Peer Azan Fakir Road.
