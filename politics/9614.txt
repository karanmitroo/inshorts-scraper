Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has slammed the Narendra Modi government for asking the UK to ban the Nirbhaya documentary. "No, the ban was not justified. The government has embarrassed the country with its disgraceful conduct on this matter by sending Indian court order to foreign countries where democracy permits greater freedom of expression", Tharoor said.
