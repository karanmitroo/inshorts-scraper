The Opposition Congress on Thursday advised Union Minister Arun Jaitley to "stop being Narad muni and start being Finance Minister". The statement made by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh was in response to Jaitley's comment that Congress party's top leadership was responsible for the delay in passing of ambitious indirect tax reform - the GST bill.
