Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said that he and his family are 'shiv bhakts', but keep such things private. "We do not want to commercialise this thing. We don't want to do 'dalali' (wheeling-dealing) over it," Gandhi added. He further claimed BJP workers had deliberately entered his name on a register meant for non-Hindu visitors at the Somnath temple.
