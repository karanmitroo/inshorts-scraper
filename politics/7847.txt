PDP spokesperson Mehboob Beg on Tuesday confirmed that the party will continue the PDP-BJP alliance in "letter and spirit". Without giving any timeframe, he said the government would be formed under the leadership of Mehbooba Mufti once the mourning period for CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed ends. This comes amid uncertainty regarding government formation after the passing away of CM Sayeed.
