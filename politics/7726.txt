Kerala state secretary of CPI(M), Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Saturday said that his party will revise the liquor policies set by the Congress government if they get elected in the upcoming assembly polls. â€œThe stance of the CPM and Left parties is that abstinence is the ideal option to curb alcoholism, not prohibition," Balakrishnan said, adding that "prohibition is not practical".
