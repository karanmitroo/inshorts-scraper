AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday demanded strict action against Vice-Chancellor (VC) of Hyderabad Central University over the suicide of dalit scholar Rohith Vemula on Sunday. "The incident clearly shows that our universities campus is no more a place of politics for the decent", Owaisi said. Meanwhile, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi will reportedly meet Rohith's mother today.
