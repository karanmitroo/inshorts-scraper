Criticising the government’s “hurried” move to demonetise ₹500, ₹1000 currency notes, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that public anger may lead to a “surgical strike” by voters against the government. “I am not opposed to the policy of taking black money out of the system. We are only opposed to the way it has been done,” he added.
