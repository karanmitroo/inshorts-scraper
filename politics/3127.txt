Union Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday attacked the Delhi government over its mohalla clinic project, calling it a "scam" after the Vigilance Department sought details on complaints of alleged irregularities in it. "Doctors in AAP govt run Mohalla Clinics, make false entries of patients, giving them useless medication to ensure revisits, and their income," Harsh Vardhan added.
