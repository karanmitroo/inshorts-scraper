At the BJP national executive meet, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday termed the Centre's demonetisation move as a "historic" and "bold" decision towards the welfare of the poor in the country. Claiming that the move closed the lifeline of terror funding and fake currency, Jaitley added, "Demonetisation was a crippling blow to terror, fake currency note racket, and insurgency."
