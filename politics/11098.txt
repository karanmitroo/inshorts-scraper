In a surprise move, senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui on Thursday said his party will support the JD(U) government headed by new CM Jitan Ram Manjhi. The new chief minister, who succeeded Nitish Kumar, said he was happy to get RJD's legislative backing. Two days ago, the Congress also had extended support to the JD(U) government.
