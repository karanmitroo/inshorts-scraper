The Supreme Court on Wednesday reinstated the Nabam Tuki-led Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh while quashing Governor JP Rajkhowa's decisions that led to the imposition of President’s Rule in the state. The court held Rajkhowa's actions “illegal” and violative of the Constitution. This is reportedly the first time the SC has restored a state government after it had been replaced.
