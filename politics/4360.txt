Anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare on Saturday accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of not fulfilling the promise of releasing AAP's donors list to the public and asked him to "walk the talk" on funding. "The talks of social change, which we espoused, are fading and politics and money are becoming important. The sense of humility is also fading," Hazare added.
