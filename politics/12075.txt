The Hindu seer, Shankaracharya Swaroopanand, slapped a journalist in Jabalpur(MP) on Tuesday night when the latter asked a question about the prospects of Narendra Modi becoming the PM. Shankaracharya, considered to be close to the Congress party, had warned Abhishek Sharma not to ask any political question. However, the journalist refused to lodge a formal complaint with the police.
