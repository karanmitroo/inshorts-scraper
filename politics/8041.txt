Finance Minister Arun Jaitley questioned parliamentary disruptions and said a "historic Constitution Amendment" enabling Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill is being "indefinitely delayed". Recalling a speech by Jawaharlal Nehru on parliament, Jaitley in a blog asked the Opposition if they are "being fair" to "this country" as the "Parliament is responsible for...vast number of human beings".
