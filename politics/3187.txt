Actor Varun Dhawan got trolled by a Twitter user for saying that he voted in the Rajya Sabha elections last year in a television interview. "You are giving tough competition to Alia Bhatt," wrote the user on Twitter. Responding to this, Varun said it was a slip of tongue and he had meant the Lok Sabha elections held in 2014.
