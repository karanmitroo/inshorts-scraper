Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday alleged that Congress was playing politics over national security and the sacrifices of those martyred in the Nagrota terror attack. "Despite the Prime Minister's presence in the House, I don't know why Congress...left the House?" he said. Notably, the Opposition had staged a walkout over the lack of an obituary reference to the martyrs.
