BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has said that he will attend the mass conversion ceremony in Aligarh on Dec-25, despite UP police not allowing the ceremony being planned in the city. Adityanath said,"There is nothing wrong in 'ghar vapasi' if one does it out of free will." The MP, however, stood against forcible conversion and backed framing of an anti-conversion law.
