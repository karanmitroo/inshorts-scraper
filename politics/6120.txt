Janata Dal (United) leader KC Tyagi on Tuesday said the Bharatiya Janata Party believes in a 'use and throw' policy, talking about cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation as BJP's Rajya Sabha MP. Sidhu recently claimed to have resigned because he was "told to stay away from Punjab". Tyagi added that he agreed with Sidhu's "anguish".
