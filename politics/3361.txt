Claiming that it is difficult for a woman to survive in politics, AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan said that the letter which surfaced yesterday was 'fake'. She claimed the letter to be part of a conspiracy to divide the party. Sasikala sought an urgent appointment with TN Governor and asked him to act immediately in the letter allegedly written by her.
