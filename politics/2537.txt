The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report has stated that the Gujarat government didn't spend ₹15,114.51 crore budgetary provisions, which is 28.5% of the total ₹53,041.05 crore provisioned last year. The report further stated that the amount remained unspent either due to "non-implementation" or "slow implementation of schemes/ programmes".
