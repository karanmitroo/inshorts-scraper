Patidar stir leader Hardik Patel on Monday said, "Congress is a chor (thief) but the BJP is a mahachor (bigger thief). And to defeat a mahachor, if we have to support a chor, we will." Patel added that he went to meet Congress Gujarat in-charge Ashok Gehlot in a hotel on Sunday on an invitation, but BJP leaked the footage.
