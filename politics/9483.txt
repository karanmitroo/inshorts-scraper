Taking a dig at Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's mysterious 'leave', Union Minister Prakash Javdekar Tuesday said that Rahul is less predictable than an eclipse. "In the prediction of a solar or lunar eclipse, certain calculations are involved. But there can be no calculations to determine as to when Rahul Gandhi will appear. So what can I say," Javdekar said.
