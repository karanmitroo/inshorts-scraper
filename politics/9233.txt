Shiv Sena said on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should reveal his stand on controversial issues like the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “There have been disturbances among the BJP’s Hindutva proponents from the time Amit Shah (BJP president) started dilly-dallying on the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” the party said in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
