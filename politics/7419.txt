Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) Chief Raj Thackeray on Wednesday urged party workers to burn autorickshaws and keep pursuing the 'Marathi' agenda. Alleging corruption in the purchase of 70,000 new autorickshaws in Mumbai, he claimed that 70-72% of those issued the new permits were from outside the state. Thackeray also alleged that the government does not care about Marathi people.
