Former environment minister and Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Saturday accused the BJP of tweaking the country's environment laws to favour industries. Alleging that PM Narendra Modi did not practise what he preached regarding environment conservation, Ramesh said, "Ministry of Environment has become a rubber stamp body. In the name of ease of doing business, environment laws are being tweaked."
