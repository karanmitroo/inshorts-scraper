Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Friday alleged that Delhi's Chief Minister and other ministers don’t have the power to appoint their peons and clerks, after an order by the Lt Governor. The Lt Governors' office later clarified that the scope of the order is restricted to the transfer and postings of IAS and DANICS officers.
