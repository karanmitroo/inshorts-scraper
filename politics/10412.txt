In Biharâ€™s biggest political realignment, Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the ruling Janata Dal-United are likely to merge ahead of the assembly polls next year to take on the BJP. The move comes 4 months after after Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar joined hands in Bihar. Earlier in August, Lalu and Nitish jointly campaigned during the Bihar by-elections.
