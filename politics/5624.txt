Jammu and Kashmir government's spokesperson Naeem Akhtar has said that the imposition of curfew in the state on the occasion of Eid on Tuesday was unfortunate but necessary. "It (imposing curfew) doesnâ€™t do any good to the image of any government to take such a step but it's the responsibility of the government to ensure law and order," he added.
