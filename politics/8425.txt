Jitan Ram Manjhi, chief of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) which is an ally of the BJP in Bihar, on Friday urged PM Narendra Modi to take "stringent" action against Union Leader VK Singh over his 'dog' remark. Criticising the Faridabad Dalit killings, Manjhi added, "If somebody has taken birth in a Dalit family so what's his/her fault".
