The BJP on Friday hit back at Congress President Sonia Gandhi for calling Union Minister Sushma Swaraj 'an expert in theatrics'. Reacting to the statement, HRD minister Smriti Irani questioned Gandhi whether she wanted to say that the Parliament was a 'theatre'. "Such a statement is disrespect to the people's mandate," she added.
