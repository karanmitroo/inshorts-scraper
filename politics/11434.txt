An election official on Thursday changed the direction of EVM allegedly at the request of candidate and Union minister KH Muniyappa to make it "vaastu" compliant. As soon as Muniyappa entered the polling centre to cast his vote, he was displeased to see the EVM facing south and placed it in north-eastern direction with the help of his supporters.
