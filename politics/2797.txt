After Goa CM Manohar Parrikar claimed that he has received messages from some Congress MLAs wanting to join BJP, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh challenged him to make the messages public. "Manohar Parrikar is an expert in fishing in troubled waters which is the reason he has sacrificed his Defence Ministry to become CM in Goa," Digvijaya tweeted.
