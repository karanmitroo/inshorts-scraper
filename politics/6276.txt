Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has proposed that Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan be dropped in Tuesday's Cabinet reshuffle and former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi be inducted instead. However, rejecting the proposal of Lalu Yadav, Manjhi said, "Paswan is like my elder brother. I would not like to become a minister by axing Paswan."
