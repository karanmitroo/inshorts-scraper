Violent clashes erupted after massive AAP protests outside BJP headquarters in Delhi and Lucknow, following Arvind Kejriwalâ€™s brief detention by Gujarat police on Wednesday for allegedly violating the model code of conduct. To disperse the crowd, police had to use batons and water cannons. "My detention shows Modi is rattled," said Kejriwal, who later apologized for the violence.
