As human rights activist Irom Sharmila lost her electoral debut from the Thoubal constituency against three-time CM Okram Ibobi Singh, reports claim that Sharmila received only 90 votes. Further, the sitting Chief Minister reportedly won from his home constituency with over 18,000 votes. Sharmila had called off her 16-year-long hunger strike in August 2016 against the Army's special powers act.
