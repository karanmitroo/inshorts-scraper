Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu has sparked a controversy by advising parents to produce more babies. "...If possible, produce one or two children more... But it is incorrect not to have children at all", he said. However, Naidu's remarks had demographic and economical overtones. He said that he intended to assert this as children were the future of the nation.
