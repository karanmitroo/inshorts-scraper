Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot has said the party's recent win in all by-election seats in BJP-ruled Rajasthan has shown that the "tide, sentiments and undercurrent" are in Congress' favour. "There has been complete rejection of the Vasundhara Raje government and the BJP in Rajasthan...The BJP blatantly tried to polarise and communalise the by-elections," Pilot added.
