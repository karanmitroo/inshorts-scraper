Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said that Home Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to Pakistan will bring down the morale of the armed forces. “He should say with modesty…we don't want to keep any relationship with Pakistan," he added. Rajnath will visit Pakistan on Wednesday to attend SAARC meet, despite threat by JuD chief Hafiz Saeed.
