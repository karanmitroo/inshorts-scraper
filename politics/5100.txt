West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday slammed the Centre for putting a day ban on a Hindi news channel and said it showed that an "emergency-like situation" prevailed in the country. An interministerial panel had earlier concluded that 'NDTV India' had revealed crucial and "strategically sensitive" information when the Pathankot terror attack was being carried out.
