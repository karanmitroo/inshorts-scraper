Goa CM, Manohar Parrikar, Saturday tweeted that his government had no role in the Anti-Modi Facebook post case, pointing out that the accused's anticipatory bail was rejected by a court. Earlier in the day, about 20 people-including some political leaders held a 10-minute protest in Panaji, before marching to nearby police headquarters demanding to withdraw the case against the accused.
