In connection to Arvind Kejriwalâ€™s recent protest, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday said - "Because of that 'yeda mukhya mantri' (Marathi for 'mad chief minister'), I had to deploy thousands of policemen." Kejriwal had called Shinde corrupt and inefficient during his dharna. He had even dared Shinde to evict him from the Rail Bhavan during his protest.
