SP Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh on Thursday said he is scared of expelled party leader Ram Gopal Yadav's threats and added that the latter is powerful because he started his political career from dacoit-infested Chambal region. "He said earlier too that he got me sacked from the party and will do the same in the future," Singh further said.
