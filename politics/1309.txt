DMK leader MK Stalin on Tuesday filed a petition in the Madras High Court, demanding a floor test for the CM Palaniswami-led AIADMK government in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. Stalin claims that the government does not have the majority after a group of AIADMK MLAs withdrew their support in wake of the merger of rival AIADMK factions.
