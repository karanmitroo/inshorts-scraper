Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said, "I think Modiji has forgotten that he is the PM now, he should answer questions and not always accuse the Opposition." The PM spoke for over an hour and never talked about farmers or youth employment issues, he added. This comes after PM Modi blamed Congress for dividing India 70 years ago.
