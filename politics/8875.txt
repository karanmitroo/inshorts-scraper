Congress leader and former Union Minister Milind Deora on Monday termed the ban on 857 porn sites in India as 'an act of Talibanism'. Deora, who served as the IT and Communications Minister from 2011 to 2014, tweeted, "The latest ban is not about liking or disliking porn. It's about govt hijacking personal liberties... Privacy is my inalienable, constitutional right."
