Congress leader Rashid Alvi was criticised on Monday, for asking HRD Minister Smriti Irani what action was taken after Google search showed PM Modi's name as the “most stupid Prime Minister”. Irani responded to Alvi's remark saying that he has only lowered his own image by asking the question. The BJP also demanded an unconditional apology from Alvi.
