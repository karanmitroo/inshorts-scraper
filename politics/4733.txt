Trinamool Congress on Thursday alleged that delay in the landing of party chief Mamata Banerjee's flight at Kolkata airport was a 'murder plot'. Banerjee's flight, from Patna to Kolkata, was denied a landing for 30 minutes despite the pilot repeatedly informing the officials that the flight was low on fuel. Notably, Banerjee held a protest rally against demonetisation in Patna.
