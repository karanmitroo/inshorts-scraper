The central intelligence agencies have reportedly said that top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are the targets of Maoists during election rallies for the upcoming Assembly polls. The Maoists have also suggested to carry out serial IED blasts in Uttar Pradesh by deploying 'suitable cadres' from outside. The intelligence has briefed Special Protection Group in this regard.
