Department of Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said, "The action taken by the enforcement agencies on illegally accumulated money is based on specific inputs, you may call it a surgical strike." Notably, PM Modi had asked BJP to stop calling demonetisation move a surgical strike, saying, "Only a soldier can do surgical strikes. We aren't capable of it."
