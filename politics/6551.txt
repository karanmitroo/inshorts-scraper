The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the state government regarding an ordinance that provides 10% reservation to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). The court ruled this while hearing a petition challenging the ordinance for being contrary to the constitution and the Supreme Court's judgements. Earlier, the Gujarat government had passed the ordinance amid Patidar protests.
