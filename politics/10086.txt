The government is likely to give nod to the recommendations of a committee which has favoured voting for NRIs through electronic means. Reportedly, the acceptance of the recommendations will be submitted to the Supreme Court this week. The committee, comprising officials from EC and Law Ministry, had taken opinions from all sections before recommending the NRI voting issue last year.
