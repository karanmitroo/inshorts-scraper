Addressing BJP workers in Uttar Pradesh, CM Yogi Adityanath called Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls "rehearsal" to the 2019 General Elections. Asking workers to focus on the bypolls, he urged them to also ensure that BJP wins all 85 seats in the 2019 polls. The two seats became vacant after CM Yogi and Deputy CM KP Maurya joined UP Legislative Council.
