Backing the ongoing protests by jewellers, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday termed the 1% excise duty on non-silver jewellery an "assassination attempt" on traders by the Centre. He alleged that it was being imposed to benefit the big industrialists. Criticising the 'Make in India' initiative, Gandhi said it was a "babbar sher" that wants to "strangulate" small businesses.
