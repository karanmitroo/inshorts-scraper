Congress' Mumbai unit President Sanjay Nirupam on Monday claimed that BJP's victory in Gujarat Assembly elections is not due to the people but because of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). "The entire Gujarat was against BJP and empty chairs could be seen during the Prime Minister's poll rallies," Nirupam added. He also called it a "big threat to Indian democracy".
