BJP on Tuesday pressed for a Privilege Motion against Congress party's Chief Whip Jyotiraditya Scindia for "defamatory" remarks against Minister Bandaru Dattatreya. BJP accused Scindia of "misleading" the House by alleging that the Minister called Dalit student Rohith Vemula "anti-national, casteist and extremist". Earlier, Congress had moved a Privilege Motion against HRD Minister Smriti Irani.
