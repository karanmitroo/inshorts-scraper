Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath joined the BJP's Jan Raksha Yatra which will pass through 11 of the 14 districts in Kerala, a day after party President Amit Shah launched the march. "I'm a worker of the BJP. If political killings happen under the political patronage, then we have to make people aware," Adityanath said ahead of his 15-km padyatra.
