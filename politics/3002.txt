BJP President Amit Shah on Monday accused CM Akhilesh Yadav of transforming Uttar Pradesh into the "number one state" in terms of murder, loot, and crime against women. He also said that if his party forms the government in Uttar Pradesh, all slaughter houses would be closed, and "instead of streams of blood, streams of milk and ghee would flow".
