Daman Singh, daughter of ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has voluntarily given up her Special Protection Group (SPG) cover. She said, “My sister Upinder has also asked for SPG's removal... the government is in the process of doing it.” The special security service, which they were availing for nearly a decade, has been replaced by a mandatory Delhi Police cover.
