BJP MP Vinay Katiyar on Monday said that he will raise the Ayodhya Ram temple issue vigorously and find a solution through legal passage. "If needed, we'll also take further steps," said Katiyar who had recently made a sexist remark against Priyanka Gandhi. Katiyar had claimed in January that the Ram temple movement was started by him 30 years ago.
