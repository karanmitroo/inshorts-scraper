The by-poll for the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat on Sunday recorded a turnout of 6.5%, state's Chief Electoral Officer Shantanu said. This is the worst turnout for an election in the state in the last 30 years. Notably, the by-poll was held amid large-scale violence which resulted in the death of six civilians, while over 100 security personnel were injured.
