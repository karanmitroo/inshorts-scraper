Addressing the public on Independence Day, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti blamed the leadership of the country for the state's situation. "People of J&K aren't bad, nor is India bad. Somewhere mistakes were made with regard to elections. The leadership of the country— from Jawahar Lal Nehru till date— and the parties, it is their mistake," Mufti said.
