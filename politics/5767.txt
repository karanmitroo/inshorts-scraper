Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Tuesday said that there should not be a complete ban on beef as it will make the farmers suffer. Acknowledging that cows are holy for Hindus, Athawale said that after the cattle stops giving milk, farmers sell them and a complete ban will make it economically difficult for them to keep those animals.
