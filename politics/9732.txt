Trinamool Congress Monday comfortably won the Bongaon Lok Sabha and Krishnagunj assembly bypolls of West Bengal. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee congratulated the people saying, â€œI salute them. This is a miracle result." The win comes despite recent blows to the party, like Saradha scam and general secretary Mukul Roy's reluctance to lead from the front.
