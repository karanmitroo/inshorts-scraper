A woman has been allegedly raped by a Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader on Tuesday in the Kalabani Gram Panchayat office of West Bengal's Purulia district. The TMC President of the area and two others have been arrested in the case. A similar case was reported in November where a senior leader of TMC was arrested for raping a newly-wed woman.
