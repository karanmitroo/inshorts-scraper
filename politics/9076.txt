Union Minister VK Singh on Monday reacted to the opposition Congress' demands seeking an answer from PM Narendra Modi on the Lalit Modi controversy. He said that Modi need not react to everything as it is not appropriate and that he will speak when the right time comes. "Those who have to criticise, will do it anyways," VK Singh added.
