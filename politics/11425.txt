Citing its own survey covering 80,000 households out of the total 3.14 lakh in Varanasi, the AAP has said Arvind Kejriwal is trailing behind Narendra Modi by 50,000 votes. Kejriwal's campaign manager Gopal Mohan said, "It's not a small achievement. When we started our campaign, we were trailing by 2 lakh votes. We'll wipe out this deficit in 10 days."
