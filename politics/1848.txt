A journalist was criticised by Twitter users after she shared a morphed image of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath drinking cow urine, on the social media platform. A picture of Adityanath drinking water from a hand pump was used, with the hand pump replaced with a cow. A user also posted the actual image in the comments.
