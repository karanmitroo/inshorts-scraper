Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah has said that it will not be a surprise if Prime Minister Narendra Modi too escapes from India like fraud-accused jeweller Nirav Modi and ex-IPL Chairman Lalit Modi. Alleging that the offences were not possible without the PM's indirect support, Siddaramaiah said the people of the country are "eagerly" waiting for the escape of the next Modi.
