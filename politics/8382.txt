Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said that killing of cows is banned in Kenya too. He added that people in Kenya, in times of famine, drink cow blood to survive but still don’t kill it or eat its meat. Apparently, Kenyans insert a bamboo tube in the animal’s jugular vein and suck blood through it.
