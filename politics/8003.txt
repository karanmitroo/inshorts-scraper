Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's resignation over the CBI raid conducted at the former's office. "If the raid happened on my Principal Secretary, what was the need to come to my office?", Kejriwal questioned. Accusing Modi of misusing the CBI, he added that Modi is still haunted by his loss in Delhi elections.
