While addressing people after launching 'Mahasampark Abhiyan' on Sunday, BJP National President Amit Shah said that it will take 25 years to fulfil the promise of 'achhe din'. "A 5-year government can do nothing to make India the top world power... BJP needs to win all elections for 25 years to take India to the number 1 position," Shah said.
