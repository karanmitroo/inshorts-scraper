Shiv Sena MLA Hemant Patil and his aide on Wednesday reportedly delayed a train for almost an hour as they were given 'side' berths. The group accompanying the two kept pulling the chain. Over 2,000 passengers on the Devgiri Express at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were held up, and two other trains were also delayed.
