Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has warned his party MPs and MLAs against indulging in cockfights during Sankranti. He said those who participate in the gambling sport and damage the party's reputation would not be given a party ticket in the upcoming general elections. Cockfights were banned in the state by the Hyderabad High Court in 2014.
