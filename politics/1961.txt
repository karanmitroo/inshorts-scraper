The Election Commission will hold a live demo of EVMs and voter-verifiable paper audit trails on Saturday at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. The EC will also give a press conference on the "EVM Challenge" hackathon, announcing its date and venue. This comes after the AAP gave an EVM tampering demonstration on a dummy device in Delhi Assembly.
