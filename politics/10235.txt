UP Governor Ram Naik Thursday sparked controversy by saying that Ram temple should be built at the site of Babri Masjid. Nair cited that building a temple at Babri site is the 'wish of Indian citizens' and should be fulfilled as soon as possible. He was named the UP governor in July after Modi govt came to power at Centre.
