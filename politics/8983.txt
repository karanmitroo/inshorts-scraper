Journalist-turned-politician MJ Akbar on Tuesday took oath as a member of the parliament in the Rajya Sabha. The BJP leader had won the Rajya Sabha bypolls from Jharkhand earlier in July this year after defeating Haji Hussain Ansari of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha by 19 votes. His term will end next year.
