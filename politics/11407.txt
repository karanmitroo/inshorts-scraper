Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani Friday claimed Narendra Modi's two emissaries had approached him on Mar-22 for a meeting with him while he was in Delhi for treatment. The two wanted him to meet Modi "for getting commitment for resolution of the Kashmir issue", Geelani stated, adding that he rejected the offer citing Modi's RSS background.
