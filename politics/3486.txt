Congress on Wednesday blamed Modi government for political crisis in Tamil Nadu, stating it is trying to "play dirty game" as BJP has no hold in the state. "They think this is an opportunity to be utilised," said Congress leader S Thirunavukkarasar. He further said the only solution to the crisis is to dissolve the House and hold fresh election.
