Addressing a rally in Muzaffarnagar, BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday asserted that if voted to power, her government would no longer build statues, monuments and museums in Uttar Pradesh. "This time I will put all my efforts in ensuring the safety, security and development of the state," she added. Mayawati had earlier faced flak for constructing multiple statues.
