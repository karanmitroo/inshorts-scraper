BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said Muslims should "relocate" to countries where Shariat law is in force. "The country will be run according to the Constitution and the legal system and not according to Shariat law," he added. This comes after All India Muslim Personal Law Board alleged attempts being made to interfere with the Shariat law through courts.
