Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has no public character, in his reply to the defamation suit filed by the latter. Kejriwal said, "The plaintiff's claim that he enjoys and in fact possesses high public character is a totally frivolous and unsustainable claim... Indian democracy has never accepted his claim of public character."
