Former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, whose bail in connection to a murder case was cancelled by the Supreme Court on Friday, said that his supporters will reply to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in the next elections. After the SC's verdict, Shahabuddin surrendered in the court and said that he was a law-abiding person and therefore he came to surrender.
