Congress leader Vijay Singla on Monday said that Punjab's SAD government should own up responsibility for the prevailing drug menace in the state. “[O]ur leader Rahul Gandhiji raised this issue three years back… at that time this government made a joke out of it," he said. Singla added that if the menace is not controlled, it will ‘ruin’ Punjab.
