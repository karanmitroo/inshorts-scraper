BJP leaders Mahesh Sharma and Shahnawaz Hussain were on Friday mocked on Twitter after they posted their 'greetings' and 'wishes' to people on account of Good Friday. Both the leaders later deleted their tweets after they went on to draw flak online. Notably, Good Friday is a Christian religious holiday commemorating the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ.
