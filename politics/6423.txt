Uttar Pradesh Congress general secretary Umesh Pandit on Thursday said that Varun Gandhi, BJP MP from Sultanpur, is a right man associated with a wrong political party. "Varun Gandhi has the potential to revive the Congress in UP. After all, he is a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family and the son of Sanjay Gandhi," Pandit added.
