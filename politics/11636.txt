BJP expelled party veteran Jaswant Singh, who is contesting as an Independent from Barmer, for six years on Saturday. This is the second time in five years that Singh was expelled from BJP. In 2009, he had been expelled for his controversial book praising Pakistan founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah. However, he was taken back in June 2010.
