PM Narendra Modi on Monday said that Congress is entrapped in Blue Whale Challenge and will see the final episode on December 18, the day of Gujarat Assembly election results. The remarks were in response to Congress' allegations that the EVMs being used in the elections were hacked by connecting them to Bluetooth devices.
