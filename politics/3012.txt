Airports along with all exit points across Uttar Pradesh were put on high alert to avoid rape accused Samajwadi Party leader and state Minister Gayatri Prajapati from escaping the country. BJP President Amit Shah had earlier slammed the Akhilesh Yadav-led government for not doing enough to arrest Prajapati. Notably, the Supreme Court had ordered registration of an FIR against Prajapati.
