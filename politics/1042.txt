Around 40 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party workers were detained on Wednesday for allegedly protesting despite being denied police permission in Mumbai's Dadar. The workers were protesting against the government over its failure to evict illegal hawkers outside railways stations. Earlier, around 25 MNS workers had vandalised stalls outside the railway stations in Thane and Kalyan.
