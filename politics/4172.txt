Former Election Commission (EC) chief SY Quraishi on Monday said that Samajwadi Party's election symbol 'cycle' may be frozen and the party's two factions may be given ad hoc names and symbols. This comes after two factions of the party reportedly staked a claim at the party's symbol. It normally takes EC 3-4 months to make such changes, Qureshi added.
