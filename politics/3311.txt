Hailing the Supreme Court verdict convicting ex-AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala in disproportionate assets case, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday said, "this is a huge encouragement for me from the highest court of the land". Notably, Swamy had filed the first complaint in connection with the case in 1996. "We have fought for this for 20 years," he added.
