PM Narendra Modi on Thursday slammed the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh for running a "drug-mafia raj" in the state. Addressing a rally in Kangra, he criticised the CM Virbhadra Singh-government over the growing abuse of drugs. He promised definitive action against the drug mafia if BJP was voted to power in the poll-bound state.
