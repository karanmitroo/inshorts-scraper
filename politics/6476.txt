Several Kashmiri separatist groups came out together on Wednesday to launch a campaign against the state government's purported move to set up townships for Kashmiri Pandits and Sainik colonies. The separatists called J&K government's stance on the issue as "vague, ambiguous and confusing". However, CM Mehbooba Mufti had earlier said no such townships were being set up.
