In an insensitive comment, TMC MP Tapas Pal has threatened to kill opposition CPM workers and have their women raped if a single ruling party worker was attacked. â€œI will let loose my boys in your homes and they will commit rape," Pal said. He however defended himself saying, "What I said was I will tell my workers to 'raid'."
