The BJP on Thursday backed Union Minister VK Singh's 'dog' remark about the killing of two Dalit kids in Faridabad. "He (Singh) has said he was misquoted. He never meant what was in fact showed in the media", party spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Singh had reportedly said, "If someone throws stones at a dog, the government is not responsible".
