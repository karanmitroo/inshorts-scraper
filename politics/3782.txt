Tamil Nadu's ruling AIADMK party leader M Thambidurai has slammed the Centre alleging that it delayed the Jallikattu issue. Adding that the bull-taming sport was in the concurrent list, Thambidurai alleged that late TN CM Jayalalithaa also stressed on it but Centre omitted her request. DMK also failed in this which is why we are at this juncture, he added.
