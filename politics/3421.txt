Tamil Nadu's interim CM O Panneerselvam has said late CM Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence, where AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan stays now, should be declared a memorial. By accommodating persons who were expelled in 2011 by Jayalalithaa from her residence, Sasikala had "betrayed" Amma, Panneerselvam added. "This is the first step of the struggle to declare it a memorial," he said.
