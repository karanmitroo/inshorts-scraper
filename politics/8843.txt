The Madras High Court on Monday cancelled former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maranâ€™s interim anticipatory bail granted on June 30 and directed him to surrender before the CBI within three days. The DMK leader has been accused by the CBI of misusing his office to illicitly construct an underground telecom exchange at his Chennai residence.
