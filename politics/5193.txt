The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, the Bihar Government and the Centre seeking their reply to shift the former from Siwan jail to Tihar jail. Slain journalist Rajdeo Ranjan's widow had filed a plea in the SC seeking to shift Shahabuddin so that witnesses in her husband's murder case are not influenced.
