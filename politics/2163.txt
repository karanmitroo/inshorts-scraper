DMK Working President MK Stalin on Sunday said that the Centre is using agencies like IT department, enforcement directorate and CBI 'selectively' against AIADMK leaders for its own political benefits. "The BJP government has not invested even one percent on trying to solve the real problems facing the people of Tamil Nadu," Stalin added.
