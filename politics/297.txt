Addressing the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi over his elevation as Congress President. "In December, did we witness an 'election' or coronation for the post," the PM asked. He further said "one youngster" had raised his voice against Gandhi's elevation, without taking Congress leader Shehzad Poonawalla's name.
