The Assam Police has registered a case against West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for allegedly making inflammatory remarks over the updating of the National Register of Citizens in the northeastern state. Alleging that it was a conspiracy to drive out Bengali-speaking people from Assam, Mamata had said, "If there is trouble in Assam, there will be trouble in Bengal."
