Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, while addressing a joint rally with Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav, said 'SCAM' for him stands for Seva (service), Courage, Ability, and Modesty. This comes in response to PM Narendra Modi's comment that 'SCAM' stands for the Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh, and Mayawati. "The person who is involved in scams sees scams everywhere," Gandhi added.
