Samajwadi Party state chief Shivpal Yadav on Wednesday expelled Uttar Pradesh Minister Pawan Pandey from the party for six years for allegedly slapping MLC Ashu Malik. Addressing the media, Shivpal said indiscipline would not be tolerated within the party. "We have written a letter to UP CM to sack Pawan Pandey of the Ministerial position," he added.
