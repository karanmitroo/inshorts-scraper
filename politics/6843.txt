Addressing a rally in poll-bound Tamil Nadu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that no matter how big somebody is, action would be taken against them if involved in the AgustaWestland helicopter scam. "I have never seen Italy, and don't even know anyone there... but if the Italian authorities made them accused what could I do?" Modi said.
