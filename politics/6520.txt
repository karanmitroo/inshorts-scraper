The Election Commission has issued a show cause notice to Jammu & Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti for allegedly violating the model code of conduct ahead of Anantnag bypolls. EC officials said objections were raised when Mufti violated rules by coming to file her nomination for the upcoming bypolls in a car that had the national and state flags.
