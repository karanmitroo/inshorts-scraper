Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who is undergoing treatment in Bengaluru, on Saturday said he is completely fine as his sugar level is under control and his chronic cough has also been treated. "I fell ill while campaigning for Punjab Assembly election. The sugar levels went too high and I was taking heavy dosages of insulin," he said via video message.
