Mohammed Ghosi, an SP leader from Maharashtra, has written a letter to party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav requesting him to nominate Yakub Memon's widow Raheen as a Rajya Sabha MP. Raheen was arrested along with Yakub in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case and remained in jail for years before being released. Ghosi said that “she might have suffered a lot.”
