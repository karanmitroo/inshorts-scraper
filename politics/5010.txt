West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday termed the invalidation of old ₹500, ₹1,000 notes as a "dangerous, disastrous, and draconian decision". Adding that this is "betrayal" to people, Banerjee questioned the move saying only 1% people have black money, so why are the other 99% being harassed? "This is anti-people. This is a dictatorship," she added.
