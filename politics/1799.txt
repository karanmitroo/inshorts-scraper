Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar said that he expected the BJP-led NDA to field "someone like LK Advani or Murli Manohar Joshi" for the presidential election. The NDA must have had some other criteria because of which they did not pick Advani or Joshi who is a scholar, has a PhD degree and was a university professor, he added.
