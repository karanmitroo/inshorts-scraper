Speaking at the launch of 'Transcendence', a book written by former President Abdul Kalam, BJP president Amit Shah said on Sunday that Hinduism has solution to every problem in the world. The book is about Kalam’s experiences with Pramukh Swami, head of Bochasanwasi Akshar Purshottam Sanstha (BAPS) — a Swaminarayan sect — and BAPS’ services to society.
