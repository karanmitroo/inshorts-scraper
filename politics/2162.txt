Amanmani Tripathi, who is an independent MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Nautanwa and is also accused of murdering his wife, has said that he will join BJP if he will be asked to do so. Tripathi, who met UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, said he considers the latter as his "guardian". Notably, Tripathi's parents were convicted in another murder case.
