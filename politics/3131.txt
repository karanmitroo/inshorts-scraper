After Congress leader Sheila Dikshit said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi lacks maturity, BJP President Amit Shah on Friday questioned why was he still being ‘forced’ into Uttar Pradesh politics. Further, Shah said the whole country acknowledged the "fact" which Dikshit had stated. Earlier, the ex-Delhi CM said Rahul Gandhi should be given more time as he isn't mature yet.
