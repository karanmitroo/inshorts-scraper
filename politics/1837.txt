Congress today called BJP the biggest non-performing asset (NPA) while accusing the NDA government of ruining India's economy. Congress Working Committee (CWC) member Anil Shastri said, "Economic growth has slowed down sharply, driven mainly by demonetisation. GDP decelerated at 6.1% during January-March 2017." The Congress leader further termed the Centre's Make in India campaign a 'flop'.
