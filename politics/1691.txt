Asserting his 'Hindu identity', Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday said, "My name is Sidda Rama. I am also a Hindu and BJP workers are not the only Hindus." He also slammed the BJP for blowing up minor issues out of proportion to cause communal tension in Karnataka ahead of the upcoming Assembly Elections.
