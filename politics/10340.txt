Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi's controversial statements may lead to his removal. The speculation gained strength when Manjhi said his days in office were numbered as his detractors in the party were making every effort to remove him from the post. "I know efforts are on to remove me, I may or may not continue till November end," he said.
