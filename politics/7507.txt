Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday alleged that PM Narendra Modi single-handedly destroyed six years of hard work by the UPA regime. "The Prime Minister cannot run the country only on his opinion. The country is not the PM and the PM is not the country," added Gandhi. He also questioned Modi for his surprise visit to Pakistan.
