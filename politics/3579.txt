Ahead of UP Assembly election, BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has said the situation in western UP is similar to Kashmir in 1990 when exodus of Hindus had taken place in the Valley. "If India's majority, Hindus, are tortured, isn't it an issue? But if a thorn pricks the foot of someone from the minority, it becomes an issue," he added.
