Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law and businessman Robert Vadra took to Facebook to claim that the demonetisation move is 'completely unplanned' and said that the government and the RBI are clueless. "For how long and how much more will the Government experiment on us, to try and prove itself correct? ... Sad to see people suffering," Vadra said.
