Odisha Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy on Sunday said that farmers commit suicides only when the Assembly is in session. "Once the session is over, are such incidents reported?" he asked. "Odia farmers live with dignity. No farmer has committed suicide even in difficult times like the famine in 1866 or the Super Cyclone in 1999," he added.
