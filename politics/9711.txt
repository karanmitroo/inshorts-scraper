The AAP leaders are willing to join Anna Hazare's protest against amendments in the Land Acquistion Act, as the Gandhian activist goes on to hold a 2-day dharna (Feb 23-24) at the Jantar Mantar. A party spokesperson said that the leaders will join if Anna allows them to, as he persists on not sharing the dais with any political party.
