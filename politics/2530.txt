YSR Congress Party President Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday mocked Andhra Pradesh Minister K Atchannaidu's English, to which the latter retorted. "It's not Common Effect Treatment plant, but Common Effluent Treatment plant. Learn something sir," Reddy corrected Atchannaidu. "I sat on the mud and studied in a government school. There are differences between you and me," Atchannaidu responded.
