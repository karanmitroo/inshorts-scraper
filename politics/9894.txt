BJP president Amit Shah said Thursday that his party will win the Delhi legislative assembly elections with two-third majority. Shah said, "Our agenda is to move from a simple majority to two-thirds majority and for that I am confident that Kiran Bedi's image... of someone who has been fighting against corruption and crime... would help."
