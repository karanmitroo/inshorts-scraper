At a rally in Mumbai, MNS chief Raj Thackeray announced on Saturday that he will contest this year's Assembly polls. The MNS chief will be the first member of the Thackeray family to contest an election. Neither Shiv Sena patriarch late Balasaheb Thackeray nor his son and current Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray have ever contested election.
