Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel said that if the Congress feels it can win the Gujarat poll by joining hands with Pakistan-based terrorists like Hafiz Saeed, it would invite them without hesitation. "As the BJP is practising ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, the Congress is continuing to indulge in the ‘Divide and Rule’ policy which existed during colonial rule," Patel added.
