The farewell dinner hosted for outgoing PM Manmohan Singh by Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday was attended by several party leaders except Rahul Gandhi, which raised eyebrows. PMO sources said that Rahul met Singh on Saturday to say that he won't be in town. A memento was presented to Singh with signatures of top Congress leaders and Union ministers.
