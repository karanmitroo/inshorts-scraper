Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday alleged that the Congress is trying to confuse the common man over the Centre's demonetisation move. "Congress is in panic over overwhelming support by people to Prime Minister's demonetisation move. Rahul Gandhi's smile and body language indicated that there is not much of black money in country because money has come back," he said.
