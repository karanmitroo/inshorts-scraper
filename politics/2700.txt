Punjab Cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday said he cannot be a transporter like SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal and said he appears on TV to earn money in order to run his family and meet expenditure. "I cannot be corrupt to mint money. I can't ditch my people who voted me to power," he added.
