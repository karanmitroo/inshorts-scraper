Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, on Wednesday, blamed ex-finance minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram, for the circulation of fake currency in India. "He (Chidambaram)n gave the contract for printing currency to a British company, De La Rue, and the same company was also printing currency for Pakistan. So, it became easy for Pakistan to get currency papers," Swamy said.
