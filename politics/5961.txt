Ahead of the 2017 elections in Uttar Pradesh, four sitting MLAs, including one from BJP and three expelled from Congress, have joined the BSP. A former BSP MLA who had joined BJP before the 2012 Assembly polls also returned to the party. Notably, the three Congress MLAs were expelled from the party for cross-voting in the recent Rajya Sabha elections.
