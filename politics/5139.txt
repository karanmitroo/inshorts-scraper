Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was on Wednesday barred from meeting the family of the ex-serviceman, who committed suicide over the One Rank One Pension scheme, in the RML hospital. "Why I am not being allowed to meet them? What new India is this," Gandhi asked the police officers manning the gate of the hospital in Delhi.
