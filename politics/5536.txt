Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday said that his recently launched front â€˜Aawaz-e-Punjab' will not be a political party, but a forum that welcomes any alliance for the betterment of Punjab. Before forming his own outfit, the former BJP MP was reportedly in talks with the Aam Aadmi Party, but the negotiations between the two apparently failed.
