The Central Information Commission (CIC) on Friday directed Delhi University and Gujarat University to provide information on degrees earned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Kejriwal had written to the CIC with regard to making the information about PM Modi's educational qualifications public. Both universities earlier rejected RTIs about the information.
