JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav has allegedly received a threat letter from a right wing group, warning him against interfering in Bihar politics and supporting 'anti-national' forces. The letter reportedly warned him that he should not speak against the Bihar government and Hindu interests. Notably, Yadav was against his party's decision to break the 'grand alliance' and join the NDA.
