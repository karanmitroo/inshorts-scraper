BJP leader Sushil Modi has accused the Bihar government of failing miserably in controlling the communal tension prevailing in over 12 districts, following the festivals of Dussehra and Muharram. He called for strict action against officials who could not manage communal tensions. The party demanded the government to set up an all-party committee to probe these incidents from last week.
