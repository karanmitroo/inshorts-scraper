All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Akbaruddin Owaisi on Sunday sparked a controversy by dubbing PM Narendra Modi as a "zalim (tyrant)" and "shaitan (devil)". While speaking at an election meeting in Kishanganj district of Bihar, Owaisi said, "There is a section, including me, who considers no one other than Modi responsible for Gujarat riots of 2002".
