BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao on Saturday said that the BJP decided to support the JD(U) in Bihar as the Nitish Kumar-led party was not able to deliver good governance in alliance with the RJD. "People gave their verdict...for good governance. They did not give their verdict for corruption and unnecessary interference in administration," Rao added.
