Activist Irom Chanu Sharmila, who has been on a fast-unto-death for the last 10 years, Friday said that she had rejected Manipur CM Okram Ibobi Singh's offer to join the Congress. "If I am allowed to vote, I will cast my vote in favour of the AAP," she added. Notably, the activist had also rejected AAP's offer last month.
