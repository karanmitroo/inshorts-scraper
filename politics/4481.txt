Following the demise of AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa, senior leaders of the party have pleaded the late CM's close aide Sasikala Natarajan to take up the vacant General Secretary post. Adding that 'Chinnamma' Sasikala had worked as Amma's conscience, AIADMK's spokesperson C Ponnaiyan said, "It is the desire of entire party that Chinnamma should become General Secretary."
