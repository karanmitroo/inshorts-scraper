Congress Party members led by Sonia Gandhi walked out from the Lok Sabha today as the Ishrat Jahan case was being discussed. BJP member Nishikant Dubey had alleged that the Home Ministry's document on the case was modified by Congress member P Chidambaram to say there was no proof of Jahan's links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba.
