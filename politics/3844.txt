BJP Punjab President and Union Minister Vijay Sampla has reportedly offered to resign from both the posts over ticket distribution in the poll-bound state. As per a report, Sampla is unhappy with BJP's decision to field Som Prakash from the Phagwara constituency as he wanted his candidate to contest from there. Sampla sent his resignation to BJP chief Amit Shah.
