Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday questioned the Padma Vibhushan announced for NCP leader Sharad Pawar, saying, "I am wondering if it is given as part of Gurudakshina." He further asked, "Is 'Dakshina' given in the form of awards also?" This comes after Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut hailed the Centre's move to honour Pawar.
