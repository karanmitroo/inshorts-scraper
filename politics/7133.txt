DMDK Chief Vijayakanth on Tuesday expelled ten senior party functionaries, including three MLAs, after they revolted against his decision to align with the People's Welfare Front (PWF) for Tamil Nadu's assembly polls. This came after the MLAs alleged that the decision to join PWF was taken against the "wishes of 95% of party workers", who favoured a tie-up with DMK.
