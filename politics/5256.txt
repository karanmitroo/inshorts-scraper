A petition was filed on Friday in Madras HC to forbear the Election Commission from assigning registered symbols to AIADMK candidate Senthil Balaji and DMK nominee KC Palanisamy in the November 19 assembly by-election to Aravakurichi constituency. The petitioner alleged the constituency's elections were cancelled during the assembly polls in May due to corrupt practices adopted by the candidates.
