A day after his meeting with PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti in Srinagar, BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav today said both parties were "positive" about continuing their alliance in Jammu and Kashmir. However, he rejected a media report claiming BJP had agreed to remove AFSPA from some areas of Kashmir on a trial basis, saying it was not discussed with Mufti.
