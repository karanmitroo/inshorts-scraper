BJP MLA Raj Purohit has demanded that the Maharashtra government make the singing of 'Vande Mataram' compulsory in educational institutions in the state. In response, SP MLA Abu Azmi said no true Muslim will sing it as Islam doesn't permit it. Following this, Shiv Sena minister Diwakar Rawat said those who opposed the demand must shift to Pakistan.
