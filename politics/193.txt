The Gujarat High Court has restored a gag order against The Wire, prohibiting it from reporting on the businesses of BJP President Amit Shah's son Jay Shah. Earlier, a lower court had partially lifted the gag order in the defamation case filed by Jay Shah. The Wire reported that Jay Shah's business turnover increased 16,000 times after PM Modi's election.
