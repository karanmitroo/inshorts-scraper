AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi on Friday lashed out at  Yogi Adityanath over his "love jihad" comments saying that people who are in love cannot be called "jihadis". â€œ... If you can make atrocious comments, then be prepared to hear the same degree of comments from us as well," warned Owaisi in Mumbai at a gathering of the minority community.
