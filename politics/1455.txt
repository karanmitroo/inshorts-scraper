UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that open defecation and lack of proper sanitation were the main reasons behind recent deaths of over 60 children suffering from encephalitis in the state-run Gorakhpur hospital. He added that encephalitis had been a challenge since 1978. This comes after UP government refuted disruption of oxygen supply as the reason for the deaths.
