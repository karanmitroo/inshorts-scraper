Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was on Sunday shown black flags by the Congress' women workers as his convoy came out of the Amritsar airport to campaign for the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls. The protestors alleged that AAP MLAs were involved in outraging the modesty of women and the leader of such a party will not be tolerated in Punjab.
