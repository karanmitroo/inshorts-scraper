Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Monday said there was a need for a stringent law like Sharia (Islamic) to check serious crimes against women and children. Calling such incidents an outcome of collapsed law and order situation, Thackeray said, "The hands and legs of those who rape and kill minors and women should be cut off."
