The Election Commission on Wednesday advanced the Mizoram Assembly Election dates to November 25 from December 04. Also, the counting will now take place on December-9 instead of December-8. Various NGO's, political and religious parties have requested for a date change as the previous dates were coinciding with Presbyterian Church's highest decision-making conference - the Synod (from Dec-3 to Dec-8).
