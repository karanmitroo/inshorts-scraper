Sri Ram Sena on Thursday accused the BJP of following 'pseudo Hinduism' after the right-wing Hindu group chief Pramod Mutalik's ban on entry into Goa was extended by the State government. The members of the group staged a demonstration in Hubballi, Karnataka and raised slogans against the BJP. They further accused the Goa government of violating Mutalik's Constitutional rights.
