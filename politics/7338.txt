Reacting to RSS Joint General Secretary Dattatreya Hosabale's comment on homosexuality, Congress leader Manish Tewari said on Friday that he hopes the organisation stands firm on its statement and does not retract its views. Notably, Hosabale had recently said that homosexuality was not a crime, as long as it did not affect the lives of others.
