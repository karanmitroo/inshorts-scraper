The recently concluded Lok Sabha polls was the most expensive one, entailing a cost of Rs 3426 crore to the national exchequer. The expenses saw a substantial jump of 131% over those incurred in 2009. The Election Commission attributed the expense rise to inflation, besides a series of measures undertaken to increase voting figures for the rise in poll expenditure.
