Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday staged a walkout from the Rajya Sabha, alleging that the central government was indulging in "politics of vendetta". TMC National Spokesperson Derek O'Brien claimed that the government was harassing the party members for opposing demonetisation. "This is a very serious issue. We may have political differences on issues but this is not done," he added.
