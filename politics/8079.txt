During a discussion on a bill to settle high-value disputes, AIADMK's Lok Sabha member K Kamaraj said that a lot of mistakes had crept into bills being presented in the House which made it difficult to understand them completely. Asking Union Law Minister Sadananda Gowda to ensure error-free bills, Kamraj suggested that proposed amendments should be printed in color.
