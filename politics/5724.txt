The AAP has distanced itself from its leader Ashutosh’s remarks on the controversy around ex-Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar. “Whatever Sandeep Kumar did cannot be defended. And, what all Ashutosh said is his own opinion,” said AAP leader Manish Sisodia. In his column, Ashutosh had compared Kumar’s act with the personal lives of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
