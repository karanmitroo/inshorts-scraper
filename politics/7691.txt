Ram Vilas Vedanti, a former BJP MP and member of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas on Friday attacked PM Narendra Modi over the delay in construction of the Ram temple during a VHP event in Allahabad. "He can take selfie at the biggest mosque of Arabs. Then why doesn’t he visit Ayodhya and takes a selfie with Ramlala Darbar?” Vedanti asked.
