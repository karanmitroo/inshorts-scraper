A Dalit family from Mau, Uttar Pradesh, had to reportedly borrow flour and vegetables to host Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and party's UP President Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday for a meal. "Rahul Gandhi was like a God to us so we had to prepare no matter what. Will repay the debt somehow," said one of the family members.
