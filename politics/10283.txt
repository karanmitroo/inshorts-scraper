Facing flak for her abusive remarks, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti Tuesday apologised in Parliament. The Congress, however, has demanded her resignation as her apology was "too little too late". The "objectionable" language used by Jyoti has created tension at a time when there have been communal riots, the Congress claimed. Leaders of all political parties had sought an apology from her.
