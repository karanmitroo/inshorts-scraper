A day after Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal ordered the state anti-corruption branch to order FIR in connection with the gas pricing issue, a case was filed on Wednesday. However, unlike the statement given by Kejriwal on Tuesday, the FIR did not name RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani and Union Petroleum Minister Veerappa Moily.
