Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has kicked up another controversy saying that it was "Muslim soldiers" who fought for India's victory in the 1999 Kargil war. At an election rally in Ghaziabad on Monday night, Khan added that no one can guard the country's borders better than those from the Muslim community.
