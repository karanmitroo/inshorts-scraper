Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said, "All asanas (postures) in Surya Namaskar, pranayama are similar to the namaz done by our Muslim brothers." Claiming that nobody has ever tried to bring Surya Namaskar and Namaz together, Adityanath said, "A few people were interested only in 'bhoga' (benefits), not Yoga."
