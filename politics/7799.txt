Union Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Monday that if the Founder-President of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) NT Rama Rao does not deserve a Bharat Ratna, then nobody does. Paying tribute on his 20th death anniversary, Raju described the former Andhra CM as a 'simple' and 'multi-faceted person'. TDP had earlier demanded conferring Bharat Ratna on Rao.
