Reacting to the inclusion of Priyanka Gandhiâ€™s name in the star campaigners' list of the Congress for the UP polls, BJP MP Vinay Katiyar on Wednesday said his party has prettier women than Priyanka. "Priyanka is not even beautiful as people publicise. We have more beautiful women than her like Smriti Irani who can pull more crowd," he added.
