Tamil Nadu's DMK chief M Karunanidhi has named his son MK Stalin as his political heir, ending years of uncertainty over the successor of the 92-year-old leader. Karunanidhi's elder son MK Alagiri had left the party after Karunanidhi did not allot any important task to him during the last state election that was won by a landslide by Jayalalitha's AIADMK.
