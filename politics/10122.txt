Ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) held protest rallies in Kolkata on Wednesday and burnt symbolic copies of the Centre's land ordinance, describing it as "black". While carrying out protest rallies, TMC workers carried placards which read "We won't accept the black land ordinance of the central government". Police said that the programme was carried out peacefully.
