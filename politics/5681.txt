Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was mobbed by BJP's women workers at the New Delhi railway station as he departed for Punjab on Thursday. They urged Kejriwal to speak on allegations regarding party leaders ‘exploiting’ women in return for tickets in Punjab. Kejriwal also encountered protests in Ludhiana, where Congress' women members questioned him over the Sandeep Kumar sex scandal.
