After BJP's landslide victory in UP, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad said on Saturday that the vote was for the "nationalist powers" which will pave the way for the Ram Temple's construction in Ayodhya. "We believed earlier too that the BJP will fulfill the demand (for a temple)...We now expect the BJP to do it at the earliest," it said.
