All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said that rather than asking people to boycott Chinese products, the RSS should ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut bilateral ties with China. He also pointed out that the BCCI and IPL have Chinese sponsors, and asked whether the BJP-led Centre will ask them to do away with those.
