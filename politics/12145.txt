Aam Aadmi Party Monday distanced itself from the views of its senior leader Prashant Bhushan that a referendum should be carried out in Kashmir to decide on deployment of the Army to deal with security threats. CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “Deployment of the Army within the country should be decided on the basis of internal security threat.”
