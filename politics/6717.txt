Madhya Pradesh's CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan today likened PM Narendra Modi to Mahatma Gandhi. “First, the world would keenly listen to everything Mahatma Gandhi said. Today, the world listens to Modiji,” Chouhan said. BJP chief Amit Shah also compared PM's call to give up LPG-subsidy to former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri's appeal to give up one meal during food shortage.
