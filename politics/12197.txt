Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who has of late been talking about corruption, on Friday disapproved the decision of the Congress government in Maharashtra to reject a judicial commission's report on the Adarsh scam and said it should be reconsidered. Maharashtra government last week rejected the report that indicted several politicians including three former CMs for "blatant violations" of statutory provisions.
