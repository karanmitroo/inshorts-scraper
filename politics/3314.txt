After BJP denied Irom Sharmila's claim that it offered her ₹36 crore to contest polls, the Manipur activist revealed that BJP morcha convenor Surbinoy had offered her the money. She said that Surbinoy had told her that she would need around ₹36 crore to contest the election, and in case she didn't have it, the Centre would "sanction" it.
