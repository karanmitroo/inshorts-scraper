Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has apologised to the barber community after he made an analogy about their profession to target the previous Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government over incomplete projects. The previous government left the work incomplete just like a barber shaves half beard of one man and half of another man's hair to prevent customers from leaving, Fadnavis had said.
