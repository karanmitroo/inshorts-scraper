The BJP on Thursday said that the AAP has become synonymous with “misusing public money” and “corruption”. The comment comes ahead of the Election Commission’s hearing of 21 AAP legislators over being made Parliamentary Secretaries. Alleging that public money has been misused in the case, the BJP said, “There are seven ministers... you have made 21 Parliamentary Secretaries for them".
