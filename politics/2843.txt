Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, along with nine non-BJP MLAs, met Governor Mridula Sinha on Sunday to stake claim to form Goa's government. This comes after three MLAs each from Goa Forward Party and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, and three independent MLAs extended support to Parrikar. BJP had won 13 seats in Goa and needed eight MLAs' support to form the government.
