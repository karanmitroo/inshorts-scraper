Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala on Tuesday said that the BJP should help resolve the Supreme Court controversy and not "muddle and polarise" the issue. Accusing the BJP of attacking the judiciary through RSS functionaries, he said, "All the 'Nation' wants is the issues raised by the senior-most judges to be resolved, but for which 'democracy' is in peril."
