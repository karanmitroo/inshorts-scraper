A Congress worker has shared a video, comparing two of Arnab Goswami's debates on the beef issue. In one debate, he is seen ranting against the recent beef protests, while in the other, he is seen slamming the government over the beef ban. "A journalist with dead morals & conscience. Although, its futile to Expose the Exposed," the worker wrote.
