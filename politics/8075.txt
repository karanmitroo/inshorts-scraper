A day after a Delhi court asked Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi to present themselves with regards to the National Herald case, both houses of Parliament were disrupted repeatedly and adjourned on Tuesday following Congress protests. Congress leaders alleged "political vendetta" while BJP hit back saying the protests over a court case were "unfair and undemocratic".
