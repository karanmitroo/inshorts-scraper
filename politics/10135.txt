Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) will protest against Maharashtra government's decision to remove job reservations for Muslims. The party, led by it's president Asaduddin Owaisi, will hold the rally in Beed on Jan-6. MIM condemned the state government's attitude as it is seeking to enable 16% reservations for Marathas but refused to bring an ordinance for continuing reservations for Muslims.
