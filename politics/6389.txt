Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the FIR against his government in the â‚¹400-crore water tanker scam was filed at Prime Minister Modi's behest. He dared Modi to lodge "as many FIRs and get as many CBI raids conducted". This comes after the Delhi ACB lodged FIRs against the governments led by former CM Sheila Dikshit and AAP.
