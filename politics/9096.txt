Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday accused the Centre of harassing the AAP government in Delhi. "It never happened in the history... especially after getting such a huge mandate. Everywhere people are saying that Narendra Modi isn't letting Kejriwal work," he said. "Even the Congress hadn't harassed the BJP when it was in power in Delhi," he added.
