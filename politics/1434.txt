Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who fell sick while attending an Independence Day event on Tuesday, later tweeted, "Perfectly fine now with 2 glasses of nimbu-pani (lemonade)." He further tweeted, "Should have had adequate water for parade in sunny humid conditions. Felt bit dehydrated. Attending rest of days programs. Must tell all you kids out there to drink adequate water."
