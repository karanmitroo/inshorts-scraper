Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday said his party is capable of winning on its own and doesn't require a coalition. His statement came a day after his son and party President Akhilesh Yadav said he's ready for any anti-BJP alliance. Notably, Akhilesh had formed an alliance with Congress for the UP elections which was opposed by Mulayam.
