Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Thursday said that Arun Jaitley would not be in the position he is currently in, had Sinha himself been a job applicant. This comes after Arun Jaitley apparently described Sinha as a "job applicant at 80", after the former Finance Minister blamed Jaitley for the "mess" in the economy.
