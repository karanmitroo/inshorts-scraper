Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot has said that he will not wear a 'Rajasthani safa (turban)' till his party comes to power in the state. Pilot revealed that it was a vow he took after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, in which BJP won all 25 seats in the state and Congress could not manage even one seat.
