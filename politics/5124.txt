Following the arrest of his personal assistant over espionage charges, SP MP Munawwar Saleem on Saturday said that he will kill himself along with his family if any links with Pakistan were found against him. "My life is an open book...I can't even dream of having any association with Pakistan, ISI or any other anti-national element," he asserted.
