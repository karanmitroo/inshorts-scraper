The Shiv Sena on Wednesday criticised the BJP for imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, claiming the party "strangulated democracy". Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said, "The BJP used nine rebel Congress MLAs to bring instability in state government... It will not be long before all this creates instability and anarchy". The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance was out of "political compulsion", it added.
