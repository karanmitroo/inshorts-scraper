Following its thumping victory in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party's Uttar Pradesh unit Tuesday said it would pose a challenge to the ruling Samajwadi Party in the 2017 assembly elections in the state. "The results of Delhi assembly elections are an indication of the people's dislike for caste and divisive politics," AAP spokesman Vaibhav Maheshwari said.
