External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday slammed Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for meeting the Chinese envoy over the Doklam standoff. "I am very sad that leader of the largest opposition party deemed it proper to meet the Chinese envoy to get information about the standoff rather than approach the Indian leadership," she said in the Rajya Sabha.
