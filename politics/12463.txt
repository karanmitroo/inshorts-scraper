A complaint against Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi was filed with a Mumbai court by Sayyed Abbaz, on Monday, for his remarks "promoting hatred among religions". Rahul, citing intelligence inputs, had said (during an Indore rally) that Pakistan's ISI was approaching Muslim victims of the Muzaffarnagar riots to lure them into terrorism. Rahul's statement was criticized by BJP and other parties.
