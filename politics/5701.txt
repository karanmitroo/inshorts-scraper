The AAP on Tuesday accused the North Delhi Municipal Corporation of exempting ₹25 crore tax on a heritage property owned by Union Sports Minster Vijay Goel. The party claimed that it is an economic burden on the civic body, as the concessions were later extended to 749 other buildings, which amounted to a loss of around ₹2,500 crore.
