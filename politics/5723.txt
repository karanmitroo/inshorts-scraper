Addressing a youth conclave at Lucknow, BJP MP Varun Gandhi praised ex-PM and his great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru for the sacrifices he made in his life. “People tell me Nehru became PM so easily, he lived like a king. Do you know he spent 15 and half years in jail? That amount of time can break a man,” he said.
