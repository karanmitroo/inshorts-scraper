UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's nameplate as Samajwadi Party's national chief was put up below Mulayam Singh Yadav's similar nameplate at the SP national office on Monday. This comes amid an ongoing tussle and an alleged division of SP in two factions. However, Mulayam had clarified that SP is united and he is its chief while Akhilesh is the CM candidate.
