Hailing the Delhi High Court's order to re-open five cases pertaining to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the BJP on Wednesday described the riots as "state-sponsored terror" by Congress on innocent Sikhs of Delhi. BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao added that the re-opening of cases shows the lack of apathy and concern that Congress had for the victims of the riots.
