Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday appealed to the opposition parties to not hinder the passing of the land acquisition bill, saying that deadlock over the bill was adversely affecting rural development. "Political considerations should not come in the way of a solution that would facilitate development of rural areas, and greater prosperity for farmers," the PM said.
