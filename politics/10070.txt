Following Delhi police statement that Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar was murdered, opposition parties like LDF and BJP are demanding resignation of Tharoor. "BJP would even think of social boycott of Tharoor in his constituency if he refuses to step down," party's Thiruvananthapuram president S Suresh said.
