As many as fourteen Congress workers were on Saturday detained by the police for raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his visit to Vadodara. "Congress members... demanded that the newly-inaugurated integrated terminal of Vadodara International Airport be named after Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the ruler of the erstwhile Baroda state," police said.
