The Patna High Court on Wednesday granted bail to former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin in the double murder and kidnapping case which took place 12 years ago. Earlier in January, his bail petition had been rejected by the High Court. Shahabuddin was given a life-term for the 2004 murder case where acid was poured on two brothers in Siwan, Bihar.
