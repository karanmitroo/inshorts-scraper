Amid logjam over the government formation in Tamil Nadu, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court, stating Governor C Vidyasagar Rao must invite VK Sasikala to form the government. Swamy had earlier said that Rao must decide on CM issue immediately, else a case "charging abatement of horse trading" can be filed.
