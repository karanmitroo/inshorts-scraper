BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said that the President’s Rule be imposed in Tamil Nadu if the state defies the Supreme Court’s ban on Jallikattu. His remarks came after the Naam Tamilar Katchi, a political party, organised a Jallikattu event in Thiruvanthipuram, Cuddalore district. "We don’t need permission from anyone," the Naam Tamilar Katchi had said.
