Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti on Monday said that it was the duty of the state governments to ban cow slaughter. She added that there were a lot of things to eat in India. "Such things (cow slaughter) should not happen. If you are asking for respect from us, then you should also learn to respect us first," she said.
