The only good thing to come out of the BJP's Jan Raksha Yatra in Kerala could be Amit Shah reducing his weight, Kerala Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said on Thursday. He further slammed the CPM-led government for making lavish arrangements for BJP President Amit Shah's visit. The BJP's padyatra aims to protest the "violence perpetrated by CPM on RSS-BJP cadres".
