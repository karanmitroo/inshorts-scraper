Samajwadi Party (SP) President Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said that his party will contest five of the 182 assembly seats in Gujarat and support the Congress in the rest. Adding that they don't want to split the anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vote, the SP chief said they will contest only the seats where they have a strong organisational base.
