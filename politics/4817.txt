After the Supreme Court slammed Centre over judges' appointment, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the judiciary shouldn't interfere with governance. "Court must give direction if the executive fails, but governance must remain with those who are elected to govern. If those nuances are kept in mind then a large number of problems would be resolved," he said.
