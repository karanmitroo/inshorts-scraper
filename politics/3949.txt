Slamming the central government, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said, "The suit-boot ki sarkaar's philosophy is -- Ram naam japna, gareeb ka maal apna (chant Lord Ram's name and loot the poor's money)". Gandhi further said, "The Congress' philosophy says 'daro mat' (don't fear), and the other philosophy says 'daro aur darao' (fear and spread fear)."
