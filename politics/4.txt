Amid incidents of statue vandalism in several parts of the country, a statue of Dr BR Ambedkar was destroyed in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut district late on Tuesday. Following the incident, several Dalits held protests and blocked traffic in the state on Wednesday morning. The community ended the protests after the authorities assured that a new statue will be installed.
