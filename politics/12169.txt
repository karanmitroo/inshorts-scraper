V Balakrishnan, who recently stepped down from the board of Infosys, has become a member of the Aam Aadmi Party. Balakrishnan said, "AAP is the most successful start-up by an IIT-ian ever. I would like to be part of the revolution happening in the country." He, however, said it was too early to say whether he will consider contesting elections.
