The Delhi High Court on Tuesday declined AAP's request to use paper trail EVMs for the upcoming civic polls in Delhi. "We cannot stay the election nor pass an order to use electronic voting machines which are not there," it added. The state election commission earlier said it was not possible to replace all the EVMs in four days.
