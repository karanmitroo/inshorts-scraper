In a big political realignment in Bihar, RJD on Thursday announced its support to the JDU government of CM Jeetan Ram Manjhi in the state. "Our support is to the Manjhi government even though it is not a minority government. This is to keep fascist forces led by the BJP out at any cost," RJD chief, Lalu Prasad said.
