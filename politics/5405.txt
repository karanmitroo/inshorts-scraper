After Congress leader Kapil Sibal accused the BJP of creating Jaish-e-Mohammed, senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday said, "We can't expect more from Kapil Sibal." He added, "The kind of language used by Congress is shameful, regrettable and full of venom." "Congress defending Rahul Gandhi is more important than defending the country," Prasad further said.
