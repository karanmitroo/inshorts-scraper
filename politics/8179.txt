Uttar Pradesh Congress leaders have unanimously decided the party should contest the state assembly elections in 2017 on its own, said Congress spokesperson RPN Singh. He added, "All leaders rejected any coalition politics". The leaders debated the “pros and cons” of prospective coalition partners such as the BSP and RLD, and most contended it was too soon to identify one.
