RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat Sunday said the right-wing Hindu organisation will expand its work and make it more organised to serve 'all' sections. He stressed that the service will be without any distinction, motives or selfish reasons. Whether the needy is Hindu or not, has nothing to do with service, he said. There is no differentiation in serving, Bhagwat added.
