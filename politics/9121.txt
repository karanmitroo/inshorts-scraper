The Congress on Wednesday accused Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde of involvement in a Rs 206 cr scam in the purchase of items such as chikki, mats and books provided to children under a government scheme. Munde allegedly cleared 24 contracts without inviting tenders. As per the rules, all government procurements over Rs 3 lakh are to be made through e-tenders.
