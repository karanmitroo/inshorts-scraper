AAP's Farrukhabad (UP) candidate Mukul Tripathi, fielded against External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid, has refused to contest the LS elections. Tripathi said, "Though the party claims to be fighting against corruption, the party itself is corrupt. There is mismanagement within the party and the members have no time to interact with their LS candidate".
