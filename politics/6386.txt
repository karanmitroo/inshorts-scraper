Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said his "next project is to expose 27 bureaucrats" loyal to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who are posted in various ministries. He alleged that they were "handpicked and positioned" by former minister P Chidambaram. Earlier, Swamy had written to PM Narendra Modi seeking the removal of the now outgoing RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan.
