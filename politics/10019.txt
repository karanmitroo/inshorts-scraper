An opinion poll conducted across all constituencies by AC Nielsen has predicted a hung assembly in Delhi, with BJP having 34 seats and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) 28 seats. The poll forecasts eight seats for Congress - the same number which it won in the last assembly elections. Independents or others may not get any seat in the 70-member assembly.
