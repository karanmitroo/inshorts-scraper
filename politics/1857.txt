Kerala MLAs on Thursday ate beef fry for breakfast at the Assembly canteen in protest before attending a special session on the Centre's ban on the sale of cattle for slaughter at animal markets. "We ate beef to register our protest. We want to tell the Centre that nobody can tell us what we should eat," said a CPI(M) MLA.
