Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij is facing flak after he suggested on Wednesday that cow should be declared as India's national animal. Vij said that cows are becoming endangered because "mafia has become active in the country to target the species". Criticising his statements, the Congress said that BJP leaders raise such issues for "political reasons.''
