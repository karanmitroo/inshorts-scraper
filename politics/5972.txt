BJP leader Swami Prasad Maurya on Wednesday alleged that BSP President Mayawati was the "Goddess of corruption" who auctioned tickets for elections and not the "Devi of Dalits". "I gave 20 years to BSP but saw that Mayawati only tutored lessons of corruption," Maurya, a former BSP leader, added while addressing BJP workers at the party office in Lucknow.
