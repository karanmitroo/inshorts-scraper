Volunteers of the Aam Aadmi Party have been given 5000 spy cameras to report distribution of cash and liquor by other political parties to influence voting. The #AAPSpyCamSena got activated on Thursday night. The volunteers set up "war rooms" at several locations, where they recorded alcohol being stored for distribution. Complaints came in from many localities including RK Puram.
