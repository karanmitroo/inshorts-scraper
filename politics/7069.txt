Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday claimed that Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula was forced to commit suicide "for talking about BR Ambedkar among students". He further demanded that the "two ministers" responsible for his death be sacked. "Will Babasahebâ€™s dream be fulfilled by the Prime Minister going to Mhow and garlanding his portrait?" Kejriwal further commented.
