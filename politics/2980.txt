BJP MLA Bhawani Singh Rajawat has urged the people that until an airport isn't built in Kota, aircraft of VIPs, including that of the Prime Minister, shouldn't be allowed to land in the area. "Kota's airport appears to be meant for political leaders and not people of Kota as only small aircraft of political leaders can land here," he added.
