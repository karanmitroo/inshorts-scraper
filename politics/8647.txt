Former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief T V Rajeswar has claimed that right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had supported Emergency in 1975. In an interview to a television news channel, Rajeswar also revealed that India's then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had not consulted with the IB or the Home Ministry before deciding to impose the Emergency.
