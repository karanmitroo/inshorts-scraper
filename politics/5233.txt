Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, Tejaswi Yadav, has reportedly received nearly 44,000 marriage proposals over WhatsApp in the last three months. This comes after the cricketer-turned-politician launched a helpline number inviting complaints from the public. He had asked people to send photographs of bad roads so that they can be repaired.
