Opposition parties including the DMK and Congress on Monday staged a walkout during Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit's maiden address in the state Assembly. Accusing the Governor of allowing a minority government to remain in office, the parties have demanded he hold a floor-test to ascertain the ruling AIADMK's majority in the legislature following the disqualification of 18 AIADMK MLAs.
