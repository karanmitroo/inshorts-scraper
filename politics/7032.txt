Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar, when questioned on the delay in fulfilling his poll promise of shutting down offshore casinos, blamed the UPA for creating a "mess" by allowing their establishment. "I was compelled to marry a pregnant woman, so naturally I had to take care of her children," he said comparing the casinos to pregnant women.
