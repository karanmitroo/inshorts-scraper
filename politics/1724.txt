Goa Congress General Secretary Janardhan Bhandari has written to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to use the Dabolim Airport to host his wedding reception. He wrote that since his guests were coming from various states, he cannot afford the arrangements. This comes after BJP President Amit Shah faced criticism for holding a meeting at the airport without permission recently.
