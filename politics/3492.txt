BJP MP Mahendra Nath Pandey equated Priyanka Gandhi to 'special utensil of steel' kept in houses in UP villages. "Whenever special guests visit us, we clean it (special utensils) and keep it on the eating table. After they go away we keep it back," he said. "Whenever elections come, Congress brings out Priyanka and then keeps her back," he added.
