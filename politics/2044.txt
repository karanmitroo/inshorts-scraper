The Water Tanker scam happened in 2012 during Sheila Dikshit's tenure as CM, in which irregularities worth â‚¹400 crore were reported while hiring water tankers. The AAP government set up sacked minister Kapil Mishra-led panel in 2015 to probe the scam. Mishra has now alleged that Arvind Kejriwal is trying to suppress the scam because of AAP ministers' involvement.
