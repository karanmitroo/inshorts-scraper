NC leader Omar Abdullah on Friday rubbished J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti’s claim that she wasn’t aware of the encounter between the security forces and Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani. In its first statement to the media, the police had stated that she was kept in loop, he said. “Mufti runs with hare and hunts with the hounds,” he added.
