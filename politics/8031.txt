The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has proposed the name of KG Suresh as the next director-general of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC). The decision was reportedly based on suggestions by Indian policy think tank Vivekananda International Foundation which shares close ties with RSS. Suresh is set to replace the institute's current DG, Sunit Tandon.
