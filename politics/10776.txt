Congress President Sonia Gandhi, on Wednesday, asserted that her party will stage a comeback. Claiming that Congress lost in the Lok Sabha polls despite doing "so much", Gandhi also attacked BJP, saying it had shown "false dreams" and people got caught in the "trap". Targeting the Modi government, she further accused BJP of copying schemes and programmes of the UPA.
