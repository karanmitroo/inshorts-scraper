Asserting that there was no need for an alliance with Congress for the UP Assembly elections, Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday said he would not campaign for the alliance in the elections. He also said he is against the SP-Congress alliance and that SP was capable enough to contest and win the elections alone.
