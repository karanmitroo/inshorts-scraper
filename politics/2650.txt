BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday alleged that no other party had done as much corruption as AAP did during their tenure in Delhi. "Not one or two but 13 legislators of the AAP have been booked for criminal cases ever since AAP won elections in Delhi," he added. Shah said AAP had only made a record of losing elections.
