The Kejriwal government intends to transfer the power to fine auto rickshaw drivers, who formed an integral part of AAPâ€™s campaign, from Delhi police to the transport department. The move, beneficial to the drivers, has been met with resistance from the transport department, which cited the lack of required manpower and claimed the move could cause inconvenience to the commuters.
