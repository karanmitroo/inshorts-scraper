Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government's demonetisation plan, saying, "Entire India knows that it (note ban) turned the black money of India's thieves to white." "We don't know the reason why Modi was after the cash of farmers, poor labourers, and housewives," Gandhi added.
