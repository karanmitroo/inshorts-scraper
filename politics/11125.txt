A man in his late thirties tried to immolate himself outside Nitish Kumar's official residence on Sunday but was overpowered by JD(U) supporters and police officials present there. Sources said he was aggrieved over Kumar's resignation from Bihar's Chief Minister's post and was shouting slogans asking him to continue. The man has since been taken into custody.
