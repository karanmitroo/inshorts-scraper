In response to Congress' criticism of the bullet train project connecting Ahmedabad and Mumbai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said those opposing the bullet train project should travel on bullock carts. Addressing an election rally in Gujarat, he further said the Congress was opposing the project as the UPA government also wanted the project but failed to get it.
