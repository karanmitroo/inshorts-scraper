The convoy of Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi was attacked by unidentified stone-pelters in the state's Vaishali district on Independence Day. Modi's convoy was passing through the area, known to be an RJD stronghold, minutes after RJD chief's son and Leader of Opposition in Assembly Tejashwi Yadav's convoy passed. RJD chief Lalu Yadav has denied his party workers' involvement.
