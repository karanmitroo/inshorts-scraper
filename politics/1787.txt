BJP leader Subramanian Swamy allegedly said that Superstar Rajinikanth has committed financial fraud and he had substantial proof of it. Rajinikanth shouldn't join politics because it will be hard for him to continue as he is unfit for any political work, Swamy added. Swamy also termed the talks of Rajinikanth joining politics as a media hype.
