Responding to BJP President Amit Shah's comments, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said, "there will be no bigger enemy" than herself "if anyone insults Bengal". "People of Bengal do not forgive anyone who insults great poets like Rabindranath Tagore...," she added. Shah earlier commented that "bomb blasts" had subdued the sound of "Rabindra Sangeet" in the state.
