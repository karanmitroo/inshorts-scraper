The Supreme Court on Thursday vacated its own order on maintaining status quo in Arunachal Pradesh and gave its nod for government formation under the leadership of the rebel Congress leader Kalikho Pul. Arunachal was under President's rule from January 26 owing to political instability after 14 Congress MLAs, led by Pul, protested against former CM Nabam Tuki, alleging corruption.
