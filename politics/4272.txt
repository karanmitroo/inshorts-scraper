Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee President Ashok Chavan has said that the party will launch a statewide stir from the first week of January to protest against demonetisation. "Fifty days have passed since demonetisation and despite assurance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that people's hardships will ease, the ground reality is different," Chavan said.
