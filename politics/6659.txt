Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday said that the Assembly poll results of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have shown that people were intolerant towards the Congress. Naidu further said that the Congress was not ready to accept people's verdict and tried to mislead them along with blocking development and making small issues grow out of proportion.
