The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has criticised the use of Devanagari numerals on the new currency notes and sought its withdrawal, saying international numerals should be used. Raising the issue during Zero Hour, DMK leader Tiruchi Siva said that the use of Devanagari numerals on currency is unconstitutional and can be done only after the passage of a law in Parliament.
