Former Kerala Congress (M) leader Francis George on Thursday announced the formation of a new party 'Janadhipathya Kerala Congress'. This comes nearly a week after he walked out of Kerala Congress (M), which his father KM George had founded in 1964. George had left the party alleging Kerala Congress leader KM Mani of having secret meetings with the BJP.
