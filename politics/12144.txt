Bahujan Samaj Party denied any pre-poll alliance with Congress and said it would contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP. This comes as a bad news for Congress, which hoped of defending its 21-seats with BSPâ€™s help. BSP has been against pre-poll tie-ups since it contested 1996 assembly elections with Congress, after finding that pre-poll alliance only benefited Congress.
