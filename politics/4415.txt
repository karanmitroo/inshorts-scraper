Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said at a rally in Mehsana, Gujarat, that PM Narendra Modi had made fun of the labourers in the Parliament over the demonetisation issue. Asking why the PM is not revealing names of defaulters, Gandhi added, "If Modiji's Govt take any big or small step to eradicate corruption, Congress party will support them."
