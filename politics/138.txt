Voting for 60-member assemblies in Nagaland and Meghalaya began at 7 am on Tuesday. Elections are being held in only 59 of the 60 seats in both the states, as a candidate was declared elected unopposed from one constituency in Nagaland and election has been rescinded in one constituency of Meghalaya after a candidate was killed in an IED blast.
