After the Election Commission censured Defence Minister Manohar Parrikarâ€™s bribery remark and asked him to be careful in future, AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday criticised the poll panel. "This is wrong. For the same offence, an FIR was registered against me and Parrikar has been let off with just a scolding," said the Delhi Chief Minister.
