PM Narendra Modi on Monday accused the Grand Alliance of trying to take away 5% reservation of SCs, STs and OBCs to give it to "a particular community.” Saying that the Indian Constitution does not allow reservation on the basis of religion, Modi added, “The leaders of Mahaswarth alliance are trying to mislead the people on the issue of reservation.”
