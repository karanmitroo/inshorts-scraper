Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has accused the Modi government of making U-turn on the issue of the nuclear deal between India and US. According to Digvijay, during the UPA rule, BJP leaders termed the Civil Nuclear deal between India-US as 'against the interest of the country'. However, now the BJP has agreed to implement the same, said Digvijay.
