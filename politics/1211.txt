Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has alleged that the Saubhagya Yojna, which was launched on Monday, is not a new project and claimed that the Centre has only changed the name of an old project. "They (BJP government) only change the names of Yojnas; these Yojnas have been continuing since Congress party's tenure," Singh added.
