Jaidev Thackeray, late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray’s son, has claimed that his father wanted him to be his political heir, but he was never interested. He also alleged that his brother and the current Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had his (Jaidev's) name removed from the family’s ration card. Jaidev has challenged Bal Thackeray’s will in Bombay High Court.
