The AAP will not extend support to any alliance or party for the Tamil Nadu elections, AAP leader Somnath Bharti wrote to MDMK chief Vaiko on Friday. The AAP "has keenly been watching the political developments in Tamil Nadu," Bharti said. The move comes after Vaiko met the state leadership of the AAP a day earlier.
