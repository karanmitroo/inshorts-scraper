The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that BJP leaders LK Advani, Uma Bharti, Murli Manohar Joshi and others will face conspiracy charges in the Babri Masjid demolition case. The top court further ordered no adjournment would be given under normal circumstances and no judge, hearing the case, would be transferred. It has set a 2-year deadline to complete the trial.
