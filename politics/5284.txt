The AIADMK on Thursday said party chief Jayalalithaa is the only chief minister who can succeed in getting Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu and thanked the Supreme Court for giving 'favourable' verdicts. Further, the party accused its principal opposition party, the DMK, which has been holding 'Rail roko' protest against the Cauvery verdict, of creating political drama over the issue.
