The JD(U) and RJD on Friday said they expected Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "behave like the PM of India and not as an eternal campaigner of Sangh". RJD's Tejashwi Yadav demanded "an apology from the PM for announcing a fictitious special package (for Bihar)". Modi visited Bihar on Saturday, his first since the NDA's defeat in the assembly elections.
