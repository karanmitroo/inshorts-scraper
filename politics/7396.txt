DMK Treasurer MK Stalin today said that the DMDK's decision to contest the Tamil Nadu assembly elections alone was not a setback to the DMK. "It is their (DMDK's) right (to decide). We cannot and will not like to interfere in their right," Stalin said. He added that DMK Chief M Karunanidhi had invited the DMDK to an alliance.
