Congress Vice President on Friday said, "I had said four years back that 70% youth are affected by drugs. Badals made fun of me. Now whole Punjab is saying what I said." He added, "Whenever a farmer sees badal (clouds), he becomes happy... but that is not the case in Punjab as Badals don't give water to farmers in Punjab."
