After Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar revealed that surgical strikes had been carried out in the past, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Wednesday said this exposed the BJP-led government's lie. "Hope FS Jaishankar won't get axed like Sujatha Singh (Indian career diplomat) for speaking the truth qua valour of Armed Forces and exposing BJP's deception," Surjewala tweeted.
