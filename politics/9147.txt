Veteran BJP leader LK Advani, who recently created a controversy by raising apprehensions about the possibility of Emergency once again in the country, has said that he is against "one-man shows" in political parties. "Arrogance breeds authoritarianism. It is very sad. Today's leaders should be modest like Vajpayee," Advani said in an interview.
