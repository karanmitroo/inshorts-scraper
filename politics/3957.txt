Calling Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi mentally unstable, RSS leader Rakesh Sinha on Thursday asserted that he had the lowest intellectual level in the Nehru-Gandhi family. "To understand RSS ideology, Rahul Gandhi has to learn politics from the scratch," he added. Rahul Gandhi had recently remarked that PM Narendra Modi and RSS had destroyed the core spirit of India.
