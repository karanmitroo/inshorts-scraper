In an apparent dig at Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya shared a poster that compared PM Narendra Modi to actor Hrithik Roshan-starrer 'Kaabil' and Rahul to Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Raees'. "If a tea-seller is 'Kaabil' he can also become PM, else even a 'Raees' born with a silver spoon wears a torn kurta," read the poster.
