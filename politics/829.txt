Around six MNS activists vandalised Mumbai Congress' headquarters on Friday using sticks and called it a "surgical strike". Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam termed the incident as an "act of cowards by...frustrated MNS workers". The feud reportedly started after Nirupam came out in support of hawkers against whom the MNS had launched an agitation after the Elphinstone station stampede.
