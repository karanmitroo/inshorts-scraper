BJP MP Varun Gandhi has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to initiate a movement for "economically advantaged" MPs to give up their salaries for the remaining 16th Lok Sabha. Gandhi said public representatives must be more responsive to the nation's growing economic inequality. An MP gets ₹50,000 as basic salary and ₹45,000 as constituency allowance, besides other allowances.
