In a big relief to Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a district court has stayed his conviction and granted him bail. Naqvi was sentenced to one year imprisonment for violating prohibitory orders during the 2009 Lok Sabha election. The minister's lawyer asserted that police action was "politically motivated" and there was no evidence to support their allegations against Naqvi.
