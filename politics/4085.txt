West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must go and be replaced by senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Arun Jaitley or Rajnath Singh as the head of the government. "In the current situation, a national government should be formed with another BJP person at the helm... to save the country," Banerjee said.
