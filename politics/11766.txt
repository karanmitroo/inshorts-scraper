Accusing the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi of defying the Model Code of Conduct, BJP Sunday complained to the Election Commission over his remarks linking RSS to Mahatma Gandhi’s killing. The party said, “It is prayed that appropriate action may kindly be taken against Rahul Gandhi and the recognition of Congress as a National Party may kindly be withdrawn immediately”.
