BJP's ally in Tripura, Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), has demanded a separate state for the tribals residing in the state. "The elections are a separate issue, our demand has for years been to create a separate state for tribal people of Tripura. We are hopeful that the Central Government will...look into our demand," IPFT President NC Debbarma said.
