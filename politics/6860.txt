The CBI on Thursday summoned former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat in connection with a sting operation wherein he was seen offering bribes to Congress lawmakers to support him in a floor test. While Rawat had called the sting 'fake', a forensic report of videotape reportedly confirmed its authenticity after which Rawat was asked to appear for questioning on Monday.
