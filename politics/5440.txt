The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the Tamil Nadu government officials to apprise it about the health of CM J Jayalalithaa by Wednesday. This comes after a PIL was filed in the court seeking a detailed report on the CMâ€™s health. The PIL had also sought the photographs of the Cabinet meeting which she reportedly held in the hospital.
