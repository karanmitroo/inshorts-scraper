Reacting to the Gorakhpur BRD Hospital tragedy, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed PM Narendra Modi and his 'New India' vision, saying, "We don't want this kind of new India." "It's clear that this government has tragedy in it. I earlier told Modiji that this hospital needs money. There are many problems...but no action is being taken," Rahul added.
