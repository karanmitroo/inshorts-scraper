Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan on Friday alleged that the export of beef has increased by two-and-a-half times under the Narendra Modi government. The Centre was "deceiving people in the name of cleaning the Ganga, while innocent people are getting killed in the name of protecting cows", he said. "BJP criticised previous governments for promoting beef export," Khan added.
