Maharashtra's opposition, the NCP, on Thursday claimed that about 15% of the total â‚¹8 lakh crore investment in Maharashtra announced during the 'Make in India Week' was fake. It questioned an MoU signed between the Maharashtra government and MCHI-CREDAI to develop 5.69 lakh affordable houses, calling it fake, as a similar MoU was signed during the NCP-Congress rule in 2010.
