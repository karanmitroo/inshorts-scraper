Former National Commission for Women chairperson Mamata Sharma Monday said the NCW has become "paralysed" under the Modi government. "NCW is now a deserted and isolated place as there is no one to receive you nor anyone to visit the commission," she said. Further, Sharma added that she has complained about this 'paralysed and inactive' state to the present chairman.
