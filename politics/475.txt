Talking about the Opposition criticising the Centre's decision to end Haj subsidy, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said some people get a "stomach ache" if they don't criticise decisions taken by the Centre. Almost everyone from the Muslim community has welcomed this move, Naqvi added. The government has decided to use the subsidy funds for the education of minority communities.
