Trinamool Congress Chief Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying, "Maharaja Modi is giving sermons. His government has reduced interest rates on small savings, stopped PF withdrawals, slashed funds for welfare programmes." Speaking on the Congress-Left alliance, she said, "They are behaving as if they are young lovers moving around holding each otherâ€™s hand."
