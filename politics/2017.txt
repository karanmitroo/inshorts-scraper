Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has reminded his son Akhilesh Yadav of an unfulfilled "promise" of returning the post of party President to him after three months. "Why don't those in the media ask Akhilesh why he is not keeping his words," he added. Akhilesh had taken over as the party's National President weeks ahead of the Assembly polls.
