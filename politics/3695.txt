Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said, "Beware of the 'chamatkari' (magical) Bharatiya Janata Party. It is trying to lead the voters astray into voting for them." He further said, "The BJP has ruined politics in the nation in the three years of its rule. The party didn't take any decisions for the development of the nation."
