BJP's official Twitter handle on Thursday made a gaffe by tweeting a picture of street lights in Canada's Shelburne district while praising the South Delhi Municipal Corporation for replacing  two lakh sodium street lights with LED lights. The party further claimed that such an action by the SDMC would save 6 crore units of electricity every year.
