The Congress has decided to drop Nirmal Khatri as party chief in Uttar Pradesh on charges of non-performance. Khatri had earlier skipped a meeting presided over by party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in Lucknow, citing health issues. He will reportedly be replaced by former Union Minister Jitin Prasada. This comes ahead of the Assembly elections in the state in 2017.
