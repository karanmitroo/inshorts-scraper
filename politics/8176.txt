Reacting to Aamir Khan's remarks on intolerance, the ruling BJP on Tuesday said that it was an individual's choice to move out of the country. "Aamir should have thought twice before making such derogatory remarks," Manoj Tiwari said. "There have been incidents, but we cannot allow the exceptions to become the defining character of India," BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli added.
