Delhi CM and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that Central Board of Film Certification chief Pahlaj Nihalani has censored 'Udta Punjab' on the order of the BJP. Kejriwal's statement came after Nihalani recently accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of taking money from AAP for showing Punjab in a bad light, ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections due in 2017.
