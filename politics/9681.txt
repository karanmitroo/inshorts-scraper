Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that his government would take into consideration the feedback given by common people in planning Delhi's Budget. "We will try a pilot project in 5-10 constituencies which will be divided in colonies. We will ask people how their Budget should be. Their feedback will then be discussed in the House," Kejriwal said.
