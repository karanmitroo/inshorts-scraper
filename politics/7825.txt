The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday attacked Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government saying crime in the state is increasing since the new government took charge. "The fear of return of jungle raj has appeared to be true... as indicated by killing of two engineers in Darbhanga, gunning down of a jeweller in Patna today," BJP leader Sushil Modi added.
