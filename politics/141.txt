A video which shows BJP President Amit Shah mimicking Congress President Rahul Gandhi while addressing a rally in poll-bound Karnataka has surfaced online. Imitating Gandhi, Shah is seen questioning what PM Modi has done in the last four years. India instead wants to know what the four generations of Congress did for the country, Shah added.
