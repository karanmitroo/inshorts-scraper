BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday criticised Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for backing JNU students and asked if raising 'anti-national' slogans was freedom of speech and expression. He added the Congress should feel ashamed. Meanwhile, Congress leader Shobha Oza responded by saying he was labelling wrong allegations against Rahul Gandhi as he never supported 'anti-national' activities.
