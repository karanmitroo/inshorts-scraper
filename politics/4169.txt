After a Madras High Court judge indicated that he may order the exhumation of late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's body, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said that he doesn't favour it. "I hold her (Jayalalithaa) in high esteem. Exhuming the body somehow does not go down well with me," he added.
