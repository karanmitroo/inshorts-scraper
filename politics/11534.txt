Mukhtar Ansari, jailed MLA of Quami Ekta Dal, will withdraw his candidature from Varanasi against BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi, "to strengthen secular forces and avoid division of votes". "We will discuss our future course of action later. Now SP, BSP and AAP have to decide how to defeat Modi," he added.
