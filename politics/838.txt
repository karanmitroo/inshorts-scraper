Former Bihar CM and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife Rabri Devi has said that there are many people in Bihar who are ready to slit PM Narendra Modi's neck and chop his hands off. This comes a day after Bihar BJP President Nityanand Rai said any finger or hand raised against the PM would be broken or chopped off.
