Taunting BJP chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has thanked her for sparing his children out of BJP's anti-AAP ad. His statement came after the BJP released new anti-AAP ad, taking a quip on a pre-poll promise made by Kejriwal during the last Delhi polls. The BJP had used caricatures of Kejriwal's children in previous anti-AAP ad.
