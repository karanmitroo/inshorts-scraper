An FIR was registered on Monday against senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi in Bihar for allegedly “promising” to give laptops, colour TVs and dhoti-saris to potential voters. He claimed that the offer was for 50,000 boys and girls, to be implemented after the government is formed, and was meant to “spell the vision of the party for the citizens”.
