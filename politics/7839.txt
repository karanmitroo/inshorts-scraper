Former West Bengal CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday asked Congress and Left parties to align with CPI(M) and defeat the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the assembly elections. He alleged that no new factories were started under the TMC rule, but the situation would change under CPI(M). He added that industrialisation would be a big issue in the upcoming polls.
