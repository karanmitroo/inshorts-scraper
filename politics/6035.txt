Senior AAP leader Kumar Vishwas on Friday said that the country stands with Home Minister Rajnath Singh after his visit to Pakistan. “Disrespect to HM is disrespect to the Nation. We, India, condemn Pak Act at SAARC. #ShameOnPak #Apologise (sic),” he tweeted. Rajnath’s speech was on Thursday blacked out by Pakistan while he was addressing the issue of terrorism.
