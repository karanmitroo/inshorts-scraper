The AAP government in Delhi passed three education bills on Tuesday with just one amendment. Calling it 'historic', CM Arvind Kejriwal said, "The three bills are proof that we are very serious about education." Notably, the bills were passed even after the opposition registered its disapproval and staged a walkout from the 70-seat Assembly, wherein AAP has 67 members.
