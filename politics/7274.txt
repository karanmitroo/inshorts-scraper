A Kerala court on Wednesday granted conditional bail to CPI(M) leader and former MLA P Jayarajan, an accused in connection with the murder case of an RSS activist in 2014. Jayarajan has been granted bail after he complained of some health problem on conditions including not entering Kannur district for the next two months and not attempting to influence witnesses.
