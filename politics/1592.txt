Bihar CM Nitish Kumar reportedly called Lalu and asked for his forgiveness before breaking the Grand Alliance few days back. "Lalu-ji, I beg your forgiveness, but after running the government for 20 months, I cannot do it any longer. I am going to quit," he reportedly told him. Kumar later resigned from his post and formed government with the BJP.
