Former BJP leader Poonam Azad, who recently joined AAP, has said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was responsible for her resignation. "I left the BJP because of Arun Jaitley. He has harassed us a lot. I was denied a party ticket because of him," she said. Poonam, wife of suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad, is a three-time BJP national executive member.
