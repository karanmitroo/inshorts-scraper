Hailing the Supreme Court’s decision of quashing the 2006 Singur land deal, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday called it a landmark victory. I’m very happy with the decision and remembering those who made sacrifices for this, she said. She further asked people to celebrate ‘Singur utsav’, stating it’s like an invocation of the Durga Puja celebrations.
