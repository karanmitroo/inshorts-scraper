The Madhya Pradesh government has annulled the Scheduled Tribe certificate of BJP leader Jyoti Dhurve, who is a sitting Lok Sabha MP from Betul (ST) constituency. The state Tribal Welfare Department's panel has found that Dhurve had mentioned the name of her husband's caste in place of father's caste, which is mandatory, in the application for the caste certificate.
