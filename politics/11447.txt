Congress party workers protested outside the residence of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in Delhi on Tuesday for his vitriolic attack on Priyanka Gandhi and her husband Robert Vadra. Swamy had said that Gandhi would have been thrashed if she had contested elections from Varanasi as she drinks too much alcohol and has a bad name.
