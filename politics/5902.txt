Criticising PM Narendra Modi's silence on the appointment of judges in his Independence Day speech, Congress has alleged that he wants a "captive and not an Independent judiciary". Modi should heed the Chief Justice of India's advice and not do petty politics on this, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said. Notably, CJI TS Thakur had also expressed disappointment over PM's silence.
