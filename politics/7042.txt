Congress on Saturday criticised Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, alleging that he insulted women by comparing offshore casinos to pregnant women. It demanded that Parsekar must resign from his post and tender an apology within 15 days. Parsekar earlier compared opposition's legacy of establishing offshore casinos to being compelled to marry a pregnant woman and act as her children's father.
