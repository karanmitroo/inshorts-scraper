BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha has slammed the Modi government over the handling of the situation which arose after ex-serviceman Ram Kishan Grewal committed suicide over the OROP issue. “Why don't we understand that opposition leaders are not enemies,” tweeted Sinha. "What are we trying to prove...that power is permanent?” he added.
