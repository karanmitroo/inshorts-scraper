Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday accused PM Narendra Modi of adding "communal texture” to the Assembly elections. Nitish said everyone could see “why Vajpayee ji was forced to remind him (Modi) to follow Raj Dharma, but wonder who will do the Vajpayee today?” Earlier, Modi had attacked RJD chief Lalu Prasad over his comment that Hindus too eat beef.
