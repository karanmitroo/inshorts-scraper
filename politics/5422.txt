After several reports claimed that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi suffered from an electric shock during a rally in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, party leader Abrar Hussain debunked the rumours. Reportedly, the electric wire which fell on Gandhi was not a live wire. "I was with Rahul Gandhiji, nothing of that sort (electrocution) happened, it is only a rumour," Hussain said.
