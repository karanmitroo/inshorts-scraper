On the Quit India movement's 75th anniversary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked the people to create a 'new India' by 2022 and free the country of poverty, dirt, corruption, terrorism, casteism, and communalism. "In 1942, the need of the hour was to free India from colonialism. Today, 75 years later the issues are different," Modi added.
