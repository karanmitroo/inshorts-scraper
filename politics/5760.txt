Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken on Friday blamed PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government for bringing anti-labour policies like 'hire and fire' that prompted major trade unions to call for a nationwide strike. Extending support to the strike and demands of the trade unions, Maken said while unions are demanding minimum wages of ₹18,000, the government has agreed to give just ₹9,100.
