BJP National Secretary Ram Madhav on Monday alleged that the Congress government in Manipur was not clearing the ongoing economic blockade for political gains. "The Manipur Chief Minister is playing games with lives of people of the valley," he said. Notably, the blockade has been imposed by the United Naga Council (UNC) against the creation of new districts in Manipur.
