Delhi Police commissioner BS Bassi Tuesday said that AAP MLA Jarnail Singh, who is booked for allegedly assaulting an MCD engineer, is absconding. Singh's anticipatory bail had been rejected, Bassi said, adding, "I hope he surrenders." The AAP MLA is also accused of tearing up official documents and threatening to frame the engineer in a false case.
