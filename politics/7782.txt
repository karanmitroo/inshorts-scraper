The Railway Police on Saturday said that after a 4-hour long interrogation, the suspended JD(U) MLA Sarfraz Alam, who allegedly molested a woman on Dibrugarh-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, admitted that he had travelled in the same train. Earlier he had denied the charges saying he wasn't on the train. However, he still denies the charges of misbehaving with the woman.
