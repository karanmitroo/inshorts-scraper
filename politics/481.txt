Two FIRs have been lodged against West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh for allegedly making "instigating comments" that could incite violence. Ghosh had reportedly said the law and order situation in the state had collapsed completely. Denying having made any such remarks, Ghosh claimed the complaints were cheap tricks by the ruling Trinamool Congress which was frightened by BJP's growth.
