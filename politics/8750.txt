The Shiv Sena on Friday praised Gujarat's Hardik Patel and called him "a hero" who has punctured PM Narendra Modi's claims of Gujarat being a peaceful state. In its mouthpiece 'Saamana', the party wrote, "Patel has become the 'king of crowds' which does not augur well for the BJP". "[H]e has thrown the gauntlet at the state government," it added.
