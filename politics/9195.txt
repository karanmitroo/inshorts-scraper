RML Awadh University on Wednesday claimed that former AAP law minister, who is alleged to be holding a fake degree, did not graduate from their university. Tomar had claimed that he held a 'genuine' degree from the same university. Denying having any such record of Tomar, the university claimed of issuing this statement on Jan 22 in reply to an RTI.
