Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) President Mayawati reshuffled the party on Thursday, changing the responsibilities of many senior party leaders. Former State Minister Lalji Verma, who was taking care of party interests in the Gorakhpur zone, was moved out and Dinesh Chandra has been given the additional responsibility for Devipatan and Gorakhpur zones. More changes are likely to be brought in.
