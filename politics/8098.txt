A day after the Delhi Assembly approved 400% hike in salaries for MLAs and ministers in Delhi, AAP MLA Pankaj Pushkar has criticised the decision and said that "inflation is for everyone". Arguing that "it will send a wrong signal to society", Pushkar revealed that government bought a 'whip' which "pressurises the legislators to vote in favor of the bill".
