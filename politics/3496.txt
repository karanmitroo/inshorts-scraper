Asserting there were no differences in the family, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday said his son Akhilesh Yadav will be the CM of Uttar Pradesh if the party gets re-elected. "I will start campaigning from tomorrow. Amar Singh is not upset," he said. Mulayam had earlier said he would campaign for his brother Shivpal Yadav first.
