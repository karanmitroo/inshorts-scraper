Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday said that imposition of any language other than the local language of a state is unconstitutional. He added that such imposition was against the spirit of formation of states on linguistic basis. Notably, Hindi signboards have been removed from Bengaluru's Metro stations after pro-Kannada groups protested against 'Hindi imposition'.
