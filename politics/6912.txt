The Election Commission has launched a mobile application titled 'e-voter' for the upcoming Kerala Assembly polls, scheduled to be held on May 16 this year. The app will help voters search for their names in the electoral roll, check the location of their polling station, seek information regarding candidates, view affidavits filed by them and file complaints.
