A Delhi court on Friday discharged former SP leader Amar Singh, LK Advani's ex-aide Sudheendra Kulkarni and two BJP MPs along with two others in the 2008 cash-for-vote case. The court, however, ordered framing of charges against Amar Singh's former aide Sanjeev Saxena. Singh and Kulkarni were accused of bribing some MPs ahead of a confidence vote in Lok Sabha.
