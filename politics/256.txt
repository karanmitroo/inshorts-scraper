Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi on Wednesday said that suspended party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has no right to speak on behalf of the party. This comes after Mani Shankar's recent remarks during a literature festival in Pakistan's Karachi, where he said the hatred he receives in India surpasses the love he receives from the citizens of Pakistan.
