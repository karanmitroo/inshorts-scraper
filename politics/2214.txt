PM Narendra Modi has planned to review the performance of BJP CMs every two months. At a review meeting on Sunday, each BJP CM gave a 15-minute presentation before the PM on a 12-point questionnaire set by the party. Leakages in government schemes should be plugged and a temptation to resort to populism should be avoided, Modi told the CMs.
