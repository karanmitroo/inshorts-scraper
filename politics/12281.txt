Reacting over Anna Hazare's acceptance of the 'sarkari' Lokpal Bill, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted - "I m really surprised. How can Anna accept sarkari lokpal bill? Sarkari lokpal is a "jokepal". Who is misguiding Anna?" Kejriwal added - "None of the 3 conditions which were agreed upon when Anna broke his fast in Aug 2011 are there in this jokepal."
