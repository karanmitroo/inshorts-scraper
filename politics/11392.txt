With Army chief Gen Bikram Singh retiring on Jul-31, BJP has asked the Election Commission to impose a stay on key appointments by the outgoing government, considering it a violation of the model code of conduct. Rejecting BJP's demand, Congress spokesman Shashi Tharoor said, "Do not politicise the armed forces. It is a professional decision where BJP has no role."
