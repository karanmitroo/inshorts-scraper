AAP on Tuesday alleged that Delhi University Registrar Tarun Das is "under pressure" from the Centre to authenticate the "forged" degree of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "When we went to DU, the VC and the Registrar both refused to meet us. Now we know why," AAP leader Ashutosh said. Earlier, Delhi University Registrar had termed Modi's BA degree as "genuine".
