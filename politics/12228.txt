In a veiled rebuff to Modi, Shiv Sena on Tuesday said, "As far as Maharashtra is concerned, Modi should take it easy. Here, Shiv Sena is there, and it carries the saffron flag of Shivaji Maharaj." At his Mumbai rally, Modi had said Maharashtra had 26 CMs so far but lagged in development compared to Gujarat which saw fewer CMs.
