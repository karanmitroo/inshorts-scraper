Amid speculations of party convenor Arvind Kejriwal being floated as AAP's chief ministerial candidate in Punjab, party leader Ashutosh on Sunday said, "It’s all rumours. Kejriwal will not leave Delhi government.” The party has not yet decided its chief ministerial face for the Punjab polls, he said. "At the right time, the democratic process will throw a leader," Ashutosh added.
