The Delhi High Court has set aside a trial court order summoning documents related to the National Herald case from the Finance Ministry and other agencies. The case, filed by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, is linked to misappropriation of funds by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and other Congress leaders during the sale of National Herald's parent firm Associated Journals Limited.
