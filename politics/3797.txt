Taking a dig at the inclusion of ex-Congress leaders Ritu Bahuguna and ND Tiwari into BJP, founder member of Swaraj Abhiyan Prashant Bhushan has said BJPâ€™s slogan must be "Congress-yukt BJP" rather than "Congress-mukt Bharat". "BJP seems to have extraordinary Bure din: They have to poach totally discredited(but virile) ND Tiwari from Cong to save their sinking ship!(sic)," he tweeted.
