Amid the ongoing UP elections, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday said that It would have been better had BJP given tickets to Muslims to contest polls. He added that the community will be adequately compensated after the BJP forms government in the state. Notably, the BJP has not fielded even a single Muslim candidate in the state.
