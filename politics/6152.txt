Suspended AAP MP Harinder Singh Khalsa, who sits next to comedian-turned-politician Bhagwant Mann in the Lok Sabha, on Friday accused Mann of coming to Parliament sessions smelling of alcohol. Khalsa added that he has requested the Speaker to change his seat in the Lok Sabha as he felt like he would vomit because of the smell of alcohol.
