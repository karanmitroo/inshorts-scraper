The Akali Dal on Monday protested outside Congress headquarters in Delhi to oppose former Punjab CM Amarinder Singh's clean chit to Jagdish Tytler, a Congress leader accused in the 1984 anti-sikh riots case. In an interview to a news channel, Singh had reportedly said that Tytler was innocent and no court had held him guilty.
