Former AAP member and lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan on Monday said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal can join hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his personal gains. Calling Kejriwal 'totally unscrupulous', Bhushan added that he regrets having not recognised such traits of the AAP convener earlier. "He used people like me and Yogendra to gain credibility," he further said.
