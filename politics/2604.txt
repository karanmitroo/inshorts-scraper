After being ill-treated at the airport for sharing the surname with Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, BJP MP Sunil Gaikwad on Thursday asked if it was a crime to have Gaikwad as surname. "This is not a thing to complain about, but this is certainly harassment," he said. Notably, Ravindra Gaikwad had recently assaulted an Air India staffer with slippers.
