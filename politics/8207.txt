Tej Pratap Yadav, elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was interrupted by Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind twice during his swearing-in after he misread 'apekshit' as 'upekshit' in his script. Kovind told the 28-year-old MLA,“It’s apekshit, not upekshit,” after which he asked him to read his oath all over again even as the crowd giggled at Yadav.
