Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Tuesday said that the Centre's demonetisation move is the biggest scam of the year. Claiming that "not even a natural calamity would have caused so much suffering", Chidambaram demanded a probe into the matter. Further calling demonetisation "absurd and thoughtless move", Chidambaram said, "It has broken the back of poor people."
