Senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Saturday alleged that UP's Muslims are most worried right now, as a weaker SP will only strengthen BJP before the upcoming 2017 Assembly polls. Adding that SP is undivided, Khan claimed that everything is fine in the party. This comes after SP supremo sacked Akhilesh Yadav from the party and later re-inducted him.
