In an apparent attack at BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj for his 'population control' remark, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has said, "Yeh Sakshi Sadhu nahi Lafandar hai (This Sakshi is not a seer, but a rogue). "What kind of Maharaj? He should be sent to jail under Goonda Act. Seers do not speak bitterly. He is fake," he tweeted.
