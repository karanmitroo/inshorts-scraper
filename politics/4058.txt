The Supreme Court verdict that banned appealing for votes in the name of religion, caste and other identities can be "exploited" by parties campaigning using the "Hindutva plank", Jamaat-e-Islami Hind said on Saturday. The organisation said BJP may use SC's 1995 ruling that had held "Hindutva" to be a way of life, for the upcoming polls, especially in Uttar Pradesh.
