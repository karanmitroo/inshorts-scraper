Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) president Pravin Togadia on Sunday said that the people who hoist Pakistani flags in Jammu and Kashmir must be shot with a gun. He also criticised the Centre of not taking a stern step on the matter and held them responsible for the pro-Pakistani separatists getting emboldened day by day.
