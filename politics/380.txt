The BJP has backed out from a joint declaration by eleven political parties to not contest the Nagaland Assembly elections until the Naga insurgency issue is resolved. The party suspended its representatives for signing the declaration, stating they had no authority to do so. The BJP said its central leadership will take a final decision on the matter.
