With Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Chief Mayawati opposing the Centre's demonetisation move, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah on Thursday asked, "Why is Behenji (Mayawati) worried over notes ban". Shah added, "Ever since the note ban was announced, Mayawati's face has lost its colour." The BJP leaders are all smiling because they never had any black money, Shah said.
