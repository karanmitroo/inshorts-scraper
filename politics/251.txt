A Baptist church and a group of clerics in Nagaland have issued warnings to Christians and Muslims against voting for the BJP in the elections in the state and Tripura. While the church urged the voters to realise that they are "Christians first" and then voters, the clerics alleged that the BJP-led Centre is not interested in the Naga cause.
