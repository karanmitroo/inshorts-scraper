After being accused of denouncing the removal of Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav from the AAP's Political Affairs Committee, leader Mayank Gandhi has threatened to quit the party. He also accused a "small group of party decision-makers" saying that efforts were being made to project him as "anti-party" and "anti-AK" (Arvind Kejriwal) on social media.
