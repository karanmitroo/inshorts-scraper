Amid the disclosure of snooping of Subhash Chandra Bose's family, a family member of martyr Bhagat Singh claimed Saturday that their family was also kept under surveillance for years. Demanding the government to declassify the documents, Abhay Singh Sandhu, nephew of Bhagat Singh, said, "Our phone conversations, too, had been under the scanner for years... even after independence."
