Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has said nobody can save his party's people if they don't improve. "People who have scant respect for [Congress]...try to dominate others, should go to the people and work for them. Everybody should be respected," Singh added. Explaining the Congress' failure to form the government in Goa, Singh said "wallets were opened", which Congress couldn't manage.
