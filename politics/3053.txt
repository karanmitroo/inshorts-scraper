The Madras High Court on Monday ordered the Tamil Nadu Assembly Secretary to submit video clippings of the trust vote proceedings that took place on February 18, 2017. This came after PILs were filed by DMK Working President MK Stalin and others who had demanded that the trust vote be declared as illegal.
