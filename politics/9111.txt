The Congress on Wednesday demanded Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani's resignation over the alleged fake degree row. After a Delhi court took cognisance of a complaint against her, the Congress said Irani has no "moral, constitutional or legal" right to continue in her post. Irani allegedly made contradictory declarations while filing nomination papers for 2004 and 2011 parliamentary elections.
