Former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India, which contested its maiden polls, failed to open its account in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections. Swaraj India had fielded 211 candidates in the elections, of which 111 were women. Earlier, Yadav had said that he had "zero expectations" from an infant party and anything above it would be a "bonus".
