Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has warned party managers against bogus membership, saying that the party should focus on genuine members than to seek to corner credit by boosting numbers through dubious methods. He added that to eliminate attempts at fake membership partymen should go to the booth levels and enroll members by taking their signatures and photographs.
