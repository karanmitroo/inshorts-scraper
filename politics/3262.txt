Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said PM Narendra Modi wants to do everything on his own as he has taken away work of LK Advani, while Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley donâ€™t have any work. "In 2014, Modiji said good days are coming. He showed Dilwale Dulhania picture and after 2.5 years Gabbar Singh came," he said.
