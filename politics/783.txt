Slamming the Congress for terming GST as 'Gabbar Singh Tax', Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday asked the party why it chose to support the tax regime in the Parliament. Meanwhile, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi asserted that GST requires reforms, adding that the party had warned the government about the consequences of "wrong implementation" of GST.
