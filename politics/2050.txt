Sacked Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra on Tuesday held a press conference and read out a letter addressed to AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal that said, "Bless me, I am filing an FIR against you." He further said, "You have everyone on your side and I'm alone. But I am ready to fight... I have learnt to fight corruption from you only."
