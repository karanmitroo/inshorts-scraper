AAP’s IT and Innovation head Ankit Lal on Monday took to Twitter to appreciate Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu for the latter’s prompt response to an issue he had raised. Ankit had apprised Prabhu about the insufficient food available in a Rajdhani train pantry. Soon, the IRCTC staff came into action. "Received the help from IRCTC, appreciate it," Ankit tweeted later.
