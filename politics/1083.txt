PM Narendra Modi on Friday said the Congress rejected his proposal in 2013 when he was Gujarat's CM to redevelop Kedarnath that was badly damaged in flash floods. Claiming that the Uttarakhand government had accepted Gujarat's offer to help redevelop Kedarnath, PM Modi said Uttarakhand announced it will develop Kedarnath itself when the Congress-led Centre found out about Gujarat's offer.
