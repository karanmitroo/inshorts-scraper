BJP ally Shiv Sena on Monday taunted PM Narendra Modi on the birth anniversary of Bal Thackeray, saying, "The late leader never boasted of a 56-inch chest." An editorial in Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana' read, "After the Godhra riots, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was about to oust Modi from Gujarat CM's post but it was Balasaheb who staunchly backed him then."
