Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday asked the Congress party to state whether it supports the recent demonetisation move to check black money and corruption or not. "Are you trying to find out excuses to cover up this? That has to be stated very clearly, then only one can have clarity," Naidu added.
