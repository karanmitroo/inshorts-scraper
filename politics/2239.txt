BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday tweeted, "Now that the Jihadis have escalated violence, Union Govt must also escalate: Impose Emergency under Article 352 in the Valley and fire away". His remark came after students again clashed with security forces and resorted to stone pelting in Kashmir. The clashes erupted as colleges and universities were opened after over a week.
