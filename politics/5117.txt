Responding to allegations that the ex-serviceman who committed suicide over OROP scheme was politically involved, the veteran's son on Thursday said that his "father was not from any party." Earlier, Minister VK Singh had alleged that the veteran had contested Sarpanch elections for Congress. "Sarpanch election is different from regular elections, he was just working for people", the son said.
