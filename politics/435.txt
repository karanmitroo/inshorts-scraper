The Opposition Congress in Chhattisgarh Assembly has demanded the disqualification of ruling BJP's 11 MLAs for holding posts of Parliamentary Secretaries. This comes a day after President Ram Nath Kovind approved the Election Commission's recommendation to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs for holding offices of profit. Congress further called the appointment of the BJP MLAs unconstitutional.
