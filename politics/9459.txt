Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju confessed Tuesday that he carries matchboxes with him on flights since he is not subjected to frisking. Raju, a chain smoker, said, "Once I became minister... matchbox, which used to be confiscated, came along with me." He further added, "I have yet to come across an incident worldwide where a matchbox became a threat."
