Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that PM Narendra Modi cheated people by furnishing a fake BA degree. Kejriwal claimed Delhi University has no record of Modi and that a degree of his namesake was shown as his own. Adding that "talent was not necessarily a product of formal education", Kejriwal said that the issue was that "he cheated".
