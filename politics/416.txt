Stating that the 5-year jail term awarded to RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was a "judicial matter", Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said he had no role in the conviction. This comes after Lalu's son Tejashwi alleged that Kumar had conspired against his father. Lalu has been convicted in three of the six fodder scam cases lodged against him.
