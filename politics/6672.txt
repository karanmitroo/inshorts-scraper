The Income Tax department has launched 'e-nivaran' (electronic solution), a special grievance redressal system to fast-track grievances and ensure early resolution of taxpayers' complaints. It comes under the Income Tax Business Application, the new smart electronic platform for the operations of the department. The system tracks a complaint from its origin, till it reaches its final resolution.
