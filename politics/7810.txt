Former J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Tuesday blamed the Centre for not doing enough to rehabilitate the "displaced" Kashmiri Pandits of the valley on the 26th anniversary of the exodus. "Words sound even more hollow now", Omar said adding, "All we can do is recommit ourselves to do what we can to keep the spirit of Kashmiriyat alive".
