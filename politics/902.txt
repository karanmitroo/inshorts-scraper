IPS officer PC Baranda, who had resigned from his post on Wednesday, will contest the upcoming Gujarat assembly elections from the Bhiloda constituency on a BJP ticket. "I quit the job of an IPS officer because I want to work for my native town, which hasn't been able to reap the benefits of development so far," Baranda said.
