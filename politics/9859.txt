A notice has been issued to senior VHP leader Praveen Togadia, banning his entry into Bengaluru between Feb-7 to Feb-10. Togadia's entry has been banned as he is known to make provocative speeches and has several cases against him, sources said. He was expected to take part in a VHP convention called the 'Hindu Viraat Samavesha' on Feb-8 in Bengaluru.
