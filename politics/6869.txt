The BJP on Tuesday attacked the Congress over the rape and murder of a Dalit woman in Kerala. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was quick in rushing to different states over Dalit issues, but has not commented here, the BJP said. "The president of the party (Sonia Gandhi) is concerned only about states not ruled by Congress," it further alleged.
