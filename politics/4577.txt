Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is "less CM and more CT...Conspiracy Theorist". "Staring at his impending defeat in Punjab, he's clearly lost his mental balance," he tweeted. Amarinder's remarks about Kejriwal came after the latter alleged that SAD-BJP and Congress have a secret seat-sharing pact for Punjab polls.
