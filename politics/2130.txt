Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has said if Shariat is influencing BJP leaders so much then they should consider joining it. Rather than focusing on triple talaq matter, BJP should consider addressing other issues, he said. 'Divorce rates in other religious communities are much more than among Muslims. We don't want to embarrass BJP by disclosing these figures," he added.
