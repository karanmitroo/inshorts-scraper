Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who addressed party workers in Mathura (UP) on Monday, said that the Congress must work like Steve Jobs' 'Apple', where there are no rigid hierarchies. "We (Congress) allow people to have different ideologies, unlike the RSS", Gandhi said. "I don't see myself as your leader, but as part of a family", he added.
