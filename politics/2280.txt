Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday raised concerns about the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the MCD polls. "Reports from all over Delhi of EVM malfunction, people with voter slips not allowed to vote. What is SEC doing?" Kejriwal tweeted. The AAP leader had earlier alleged EVM tampering in the recent Assembly elections.
