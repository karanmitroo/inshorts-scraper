The BJP on Sunday demanded that UP CM Akhilesh Yadav must prove his majority in the Assembly or resign while labelling the Samajwadi Party as "a sinking ship". This comes after Shivpal Yadav said his cousin Ram Gopal Yadav was sacked from the party for conspiring with the BJP. Earlier, Akhilesh had sacked four cabinet ministers, including his uncle Shivpal.
