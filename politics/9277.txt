Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh sparked a controversy on Thursday after he said that the Dharamshala gang-rape victim, a student of the local Government Post-Graduate College, is being used to 'malign' someone. "The lady concerned has been traced and she is in police custody. It appears that whatever was there... was an organised attempt to malign somebody," Singh said.
