Speaking about the corruption allegations levelled against him by Kapil Mishra, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said "truth will prevail" and it will commence from tomorrow's special session of the Legislative Assembly. Mishra had earlier claimed that Health Minister Satyendar Jain handed over ₹2 crore to Arvind Kejriwal and "settled" a ₹50-crore land deal for the CM's brother-in-law.
