Shiv Sena Wednesday slammed BJP for performing poorly in Delhi Assembly elections saying that the saffron party has been turned into "dirt" by the broom-wielding AAP. In an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamna', Sena also said, "It is a lesson for BJP that elections cannot be won merely on the back of poll promises and speeches."
