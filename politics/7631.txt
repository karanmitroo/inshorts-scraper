An Allahabad court today admitted advocate Sushil Kumar Mishra's petition seeking a sedition trial of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. It is being sought for his opposition to police action against JNU students who participated in a demonstration where "anti-national" slogans were raised. Notably, Mishra had last year sought a trial of US President Barack Obama for allegedly defaming India.
