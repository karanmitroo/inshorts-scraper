After being criticised for attempting to use taxpayers' money for paying his legal bills, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday asked, "Should I pay for it from my pocket". "There was massive corruption in DDCA...I initiated a probe. The BJP filed a case against me. We hired lawyer Ram Jethmalani. They ask why the government should pay," he said.
