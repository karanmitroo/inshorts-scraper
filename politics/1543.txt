The Delhi High Court on Friday sought replies from journalist Arnab Goswami and his channel Republic TV, asking them to respect Shashi Tharoor's 'right to silence' on his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death. Tharoor had filed a plea asking the channel to refrain from 'misreporting' his wife's death. He had already filed a â‚¹2-crore defamation case against Goswami and his channel.
