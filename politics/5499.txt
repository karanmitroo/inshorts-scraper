Maharashtra Navnirman Sena-affiliate, MNS Chitrapat Sena, on Friday, warned all Pakistani actors and artists to leave India within 48 hours or it will "push them out". This comes amid tensions brewing between India and Pakistan following the Uri terror attack. In the past, the Shiv Sena had forced Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali to cancel his performance in Mumbai.
