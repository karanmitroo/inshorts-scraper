Union Minister Uma Bharti on Wednesday claimed that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had sought help from former RSS chief MS Golwalkar after Pakistan attacked Jammu and Kashmir following the Independence. Stating that the Army did not possess "high-tech" equipment to reach Jammu and Kashmir immediately, Bharti said that RSS volunteers went to the state to help the Army.
