Rajya Sabha witnessed uproarious scenes on Thursday as Congress lodged strong protest over lauding of Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse at a  function held in Maharashtra earlier in Dec. Congress said that Godse is being eulogised by hosting his 'Shaurya Diwas' in Maharashtra. Govt, however, disapproved of any such event hailing Godse, but said no organisation should be defamed.
