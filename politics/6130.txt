Calling the current level of price rise as "an alarming situation", Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury on Thursday said that it should be "a state of emergency" in the country. Condemning Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Acche Din' promise, she added that the price rise would also impact malnutrition in the country as the poor can not afford to eat anything nutritious.
