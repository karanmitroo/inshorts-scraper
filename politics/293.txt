In a Facebook video, the 16-year-old daughter of a BJP leader in Kerala's Kasaragod has alleged that her father has been threatened by local CPI(M) leaders after he joined BJP. She claimed that 5 CPI(M) workers had threatened him when the two were returning from her school. CPI(M)'s local unit has denied the allegations and called it a "political stunt".
