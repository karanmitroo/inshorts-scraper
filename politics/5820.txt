After the Bombay High Court allowed women to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the Haji Ali dargah, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) announced to approach the Supreme Court against the verdict. Calling it a hasty decision, AIMIM leader Haji Rafat Hussain said, "It shouldn't have been done, even Islam don't allow entry of women... This can disturb the environment."
