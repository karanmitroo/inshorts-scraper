Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday criticised the Central government asking, “Why centre not clearing names suggested by SC collegium? Does centre want BJP lawyers to be appointed as HC judges?” This comes after the Supreme Court expressed disappointment at the Centre towards the non-execution of the collegium's decisions regarding the transfer and appointment of judges in High Courts.
