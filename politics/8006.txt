AAP MP Bhagwant Mann was on Wednesday offered water by PM Narendra Modi while he was protesting in the Lok Sabha against the CBI raids at the Delhi Secretariat. Mann, tired from shouting slogans, was seemingly looking for water when Modi offered him the glass of water kept on his table. The duo exchanged smiles before Mann resumed his protest.
