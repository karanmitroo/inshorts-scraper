 Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has said the Gujarat riots of 2002 are not comparable with the 1984's anti-Sikh riots (Delhi). Sen argued that Congress leaders, Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi, who were fighting elections today, were not the people responsible for the anti-Sikh riots; whereas Modi was the CM when the Gujarat riots took place.
