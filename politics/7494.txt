The Delhi unit of the BJP on Wednesday filed a complaint with the Delhi Police against AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, accusing him of using "abusive language" against PM Narendra Modi at an event in February. Khan defended his alleged remarks saying that he was merely criticising the "anti-Dalit" and "anti-minority" policies of the BJP-led government at the Centre.
