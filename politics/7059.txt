BJP President Amit Shah on Wednesday accused the Jayalalithaa government in Tamil Nadu of being the "most corrupt" in the country and asked people to oust it in the upcoming polls. Speaking at a campaign rally, Shah also charged Jayalalithaa's government with non-cooperation over the implementation of central schemes including UDAY, aimed at helping debt-ridden state power discoms.
