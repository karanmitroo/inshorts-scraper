Lashing out at PM Narendra Modi for protecting Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in 'Lalitgate', the Congress on Saturday accused him of following 'Raje dharma' instead of 'rajya dharma'. "Instead of taking action on these issues, Modi has become the protector of those having huge black money", Congress spokesman  Ajoy Kumar said.
