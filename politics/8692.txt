A delegation of Jain religious leaders on Sunday met Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to solve the controversy surrounding the meat ban in Mumbai during the 'Paryushan' festival. "As far as Shiv Sena is concerned, this controversy has ended. But we must find out how it all started and who is responsible for it?", Thackeray said after the meeting.
