A day after the CBI registered a preliminary inquiry against Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to probe irregularities in the 'Talk to AK' campaign, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed the agency is scared of Sisodia. "Today Manish kept waiting for the CBI, but it did not turn up. Till now people used to fear CBI...," Kejriwal tweeted.
