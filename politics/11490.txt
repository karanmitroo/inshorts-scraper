There seems to be no end to attacks on the members of Aam Aadmi Party. AAP's candidate from Nalanda, Pranav Prakash, was allegedly beaten by 25 unknown assailants on Sunday. "They dragged me out of the car and hit me on my mouth with the pistol," said Prakash. He has sustained serious injuries and has been admitted to the hospital.
