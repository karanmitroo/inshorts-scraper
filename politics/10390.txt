Attacking PM Narendra Modi, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh Saturday said, "Modi should focus on RSS and not on Gandhi, Nehru and Patel." Further, he accussed the BJP of entering into a 'secret' poll pact with the Majlise-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen for the upcoming polls in Delhi. "BJP can go to any extreme for power," he added.
