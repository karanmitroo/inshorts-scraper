Following violence by DMK MLAs in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, Speaker Dhanapal on Saturday ordered the Assembly police to evict the legislators. "You tore my shirt and insulted me, I am doing my work abiding law," he said. Notably, the house had to be adjourned after DMK MLAs threw chairs and microphones demanding secret ballot for the proposed floor test.
