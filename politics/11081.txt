Karnataka CM, Siddaramaiah, is unlikely to accept Union minister P Chidambaram's candidature to the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka. He fears that Chidambaram's nomination will cause embarrassment if a controversy on the sharing of Cauvery waters arises. Speculation is rife that Chidambaram, who declined to contest the Lok Sabha polls, will be accommodated in the Rajya Sabha from the state.
