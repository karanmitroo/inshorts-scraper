Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that a 'Mahagathbandhan' (Grand Alliance) of non-BJP parties is needed at the national level to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Urging all the non-BJP parties to set their own agenda, Nitish further said that there is no shortage of leaders or faces for the post of Prime Minister.
