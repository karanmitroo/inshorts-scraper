The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Human Resource Development Ministry to consider continuing the German language in Kendriya Vidyalayas for the present academic session. A day before, the centre had stood by its decision of scrapping German as a third language in KVs. The SC told Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, "Why the hurry? Do it from the next session."
