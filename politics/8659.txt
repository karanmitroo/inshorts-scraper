Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was mocked on Twitter for saying “every individual has a mother” during his speech at 'Kisaan Mazdoor Samman Rally’ on Saturday. “There is no such person who doesn't have a mother," Rahul added. "Congress is calling all news channels to stop telecast of Rahul's speech as he turns the speech into comedy circus," @ktrishi tweeted.
