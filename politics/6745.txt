National Conference (NC) President Dr Farooq Abdullah on Saturday accused the Centre of trying to destroy the internal autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir. He criticised the Mehbooba Mufti-led government's silence over the implementation of the National Food Security Act and NEET exam in the state. The NC also pledged to restore autonomy in J&K to what it was before 1953.
