CPI leader D Raja today backed Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad's comment comparing ISIS with RSS, saying he found nothing wrong with what Azad said. "He has attacked fundamentalist forces on both sides, as these work to destroy the social harmony and social fabric of the country," Raja said. Azad on Saturday drew a parallel between ISIS and RSS.
