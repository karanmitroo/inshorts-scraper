AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has called PM Narendra Modi the 'Sultan of Delhi', stating he has issued over a hundred farmaan (orders) within two years of governance. He further added, "secularism is not simply saying that you are a secular PM and then saying Jai Shri Ram at rallies." He made these remarks during a debate at a literature festival.
