Former army chief General, VK Singh, has tweeted against the Army Chief-designate - Lt General Dalbir Singh Suhag - linking him of supporting "dacoity" by an army unit that once worked under him. Lt Suhag's appointment was one of the last major decisions cleared by former PM Manmohan Singh's government before it was trounced in the election by the BJP.
