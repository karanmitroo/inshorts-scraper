BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi on Tuesday sought an explanation from the Congress regarding recent remarks made by Congress leaders Mani Shankar Aiyar and Salman Khurshid, and said the two were behaving like ISI, IS or Taliban propagandists. Lekhi said, â€œWe have a hate-India constituency within India which has been attacking our resolve to fight communally divisive forces."
