Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday asked PM Narendra Modi if Dalits and backwards are not nationalists. He was questioning the PM over the latter’s remark in which he reportedly said, “the nationalists are with us, we need to bring Dalits and backwards.” Modi had also asked BJP to analyse why Dalits and tribals don’t relate to the party.
