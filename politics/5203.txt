JD(U) spokesperson Ajay Alok on Wednesday said that BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi should mind his dignity. "Everyone should be careful with their language, especially the elders who are full of experience," Ajay stated. The verbals started after Modi commented on Tejashwi Yadav reportedly receiving 44, 000 marriage proposals on WhatsApp, when his elder brother Tej Yadav is still unmarried.
