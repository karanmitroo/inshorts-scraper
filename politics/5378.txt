With Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa being treated at a hospital, opposition DMK on Sunday demanded either a "Chief Minister in-charge or a new Chief Minister", to streamline governance. DMK's ally Congress, however, said, there was a "machinery" in place and there was no "such need". MDMK's Vaiko too said there was no need of any CM in-charge.
