BJP President Amit Shah on Friday said he will never accept a job of becoming Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's adviser. When asked if he is assured of his party's victory as long as Congress is led by Rahul, he said, "We donâ€™t depend on our rivals' weakness". He further added, "We were smart, so we got Goa and Manipur".
