Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should visit Uttar Pradesh to know the plight of the farmers instead of visiting foreign nations. He added, “[H]industan ka gareeb vyakti trast hai, Narendra Modi mast hai (Poor people are suffering, whereas Narendra Modi is happy).” Gandhi is currently on a month-long ‘Kisan Mahayatra’ in the state.
