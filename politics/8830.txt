BJP MLA OP Sharma sparked a controversy on Monday by terming AAP MLA Alka Lamba a "drug addict", and questioned her "motive" behind embarking on an anti-drugs drive leading to an attack on her. Alleging the involvement of Lamba and Arvind Kejriwalâ€™s goons in vandalising shops in Delhi, Sharma threatened retaliation by "lathi-wielding" BJP workers in future in such incidents.
