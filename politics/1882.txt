All accused, including BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, were on Tuesday granted bail in the Babri Masjid demolition case by a court in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Last month, the Supreme Court had ordered prosecution of the politicians and others accused of criminal conspiracy in the case and directed to conclude the trial in two years.
