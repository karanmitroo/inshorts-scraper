BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday demanded that Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian be sacked. “Who said to US Cong on 13/3/13 the US should act against India to defend US Pharmaceuticals interests? Arvind Subramanian MoF !! Sack him!!!” he tweeted. Notably, this comes after Swamy’s criticism of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan who recently said he would quit in September.
