AIADMK's breakaway faction led by former Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam (OPS) has been spotted campaigning for the by-elections with a replica of late CM Jayalalithaa's mortal remains. DMK's Radha Ravi slammed this move and said that a man like Panneerselvam should not approach people in such an unethical way. By-elections to RK Nagar seat are due on April 12.
