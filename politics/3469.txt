Tamil Nadu Interim CM O Panneerselvam on Wednesday alleged he had daily visited the hospital where former CM J Jayalalithaa was admitted, but couldnâ€™t meet her even once. He further revealed only AIADMK chief VK Sasikala was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa. "I don't understand her rush to become CM, does she not understand the situation in Tamil Nadu?" he asked.
