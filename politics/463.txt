Drawing references from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Tuesday likened the people of Congress to Pandavas who are walking on the right path. He added that the BJP people were Kauravas who were on the wrong path. This comes ahead of the state Assembly elections which are expected to be held in early 2018.
