Lyricist Javed Akhtar, whose term as a Rajya Sabha member ended on Tuesday, slammed AIMIM leader Asaddudin Owaisi for his 'Bharat mata ki jai' remark in his farewell speech. Without naming Owaisi, Akhtar chanted the slogan several times and said, "I don’t care to know whether saying ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ is my duty or not, it is my right."
