Social activist Anna Hazare has decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi from October 2 over Land Acquisition Bill and One Rank, One Pension (OROP) issue. Earlier this year, the anti-corruption activist had written to PM Narendra Modi, urging him not to pass the new ordinance on the Land Acquisition Bill.
