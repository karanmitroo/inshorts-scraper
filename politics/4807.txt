India's retaliation against "cowardly attacks" from across the border was so strong that Pakistan's army pleaded India to halt its response, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said on Friday. He further praised the country's "political leadership" for taking a strong policy decision on Pakistan. His statements come after the body of an Indian soldier was recently mutilated by Pakistani militants.
