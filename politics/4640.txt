Criticising the BJP-led Maharashtra government for not fulfilling promises, Congress leader Radhakrishna Patil compared the state government with cartoon character 'Doraemon'. "This government is like Doraemon cartoon and the public has become Nobita. The way Doraemon takes Nobita away from reality and shows him unfulfilling dreams, same is being done by this government with public," Patil said.
