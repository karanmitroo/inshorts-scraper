BJP's Assam Chief Ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday said BJP will not take All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) support to form the government. Citing exit poll results, which have predicted a BJP win in the Assembly elections, Sonowal said the people have voted for change. Congress, however, has asserted that the exit polls were not based on fact.
