Congress leader and Karnataka  MLA KN Rajanna has said that the Congress party is like a thieves' party where 'honest and sincere work' is not respected. "As long as Indira Gandhi was alive, people voted for the Congress without caring who its candidates were," he added. Earlier this week, Congress MP DK Suresh expressed his dissatisfaction with the Congress publicly.
