Taking a dig at BJP over appointing two deputy Chief Ministers in UP, Shiv Sena said it was aimed at keeping Adityanath "free to perform his religious duties". "Rather than performing religious duties, Adityanath should focus on delivering good governance," Sena wrote in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'. Notably, Shiv Sena was not given the Deputy CM post by BJP in Maharashtra.
