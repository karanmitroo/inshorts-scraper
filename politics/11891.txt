The subsidy on electricity bills in Delhi, announced by the Sheila Dikshit government and later increased by the Arvind Kejriwal government, will cease in the new financial year as there is no provision for it in the interim budget for 2014-15 approved by Parliament on Friday. On Dec-31, Kejriwal had slashed electricity rates by 50% for consumption upto 400 units.
