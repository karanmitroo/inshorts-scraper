The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected jailed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala's plea to review the verdict passed against her in a disproportionate assets case. The court said it did not find any error in the trial court verdict under which Sasikala was sentenced to four years in jail and fined ₹10 crore, for amassing disproportionate assets of around ₹66.65 crore.
