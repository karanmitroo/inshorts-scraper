Congress leader Asha Kumari, who replaced Kamal Nath as party's General Secretary in-charge of Punjab, on Monday rejected demands for her resignation over her conviction in a land grab case. "I cannot oblige them... I have been given full mandate by the Congress president," she asserted. Notably, Kumari is currently out on bail after being sentenced to a year's imprisonment.
