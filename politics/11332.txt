Pitching his 'aam-aadmi' credentials, Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday said, "I am a fakir. I have no money. I will run a campaign on your money. You decide what do you want". He further said, "Somebody was saying that Modi is spending Rs 5000 crore in advertisements. If he is elected to power, he will make at least Rs 5 lakh crore".
