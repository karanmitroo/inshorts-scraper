Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Sunday asked Manohar Parrikar to relax in Delhi and "prove to be a good Defence Minister", adding, "Who knows if you play your cards well you may replace Modi". "My sympathies for Parrikar...In spite of losing badly he's still fishing in troubled waters. But then he loves Goa fish. Isn't it Mr Parrikar?" he tweeted.
