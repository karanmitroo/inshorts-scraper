Following protests from the Shiv Sena, Pakistan’s former foreign minister Mahmud Kasuri's book, named ‘Neither A Hawk, Nor A Dove,’ was launched at Nehru Centre in Mumbai on Monday. At the event, Kasuri thanked Maharashtra CM for providing him with protection. Earlier in the day, the event's main organiser Sudheendra Kulkarni was allegedly abused with black ink by Shiv Sainiks.
