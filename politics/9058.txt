Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has accused Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad of lying about his "brave" decision to arrest BJP leader LK Advani during Rath Yatra (for building Ram Temple) in 1990. Paswan said Lalu, who was Bihar's CM at that time, was indecisive about arresting Advani and the arrest was made on ex-PM VP Singh's insistence.
