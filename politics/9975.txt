In a relief to AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, the Election Commission on Thursday rejected another complaint filed by the Congress party against him. Following the EC's decision, the Congress stated that it will appeal in the Delhi high court against the same. Earlier, the party had filed a complaint with the EC against Kejriwal for his 'bribe remarks' on Monday.
