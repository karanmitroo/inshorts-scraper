According to a 1983 declassified US report, the Central Intelligence Agency had opined that Rajiv Gandhi may not succeed his mother, Indira, as the Prime Minister after her death because he was "politically immature." He had "failed to excite either the party or the public," the report added. Notably, Rajiv went on to succeed Indira after her assassination in 1984.
