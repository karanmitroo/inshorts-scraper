The BJP on Thursday reminded National Conference President Omar Abdullah that it was them who had given him his first political break. It was reacting to Abdullah's comments on Wednesday that his party will never align with the BJP for government formation in Jammu and Kashmir. Abdullah was a junior Minister of Foreign Affairs in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's NDA government.
