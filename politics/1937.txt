The demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 had the backing of the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao-led Congress government in the Centre, ex-MP RV Vedanti has claimed. Further, Vedanti added that Rao had agreed to their request of not sending forces in order to smoothen the process of demolition. Vedanti was granted bail in Babri demolition case on Saturday.
