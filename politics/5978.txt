BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday said that best for Kashmir would be to impose President’s Rule there and hand over the state’s administration to the Army and ex-servicemen. Criticising Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad over his speech in the Parliament on Kashmir, he tweeted that Azad sheds tears for children injured by CRPF pellets, not for jawans’ children.
