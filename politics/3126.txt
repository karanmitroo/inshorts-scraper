AAP MP Bhagwant Mann has said his party wouldn't allow any water to flow to Haryana as Punjab has no extra water. He further accused the Akali Dal and INLD of trying to exploit the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal issue for political mileage. INLD suddenly decided to dig the canal after realising that SAD was going to lose power, Mann said.
