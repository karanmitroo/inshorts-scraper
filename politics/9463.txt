Ending speculations about the rebel-duo (Bhushan-Yadav) quitting AAP and forming a new party, Prashant Bhushan said Saturday that he won't quit. "My grievances are with Kejriwal, not with the party", said Bhushan, speaking up on the rift that left him and Yogendra Yadav ousted. Bhushan's close aide has also claimed that the leaders are reluctant on forming a new party.
