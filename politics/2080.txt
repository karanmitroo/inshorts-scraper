AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said the Bilkis Bano rape case is a fit case wherein the nation's collective conscience has to be satisfied and all convicted should be given the death penalty. Owaisi has asked the Centre to move the Supreme Court in this regard. In 2002, pregnant Bilkis Bano was gang raped and her family members were murdered.
