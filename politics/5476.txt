Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday said that PM Narendra Modi went to Lahore "for us" because he understood the importance of improved relations between India and Pakistan. Mufti's statement comes amid the opposition targeting the PM for visiting Lahore to meet Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif first and trying to isolate it internationally later, after Uri attack.
