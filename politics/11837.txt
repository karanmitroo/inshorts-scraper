Kiran Kumar Reddy, who resigned from the CMâ€™s office to protest against the formation of Telangana, is set to launch his 'Samaikyandhra' party at a rally on March-2. Rajahmundry is likely to be the venue of his rally. He will follow the tradition of visiting temples for an auspicious start by praying at the shrine of Lord Venkateswara.
