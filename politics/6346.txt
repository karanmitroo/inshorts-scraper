BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said an RTI reply from IIT-Kharagpur shows that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal does not have an IIT rank and alleged that Kejriwal "probably came through other methods." Earlier, Swamy had filed an RTI query regarding Kejriwal's All India Rank and entry into IIT-Kharagpur, but the institution had said the information was unavailable.
