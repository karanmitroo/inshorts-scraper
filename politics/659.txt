Sonia Gandhi's last speech as Congress President was interrupted several times due to firecrackers that the party workers were bursting outside the All India Congress Committee headquarters in Delhi on Saturday. She had to pause after opening her speech, due to the loud noise of the firecrackers and had to wait for several minutes before she could resume.
