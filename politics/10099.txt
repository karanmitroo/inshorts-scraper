Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday claimed that the national capital has around eight lakh fake voters. "In Delhi, 3,96,914 voters have 11,50,509 voter identity cards, which means one voter has three to four cards," Kejriwal said. He met Chief Election Commissioner VS Sampath to complain about the irregularity and was assured that the matter would be looked into.
