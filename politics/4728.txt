AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged the Centre to change the Home Ministry's advisory of making it mandatory to play the National Anthem before movie screenings. "This is a government of ultra-nationalists. Those who don't agree with them are anti-nationals. The Supreme Court order means that you will have to amend the 1971 National Honour Act," he added.
