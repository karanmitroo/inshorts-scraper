Talking about the issue of farmers committing suicide, Madhya Pradesh Panchayati Raj Minister Gopal Bhargav on Friday said, "MLAs also die. In past four years, 10 MLAs have died." "Does anybody have any control over death? Do MLAs live forever? We are also concerned about the problem. We also have sympathies for farmers," Bhargav added.
