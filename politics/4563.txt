Late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa's niece Amrutha has claimed that Sasikala Natarajan never allowed Jayalalithaa to be close to her family. Saying that Sasikala does not have any rights over Jayalalithaa's property, cash, and jewellery, Amrutha added, "Let it be handed over to the government and this can be utilised for the people of Tamil Nadu."
