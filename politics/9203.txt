Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu has filed a case against Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao for allegedly tapping his phone illegally and violating his basic rights along with tarnishing his image. Naidu's step came just hours after a news channel owned by Rao's family aired the audio tape of a phone conversation wherein Naidu was allegedly bribing an MLA.
