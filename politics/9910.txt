In a first, the VHP is planning to organise a 'Ram Mahotsava' from March 21/22 to April 1, on the lines of Durga Puja. This programme would be organised in every village in the country, VHP Media incharge Sharad Sharma said Thursday. The programme would aim at "mobilising Hindus" and "reminding them of their resolve" to construct a Ram temple.
