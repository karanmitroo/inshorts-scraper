Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday claimed that the BJP-AGP alliance was a "marriage of convenience" to grab power in the state. He added that the BJP-AGP leaders had completely ignored the wishes of the the party workers. The Congress, on the other hand, has all along been giving due recognition and respect to grassroots workers, Gogoi said.
