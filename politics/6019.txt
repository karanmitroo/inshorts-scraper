Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has asked the RSS and BJP to keep cows and nilgais at their shakhas if they love them so much. They talk of protecting cow and nilgai which destroy farmers’ crops, he said. “JD(U) workers should click pictures of BJP workers and leaders’ shoes and ask them which leather is this made of,” he added.
