Hundreds of ruling JD(U) workers Sunday disrupted train services and blocked roads at many places in Bihar to enforce a statewide shutdown to press for special status. CM Nitish Kumar has called for a dawn-to-dusk shutdown and will hit the streets before holding a dharna. He said the special status was essential for the development of an economically backward state.
