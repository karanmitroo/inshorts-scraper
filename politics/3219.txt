Aam Aadmi Party member and Hindi poet Kumar Vishwas on Sunday said that his party knew he cannot do politics, and he did poetry there as well. Suggesting that the AAP "will win in Punjab, may or may not win in Goa" Vishvas further added that it was difficult for him to find a balance between poetry and politics.
