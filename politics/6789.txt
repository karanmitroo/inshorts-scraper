Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday alleged non-availability of basic amenities like clean drinking water in Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's constituency. Goyal claimed that even local issues there have not long been addressed. Jayalalithaa did not even come to the constituency during last year's floods when Prime Minister Narendra Modi could come "all the way" from Delhi, he added.
