The Supreme Court on Monday scrapped a PIL seeking a CBI probe into Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's citizenship. The court said PILs cannot be individual-centric and that the petitioner had made allegations without verifying facts. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had claimed earlier that Rahul Gandhi declared he was a British national when he had worked in the United Kingdom.
