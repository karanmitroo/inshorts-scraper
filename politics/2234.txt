Praising PM Narendra Modi's initiative for cashless economy, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday reportedly said that the first cashless transaction was done years ago by Lord Krishna to help his friend Sudama. He further asserted that only cashless transaction can end corruption. PM Modi had earlier asked BJP MPs to promote the cashless economy.
