Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad on Wednesday demanded strict action against Union Minister Giriraj Singh for allegedly making racial comments against Congress president Sonia Gandhi. "He should be made to wear bangles, vermilion, bindi, and his face should be blackened as he had crossed borders of indecency," Lalu said.
