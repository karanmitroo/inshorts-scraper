Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said, "Any grand alliance in UP will only take shape when the SP and BSP are together". Talking about a possible coalition between the six socialist parties including SP and JD(U), Kumar said, "I have always supported any move towards unity." However, Congress leader PL Punia has dismissed any "grand alliance" talks in UP.
