Former Bihar welfare minister Parveen Amanullah, who had quit JD(U) on Tuesday, joined the Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday. "I had several problems with the Nitish government, and none of my concerns regarding corruption were being addressed. I have been in talks with AAP for a month and have finally decided to join the party," she said.
