Shiv Sena on Wednesday said in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should stop maligning the image of India on foreign lands. The Sena's statement was in reference to Modi's repeated statements criticising corrupt systems in India during his foreign trips. Adding that the world may misinterpret his remarks, Sena said that such things would affect India's economy.
