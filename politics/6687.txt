After being nominated by the Samajwadi Party (SP) for the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, Amar Singh has claimed that he was a "Mulayamwadi" and not a "samajwadi". Amar Singh further said, "Giving me a Rajya Sabha seat is the expression of Mulayamjiâ€™s (SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav) affection for me. I am, truly, moved by it."
