A Delhi court on Tuesday denied anticipatory bail to AAP leader Somnath Bharti in a domestic violence case filed against him by his wife. Dismissing the plea, the court termed Bharti's bail application as 'pre-mature' as there was no FIR or any apprehension of arrest. Bharti's wife accused him last month of domestic violence and mental torture since 2010.
