Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra was on Wednesday assaulted by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs inside the Assembly as he tried to raise slogans against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health Minister Satyendar Jain. Mishra alleged that the assault was ordered by Kejriwal, and dared the AAP convener to come out clean on the allegations levelled against him.
