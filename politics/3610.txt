BJP president Amit Shah has said, "Amarinder Singh calls himself captain but follows orders of Rahul Gandhi. I don't understand what type of captain he is." Further slamming AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, Shah said, "He wants to become the CM of Punjab by spreading these lies. He is Delhi CM but wants to become CM of Punjab, Goa, and Gujarat."
