BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday urged the government to remove former Finance Minister P Chidambaramâ€™s friends from the Finance Ministry. Alleging that Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das favours Chidambaram, Swamy said that a report against the Congress leader was submitted to the Finance Ministry, but no action was taken because certain senior officials owe allegiance to Chidambaram.
