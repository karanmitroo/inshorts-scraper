Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Yadav on Saturday said that the JD(U) faction led by him will fight the Gujarat Assembly elections on an 'autorickshaw' symbol, and in alliance with the Congress. This comes after the Election Commission recognised the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led faction as the real JD(U) and allowed his faction to use the 'arrow' symbol.
