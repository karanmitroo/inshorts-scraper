Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to Chief Secretary asking to direct state Election Commission to conduct MCD polls by ballots and not EVMs. This came after several party leaders raised doubts over the reliability of EVMs in counting votes. BSP supremo Mayawati had alleged that EVMs were tampered with in UP polls.
