US President Barack Obama on Friday telephoned PM designate Narendra Modi and invited him to visit Washington at a mutually agreeable time to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries. Separately, senior State Department officials said the visa thing is now a non-issue. Officials explained that as a head of government, Modi will merit a different treatment altogether.
