Speaking on the sting operation that reportedly caught a group of Karnataka MLAs demanding money for Rajya Sabha votes, Janata Dal (Secular) said its legislators were aware of the sting and were only 'amusing' themselves. The party’s Karnataka unit President HD Kumaraswamy said, “They were just making buffoons of those who approached them, there was no transaction of money.”
