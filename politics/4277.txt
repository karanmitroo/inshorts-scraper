Shihhan Hussaini, an alleged loyalist of late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, on Wednesday claimed that the AIADMK supremo was "poisoned". "We want to find out who was the conspirator," he said and demanded that Jayalalithaa's body be dug out for a probe. "O Panneerselvam is the right candidate for party general secretary," he added.
