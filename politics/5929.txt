Reacting to VHP leader Pravin Togadia’s remarks against PM Narendra Modi, Congress leader Manish Tewari on Sunday asked if the RSS will stand with its Parivar (allies) or the PM. “Tagodia of VHP, Hindu Mahasabha and Bajrang Dal are at war with Modi over the cow?” he tweeted. Togadia has accused the PM of insulting “gau rakshaks”.
