The opposition BJP has launched a satirical website targeting the BJD, ahead of Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik's address to 60 lakh school students across the state on Children's Day. While a revision book on the website lists the government's failures, another section carries news on the blunders committed by government officials. Meanwhile, several schools organised competitions glorifying Patnaik.
