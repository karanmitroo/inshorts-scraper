Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Singh Yadav, who had earlier resigned from all party posts and the UP Cabinet over alleged differences with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, on Friday said that Akhilesh will learn and get experience with time. The comment came when Shivpal was asked if Akhilesh's actions were childish or inexperienced. Notably, Akhilesh has reinstated Shivpal in his cabinet.
