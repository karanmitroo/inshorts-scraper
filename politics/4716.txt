Punjab Congress Chief Captain Amarinder Singh has challenged Union Minister Arun Jaitley to contest in the Amritsar bypoll which is due after Singh resigned from his Lok Sabha membership from the constituency. Notably, Singh had won the Amritsar seat in the 2014 General Elections by defeating Jaitley by over one lakh votes.
