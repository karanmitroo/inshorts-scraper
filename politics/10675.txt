Hitting out at BJP's FDI policies, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee mocked at NaMo's "acche din" slogan saying that India has been hit with a "weeping time" instead. "In the name of FDI, they have opened up railways, defence and many other sectors for FDI.", she said. Banerjee added that her party is in favour of PPP.
