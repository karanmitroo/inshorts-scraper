Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde Saturday said he would be happy to see NCP chief Sharad Pawar become PM, describing Pawar as his "political guru". Pawar (who broke away from Congress in 1999) has been trying to become PM since 1992, but was a "victim of Delhi politics", he added. However, later Shinde backtracked from his remark, saying he was misquoted.
