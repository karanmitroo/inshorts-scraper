Former Railway Minister and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has slammed the Centre's decision to merge Railway Budget with General Budget and said that the department is no more a priority for the government. "Based on my personal experience as Railway minister I can say the decision will have no benefit... this step would end autonomy of Railway,"  Kumar added.
