The Bombay High Court on Wednesday rejected former Maharashtra Deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal's bail and a habeas corpus petitions that challenged his detention over the money laundering charges. Rejecting the pleas, the court stated that they were devoid of merit. Earlier, Bhujbal had contended that his detention was illegal as the Enforcement Directorate has not complied with the mandatory procedure.
