Shihan Hussaini, a supporter of former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, who had crucified himself in 2015 to pray for her release from jail, has started a political party in her name. Called AMMA (Amma Makkal Munnetra Amaippu), the party's main objective is to avenge her death, he said. Earlier, Hussaini had also painted a portrait of Jayalalithaa with his blood.
