BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday questioned why Congress Vice President didn't visit temples in Delhi, adding that nobody should conceal their faith. This was in reference to Gandhi's visit to Gujarat's Somnath Temple, where he allegedly registered as non-Hindu. Denying Congress' claims that he was a Jain, Shah also declared that his family had been Hindu for six generations.
