The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday removed its founding members Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the party's national executive. The resolution to sack both the leaders got the support of 200 members out of 300. "What happened today was exactly what Arvind Kejriwal said yesterday, we have literally been kicked out, physically," alleged Prashant Bhushan.
