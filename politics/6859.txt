The BJP on Thursday said that the Congress demanded a Supreme Court-monitored time bound CBI probe in the AgustaWestland issue because they were "afraid". "I think they are afraid because now the ED and CBI investigation has gained momentum... we are very much certain that in few weeks, first action will be seen," BJP MP Kirit Somaiya said.
