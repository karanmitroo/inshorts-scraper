Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday criticised the government for cutting the interest rates on PPF and other small savings, calling it "yet another assault" on middle-class people. “This Govt has failed farmers, failed the poor and now it’s failing the middle class," he added. The interest rate on PPF has been cut to 8.1% from the current 8.7%.
