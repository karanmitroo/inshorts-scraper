Wishing birthday to Saral Patel, who changed his Twitter name to 'Beta' Saral after Union Minister Smriti Irani told him "Grammar theek karo beta", Irani tweeted, "Birthday greetings @SaralPatel007, blessings from Auntyji." Irani's 'beta' reply had come when Saral tweeted, "It's a common practice to address people as 'Dear'," following her spat with Congressman Ashok Choudhary over the issue.
