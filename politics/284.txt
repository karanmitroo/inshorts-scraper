The portrait of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was unveiled in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on Monday by Speaker P Dhanapal. Opposing the move, the main opposition DMK boycotted the event claiming that Jayalalithaa was convicted in a disproportionate assets case. The state government defended the portrait, highlighting steps taken by the former CM for women's empowerment.
