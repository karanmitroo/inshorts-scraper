BJP Spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh on Sunday accused West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee of lying about the recent Malda riots. He alleged that she did that to protect the TMC supported criminals involved in cross-border smuggling. Notably, Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday called the Malda violence a 'struggle between the BSF and the locals' and not communal in nature.
