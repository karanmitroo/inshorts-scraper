After receiving flak for dropping Gandhi Jayanti from the list of public holidays, Goa government clarified that the holiday has not been cancelled and called it a 'typing mistake'. Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar said, "It was either by mistake or mischief by the Congress. There is election in Goa, the Congress will go to any level to create a controversy."
