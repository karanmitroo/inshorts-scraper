UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday appointed MLC Naresh Uttam Patel Samajwadi Party’s UP President — the post held by his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav until now. Meanwhile, Akhilesh's supporters created chaos at the party office in Lucknow and removed Shivpal's nameplate from there. The development came after Mulayam Singh Yadav nullified the decision of making Akhilesh party’s National President.
