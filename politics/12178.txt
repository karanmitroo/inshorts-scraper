UP CM Akhilesh Yadav has come under fire once again for hosting 14-day-long carnival at his native village Saifai, even as 34 children died and hundreds of people continue to battle extreme cold in relief camps. Party chief Mulayam Singh has not visited the riot victims till date and the government has been blamed for not doing enough for them.
