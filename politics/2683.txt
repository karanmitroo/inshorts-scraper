The BJP-led Manipur government has decided to set up an anti-corruption cell at the Nongthombam Biren Singh's Secretariat in the state for gathering information on corrupt elements in public service. A mobile number has been set up to enable the people to inform the government about malpractices so as to allow the authorities to take appropriate actions.
