Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah failed to get an appointment with PM Modi on Friday to discuss pending issues of the state like drought relief. "I am surprised and sad that PM has not given an appointment to the CM despite writing letters 2-3 times. Will he behave like this with CMs of Goa and Maharashtra?", Congress leader Mallikarjuna Kharge said.
