Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the ongoing row over his educational qualifications, saying, "A country doesn't run on degrees". There are other problems in India, which nobody talks about, he said. The controversy should end "if our PM does not have a degree and he is running the nation well", Raut added.
