Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday denied charges of a political vendetta against the Congress in the National Herald case. Jaitley said the government had nothing to do with the private complaint lodged. He added, "Nobody in this country has immunity from law." Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned for the day after Congress protested an alleged political vendetta.
