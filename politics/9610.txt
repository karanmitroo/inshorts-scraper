Congress President Sonia Gandhi Monday brushed aside questions on daughter Priyanka's greater role in the party. She also seemed annoyed with questions on Rahul Gandhi. "You ask the same question again and again. You will get to know when he comes back," she snapped. There are speculations that Priyanka might be made AICC Secretary General to supplement Rahul.
