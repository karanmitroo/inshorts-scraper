Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday called the feud in the Samajwadi Party a 'drama, comedy and melody'. "It's a family drama. At times it's comedy, sometimes it's melody but it will end in tragedy," he stated. His reaction came after SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav had expelled his son Akhilesh Yadav from the party and later re-inducted him.
