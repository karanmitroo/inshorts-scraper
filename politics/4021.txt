The BJP is planning to send fewer outstation workers to the poll-bound states, according to a report. The BJP had lost both Bihar and Delhi elections as its leaders reportedly blamed sabotage and indifference of local workers. “We don’t want [a] repeat in [UP] and four other election-bound states. These are too crucial,” a BJP leader was quoted as saying.
