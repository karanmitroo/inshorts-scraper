BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has urged the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate to register a case against Congress President Sonia Gandhi over her letter to the then Finance Minister Chidambaram seeking to shield Tehelka magazine. Stating that a money laundering and corruption case should be filed against her, Swamy said Chidambaram and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were "equally culpable".
