Congress leader Manish Tewari on Saturday lashed out at the Narendra Modi-led government by questioning whether India was "doing business" with Islamic State in Libya. "Since foreign minister seems to have direct "hotline" to IS or ISIS in Libya what happened to 57 people from Punjab, are they dead or alive FM," Tewari tweeted, targeting Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.
