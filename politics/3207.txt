Asserting that there could be nothing more hilarious, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday termed Bihar's new rule on alcohol consumption by government servants a joke. "He is unable to stop people...in his own state...How will he know if they are drinking outside?" Modi asserted. Notably, Bihar government recently prohibited government servants from consuming alcohol anywhere in the world.
