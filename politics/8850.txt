Bihar CM Nitish Kumar tweeted on Monday, "50 lakh people of Bihar will join a signature campaign and send their samples to Modiji for a DNA test," in retaliation to Modi's comments regarding corruption being in Kumar's DNA. He'd earlier said Modi's comments insulted all Biharis, to which BJP had replied, "Bihar is not Nitish, Nitish is not Bihar."
