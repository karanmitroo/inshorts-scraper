Upset over suspended AAP leader Sandeep Kumar’s ‘objectionable’ act, members of the Valmiki community on Saturday protested outside Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, demanding him to resign on moral grounds. “The Dalit community has never been involved in things like these… we are here to protest against the corrupt ministers of Delhi government,” said a protester.
