After 'Iron Lady of Manipur' Irom Sharmila submitted the papers for her marriage in Kodaikanal, local activist V Mahendran has reportedly filed a petition requesting the government to deny her permission to get married. Mahendran fears Sharmila and her activist fiance' might be a threat to local peace and affect tourism after she suggested she would support local tribals' agitations.
