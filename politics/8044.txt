Dilip Ghosh, who shares close ties with the RSS, replaced Rahul Sinha as the new BJP President in West Bengal on Friday. The decision for Ghosh's appointment was reportedly owing to demands from leaders in Bengal's BJP unit for Sinha's removal ahead of the 2016 polls. Meanwhile, Sinha has been made a national secretary of the party.
