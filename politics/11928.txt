The poll expense ceiling for candidates contesting the upcoming Lok Sabha general elections has been raised from Rs.25 lakh to Rs.40 lakh. Joint CEO of West Bengal Saibal Barman said that the raise was effected in 2011 and came in force for Lok Sabha byelections only. However, some political parties are still not happy as they demanded a further rise.
