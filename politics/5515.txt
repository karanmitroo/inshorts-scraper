The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday derecognised five political parties including Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal. Other derecognised parties include Janata Dal (Secular), All India Forward Bloc, All India United Democratic Front, and Indian Union Muslim League. The action was taken after these parties failed to furnish their income tax returns and audit reports.
