Bihar BJP President Nityanand Rai on Monday said that if any "finger or hand was raised" against PM Narendra Modi, it would be broken or chopped off. He added that it should be a source of pride for all that Modi came from a poor family and had risen through the ranks to become the Prime Minister of the country.
