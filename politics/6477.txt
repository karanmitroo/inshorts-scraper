Former Uttarakhand CM Vijay Bahuguna, who switched sides from Congress along with eight other MLAs, has been inducted into BJP's National Executive. The rebel legislators had formally joined the BJP on May 19, after being expelled by the Uttarakhand Assembly Speaker. The MLAs had rebelled against the Harish Rawat-led government leading to the imposition of President's Rule in the state.
