Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday asserted that the BJP-AGP alliance will win and uproot the failed Congress government from Assam. Expressing confidence over the BJP-AGP alliance, he said its width and the geographical spread would play a crucial role in achieving victory in the state polls. "People of Assam are tired of slogans and they want development," Jaitley added.
