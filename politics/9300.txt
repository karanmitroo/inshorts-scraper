The BJP is planning to hold a grand celebration to mark the completion of one year of PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre. Reportedly, 250 rallies are scheduled across the country and the PM will address one of them. Furthermore, party legislatures will hold around 500 press conferences along with releasing e-books and booklets about the year's progress.
