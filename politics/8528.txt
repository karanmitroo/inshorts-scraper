Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi has alleged that PM Narendra Modi is weakening the “crying” farmers so that they give up farming and their lands could be taken easily. “We may be 40 to 45 (MPs) in Parliament but farmers and labourers are with us. These people are still not aware of the strength of our farmers,” he said.
