An ‘all-party meeting’ called by Tamil Nadu's opposition party DMK on the Cauvery issue on Tuesday urged the state government to immediately convene the state Assembly to discuss the matter. The meeting was boycotted by the ruling party AIADMK, BJP and all constituents of the four-party People’s Welfare Front. DMK’s allies Congress and IUML were among the meet's attendees.
