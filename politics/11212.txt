The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday did not rule out backing Third Front to stop BJP from coming to power, saying it may offer issue based support to a non-Congress "secular" dispensation. "Yes, we may extend issue based support if there is a situation that demands our support to a Third Front government," senior leader Gopal Rai said.
