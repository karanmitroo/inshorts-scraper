Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has alleged that his predecessor, late YS Rajasekhara Reddy, gave money to Maoists to kill him in 2003. This comes after YS Rajasekhara Reddy's son YS Jagan Mohan Reddy recently said that there is nothing wrong if Naidu is shot dead in public for duping people and seeking sympathy votes.
