Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday said, "If you (voters in Andhra) don't like my government, don't take the pensions and don't use the roads." He also asked his party leaders to demand votes since the government was doing a lot for voters. Speaking against electoral corruption, Naidu urged voters not to fall for corrupt parties offering money.
