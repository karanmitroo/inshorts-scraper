The Congress party will lodge a complaint with the Election Commission on Monday regarding the Rajya Sabha elections in Haryana, AICC General Secretary BK Hariprasad said. This comes after the votes of 14 Congress MLAs were declared invalid, which led to the loss of a Congress-backed candidate in the election. Hariprasad alleged a deliberate fraud while marking the ballot.
