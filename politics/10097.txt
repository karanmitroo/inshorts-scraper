Debashish Acharya, who had slapped Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday has been charged with 'attempt to murder'. On the contrary, TMC workers, who had brutally beaten up Acharya, have been charged with an attempt to commit culpable homicide 'not amounting to murder'. Currently, Acharya is in hospital in a 'critical condition' following deep wounds in his head.
