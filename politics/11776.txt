Former Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders Amar Singh and Jayaprada Monday joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Amar Singh was expelled from SP in 2010 and actor-turned-politician Jayaprada followed him in quitting the party. Addressing a press conference, RLD chief Ajit Singh said his party would be fighting on eight seats in western Uttar Pradesh.
