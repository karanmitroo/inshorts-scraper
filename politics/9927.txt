BJP's Delhi CM candidate Kiran Bedi on Tuesday sent a legal notice to AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for using her photograph in the party's poster campaign without her permission. In the posters, the picture of Kejriwal has the word "imandar" (honest) printed below it while that of Bedi has "avsarvadi" (opportunist).
