The Congress on Friday suspended Bir Devinder Singh from the party for six years on charges of indiscipline. The move came after a three-member committee of the party recommended his removal. They suggested that Singh, a former MLA, should be sacked for his outburst against Congress' Punjab Chief Amarinder Singh and for his failure to appear before the committee.
