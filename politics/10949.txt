"Don't look it as a Hindutva project. This is not a Hindutva project. This is a national project. Don't try to polarize politics through Ganga cleaning," Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on Sunday. The statement comes ahead of the first national dialogue on river Ganga - Ganga Manthan - being organized by the Centre tomorrow.
