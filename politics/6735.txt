Former Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma on Friday quit the Congress and rejoined the Samajwadi Party, claiming he "could not oppose Akhilesh Yadav in the coming assembly polls." Verma added, "I was feeling suffocated in the Congress for the past two years. I thank Sonia and Rahulji, but I could not adjust myself in the party in the present scenario."
