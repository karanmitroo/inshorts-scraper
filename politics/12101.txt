A section of clerics in Varanasi have issued a fatwa against the AAP cap (with the image) of a broom saying that the cap is anti-Islamic. Mufti board secretary Maulana Haseen Ahmad Habibi quoted that Muslims bow their head only before the Almighty and since a broom is used for cleaning garbage, Muslims must not wear it.
