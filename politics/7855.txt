The Congress has issued a show cause notice to the editor of its party magazine Sanjay Nirupam over controversial articles that were published recently. The editor has "a few days" to respond. An article had earlier called Congress President Sonia Gandhi's father a "fascist soldier" and another was critical of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's Kashmir, China and Tibet policies.
