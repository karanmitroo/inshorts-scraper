PM Narendra Modi Sunday said, he will not speak a word against the Shiv Sena as he has immense respect for Balasaheb Thackeray. Modiâ€™s reaction came on recurring reports over his silence on the breaking of the 25-year-old alliance with the Shiv Sena. He also launched a personal attack on NCP chief Sharad Pawar while addressing a rally in Maharashtra.
