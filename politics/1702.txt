Referring to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar as a "genuine leader", historian Ramachandra Guha has called for making Kumar the president of the Congress party. “For the Congress is a party without a leader and Nitish is a leader without a party,” Guha said. "If Congress gives him a chance to lead the UPA, it might have a future," he added.
