"We are looking at contesting over 400 seats in the coming general elections,'' AAP leader Prashant Bhushan said Tuesday. The party increased the seats from 200 to 400, following a strong response from across the country. However, AAP leader Gopal Rai said the party hadn't fixed any cap on the number of seats and was still exploring options.
