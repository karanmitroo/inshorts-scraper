The war of words between, Priyanka Gandhi and Varun Gandhi, escalated to a new level on Tuesday. Priyanka said that the Lok Sabha elections is "an ideological war" and that Varunâ€™s actions amounted to "betrayal" of the family. Varun also hit back accusing her of "crossing limits of decency" and said that one cannot raise one's stature by belittling somebody.
