Former Maharashtra Medical Education Minister, Vijaykumar Gavit, who faces charges of wealth accumulation in a disproportionate assets case, joined the BJP on Saturday. The NCP leader was sacked from the Maharashtra Cabinet earlier this year, after his daughter Heena Gavit accepted a BJP Lok Sabha ticket to contest from Nandurbar, and went on to win the election.
