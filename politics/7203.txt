The AIADMK has sought an apology from the BJP over Union Minister Piyush Goyal's comment on Tamil Nadu and its government. State Minister O Panneerselvam called Goyal's statement a "preposterous" and "unsubstantiated" allegation. Goyal had on Friday called Tamil Nadu a state within a state, saying he could not contact the ministers of the Jayalalithaa government even after several attempts.
