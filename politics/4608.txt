Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi has urged the Law Ministry to make paid news an offence to check malpractices in elections. "At present, we determine which news item is paid and add the expenses incurred to the candidates' expenses. But with most candidates reporting poll expenses only 50% of the limit, we need to... make it an offence," Zaidi said.
