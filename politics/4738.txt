The Punjab Election Commission has issued a notice to the Aam Aadmi Party over the Dalit-specific manifesto which the party had released recently, calling it "caste-based" politics. "We had sent an advisory to all political parties to submit copies of their manifesto to the commission. AAP has failed to do so," said Chief Electoral Officer VK Singh.
