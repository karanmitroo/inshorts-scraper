Samjawadi Party leader Azam Khan, who has been banned by the Election Commission from campaigning, on Sunday attacked the EC and said the poll panel is acting at the behest of Congress government at the Centre. "The Election Commission will have to prove its integrity," Azam said threatening to knock the doors of the court against the poll panel.
