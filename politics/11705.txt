BJP Saturday fielded actor Paresh Rawal as the party candidate from Ahmedabad East Lok Sabha constituency, instead of sitting MP Harin Pathak, who is a seven-time Lok Sabha member and is considered close to LK Advani. With this, Rawal has joined the league of Bollywood actors fielded by the party, including Hema Malini and Shatrughan Sinha.
