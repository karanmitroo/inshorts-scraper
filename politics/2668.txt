Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee has said the BSP and SP should contest the 2019 General Elections as allies as Congress is weak in Uttar Pradesh. SP and Congress can move court like Mayawati over EVMs tampering, she said. "Donâ€™t be surprised if you see Trinamool Congress leading the nation or offering crucial support to the next government," Banerjee added.
