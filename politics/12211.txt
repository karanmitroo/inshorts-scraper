Irritated by a sudden spurt of 10,900 likes on his FB page over 24 hours (between Tuesday and Wednesday), former Union railway minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has lodged a police complaint. "Usually, 10-20 'likes' are received on my Facebook page every day, but thousands of 'likes' was alarming," Bansal said. Notably, Bansal's FB page was also hacked earlier.
