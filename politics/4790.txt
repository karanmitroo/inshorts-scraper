Congress leader Anand Sharma on Monday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move has made the people of the country cashless. He further said, "Only 4% of the people in this country have credit cards. He (Modi) has made the people cashless but cannot make the country cashless... He has made people beg for their own money."
