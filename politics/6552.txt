The Congress on Wednesday accused the Left-front government in Tripura of brainwashing students with communism by removing Mahatma Gandhi from school textbooks, and keeping them unaware of India's real history. It is a long-term conspiracy of removing the role of leaders of Indian freedom movement while including Karl Marx and Adolf Hitler in the books, Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said.
