Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday said that Delhi's real pollution problem is political, not environmental. This came after Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave dismissed Delhi government's claims that neighbouring states are responsible for pollution in the national capital. The NGT has collectively slammed Delhi and 4 other states for not taking adequate steps to contain pollution.
