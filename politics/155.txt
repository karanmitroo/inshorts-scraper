Speaking at an interactive session on India's fiscal reforms, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Monday slammed Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley saying, "If I was in Jaitley's position, I would have resigned." He further said, "He (FM Jaitley) is perhaps in the unenviable situation of having to read a budget speech written by others, written in other places."
