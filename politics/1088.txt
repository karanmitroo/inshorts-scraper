DMK working President MK Stalin has released a video of him working out in a gym as a public relations strategy. This video uses several captions like 'Never Give Up', 'Rise Up For Challenge' with a montage of his videos during workout sessions. However, senior leaders of the party have dismissed the campaign as being unnecessary.
