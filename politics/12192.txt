Arvind Kejriwal (45) was sworn in Saturday as Delhi's youngest CM, as an estimated one-lakh people cheered for him at Ramlila Maidan. "I appeal to my party let us never become arrogant... we are here to serve... The whole fight is for a change of governance," he said, urging the city people not to seek or offer a bribe ever.
