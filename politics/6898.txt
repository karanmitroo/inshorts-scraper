The Election Commission on Saturday ordered filing of an FIR against TMC leader Sonali Guha, after she was caught on video allegedly ordering party workers to beat CPI(M) polling agents. "Drive out the CPI-M agents by beating them, they have damaged the EVM," she said. This happened after an EVM malfunctioned in her constituency, leading to temporary suspension of voting.
