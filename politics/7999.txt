Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal on Wednesday urged PM Narendra Modi to intervene and name Chandigarh's new airport after Bhagat Singh. Badal said that Bhagat Singh enjoys a national and international following on par with Gandhi and Mandela, and it could end the controversies related to naming the airport. Earlier, Haryana government had recommended Jan Sangh leader Mangal Sein's name.
