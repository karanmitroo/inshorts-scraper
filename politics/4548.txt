Four members of Punjab's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), including the founder member Colonel CM Lakhanpal, quit the party on Sunday to join Congress. AAP has started bringing in people with not so clean background and is compromising on principles, Lakhanpal alleged. Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh claimed that people are leaving AAP because the party lacks principle.
