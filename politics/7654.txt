Leaders of CPI(M), CPI and JD(U) on Saturday called on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, seeking an “independent” magisterial probe to establish the "authenticity" of evidence produced against JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar. Kumar was on Friday arrested on charges of sedition in connection with an event organised in JNU against the hanging of 2001 Parliament House attack convict Afzal Guru.
