The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday sought disqualification of 20 Uttarakhand MLAs for allegedly occupying offices of profit. Nine MLAs were appointed as Parliamentary Secretaries by the Harish Rawat-led Uttarakhand government, while 11 others were appointed as different boards' heads, the AAP said. This comes after the President withheld assent to the Delhi government's 'office of profit' bill.
