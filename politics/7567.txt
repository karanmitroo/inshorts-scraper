Appealing the Jat protesters to suspend their agitation, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh  said on Monday that the government's decision to call the army for containing the protests "cannot be justified". Calling it a "dangerous start" by the BJP government, he said that calling the Army to deal with "local political fights", is a "very dangerous thing".
