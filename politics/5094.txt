Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said the "belated criticism"  on the one-day ban imposed on NDTV India was "ill-informed and politically inspired". Further, Naiduâ€‹ asserted that people of the country should know that the UPA Government, during 2005-14, had also ordered several TV channels to go off air on 21 occasions.
