BJP chief Amit Shah hit back at critics on Monday, citing the Dadri lynching and murder of rationalists as a concern for parties ruling those states. "Law and order is a state issue. You all know that. We have nothing to do with it", Shah said. He questioned the media over having an 'agenda' over repeated questioning on Dadri.
