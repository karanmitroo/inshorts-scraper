The opposition JD(S) on Wednesday launched its first Namma Appaji canteen, ideated and sponsored by JD(S) leader TA Sharavana, in Bengaluru's Hanumantha Nagar. The canteen provides food at subsidised rates and charges only ₹5 to ₹10 for a meal. The ruling Congress has received criticism for demolishing heritage buildings for the construction of Indira Canteens aimed at providing subsidised food.
