In an alleged reference to PM Narendra Modi's silence over the $1.7 billion Punjab National Bank scam, Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted that PM should stop behaving as if he is guilty. Questioning how the accused in the scam managed to flee the country, the Congress had earlier called Nirav Modi "chhota Modi". The BJP had called the remark derogatory.
