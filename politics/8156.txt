To end the deadlock over the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, PM Narendra Modi on Friday invited Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh to hold discussions over tea. The Congress has made several non-negotiable demands regarding the Bill. It will be the first face-to-face meeting between Gandhi and Modi since the latter became the PM.
