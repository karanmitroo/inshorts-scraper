Congress leader Tom Vadakkan on Tuesday said, "40 days of demonetisation, 124 notifications this is almost three notifications per day. This government has made a mess of demonetisation." Vadakkan added, "Starting from the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, RBI governor, who is responsible for this mess? I think the people of the country would like to know."
