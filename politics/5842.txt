Amid Bihar's worsening flood situation, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said, "It was fortunate and a welcome sight to find the Ganga at one's doorsteps". He said the flood victims were lucky as in most cases a person has to go to the river. Lalu's comments came on the day flood victims held demonstrations against inadequate flood relief.
