In a major faux pas, Mohammad Yousuf Bhat, the congress party candidate from Ganderbal (J&K), has sparked a controversy by mentioning his 'daughter's marriage' as a liability in his nomination papers. Bhat, however, said that he is illiterate and that his papers were filed by his aide. He has also been reprimanded by the party high command over the incident.
