BJP MLA Anil Bonde has alleged that the Maharashtra government grants more funds for the maintenance of animals in fodder camps than for children living in orphanages and state-run children's homes. He further alleged that a fodder camp receives ₹70 for the upkeep of an animal while orphanages and state-run children homes are paid ₹30 for a child per day.
