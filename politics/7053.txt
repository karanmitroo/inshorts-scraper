Makkal DMDK, the breakaway group of the Vijayakanth-led DMDK, on Monday extended unconditional support to the DMK. The party was founded on Sunday by expelled DMDK functionaries, who supported an alliance with DMK, opposing the party's tie-up with PWF. "We did not make any demand that we should be given a specified number of seats," party chief VC Chandrakumar said.
