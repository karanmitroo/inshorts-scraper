AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday promised to scrap Residential House Tax in the city if voted to power in MCD. AAP has worked out the mathematics and the money saved from corruption would be used to cover the shortfall after scrapping the house tax, he said. "Public is harassed in the name of collection of house tax," he added.
