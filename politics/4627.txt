Ahead of the upcoming elections, Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal (89) has asked people to give him "another chance" to serve them, as it will "add ten years" to his life. The five-time CM of the state is also the oldest serving Chief Minister in India. Notably, Badal's political career started in 1947, when he was elected as a sarpanch.
