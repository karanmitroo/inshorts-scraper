Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said he's a “disciplined Swayamsevak” while refusing to comment on the controversy around Goa unit of the RSS. “I am swayamsevak, I follow RSS. You will have to go to shakha to follow RSS,” he added. The RSS had recently removed its Goa unit chief Subhash Velingkar for working against the BJP-led Goa government.
