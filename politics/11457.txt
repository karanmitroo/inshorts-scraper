A local court in Kutch district of Gujarat on Wednesday asked AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to appear within ten days for alleged breach of model code of conduct during his 'fact finding' tour last month. The former Delhi chief minister, during his four-day "reality check" tour of Gujarat, had addressed a public gathering using a loudspeaker without prior permission.
