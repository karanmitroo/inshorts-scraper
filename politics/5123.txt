BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday termed Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘vikas rath yatra’ as “bankrupt yatra”. Had Samajwadi Party (SP) “really worked” for people’s welfare, it “would not have needed to take out the yatra with massive government expenditure”, she added. Akhilesh's luxury rath worth crores of rupees made the rath yatra bankrupt at the very start, she said.
