The Congress on Tuesday termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech as "most disappointing" and demanded that he acknowledge the failure of his government to deliver on its promises to the people. "Modi's promise of curbing black money remains a sham, and his government has promoted black money hoarding and crony capitalism," senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said.
