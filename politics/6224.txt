The Congress on Monday accused the central government of obstructing, delaying and defeating judicial appointments by “stealth”. The party alleged that the government was hitting back at the judiciary for striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act. “The… government has unleashed several degrees of innuendos, sarcasm, open criticism of court judgments,” the party said.
