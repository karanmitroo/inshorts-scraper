The Parliament on Thursday witnessed uproar over the naming of Chandigarh airport after Bhagat Singh, as the Opposition alleged that the BJP government in Haryana refused to do so. "The Punjab government had agreed that the airport will be named after Bhagat Singh, but Haryana CM said 'no'. They want to name it after Mangal Sein," a CPM minister said.
