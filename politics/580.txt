The BJP-led Haryana government has created only 3,000 job opportunities for youths in the state during their three-year tenure, Congress MP Deepender Hooda has claimed. The government admitted that it has given jobs to only nine lakh youths across the country so far, against its poll promise of two crore jobs every year, he further said.
