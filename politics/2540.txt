As a section of a crowd started chanting 'Modi, Modi' at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's rally on Sunday, the latter said that if chanting 'Modi, Modi' can solve problems, then even he would chant the PM's name. "Can chanting Modi, Modi get the House Tax exempted? Can it reduce the electricity bill rates," Kejriwal asked.
