An AAP woman activist, who had earlier registered a case of molestation against a party colleague, on Wednesday allegedly committed suicide in Delhi. Her family claimed she was suffering from depression after her alleged molester was released on bail. The BJP has claimed that AAP leaders had ignored her "harassment" complaint and that this shows the "anti-woman" character of AAP.
