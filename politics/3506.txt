Assam Assembly Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami on Monday suspended AIUDF MLA Aminul Islam for three days for using Facebook Live to telecast his speech from inside the House. "It is a matter of great regret. The Ethics Committee recommended suspension of the member," he said. The AIUDF leader later confessed that he had committed a mistake and accepted the verdict.
