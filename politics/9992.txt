As the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is carrying out fund-raising campaigns to fight the upcoming Delhi elections, a beggar near Ghazipur crossing in the city gave party chief Arvind Kejriwal a 'donation' of Rs 5. "Yest, a beggar at ghazipur cross gave me Rs 5 to fight elections. It moved me to tears", wrote the emotional leader on Twitter.
