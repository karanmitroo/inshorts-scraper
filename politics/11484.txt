The Prime Minister's Office on Sunday rubbished as "baseless and mischievous" the contention of former media adviser to PM, Sanjaya Baru, that PMO files were seen by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. "Baru's book is an attempt to misuse a privileged position and access to high office to gain credibility and to apparently exploit it for commercial gain," it added.
