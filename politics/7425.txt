Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said it was because of his pressure that the government decided to roll-back tax on Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) withdrawals. He said, "Whenever somebody is being oppressed wrongly or victimized, I tend to try and help those people. I felt that the salaried and the middle-class people were being hurt by the government."
