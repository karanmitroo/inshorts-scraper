Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday alleged that the Congress has become content with being the tail-ender of alliances in its desperation to form an anti-BJP front in poll-bound states. Jaitley alleged that the Congress has lowered its ambition by forming an alliance with regional parties, giving examples of states like Bihar, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu in this regard.
