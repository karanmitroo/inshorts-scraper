Late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa had claimed to be attacked by MLAs in the Legislative Assembly in 1989. In an interview, Jayalalithaa said that she was dragged, hit, and pulled by saree in the presence of then CM Karunanidhi. That day I vowed to enter the Assembly only as a CM and I did it within two years, Jayalalithaa added.
