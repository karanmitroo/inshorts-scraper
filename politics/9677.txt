While presenting the budget for 2015-2016 on Tuesday, the Akhilesh Yadav govt of UP said it would reintroduce free laptops scheme for the meritorious students and the Kanya Vidya Dhan scheme to encourage education of girls. The Samajwadi Party govt, however, dropped the unemployment allowance scheme, which it had promised in its election manifesto during 2011 state assembly polls.
