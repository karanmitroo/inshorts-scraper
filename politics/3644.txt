Addressing a poll rally in Punjab, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said that Punjab, which shares borders with Pakistan, needs a strong government like SAD-BJP's to protect the country from infiltrators from across the border. "Congress labelled the youth of state as terrorists, while few others are calling them drug addicts. That cannot be accepted," PM Modi added.
