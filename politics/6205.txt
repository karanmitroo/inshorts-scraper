Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the economic reforms of 1991 "happened not because of the Congress but in spite of the Congress". He said that credit should be given to "the Narasimha Rao-Manmohan Singh combine" for taking steps to integrate India with the world. The reforms were initiated in response to India's balance of payment crisis of 1991.
