Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's close aide Locket Chatterjee quit the party and joined BJP on Thursday. Bengali film actor Locket's decision came on the same day when Mamata's another aide Srinjoy Bose resigned from the TMC. Locket alleged that she felt claustrophobic in the Trinamool and was not able to do the work.
