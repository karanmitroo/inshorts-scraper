Olympic medallist boxer Mary Kom and BJP leader Subramanian Swamy took oath as members of the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. The government had last week nominated Swamy, writer Narendra Jadhav, journalist Swapan Dasgupta and Kom to the Upper House. Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi and cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who were also nominated, are yet to take their oaths.
