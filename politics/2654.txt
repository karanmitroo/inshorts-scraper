Speaking about the issue of meat shortage in Uttar Pradesh, Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in the Lok Saba said, "We are not providing meat to lion... Hope no one says tomorrow that lions should survive by eating palak paneer." This comes amid Yogi Adityanath-led government's crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses. Closure of illegal and mechanised slaughterhouses was BJP's pre-poll promise.
