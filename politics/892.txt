Senior Gujarat Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil has claimed that Patidar leader Hardik Patel has Sardar Patel's DNA. Sardar Patel's great-grandnephew Sameer Patel slammed Gohil's remark and said that Sardar Patel worked to unify the nation while Hardik was dividing the country. This comes after a sex video allegedly featuring Hardik went viral ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections.
