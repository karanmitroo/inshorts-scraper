Responding to yoga guru Baba Ramdev's controversial remark over homosexuality, Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee sent a defamation notice to Ramdev on Thursday. The notice demands Ramdev to withdraw his statement within 7 days and express regrets for it on television news channels. Ramdev had reportedly said, "It appears that many Congress activists were supporting gay sex as they are homosexuals."
