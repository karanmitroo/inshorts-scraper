A US court has dismissed 1984 anti-Sikh riots case against Congress President Sonia Gandhi due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. New York-based human rights group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) had filed the lawsuit against Gandhi in 2013 for allegedly protecting Congress leaders accused of inciting violence against the Sikhs. Reportedly, SFJ now plans to challenge the court's order.
