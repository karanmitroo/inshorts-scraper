Congress leader Manish Tewari has said that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar possibly speaks more than he acts. Tewari's comments came against the backdrop of PM Modi lauding the Indian Army and Parrikar for carrying out surgical strikes in PoK. Like our army which doesn't speak, but displays its valour, our Defence Minister also doesn't speak, but acts, PM had said.
