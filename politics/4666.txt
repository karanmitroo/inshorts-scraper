Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that demonetisation alone cannot curb black money menace in the country. However, he added that he supports the Centre's demonetisation move. "I believe it alone will not serve the purpose until crack down on Benami properties, including gold and jewellery stashed with people, is made by the Centre," he added.
