Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday said that it would be difficult for the BJP to win Goa election without the support of RSS, from where the party's "foot soldiers" come. "I was shown a video clip wherein (RSS rebel leader) Subhash Velingkar used such words against BJP, which I can't even mention," he said.
