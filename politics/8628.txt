Delhi Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra on Thursday expressed his support for lowering the legal age for drinking in the capital. "I am against any law that is not in tune with reality," the minister added. Presently, five states and union territories besides Delhi have 25 as the legal drinking age, while the figure is 21 or 18 in most states.
