Jammu and Kashmir CM Mufti Mohammed Sayeed (79), who had been admitted in Delhi's AIIMS hospital a few days ago, is in a critical but stable condition, said doctors on Sunday. "He is conscious, alert and is eating properly," doctors added. However, they also said that pneumonia is still a cause of concern considering Mufti's age.
