Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said Friday that the mass-cheating photographs surfacing the media doesn't reflect the reality of the entire state. "Students of Bihar are brilliant and have set an example in the country. A student progresses in life with his capability, not because of certificates," Nitish added. He also urged parents to tell their children not to cheat.
