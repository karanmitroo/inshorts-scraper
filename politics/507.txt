Reacting to Congress leader P Chidambaram's criticism of the government's policy on J&K, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Sunday said, "The problem of Jammu and Kashmir is misgiving of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's misadventures." Earlier, Chidambaram had slammed the government, saying that its militaristic approach to the Kashmir situation had failed to end militancy and insurgency.
