The Hindu Yuva Vahini, founded by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, is planning to revive anti-Romeo squads in Gujarat as part of its expansion plans in the BJP-ruled state to spread awareness about "true Hindu culture". The outfit aims to induct over 6 lakh members within six months and plans to keep a check on conversion and cow slaughter.
