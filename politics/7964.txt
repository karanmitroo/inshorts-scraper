BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav has said that the RSS believes that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh would reunite one day to form “Akhand Bharat”, through "popular goodwill" rather than war. The comments were made public after PM Narendra Modi's stopover in Lahore on Friday. Madhav clarified that RSS’ ideology is for India’s supremacy and is not "aggressive" or "fascist".
