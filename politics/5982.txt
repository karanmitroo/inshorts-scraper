Opposition AIADMK on Tuesday demanded that the Centre grant special category status to Puducherry to end "the current tussle" between CM V Narayanasamy and Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi. "The government is now in coma condition," the party claimed. This comes amid reports that Kiran Bedi interferes with the administration, including meeting Congress leaders, considered as the CM's rivals.
