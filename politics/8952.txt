The BJP on Thursday levelled bribe charges against Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh and raised questions about Singh's dealings with a Shimla-based LIC agent, Anand Chauhan. The saffron party also alleged that Chauhan opened a ghost bank account to facilitate Virbhadra Singh and his family. The development comes a day after BJP levelled corruption charges on Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat.
