Karnataka legislative assembly speaker Kagodu Thimmappa claims to not know who Digvijay Singh is. "Who is Digvijaya Singh? I don't know who he was," Thimmappa said, on Monday.  In response to the speaker's statement, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Digvijay Singh, sarcastically said "I will soon introduce myself to Thimmappa".
