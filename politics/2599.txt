Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Wednesday objected to Skill Development Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy giving detailed answers to supplementaries posed to him. "Is it an answer or a speech?" Yadav asked in the House. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan responded that she has already told members and ministers to restrict their questions and answers.
