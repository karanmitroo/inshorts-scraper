Karnataka Tourism Minister Priyank Kharge has slammed his Goa counterpart Manohar Ajgaonkar for planning a ban on Lamanis' entry into Goa. "First of all, he should have something substantial to say, that these people are indulging in drugsâ€¦crime is not limited to one community alone," he said. Notably, Lamanis is a nomadic tribe that mostly hails from Karnataka.
