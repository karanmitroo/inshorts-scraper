The BJP on Tuesday accused the Congress of playing with national security in the Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case. Citing the recent RTI disclosure that then Home Minister P Chidambaram had signed the first affidavit, which suggested that Jahan was an LeT operative, BJP minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, "Sonia Gandhi cleverly worked on this... She worked together with Chidambaram."
