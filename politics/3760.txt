West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday slammed the Narendra Modi government for presenting the Union Budget on February 1, which is celebrated as Saraswati Puja in West Bengal. "Do Saraswati bandana (prayer) and not your bandana," she asserted. Banerjee further asked why Saraswati Puja was not being celebrated in a big way instead of the Budget being presented.
