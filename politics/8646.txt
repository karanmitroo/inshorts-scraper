Joy Banerjee, an actor-turned BJP leader in Bengal, on Sunday sparked a row by saying that the Election Commission (EC) is under the control of his party. Accusing the Trinamool Congress party of using unfair means in Lok Sabha elections, Banerjee said, "[I]n the coming assembly election it will not be possible as it will be held under Army vigilance".
