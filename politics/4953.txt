Leading a protest march against demonetisation ahead of the Parliament's Winter Session, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said, "Initially ATM meant 'All Time Money', now it's 'Aayega Tab Milega'." Mamata also staged a march from the Parliament to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. ATM is an acronym for Automated Teller Machine.
