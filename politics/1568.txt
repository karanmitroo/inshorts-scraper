Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said nobody has the capacity to take on PM Narendra Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Notably, Kumar had earlier ended his 17-year-old alliance with the BJP in 2013 over the party's decision to nominate Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate in 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
