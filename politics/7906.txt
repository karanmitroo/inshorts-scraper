BJP leader and former External Affairs minister Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday said it is "futile" to talk to Pakistan as it has "never kept its promises". Sinha added that terrorism is the only issue that needs to be spoken about and these should happen between the National Security Advisors of both countries. Earlier, Sinha had attacked the BJP's foreign policy.
