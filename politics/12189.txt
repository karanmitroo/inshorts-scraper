Ending months of speculation, former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa on Monday said he would return to the BJP. Yeddyurappa was made to quit as CM in 2011 over the findings of Lokayukta indicting him on illegal mining issue. Subsequently, he had formed KJP in December last year, ending his 40-year-long association with BJP.
