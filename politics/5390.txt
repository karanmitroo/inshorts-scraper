Bihar CM Nitish Kumar should be arrested if any liquor is found in Bihar, following the ban from October 2, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said. Adding that he does not oppose the ban, Paswan said he is against the 'draconian' provisions of the law. Notably, the Supreme Court had earlier stayed Patna HC's decision to scrap the law.
