Amid the ongoing uproar by the Opposition, Samajwadi Party MP Akshay Yadav on Thursday tore some papers and threw them at the Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan. Following this, the house was adjourned. Akshay Yadav, an MP from Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh, is the nephew of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav. Notably, the party had initially supported the demonetisation move.
