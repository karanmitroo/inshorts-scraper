The BJP has asked the Election Commission to deploy women police personnel at the booths ahead of phase VI and VII polling in Uttar Pradesh for proper verification of the burqa-clad voters. "Adequate deployment of female police would ensure proper checking of women voters, and at the same time, minimise incidents of bogus voting," the party said.
