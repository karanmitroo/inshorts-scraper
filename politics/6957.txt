Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday questioned how PM Narendra Modi would protect India’s borders from intrusion when he could not even save the fishes in Indian waters from foreign fishermen. "The BJP and the Trinamool have banned fishermen's trawlers, but neighbouring countries' fishermen are openly fishing into the Indian waters,” she claimed, addressing a rally in West Bengal.
