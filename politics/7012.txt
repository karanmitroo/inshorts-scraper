The Shiv Sena on Monday slammed Maharashtra's Rural Development and Water Conservation Minister Pankaja Munde for clicking selfies with farmers during her visit to the drought-hit Latur district. Calling the event "unfortunate", Sena leader Manisha Kayande said, "I think ministers should watch their actions before doing such things. I think that Pankaja Munde should have avoided this."
