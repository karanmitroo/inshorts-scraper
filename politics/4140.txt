After the arrest of TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay in the Rose Valley chit fund scam, Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said that PM Modi and Amit Shah should be arrested instead because they don't understand Indian politics. "If they [BJP] think that after the arrest we won't protest, they are wrong. [We] will take the legal battle forward," she added.
