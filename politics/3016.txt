Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asked, "Do BJP leaders know anything besides committing rapes". "They are unable to run the country...The only thing they know is to give rape threats every day," he tweeted. Kejriwal was referring to a report which stated that the girls who had allegedly exposed gender divide in Banaras Hindu University are getting rape threats.
