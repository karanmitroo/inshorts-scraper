Expressing dissent over demonetisation, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhury on Wednesday said people are now waiting in bank queues with ludo and scrabble. "Chappal ghis gaye hain, queue mey khaday khaday," she added. Earlier, Congress termed demonetisation a "colossal disaster" and said it's a publicity stunt by PM Narendra Modi to divert people's attention from his government's failures.
