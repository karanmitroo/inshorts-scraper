Rubbishing AAP's charges, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said that the Home Ministry had not ordered Delhi Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar's arrest. "The law takes its own course. There is no interference by the MHA in any such matter," Singh said. AAP leader Ashutosh had earlier said that Tomar's arrest was a conspiracy hatched in the Home Ministry.
