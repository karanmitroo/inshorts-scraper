Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday led the Opposition's walkout from the Parliament over no obituary references being made for the seven soldiers who were martyred in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Nagrota. "It is the rule and tradition of the Parliament...this is the first time that this has not happened," Rahul Gandhi said.
