Offering condolences to families of CRPF troopers killed in Sukma attack, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Monday said the attack calls for political responsibility and public accountability. "Will we see anyone own this failure?â€¦CRPF is without a DG: the govt is clearly unconcerned about internal security, whether it be Kashmir or goons killing in the name of cow," he tweeted.
