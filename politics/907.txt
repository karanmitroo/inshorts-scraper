NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said the situation in poll-bound Gujarat was in favour of the Congress. "The traders community which has been with the BJP so far now stands alienated due to decisions like demonetisation and GST rollout," he added. The two-phase Gujarat state assembly elections are scheduled for next month.
