The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday questioned Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in connection with the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. Earlier, in its closure report, the CBI had acquitted Tytler of all the charges. However, a Delhi court in December 2015 rejected the closure report and directed the CBI to re-investigate his involvement in the case.
