Tripura TMC MLA Sudip Roy Barman on Monday grabbed the Speaker's ceremonial mace and ran out of the state Assembly as a protest against the Speaker. The MLA reportedly apologised for his behaviour later, but defended his actions. Notably, this is the third such incident of mace snatching in the history of Tripura Assembly since becoming a state in 1972.
