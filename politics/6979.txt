The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Friday said that it will not contest in the upcoming May 16 by-elections in Ghazipur and Bilari, Uttar Pradesh. The party's State Unit Chief Ram Achal Rajbhar said that this was to prepare for 2017 Assembly elections in the state. The Ghazipur and Bilari seats fell vacant after their two sitting MLAs passed away.
