Expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa has moved the Supreme Court seeking a CBI probe into the death of former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa. Pushpa called her death "suspicious" as her actual medical condition was not disclosed, nobody was allowed to meet her and her funeral photographs showed embalming marks. Jayalalithaa passed away on December 5 following a cardiac arrest.
