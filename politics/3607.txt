Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has sparked a controversy for staying in the house of alleged ex-militant and Khalistan Liberation Front activist Gurwinder Singh during his Punjab visit on Saturday. Singh, an acquitted Khalistan Commando Force militant, is accused of inciting Sikh-Hindu riots in Punjab and was jailed in various cases including murder. He is reportedly working for KLF from England.
