Meghalaya MLA Julius Dorphang, accused of raping a minor girl, was arrested in Guwahati on Friday. The absconding legislator, who had been wanted in connection with sex racket involving a 14-year-old girl, has been brought to Shillong. The racket came to light after an employee of the guest house, where the crime took place, was arrested for pimping last month.
