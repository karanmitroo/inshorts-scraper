After an ex-serviceman committed suicide at Jantar Mantar, Delhi, allegedly over the OROP issue, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said that those who commit suicide cannot be called shaheed (martyr). "Shaheed are those who lay down their lives at the border, not who commit suicide," Khattar said. Earlier, Union Minister VK Singh had asked to probe the deceased's mental condition.
