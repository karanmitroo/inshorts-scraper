Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Saturday said his party's organisational structure was "no match" to the BJP-RSS. He said the organisational structure was the ability to pull out votes on an election day. Further, Chidambaram said the Congress party needs 29 different strategies for the 29 states in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
