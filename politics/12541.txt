With 7,000-volunteers expected in the city, Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party has asked Delhiites to offer accommodation cost-free to its volunteers, ahead of the assembly elections on December-4, and has received a positive response. The party has already been funding itself by donations from voters with people not only chipping in cash but also spare mobiles, laptops and office spaces.
