Induction of expelled JD(U) leader Sabir Ali on Friday triggered angry protests within BJP, with senior leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi terming him as a "friend" of Indian Mujahideen chief Yasin Bhatkal. “Terrorist Bhatakal friend join BJP... soon accepting dawood…,” tweeted Naqvi, who alleged that Bhatkal was arrested from Ali's Mumbai residence some time ago. Consequently, Ali’s membership was cancelled Saturday.
