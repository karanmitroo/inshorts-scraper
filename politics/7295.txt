Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday linked "rising Naxalism" to the need for reservations in the private sector. Paswan asserted that the reason behind the growth of Naxalism is the snatching away of gold and coal-rich lands from people without giving them jobs. He asked the Modi government to take "affirmative action" and reserve jobs in the private sector.
