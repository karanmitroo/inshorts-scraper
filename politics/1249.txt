Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Narayan Rane reportedly resigned from the party on Thursday. Rane had earlier expressed his unhappiness with the party's decision to ignore him for the Chief Minister's post when Congress was in power in Maharashtra. Notably, Rane had joined the Congress in 2005 after being expelled from the Shiv Sena by Bal Thackeray.
