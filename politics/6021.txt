Expelled Uttar Pradesh BJP leader Dayashankar Singh was released from jail on Sunday after he was arrested for comparing BSP chief Mayawati to a prostitute. This comes a day after a local court granted him bail. After the BSP party said they will challenge the bail in the High Court, Dayashankar said, "I accept all the challenges of the BSP."
