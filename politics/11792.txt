AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has been booked by police for violating the election code of conduct after he used loudspeakers and microphones in Gandhidham in Kutch allegedly without permission. Earlier, the Election Commission had also said that Kejriwal, who began a four-day tour of Gujarat Wednesday, by not taking police permission for his road-show violated the model code of conduct.
