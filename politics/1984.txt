In the wake of recent Rohtak gangrape, Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry Kiran Bedi has said that instead of "Beti Bachao Beti Padhao", the new slogan for India should be "Beti Bachao Apni Apni". She further said, "Haryana kind of brutal murder with rape and gangrapes will not go away till parents realise their responsibility of careful and watchful nurturance."
