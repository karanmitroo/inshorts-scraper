RSS on Tuesday said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi's recent 'hawabaaz' remark on PM Narendra Modi was her attempt to hide fear. In its mouthpiece 'Panchjanya', RSS wrote, "Congress President's anti-government accusations are actually rooted in her frustration over being left behind in the political race... made just three days after government accepted to implement OROP."
