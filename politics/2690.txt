State-run Air India has blacklisted Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad for hitting its staffer, Delhi Airport Manager Harinder Singh said. Gaikwad has said Air India misled him by giving a business class ticket despite not having a business class section in the flight. FIRs have also been lodged after Gaikwad admitted to hitting the staffer "25 times" with slippers.
