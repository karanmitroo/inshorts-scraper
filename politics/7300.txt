Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said that the NDA government is "still committed to the agenda for governance" in Jammu and Kashmir. His statement comes after BJP President Amit Shah met PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti in Delhi on Friday. However, the agenda for this meeting remained unclear. The parties are yet to agree on government formation in the state.
