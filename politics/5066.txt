The Supreme Court on Tuesday cancelled the bail of rape-accused RJD MLA Raj Ballabh Yadav and ordered him to surrender before a Bihar lower court. Yadav has been charged with the rape of a minor girl at his Bihar Sharif residence. He had surrendered in March, but was later granted bail by the Patna High Court on September 30.
