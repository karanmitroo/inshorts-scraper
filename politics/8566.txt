Organisers of the concert by Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali cancelled the show in the aftermath of the Shiv Sena raising objections to a Pakistani singer's performing in Mumbai. The concert organisers met Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray to seek his intervention in the matter, but the discussions were unsuccessful. Ghulam Ali has performed in Mumbai earlier.
