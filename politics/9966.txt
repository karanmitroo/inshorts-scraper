Sparking a controversy, Union minister Nitin Gadkari Tuesday said that the government at the Centre is that of 'Ram Bhakts' and those who shout ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans. He made such remarks while announcing the construction of ‘Ram-Janki Marg’, connecting Ayodhya with Janakpur in Nepal. The Ram Van Gaman Marg will also be upgraded to a national highway, he added.
