Speaking at a public rally, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said, "Yogi Adityanath Ji has done what CMs of UP never didâ€“ he came to Noida." Adityanath had visited Noida on Saturday, breaking the 'Noida jinx', due to which his predecessors refrained from coming to the city as it is widely believed that whoever visits Noida, loses power.
