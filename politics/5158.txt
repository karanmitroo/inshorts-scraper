Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has asked people to donate money to AAP as the party will contest the upcoming Punjab Assembly polls in 2017. Alleging that Akalis would spend "their ill-gotten money from drugs", Kejriwal said, "How can you expect the schemes of social welfare from the political parties, which contest elections with the money donated by the corporate houses?".
