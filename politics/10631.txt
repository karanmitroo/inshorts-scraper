AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan and two others were on Saturday put on trial by a Delhi court on defamation charges in a complaint filed by Amit Sibal, son of ex-minister Kapil Sibal. Amit had alleged that AAP leaders had said he had taken advantage of his fatherâ€™s position to represent a telecom company in court cases in Delhi.
