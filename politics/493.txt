BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday said that only those who flaunt their sexual orientation are punished under Section 377, which criminalises homosexuality. "As long as they don't celebrate it, don't flaunt it, don't create gay bars to select partners it's not a problem," he added. This comes after the Supreme Court ordered a review of Section 377.
