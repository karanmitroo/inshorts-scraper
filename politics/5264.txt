Patiala House Court on Tuesday dismissed a case against Union Minister Smriti Irani for allegedly providing false information regarding her educational qualifications in an election affidavit. The court dismissed it on the ground that there was an 11-year delay in filing the complaint and the lack of original documents. It also observed that the complaint was filed to harass Irani.
