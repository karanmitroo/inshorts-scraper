Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that the Centre could 'shake hands' with the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, but had a problem being 'friends' with the Delhi government. He further said, "I want to work with the opposition as they are an integral part of the assembly."
