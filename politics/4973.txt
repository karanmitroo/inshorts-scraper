A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke down during his speech in Goa, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said that the country does not need PM's tears, but a solution to financial crunch. "It's a huge problem. Business is suffering due to this. The farmers cannot cultivate now due to your policies," Sisodia said.
