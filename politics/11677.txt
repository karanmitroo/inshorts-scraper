The Election Commission on Monday asked the petroleum ministry to defer its decision to revise gas prices from Apr-1. "After taking into account all relevant facts, including the fact that the matter is sub-judice in the Supreme Court, the commission has decided that the proposal may be deferred", EC said. This decision would delay the revision until after the elections.
