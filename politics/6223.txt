The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Wednesday cancelled the registration of 191 political parties, including Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM, for failure in submitting copies of audited accounts and tax returns. The deregistered parties won't be able to contest the upcoming civic polls, however, the decision may be reconsidered if they submit the documents and pay a penalty, an official said.
