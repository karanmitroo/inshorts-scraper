BJP president Amit Shah Wednesday distanced himself from party MP Sakshi Maharaj's controversial statement that Hindu women should produce four children to protect Hinduism. "This is his personal opinion. I don't want to comment on this," Shah said. BJP secretary Shrikant Sharma issued a statement asking BJP activists to keep away from unnecessary statements.
