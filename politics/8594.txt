The RSS on Sunday took a jibe at Congress Vice-president Rahul Gandhi for making a foreign trip when the Bihar elections are approaching. Calling him "young ‘Mr India’ of the old party", the RSS, in its mouthpiece 'Panchjanya', said, "The Captain has abandoned the ship and gone missing leaving the burden of steering the party on old shoulders like always".
