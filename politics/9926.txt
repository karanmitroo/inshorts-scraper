AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal Monday continued to encourage Delhiites to accept bribes from BJP and Congress but vote for his party. "I know they are distributing blankets and sacks of rice as well. Take all of that, but reject liquor as it destroys families,” Kejriwal said. This comes despite Election Commission’s warning to refrain from making such remarks.
