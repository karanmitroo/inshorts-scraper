Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday termed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as a '420' (thief) and a cheat. "Kejriwal is a '420' and we don't have any hopes from him. So, there is no use of commenting on him," he added. This comes after Shunglu Committee's report on gross misuse of power by the AAP government.
