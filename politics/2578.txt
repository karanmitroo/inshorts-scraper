Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who assaulted an Air India employee, has said that the employee made insulting comments against PM Narendra Modi. "Whatever happened was a reaction to actions. Though I received a business class ticket on the boarding pass, no official informed me after I entered the plane that the flight doesn't have a business class," he added.
