BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said that original manuscript of the Indian Constitution had images of Hindu gods and ideals like Ram, Krishna, Arjun, Nataraja, Vivekananda and Guru Gobind Singh. "If the constitution was framed today and the constituent assembly resolves that we will have such pictures what will happen?" he asked.
