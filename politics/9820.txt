Seventy constituencies are going into polls in Delhi on Saturday. Contenders for the CM post, Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal appealed to voters to come out in large numbers. However, according to reports, the turnout in the morning was "dismal". Stalwarts like Sonia Gandhi and President Pranab Mukherjee also cast their vote. President Mukherjee's daughter, Sharmishtha, is a first-time contestant.
