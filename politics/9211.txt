AAP on Tuesday lashed out at Lt Governor Najeeb Jung for questioning its move to admit five police officers from Bihar in its Anti Corruption Branch (ACB). Senior party leader Ashutosh said, "ACB falls outside the purview of the L-G." He further mocked Jung saying, "...tomorrow if Obama is to probe something, he'd have to take the Delhi LG's permission."
