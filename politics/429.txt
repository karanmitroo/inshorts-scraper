Targeting the Opposition's 'Save the Constitution' rally held in Mumbai on Friday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the rally was held to save the party, not the Constitution. "The Constitution is intact. What they (Congress) held today was a 'Save Party' rally and not 'Save Constitution' rally. When Congress-NCP were in power, they...didn't remember the Constitution," he said.
