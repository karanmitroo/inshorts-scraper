Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said their party will allow Parliament to function only after Union Minister Sushma Swaraj discloses how much money she and her family "have received" from former IPL chief Lalit Modi. Rahul also hit out at PM Narendra Modi for praising CMs of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan while remaining silent on their "illegal" acts.
