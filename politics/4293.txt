Criticising the Kerala government for its 'anti-people' policies, the BJP state unit President Kummanam Rajasekharan on Thursday launched a 24-hour fast in front of the Secretariat. The party is demanding the restoration of subsidised food-grain distribution through ration shops. The BJP leaders also alleged that atrocities against Dalits have also increased under the LDF government.
