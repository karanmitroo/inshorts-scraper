BSP Chief Mayawati on Saturday said the BJP's manifesto for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh polls is a document meant to befool the people of the state. "BJP has been around two and a half years in office, but has still not fulfilled its promises. In the name of surgical strike, demonetisation and Parivartan Yatra has been dramatizing things," Mayawati said.
