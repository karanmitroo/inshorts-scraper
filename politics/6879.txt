Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan recently said, "Yogi Adityanath should first get married and prove his masculinity." Calling all the sages "frustrated", Khan added, "How would a Mahant know what love is... he should first get married and help in the growth of generation." Replying to the remarks, Adityanath asked Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to sack Khan.
