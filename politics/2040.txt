Ex-AAP minister Kapil Mishra, who levelled corruption charges against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, was suspended from the party's primary membership after a meeting of its Political Affairs Committee on Monday. Mishra had alleged that party MLA Satyendar Jain settled a â‚¹50-crore land deal for Kejriwal's brother-in-law and that AAP used money, alcohol, and women as bribes during Punjab polls.
