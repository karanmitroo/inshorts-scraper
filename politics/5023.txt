Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's announcement to demonetise high currency notes, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said, "Paytm biggest beneficiary of PM's announcement. Next day PM appears in its ads. What's the deal, Mr PM?" Kejriwal added, "Utterly shameful. Do people want their PM to model for private companies? Tomorrow, if these companies do wrongdoings, who will act against them?"
