AAP leader Bhagwant Mann on Saturday asserted that he will defeat Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal by a margin of one lakh votes in the Assembly polls. Casting his vote, he accused former Canadian lawmaker Ruby Dhalla of campaigning for Badal. "She is a Canadian, how she can canvass in the election. The EC should...cancel her visa," Mann said.
