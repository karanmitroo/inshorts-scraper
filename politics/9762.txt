AAP leader Manish Sisodia will be appointed as the deputy CM of Delhi, said party sources. The decision to make Sisodia the deputy CM was taken at a meeting of AAP's political affairs committee on Wednesday, the sources added. Sisodia is being given the responsibility so that CM-designate Arvind Kejriwal can focus on expanding the party at the national level.
