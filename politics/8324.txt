To counter the 'Award Wapsi' phenomenon, the BJP on Thursday released a booklet titled 'Know the truth', which dubs the campaign as "nothing but an ideological intolerance". It further explains, "Why the so-called intellectuals were silent then and violent now". "The purpose of the book is to show both sides of the story", Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said.
