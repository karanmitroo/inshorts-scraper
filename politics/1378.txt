Congress on Tuesday demanded Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh's resignation over cow deaths. Singh, along with Animal Husbandry Minister Brijmohan Agrawal, was blamed by Congress for about 350 cow deaths in three cow sheds this year allegedly due to lack of water and fodder. The skins of cows were sold off to feed fish in the pond, Congress added.
