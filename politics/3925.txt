Amid reports that the Samajwadi Party and Congress may form an alliance for UP Assembly polls, posters with images of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and UP CM Akhilesh Yadavâ€™s wife Dimple Yadav have surfaced in the state. "Mahilaon ka bajega danka," read a poster. "We want both the parties to join hands and check the communal forces," said a Congress leader.
