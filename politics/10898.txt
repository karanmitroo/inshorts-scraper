Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Sunday ended his 7-day-long fast in Guna seeking immediate disbursal of compensation to farmers affected by crop damage and a CBI probe into the alleged Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board scam. Singh gave a 15-day ultimatum to the state administration to do the needful and threatened to approach law court if "justice is not done".
