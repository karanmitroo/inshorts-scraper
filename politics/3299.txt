Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has said that SP-Congress alliance will continue for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and other secular parties will also join the coalition. "If Congress, SP and RLD fight the 2019 Lok Sabha elections together, BJP will only be able to get 10-15 seats in the state [Uttar Pradesh]," he added.
