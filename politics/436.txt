Responding to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's open letter on disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs, BJP's Delhi President Manoj Tiwari asked Sisodia to stop writing letters and contest elections instead. Tiwari also dared AAP to contest elections from all 70 Delhi Assembly seats instead of 20. Sisodia accused the BJP-led Centre of hampering AAP's functioning in the National Capital.
