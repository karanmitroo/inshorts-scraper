An FIR was registered against Aam Aadmi Party's MP Bhagwant Mann on Friday for filming the various security stages of the Parliament and posting the video online. The police complaint was filed at Parliament Street Police station in New Delhi. While Mann had apologised unconditionally for his act, his move attracted strong criticism for putting the Parliament's security at threat.
