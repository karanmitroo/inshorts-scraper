Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said that RSS stands for 'Ready for Selfless Service' and it is the most patriotic organisation in the country. Naidu added that, the opposition, that follows the politics of hatred, has no moral right to criticise the RSS. The Minister also said that the party is doing 'tamasha' politics over Rohith Vemula's death.
