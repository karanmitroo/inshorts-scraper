The CBI has registered a case against unidentified persons for allegedly using PM Narendra Modi's name to con people through a loan scheme. This came after the Prime Minister's Office filed a complaint 11 months ago. The impersonators offered loans under the 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Kalyan Yojana' with no file charge and no guarantor with 0% interest within 12 hours.
