The BJP plans to set up “digital war rooms” in four states (Jharkhand, J&K, Haryana and Maharashtra) heading for assembly elections to spread its message on social media. IT professionals will work 24x7 in the capitals of these states to promote the BJP’s agenda, and track voting trends through platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Android messaging applications.
