Shiv Sena on Saturday reportedly sacked its members involved in throwing ink on Right to Information (RTI) activist Mallikarjun Bhaikatti. They had done so after Bhaikatti exposed an illegal construction taking place in Latur. Party’s youth wing chief Aditya Thackeray tweeted, “Heard of the unfortunate incident in Latur. The party strongly condemns the disgraceful act”.
