Giving a blow to the Vasundhara Raje government, the Congress Tuesday wrenched the assembly seats of Weir, Nasirabad and Surajgarh from the BJP. The BJP could win only the Kota seat, bringing down its strength to 160 from 163 in the Rajasthan assembly. According to Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot, people have rejected the BJP for brutal "misuse" of power.
