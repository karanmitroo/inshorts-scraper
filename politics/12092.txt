While addressing the media on Thursday, AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny said - “No democracy in AAP, party is being run in dictatorial style. Anyone who tries to raise his or her voice at AAP meeting is silenced. Kejriwal is short tempered and doesn't like dissent. The Delhi CM is an opportunist and has used people to climb the ladder.”
