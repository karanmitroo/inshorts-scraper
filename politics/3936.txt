The BJP on Saturday condemned the remarks of its Haryana Minister Anil Vij on Mahatma Gandhi, stating it as his personal opinion and not the party's stand. "Gandhi is our icon," BJP Spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said. Calling PM Narendra Modi a better brand for Khadi than Mahatma Gandhi, Vij said that Gandhi will gradually be removed from currency notes.
