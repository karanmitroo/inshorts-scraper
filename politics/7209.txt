Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi "surrendered before Pakistan" by allowing investigators from there to probe the Pathankot attack. AAP MLAs also protested in the Delhi Assembly against Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team (JIT) visiting India, raising banners of 'ISI go back'. The Assembly was adjourned for 30 minutes due to the protests.
