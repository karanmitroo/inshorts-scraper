Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde on Sunday alleged that despite reminders seeking information about the foreign donations received by AAP, party chief Arvind Kejriwal was silent on the issue. "We have sent three reminders so far to Kejriwal, seeking clarification on the foreign aid he is getting for his party, but he has not replied so far," Shinde said.
