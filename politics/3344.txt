RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday sat on the chair reserved for Bihar CM Nitish Kumar at an event and later vacated it on realising his mistake. The whole act was caught on camera. During the Prakash Utsav event last month, Nitish had shared the stage with PM Narendra Modi while Lalu was made to sit in the audience.
