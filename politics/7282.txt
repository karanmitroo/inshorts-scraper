Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Tuesday said that PM Narendra Modi should practice 'raj dharma' and abide by the Constitution, instead of encouraging horse-trading. Modi's "duty is towards the Constitution not towards petty politicking and horse trading by the BJP which he is encouraging," he said. The Uttarakhand issue reflected the politics of money and muscle power, he added.
