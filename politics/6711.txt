BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday slammed Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for visiting Uttar Pradesh while Bihar was "gripped by violence". It was "regrettable" that the Chief Minister did not have time to "visit the families of the slain teenager in Gaya and...(the) journalist in Siwan district," he said. This comes after Nitish's visit to Varanasi and Lucknow.
