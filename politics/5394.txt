Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused PM Narendra Modi of exploiting surgical strikes and said that the latter is doing 'dalali' (commissioning) of soldiers' blood. "Our jawans have given lives and blood... they've done surgical strikes. You (Modi) are hiding behind their blood," Gandhi said. He further blamed Modi of dividing Indians and making them fight with each other.
