Uttar Pradesh Textile Minister Satyadev Pachauri, who was on an inspection visit to his department in Lucknow, allegedly insulted a differently-abled who works as a cleaner. In a video of the incident, Pachauri can be seen saying, "Loolhe langdon ko kaam pe rakha hai (You have employed a crippled). No wonder this is the status of cleanliness in this office."
