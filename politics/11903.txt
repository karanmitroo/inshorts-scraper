EC’s preliminary estimates has put the cost of the upcoming LS elections at Rs.3,500 crore, a 150% increase from 2009 polls (1,400 crore). The amount, which doesn't consider security expenditures and parties’ campaign expenses, includes costs of awareness campaigns, anti-corruption measures and digitization of polls. Inflation and increased honorarium for election officials have also contributed to the increase.
