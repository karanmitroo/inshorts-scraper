TMC on Saturday showed a photoshopped picture of Home Minister Rajnath Singh offering 'laddu' to CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat to indicate an alliance between BJP and CPI(M).  Referring to the picture, party leader Derek O'Brien said, "andar dosti, bahar kushti." The picture, however, was removed after BJP shared the original picture, showing Rajnath Singh offering a laddu to Narendra Modi.
