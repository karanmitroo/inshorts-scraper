The Election Commission on Wednesday issued a notice to MP Industries Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya for distributing Rs.100-notes to girls, ahead of MP's Assembly Elections on November-25. Vijayvargiya said he distributed the cash as part of a ritual at the religious-function to honour girls in Mhow. Vijayvargiya reportedly said that he doesn't believe in such a model code of conduct.
