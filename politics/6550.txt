West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday reiterated her demand for State funding of elections in the country. "There is no need to shout 'black money, black money'. If there is state funding for elections, the use of black money will stop," Banerjee said. She added that electoral reforms were as crucial as economic or administrative reforms.
