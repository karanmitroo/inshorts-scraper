Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who recently underwent a throat surgery, on Sunday appealed to the political parties to get united and fight against chikungunya and dengue outbreak in the city. “Just like how all of us Indians come together when there is an India-Pakistan match, we should come together to fight mosquitoes,” he added.
