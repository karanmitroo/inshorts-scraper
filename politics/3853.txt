BJP's Punjab unit chief Vijay Sampla on Tuesday rejected the reports about him resigning from the party as false. "These are all rumours. I had gone for some work," Sampla said. Earlier in the day, media reports claimed that Sampla had tendered his resignation as he was unhappy with the party's ticket allocation for the upcoming Punjab Assembly polls.
