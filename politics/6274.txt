Uttarakhand CM and Congress leader Harish Rawat has been slammed by his own party's state President Kishore Upadhyay over inaction on 7,980 letters written to him in the past two years. All these correspondences were “complaints/applications from the public and also from Congress workers”, Upadhyay claimed. Notably, assembly elections are due in the state next year.
