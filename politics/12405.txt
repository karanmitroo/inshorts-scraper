Over one-and-a-half months after he was arrested for his alleged involvement in inciting violence in Muzaffarnagar, BJP MLA Sangeet Som was released from Muzaffarnagar jail on Monday, after being granted bail. Som was arrested on September-21 for allegedly inciting people and sharing a "provocative" video on a social networking site before riots broke out in Muzaffarnagar.
