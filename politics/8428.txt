JC Prabhakar Reddy, a Telugu Desam Party MLA in Andhra Pradesh, on Saturday said he will take bribes to forward development work in his constituency as the government does not have funds for the purpose. â€œSeveral contractors offer me money... so far I have refused to take. Now, I will start taking bribe for the development of Tadipatri", he said.
