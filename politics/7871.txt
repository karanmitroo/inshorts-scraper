Referring to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and AAP at an election rally on Thursday, Deputy CM of Punjab and Akali leader Sukhbir Singh Badal asked the people to "make the topiwalas run" and give his party "a hattrick". Badal ridiculed Kejriwal's promise to end the state's drug menace and said, "First control the addiction problem of your MP Bhagwant Mann."
