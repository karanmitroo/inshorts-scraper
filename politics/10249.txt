TMC chief Mamata Banerjee on Saturday attacked PM Narendra Modi following the arrest of her key aide Madan Mitra. Mamata said, an image of Madan with the man who ran Saradha scam should not be considered proof of criminal conspiracy. She further asked, should the PM be arrested just because there are images of him with Sahara chief Subrata Roy?
