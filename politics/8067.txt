Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday noted Delhiites pay Income Tax worth ₹1.30 lakh crore to the Centre but get a return worth ₹350 crore and said, "Even the British has not looted Delhi the way the Centre has." He said the issue of full statehood for Delhi needed to be addressed by a "government with a big heart".
