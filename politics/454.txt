While addressing at the opening day of Kerala Budget session on Monday, the state Governor P Sathasivam skipped the parts of his speech that were critical about the Centre. The speech was prepared by the state government and was distributed to the assembly and media beforehand. The ruling CPI(M) accused the Governor of trying to "appease" the central government.
