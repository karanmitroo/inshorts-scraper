Centre has decided to introduce the Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament. The Bill seeks to impose duty, on both the Centre and state governments, to exercise power to prevent targeted violence, including mass violence against SCs, STs and minorities. However, the Bill faces opposition from BJP and some regional parties.
