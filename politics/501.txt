Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has said he is not thinking of an alliance with any party and is working on strengthening the party’s vote bank. "It (alliance talks and seat negotiations) wastes a lot of time and I don’t want to be in confusion (over seats)," he added. However, he said he was open to "friendships" with like-minded parties.
