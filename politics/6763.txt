BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said, "In my opinion, RBI Governor (Raghuram Rajan) is not appropriate for the country." He added, "I don't want to speak much about him. He has hiked interest rates in the garb of controlling inflation that has damaged the country." Swamy further said Rajan should be removed from the post as soon as possible.
