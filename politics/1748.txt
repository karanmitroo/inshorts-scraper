A day after accusing Army personnel of raping women in J&K, Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan said his “statement was misconstrued by the media”. He added “I am the BJP’s ‘item girl’. They don’t have anyone else to talk about. They even fought [Assembly] elections here focusing on me.” Khan further said the Army’s morale cannot fall because of him.
