Bihar's ruling Janata Dal (United) on Wednesday asked its senior rebel leader Sharad Yadav to join the Lalu Prasad Yadav-led opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal. This comes a day after the Election Commission (EC) did not take cognisance of an application by Sharad Yadav claiming to represent the "real JD(U)", citing lack of documents.
