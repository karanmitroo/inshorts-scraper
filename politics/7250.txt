Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev on Friday dismissed allegations levelled by the Congress saying that if he wants to "stand against Congress or challenge it", he will "do it openly". "I have nothing to do with the political crisis which the Congress is suffering in Uttarakhand," Ramdev said. The Congress earlier accused Ramdev of playing a part in the Uttarakhand crisis.
