Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray today asked office bearers and workers of his party not to display hoardings on birthdays. He said any party office bearers, not only in Pune but across Maharashtra, who are found displaying such hoardings would lose their post. Thackeray asked his party leaders to increase communication with people instead of displaying birthday hoardings.
