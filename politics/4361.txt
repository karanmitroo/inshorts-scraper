Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah was on Sunday caught on camera while he was getting his shoe laces tied by a person in Mysuru. His office, however, clarified that the person who tied his laces is not his staff, but his relative. Earlier, a BJD minister in Odisha was caught on camera while getting his shoe laces tied by his security officer.
