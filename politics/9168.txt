Attacking the saffron party, RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Monday challenged BJP to declare its chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. "Show the face of the CM candidate or accept that there is nobody in the dynasty and it is 'nirvansh' (childless)," Prasad said. “There is khot (bad intention) in the mind of BJP,” he added.
