BSP supremo Mayawati on Thursday asserted that no matter how much the Samajwadi Party tries to reconcile, their internal rift would not end. "The dispute within the SAPA family has deepened and has divided it into two parts. One is Akhilesh and the second is Shivpal," she said. The party's vote base will get divided due to this, Mayawati added.
