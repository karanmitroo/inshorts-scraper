Angry over "shoddy" arrangements and no show of local leaders to receive her, senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj cancelled her proposed rally in Shivpuri (MP) and left for Ashoknagar to address a scheduled public meeting. As per the sources, even no party vehicle was present at the helipad to receive her, except a security vehicle with a tag "Escort".
