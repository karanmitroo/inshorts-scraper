RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav on Saturday 'thanked' Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after his father received a 3.5-year jail term in a fodder scam case. Stating that Lalu's conviction was a conspiracy to break the RJD, Tejashwi accused the Centre of misusing the CBI. Meanwhile, the BJP said that corrupt people have to face legal consequences.
