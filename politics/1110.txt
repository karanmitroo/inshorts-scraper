Maharashtra's Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam on Thursday said that the sale or use of firecrackers would not be banned in the state. "The administration neither has and nor ever will issue any such order. Public awareness should help in pollution control," he said. Earlier, Kadam had said that he would request Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to ban crackers in Maharashtra.
