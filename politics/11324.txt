"I don't want to see Narendra Modi as PM, he does not deserve to be the prime minister," film director Mahesh Bhatt said, while campaigning for Congress candidate Rita Bahuguna Joshi in Lucknow. Appealing to voters to shun communal forces in Lok Sabha polls, Bhatt added that Modi should be defeated as he was a 'communal' leader.
