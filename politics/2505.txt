Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav has said that the speculations of her joining the BJP over frequent meetings with Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath are baseless. "People just talk. All the more when a woman tries to do something worthwhile...I had met Yogiji even before. There is nothing new about me meeting him," she added.
