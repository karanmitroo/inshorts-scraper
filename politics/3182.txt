Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's 'shamshaan-kabristaan' remark, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said the former should first worry about the living and not about the dead. His demonetisation move claimed lives of close to 150 people, Owaisi said. PM Modi in his rally had said that if there is a 'kabristaan' (graveyard), there should be 'shamshaan' (cremation ground) too.
