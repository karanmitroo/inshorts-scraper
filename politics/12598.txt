Bihar rural works and Panchayati Raj minister Bhim Singh said "People join army or police for shahadat (martyrdom)," defending the absence of JD(U) ministers to receive the bodies of the four jawans. He even told a newsman, "Had your father gone to the airport to receive the bodies?" Later, when upbraided by CM Nitish Kumar, he apologised publicly.
