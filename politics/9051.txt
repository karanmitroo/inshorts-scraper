Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh on Tuesday said that the word 'adhinayak' should be removed from the national anthem as it praises 'Angrezi shashak' (British ruler) of the pre-Independence period. He suggested that the word should be replaced with 'mangal'. Furthermore, he recommended replacing 'Mahamahim’ (his/her excellency) with ‘mananiye’ (honourable) as a prefix for governors and the President.
