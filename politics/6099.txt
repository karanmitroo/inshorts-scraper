The BJP on Friday termed Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi’s speech on inflation in the Parliament ‘baseless’, stating it was just to grab the people's attention by sprouting one-liners. "Whatever he (Rahul Gandhi) is blaming us for in the current situation, their government was initially responsible for it,” said BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain.
