As many as 24 kanwarias, 6 ITBP and Police personnel were recently injured in stone pelting by a mob during the 'Kanwar Yatra' in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. It is alleged that the attack happened after the yatris played loud music while passing through a Muslim-dominated locality. The police had to resort to a lathi charge to disperse the crowd.
