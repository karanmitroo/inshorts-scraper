Minister for Civil Aviation Ashok Gajapati Raju approved revoking of no-frisking privileges to Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, at airports across the country on Tuesday. The decision came after the home ministry's approval to remove Vadra's name from the list after it was found that there was no threat of any kind to him.
