Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday denied the reports that claimed he had demanded action against BJP veterans for speaking out on the poor performance of the party in Bihar elections. "Party elders including Advani and MM Joshi are our highly respected leaders and neither I nor any other party functionary has ever shown any disrespect to them," he said.
