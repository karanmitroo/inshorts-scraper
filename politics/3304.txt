The RLD candidate from Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh, Ram Kumar Kashyap, joined BJP on Monday just two days before polling and will now campaign against himself. Since he cannot withdraw his candidature now, he will campaign for the BJP candidate from his constituency. After pledging allegiance to the BJP, he asked his supporters not to vote for him.
