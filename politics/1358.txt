BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said MK Stalin's DMK and AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran will form a coalition government in Tamil Nadu. He claimed that the AIADMK factions led by O Panneerselvam and EK Palaniswami do not have the required number of MLAs to achieve a majority. Notably, 19 Dhinakaran-led AIADMK MLAs withdrew support from the government on Thursday.
