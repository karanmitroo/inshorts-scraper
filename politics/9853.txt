BJP's Delhi CM candidate Kiran Bedi's campaign assistant Narendra Tandon Monday quit the party and accused Bedi of adopting 'dictatorial' attitude. Tandon, a former secretary of the BJP's Delhi unit, said, "It was difficult for me to continue under her (Bedi)." However, seemingly unbothered BJP claimed that Tandon had 'created trouble' in the past as well.
