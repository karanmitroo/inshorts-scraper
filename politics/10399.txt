Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi Saturday met the victims of botched sterilisation surgeries that led to 13 deaths. "Truth is that it is not only a case of negligence. Here corruption has a role, fake medicines have a role," Gandhi said. Deamanding a thorough investigation, he said that the Raman Singh government was "not taking responsibility" for the tragedy.
