Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday moved a resolution in the Assembly, urging President Pranab Mukherjee to withdraw the "draconian demonetisation scheme" which he alleged is causing inconvenience to people. Claiming that demonetisation has helped the BJP, he accused the government of selectively leaking the information so that people associated with it could convert their black money to white.
