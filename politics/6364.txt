The AAP on Wednesday said Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and Anti-Corruption Bureau chief MK Meena should be made "co-accused" in four cases pertaining to scams which happened during former CM Sheila Dikshit's tenure. The party alleged that the L-G is "protecting" Dikshit through "inaction" and that Meena had "also colluded" with the L-G in "this criminal activity".
