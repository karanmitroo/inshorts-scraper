Bihar Congress on Wednesday held a review meeting after the Lok Sabha election debacle with party leaders regretting the tie-up with RJD and proposing an alliance with JD(U) in state assembly polls next year. Many of the party leaders complained that while RJD gained from alliance with Congress, "we could not benefit anything from it," the sources said.
