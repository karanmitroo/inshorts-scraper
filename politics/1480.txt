Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's convoy of 175 cars passed a toll plaza in Barabanki's Ahmadpur without paying the toll tax. The incident has also been captured on camera at the toll plaza. While CMs and Members of Legislative Council (MLCs) are exempted from paying toll tax, the rule doesn't apply to former CMs and his supporters.
