Dismissing reports of the National Conference joining hands with the BJP, J&K CM Omar Abdullah Friday said the tie up was "impossible". "Where from did you get such reports? You make such reports at your homes. What can I do? There is no such thing from our side. We have not given any such indication," Omar said.
