West Bengal Police on Saturday stopped a BJP delegation from entering a riot-hit area in Howrah district's Dhulagarh. Following this, the BJP delegation blocked the road and accused the Mamata Banerjee-led government of pursuing "appeasement politics towards a particular community." The BJP has alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress has been targetting Hindus over their support to the BJP.
