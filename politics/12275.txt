On Tuesday, Congress vice-President Rahul Gandhi's private jet had to abort landing procedures to avoid the possibility of a collision on the runway, while he was returning to Delhi from Rae Bareli. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation of the country has asked for an investigation in the incident, which is being viewed as a procedural lapse.
