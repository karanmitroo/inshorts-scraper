Janata Dal (United) on Monday sought an explanation from its MLA Shyam Bahadur Singh after a recently surfaced video showed him dancing with alleged bar dancers at a function. Party spokesperson Ajay Alok, however, said dancing at a family function, especially at a wedding, could not be considered wrong as the MLA was not dancing under the influence of alcohol.
