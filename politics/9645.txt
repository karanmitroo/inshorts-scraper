Delhi CM and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had tendered his resignation as party's National Convener in the National Executive (NE) meeting on Thursday, said party sources. However, NE members rejected his proposal of quitting. The sources added that Kejriwal was upset after few leaders raised the issue of him playing dual role of the Delhi CM and the party convener.
