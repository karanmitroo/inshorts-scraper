Congress on Friday said that PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi ranks 418th among 476 cities on cleanliness in a “survey report not released” by the Urban Development Ministry. The Ministry, however, said that the survey was conducted before Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan's launch and the “first survey being carried out after the launch will be released later this year”.
