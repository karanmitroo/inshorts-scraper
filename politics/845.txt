RJD leader and Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tej Pratap on Sunday said Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi should go ahead with his son's wedding without any fear or worry. This comes after a video of Pratap threatening to disrupt the wedding and beat up Modi surfaced online. After the video emerged, Modi had changed the wedding venue, citing security reasons.
