Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan on Tuesday said, it is unheard of that a party thumps chest and seeks electoral gains from claims of surgical strike without giving any evidence and refers to those who seek proof as anti-national. “Fantastic! BJP uses 'Surgical strikes' for electoral gains. Now Parikkar credits RSS. But refuses to show evidence!” he tweeted.
