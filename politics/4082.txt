Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Abu Azmi on Friday said, "I have never disrespected women, but those who allow women to wear short clothes, disrespect them." Azmi further said, "Until and unless these people won't mend and such incidents keep on happening in the country, till then the girls should be cautious and take care of their own security."
