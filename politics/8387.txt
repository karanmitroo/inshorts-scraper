Bharatiya Janta Party MP Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday accused the party of sidelining him in the Bihar assembly elections. "(I have) been kept out, thanks to insecure local leaders who we know very well", Sinha tweeted, without naming anyone. Further, he said that it was "not by choice" that he was absent from the election campaign.
