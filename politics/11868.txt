Accusing Congress-led UPA government of betraying Bihar for denying it a special category status, CM Nitish Kumar Thursday gave a 'Bihar bandh' call on Mar-1. "We have no problem with Seemandhra getting special category status but the same has been denied to Bihar despite a favourable recommendation of the Raghuram Rajan Committee," Kumar said.
