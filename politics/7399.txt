The Left parties on Wednesday approached the Election Commission, claiming West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had "brazenly threatened the voters" after the election announcement. They also demanded deployment of central forces to ensure free and fair elections. They alleged that Banerjee had stated there will be no central security forces after the polls, and just her administration will be around.
