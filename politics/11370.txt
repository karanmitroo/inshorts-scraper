Samajwadi Party leader Ramji Lal Suman, a close associate of party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, was caught on tape Tuesday saying, a parliamentarian is not worth his name if on receiving his telephone call an officer does not wet his pants. Suman is a candidate from Hathras and has been a parliamentarian four times in the past.
