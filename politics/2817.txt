BJP minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday took oath as the Chief Minister of Goa in Panaji. Former CM Laxmikant Parsekar was also present at the ceremony. This comes after the Supreme Court ordered a floor test in Goa Assembly on March 16 after the Congress challenged the appointment of Parrikar as CM.
