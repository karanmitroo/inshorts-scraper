Quami Ekta Dal MLA Mukhtar Ansari has said his party’s merger with the Samajwadi Party seems “difficult”, but it is open to an alliance. Ansari's statement came hours after his meeting with SP leader Shivpal Yadav. In June, a merger between the two parties was announced but it was later called off as UP CM Akhilesh Yadav objected to it.
