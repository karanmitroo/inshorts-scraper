A Delhi court on Saturday exempted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from appearing in the court over the defamation case filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The court cited Kejriwal's official engagements in view ofÂ the upcoming civic polls as a reason for the exemption. Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders face trial in the case.
