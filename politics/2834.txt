Wealthier candidates were far more likely to win than their less wealthy competitors, according to an analysis. Across 689 constituencies in the recently concluded elections, the wealthiest candidate won 33.5% of the time, compared to just 1% for tenth-wealthiest candidate. Education, too, contributed to chances of winning, with doctorate degree holders winning nearly 20% of their elections.
