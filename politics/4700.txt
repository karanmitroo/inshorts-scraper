Addressing a Parivartan rally in Uttar Pradesh, PM Narendra Modi today said, "After demonetisation, those who have stashed black money are queuing up outside poor's house, asking for help." Modi further said, "Will corruption go on its own? It has to be driven out. Is fighting corruption a crime? Why are some people calling me a wrongdoer for fighting corruption?"
