Reacting to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's "no one has right to judge patriotism of others" remark, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Monday asked would he advise PM Narendra Modi to restrain his "Troll Army of Modi Bhakts". "Anyone who criticises Modi is labelled Anti National. But Mohan Bhagwat ji won't because they are fountain heads of Double Speak," he tweeted.
