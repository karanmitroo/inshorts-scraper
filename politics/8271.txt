Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said his party will contest the Assembly elections in other states, if his party members demand so. Encouraged by the Sena's performance in the Bihar polls, Uddhav said, "[W]e have realised that we should move out to spread the message and fill the vacuum of Hindutva thought in the country".
