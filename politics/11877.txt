In a relief to former Maharashtra chief minister and revenue minister Shivajirao Nilangekar, the CBI has given him a clean chit in the Adarsh society housing scam. The CBI has said that there is no link between Shivajirao's role as revenue minister and the benefits derived by his son-in-law Arun Dawle, who received a flat in the Adarsh housing society.
