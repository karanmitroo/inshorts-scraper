Attacking Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for defending the khap panchayats, finance minister P Chidambaram Wednesday described them as retrograde organisations that cannot be part of India's culture. "(it's) rubbish. Must have the courage to stand up and say these retrograde practices are not part of India's culture...These are simply (organisations of) self-serving individuals who propagate this poisonous culture," Chidambaram added.
