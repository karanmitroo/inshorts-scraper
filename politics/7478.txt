The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which has allied with the BJP, will contest 24 out of the 126 seats in the upcoming Assembly polls in Assam, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. The BJP and other allies will contest the elections on the remaining seats. "Next we need to take down the corrupt Tarun Gogoi government in Assam," Prasad added.
