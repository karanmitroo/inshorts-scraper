The Samajwadi Party on Tuesday asked absconding Uttar Pradesh Minister Gayatri Prajapati, accused in a rape case, to surrender and offer his resignation as soon as possible. "SP is not intentionally trying to rescue him [Prajapati]," party leader Abu Azmi said. He further said that Prajapati should not malign the image of the party.
