The CPM on Tuesday tweeted photos of violence in Tripura, accusing the BJP-IPFT leadership of "coordinating" attacks on the Left in the state. Claiming that hundreds of cadre were unable to go to their homes because of "violence and threats of violence", the CPM added that BJP-IPFT wanted to use their newly acquired power to "smash" the party's support base.
