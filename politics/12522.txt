In the middle of a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on defence, with important issues like border infiltrations being addressed, committee chairman Raj Babbar dispersed the meeting claiming some members had to catch their flights. The Navy and Airforce were yet to make their presentations when Babbar dispersed the meeting with none of the other members protesting the move.
