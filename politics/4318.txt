PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday accused Congress of betraying the jawans by not fulfilling the pending One Rank, One Pension (OROP) demand in the last 40 years. "In reality, the budget for OROP is over ₹10,000 crore. Why did they (Congress) betray the Jawans by allocating ₹500 crore for this," Modi claimed. The jawans must get their due, he added.
