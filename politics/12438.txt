The Madhya Pradesh unit of Congress objected to the use of diyas (earthen lamps) in BJP advertisements saying the symbol whips up religious feelings and lodged a complaint against them, terming it violation of the model code of conduct. In a BJP advertisement, a picture of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and a lit diya with a slogan was displayed.
