The Congress on Wednesday dismissed the controversial remark directed at Lata Mangeshkar by its Mumbai Congress chief Janardan Chandurkar who demanded taking back Bharat Ratna from those who praise "communal forces". Party spokesman RS Surjewala told reporters that the statement by Chandurkar was "regrettable". Surjewala further added, "We all love and respect Lata Mangeshkar and we respect her artistic creativity."
