Controversial TMC MP, Tapas Pal has found a voice of support from Abhijit Mukherjee, the son of President Pranab Mukherjee. “Though I don’t support what he said, but now that he has asked for an unconditional apology, I think this matter shouldn’t be carried forward anymore,” Abhijit said. This is contrary to his party’s view, which demanded Pal’s expulsion.
