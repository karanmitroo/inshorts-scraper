The BJP will file a motion in the Lok Sabha seeking to ban Fair and Lovely ads and other advertisements depicting dark skin that promote racism. This comes just after Congress' Rahul Gandhi criticised the government's "Fair and Lovely yojana to convert black money into white money". BJP leaders claimed this was racist and it meant "anything dark was ugly".
