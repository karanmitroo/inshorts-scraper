Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar welcomed the Supreme Court's decision on Thursday, to hold as "unconstitutional" the 2004 law passed by Punjab which terminated the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal water sharing agreement with neighbouring states. "The Supreme Court has given its decision on this vital issue after 12 years... I welcome the Supreme Court verdict. It is natural justice," Khattar said.
