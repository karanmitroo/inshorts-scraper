During his three-day visit to poll-bound Gujarat, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said that the Congress will never disrespect the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). "When Modi ji was in the Opposition, he used to speak with disrespect about the Prime Minister. That is the difference between us and them," Rahul added.
