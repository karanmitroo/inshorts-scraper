The AIADMK on Saturday claimed that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa is fine and added that there is no need to release her pictures to prove the same as she is "not answerable to the opposition". This comes a day after DMK chief Karunanidhi asked the state government to release her pictures to put an end to her health rumours.
