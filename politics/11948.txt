Amid continued disruption of Parliament, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited top BJP leaders for dinner on February 12 to seek their support for the passage of the crucial Telangana Bill and other anti-corruption legislations in Parliament. The dinner meeting was earlier scheduled for Monday but was postponed on account of non-availability of Advani.
