Goa factories minister Deepak Dhavalikar Tuesday came out in support of his wife Lata, a day after she sparked a controversy saying 'rapes are on rise as women are aping Western culture'. When approached for a reaction over the controversial remarks, Dhavalikar echoed his wife's statement saying, "When girls used to follow Hindu culture, there were no instances of rape."
