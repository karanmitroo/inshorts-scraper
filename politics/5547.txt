BSP chief Mayawati has slammed BJP President Amit Shah’s remark over her owning bungalows in Delhi and accused the party of having a “casteist mentality”. “BJP [is]…unable to digest...that a daughter of a Dalit can reside in a bungalow,” she said. Earlier, Shah said if Mayawati distributed the money she spent on bungalows, every Dalit household could get an AC.
