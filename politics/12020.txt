Notwithstanding ruling AAPâ€™s commitment to slash electricity rates, power tariff in Delhi was hiked by up to 8% on Friday by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd, an electricity distribution company, had warned the government of possible power cuts in some parts of Delhi because it was unable to pay for electricity supplied by state generating companies.
