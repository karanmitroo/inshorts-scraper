AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala on Sunday was in tears as she addressed the party MLAs at the Golden Bay Resort in Kuvathur. "I went to Amma's memorial but couldn't get out of there due to the magnetic power. That day I took a pledge, that I'll safeguard the organisation she has left behind, till my last breath," she said.
