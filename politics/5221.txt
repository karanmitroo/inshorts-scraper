Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday expelled the SP General Secretary Ramgopal Yadav from the party for six years. The announcement came from SP state chief Shivpal Yadav, who was earlier expelled from the Cabinet by UP CM Akhilesh Yadav. Shivpal accused Ramgopal of being involved with corrupt people and "betraying" SP to save his kin from CBI.
