After Janata Dal (United) criticised the Centre for 'Y'-category security being accorded to former Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, the BJP on Friday defended the central governmentâ€™s move. The BJP said that the Centre must have taken into account the threat to the Jan Adhikar Party founder before extending the 'Y'-category security cover to him.
