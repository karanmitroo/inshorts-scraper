The Delhi High Court on Thursday advised Union minister Nitin Gadkari and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal to strike a truce, and shake hands in "public interest" instead of feuding in a defamation suit. "You both are renowned politicians, people look up to You," court added. In January, Gadkari had sued Kejriwal for linking him to corruption.
