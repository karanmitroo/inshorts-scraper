Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday demanded that India be declared ‘Hindu Rashtra’. ”Enough of this ‘secular’ stuff…when Hindus are being targeted and attacked, where are these secularists?” Thackeray said. Claiming that his party has always supported the cause of Hindutva, he further urged all Hindus to unite for the country.
