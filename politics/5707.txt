Expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh, who was earlier arrested for his "prostitute" remark against BSP supremo Mayawati, has now reportedly likened her to a "dog". She is a coward woman and is like a dog that chases speeding vehicles, but steps back as and when the vehicle stops, he reportedly said. However, Singh later denied making such a remark.
