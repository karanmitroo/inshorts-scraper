CPI(M) MP Sitaram Yechury has criticised PM Narendra Modi’s address over cow vigilantism, stating ‘without action, getting angry has little meaning’. “Not a word against hounding of specific social groups. No restraint on party leaders or MPs who encourage social and economic bullying!” he tweeted. PM Modi had on Saturday condemned those who indulge in cow vigilantism.
