The BJP's chief ministerial candidate for Delhi, Kiran Bedi, Sunday claimed she was approached by the BJP to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. "Advanji personally asked me to do so, but I refused," Bedi said. Further, she said, "Congress had offered me to join politics from Amritsar, since I belong from there, when I was with the Delhi Police."
