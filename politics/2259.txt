The Andhra Pradesh Police has conducted searches at Jaganmohan Reddy-led YSR Congress Party headquarters in Hyderabad over Facebook posts made by a man who reportedly works on the opposition party's social media team. Reports also suggest that the government is likely to set up a Social Media Regulatory Authority (SMRA) to 'control' social media platforms.
