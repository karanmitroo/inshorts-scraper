Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday slammed the deployment of CRPF to handle the unrest at Srinagar's National Institute of Technology. He tweeted, "TWO companies of CRPF in a campus is not normal by any stretch of imagination. Requires tact not use of force". Notably, the clashes had started over the India-West Indies World T20 semifinals.
