Former Bihar CM Lalu Prasad Yadav sparked row on Monday after he gave a statement in support of the recent mass cheating case during board examinations in the state. The RJD chief said, "People were climbing like lizards onto such a big building. Would this happen in RJD's rule? We would have ourselves given them books to cheat."
