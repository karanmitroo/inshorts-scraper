Rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Thursday said he will challenge his disqualification from the Rajya Sabha in court. He claimed that his opposition to JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and the BJP resulted in the ouster. He alleged he was disqualified unfairly, and that even Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab and liquor baron Vijay Mallya were allowed to exhaust all appeals.
