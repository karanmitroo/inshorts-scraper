Addressing a poll rally, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said, "Most of the corruption takes place in one state...if there's a name for that corruption, it's Sukhbir Badal". "They have ruined the entire industry because only Badal family can run business in the state. In every industry or business, there is some share of the Badals," he added.
