Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the hike in fuel prices. "Post Demonetisation disaster and shoddy GST Implementation, Modiji is now punishing the common Indian by massive taxation on petrol and diesel," Gandhi tweeted. This comes after Union Minister KJ Alphons said that vehicle-owners were not starving and could pay higher fuel prices.
