Following reports suspecting Pakistan's involvement in last year's Kanpur train accident, Shiv Sena has urged the Centre to snap diplomatic ties with Pakistan. "Pakistan has been encouraged enough, we have to stop assuming such a diplomatic stance," party leader Manisha Kayande said. Considering China's Pakistan support, India should also take a stand on how to deal with China, she added.
