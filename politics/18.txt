Talking about the razing of Communist icon Lenin's statue in Tripura, MoS for Home Affairs Hansraj Ahir said there is no place for foreign leaders' statues. India has enough icons like Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar for people to laud, he added. However, Ahir also said, "We condemn all kinds of violence and the state government is handling the situation".
