The Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) on Sunday said an out-of-court settlement on the Babri Masjid issue isn't possible with PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath at the helm of affairs. "There's no hope that justice will prevail with the Muslims. Both of them have been BJP workers and Ram temple movement supporters," said BMAC Convenor Zafaryab Jilani.
