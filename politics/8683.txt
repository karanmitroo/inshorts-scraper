The opposition Congress on Thursday demanded an apology from the Centre for discontinuing the postal stamps of the former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The Congress also slammed Communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for his 'only one family can't get all the honour and right to feature on stamps' remark by calling it an 'oxymoron'.
