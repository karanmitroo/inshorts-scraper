The Delhi High Court on Friday ordered the Income Tax department to probe Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi in the National Herald case. However, some reports have stated that the Congress leaders may move the Supreme Court against the High Court order. In 2015, the Patiala House Court had granted bail to Sonia and Rahul.
