Reacting to Telangana government's move to increase reservation for Muslims to 12%, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asserted that religion-based quota will divide the nation and create social unrest like that in Pakistan. "The NDA is in favour of reservation on the basis of social and educational backwardness...Even our Constitution doesn't allow it (religion-based quota)," he added.
