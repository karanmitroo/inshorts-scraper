After JD(U) released a photograph of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav with a liquor bottle, Yadav said that the standard of politics had hit rock bottom at the behest of Nitish Kumar. The picture showed Yadav standing with a woman and an alcohol bottle in the backdrop. The picture was clicked during my cricketing days before I entered politics, Yadav added.
