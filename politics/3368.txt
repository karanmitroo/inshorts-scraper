West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh has said people like Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen are "spineless, they can be bought or sold and can stoop to any level". "A fellow Bengali among us has won the Nobel Prize and we are proud... But, what has he done for the state? No one in Bengal understands him," he added.
