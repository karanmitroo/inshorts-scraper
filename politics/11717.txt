Sulking Shiv Sena spokesman Rahul Narvekar, who recently withdrew his candidature from Maharashtra legislative council elections, joined NCP on Monday and will contest the Lok Sabha polls on the party's ticket from the Maval constituency. According to him, he had no choice but to quit the Sena because he was falling prey to internal politics.
