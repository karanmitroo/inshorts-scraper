The Govt is considering the Election Commission's proposal to ban the publication of opinion polls between the announcement of election schedule and the final phase of polling. Currently the EC can ban them just 48-hours prior to voting."Such opinion polls often tend to cause a prejudicial effect on the minds of the electors," said attorney-general Vahanvati, supporting the EC's proposal.
