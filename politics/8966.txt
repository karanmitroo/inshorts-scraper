BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Sunday reacted strongly to the statements of some political leaders who linked 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon's death sentence to his religion. "Let us not try for our petty political gains to ascribe a religion to a terrorist or terrorism. Connecting terrorism with any religion... will be doing injustice to that religion," Patra said.
