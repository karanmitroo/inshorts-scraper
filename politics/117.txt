BJP Spokesperson Sambit Patra on Wednesday said, "If corrupt are being jailed and law is taking its own course, I see no reason why any political party should cry vendetta. This is law, not vendetta." The statement comes after Congress slammed BJP for P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram's arrest over a money laundering case, calling it 'BJP government's vendetta'.
