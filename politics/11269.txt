Digvijaya Singh on Thursday said his acknowledgement of his relationship with Amrita Rai proves that, "I have the courage of my conviction & to face the consequences. He (Modi) is a coward, who had hidden his wife for years." Photos of Mr. Singh (67) and Amrita (43) were leaked online earlier this week, following which he accepted about his relationship.
