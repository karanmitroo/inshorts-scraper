BJP leader and Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Friday labelled Thursday's Kolkata flyover collapse, which claimed at least 24 lives, 'an act of fraud'. "The nexus of corruption between the Trinamool Congress and the Left party which is in the opposition has been exposed," Naqvi said. This comes after the flyover's construction firm termed it 'an act of God'.
