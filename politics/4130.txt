DMK chief M Karunanidhi on Wednesday missed the first party general body meeting in 48 years. The 93-year-old has recently been hospitalised twice after complaining of difficulty in breathing due to throat and lung infection. Karunanidhi's son MK Stalin was elected as the party's working President in the general body meeting. However, Karunanidhi will remain the DMK party's President.
