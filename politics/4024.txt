BJP's ally in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena on Monday slammed the Centre for frequently issuing ordinances. Sena said a record is being created in issuing ordinances, and in such a case, the Centre should issue ordinances for Ram Mandir's construction and implementing the Uniform Civil Code. Sena also said that the economic development has slackened due to Centre's demonetisation drive.
