A month after it was revealed that MPs relish delicacies subsidized by 60-90%, Parliament's Food Management Committee chief AP Jitender Reddy on Sunday said that there was no proposal to raise the food price in the Parliament canteen. Reddy claimed that an internal survey has found that during session period, only 150-250 out of 800 MPs eat in the canteen.
