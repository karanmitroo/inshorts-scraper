After PM Narendra Modi called himself a “fakir” during a rally on Saturday, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “How come you’re a Fakir? You change four pairs of clothes each day, your suit costs ₹10L and you travel around the world”. “People will take revenge from you [Modi]…were you voted to power so you could punish the honest?” he added.
