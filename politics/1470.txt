The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has demanded UP CM Yogi Adityanath's resignation over the death of children in Gorakhpur hospital due to alleged lack of oxygen supply. The BSP said Adityanath neglected the health sector completely and didn't pay attention towards the issue of health and malnutrition. Reportedly, it has been indicated that the hospital was short of oxygen cylinders.
