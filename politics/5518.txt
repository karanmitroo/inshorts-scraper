Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh on Saturday said that Pakistan is firing the gun from the shoulders of the Hurriyat leaders and is solely responsible for the killings in the state. He further said that the Indus Water Treaty signed in 1960 with Pakistan has always been an issue and to rethink the issue would be 'good'.
