Goa's Deputy CM Francis D'Souza has threatened to quit his post if not made the CM after Manohar Parrikar resigns on Saturday. "It's like the chief minister or nothing for me, I will not join the present cabinet if not made the chief minister, and I have strong support of MLAs and ministers," said D'Souza on Friday.
