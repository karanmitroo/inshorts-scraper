Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday washed dishes in Golden Temple's community kitchen as penance for depicting the temple with party symbol broom in its manifesto. "I had come here for 'sewa' to apologize if we had knowingly or unknowingly committed any mistake," he said. AAP leader Ashish Khetan, whom the police booked for the incident, also accompanied Kejriwal.
