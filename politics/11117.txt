DMK chief M Karunanidhi's son and treasurer, MK Stalin, on Sunday resigned from all party posts, owning moral responsibility for his party's rout in the Lok Sabha elections. Stalin's decision comes even as sections within the party pointed a finger at his leadership and cited the choice of certain candidates as reasons for the DMK's disastrous show in the elections.
