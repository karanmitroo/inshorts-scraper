An ambulance was stopped by the police to allow for the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s convoy to pass from a busy street. A video of the incident showed a motorist saying “Let the ambulance go”, but the traffic police didn't pay heed. "Why should we wait for the CM to give interviews at airport," the motorist added.
