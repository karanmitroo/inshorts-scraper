Congress on Sunday alleged that PM Narendra Modi has been "absconding" from the Parliament, but has enough time to address the Coldplay concert. "This government will not be run through videoconferencing at rock concerts, but only by accountability to (the) Parliament," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. Notably, PM Modi addressed the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai on Saturday.
