BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Saturday questioned Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra's role in the National Herald case. Swamy claimed the Enforcement Directorate has questioned Robert Vadra on alleged money laundering with regard to Associate Journals Ltd (AJL). The lawyers, representing Congress leaders, however said that the two cases were entirely different.
