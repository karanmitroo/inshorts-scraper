Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday appointed Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati as the party's National Secretary. Prajapati holds the transport portfolio in the state cabinet. Notably, he was sacked by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in September following charges of corruption in the Mining department but was reinstated a few days later.
