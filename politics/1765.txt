West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that the central government's GST implementation is an epic blunder like demonetisation. "Our repeated suggestions to take some more time to properly implement GST have fallen on deaf ears," Mamata said. "Only 60 hours are left before this ill-planned launch and no one knows for sure what's happening," she added.
