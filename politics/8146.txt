Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday sent notice to Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh over alleged money laundering, asking him to appear for questioning at New Delhi in the first week of December. "The Centre is misusing ED and CBI to fabricate cases against me," Singh said. "This is an old matter being played up unnecessarily in the media," he added.
