Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot has claimed that the GST Council had cut tax rates due to pressure mounted by party Vice President Rahul Gandhi. He further alleged that the rates were cut because BJP was afraid of losing votes in the Gujarat elections. The number of items being taxed under 28% was cut from 227 to 50 on Friday.
