Virender Singh, a close aide of former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was earlier booked under sedition charges for allegedly inciting violence during the Jat agitation, was arrested on Thursday, police said. Singh was booked in February based on an audio clip of a phone call between a Khap leader, in which he was allegedly heard inciting more violence.
