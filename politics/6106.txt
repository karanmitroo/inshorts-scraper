Congress on Sunday criticised Union Minister Manohar Parrikar over his remarks making reference to an actor. The party said that instead of training his guns elsewhere, Parrikar threatens ‘teaching a lesson’ to ‘actors’. “Manohar Parrikar’s statement proves a concerted conspiracy to curb all dissent, hound Dalits and Minorities”, said Congress Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.
