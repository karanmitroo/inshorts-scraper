According to an AIIMS  doctor associated with the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, the decision to send Sunanda Pushkar's viscera reports abroad for further testing was "politically motivated". The cause of death is "crystal clear", and is mentioned "conclusively" on the report. "Our forensic science laboratories are well equipped", he added.
