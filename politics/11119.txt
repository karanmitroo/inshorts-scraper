Chief spokesperson of Delhi Congress Mukesh Sharma Sunday said, the party will prefer fresh election in the city to supporting the AAP again to form a government, as favoured by a section of AAP MLAs. "There is no question of extending support to AAP to form a government again. Arvind Kejriwal had deserted the people of Delhi," Sharma added.
