Jharkhand Peopleâ€™s Party (JPP) on Friday called a state-wide bandh on the oath-taking day of Raghuvar Das, who has been elected as the first non-tribal CM of Jharkhand. The party described the selection of the non-tribal CM in the state as an "anti-tribal" approach of BJP. Oath-taking ceremony of Raghuvar Das will presumably be held on Dec-29.
