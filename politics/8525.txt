The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has put forth a case against cow slaughter on “environmental” and “medicinal” grounds, apart from religious ones. The organisation’s Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Manmohan Vaidya said, “Cow-based farming has been the backbone of our agriculture for centuries. That is why cow slaughter was banned even by some Muslim rulers, including Akbar.”
