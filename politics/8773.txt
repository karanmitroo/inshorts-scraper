The Aam Aadmi Party may reportedly expel three MLAs, Jitender Singh Tomar, Manoj Kumar and Pankaj Pushkar, for “showing wrong documents, indulging in forgery and anti-party activities.” They could lose their assembly membership if a unanimous resolution is moved against them and the Speaker accepts it. Tomar is presently in Tihar Jail on charges of submitting fake educational degrees.
