Diamond merchant Harshad Ramniklal Mehta, who is under investigation for tax evasion, funded BJP's CM candidate Kiran Bedi's NGO Navjyoti India Foundation. Bedi has ruled out any intention of returning the funds saying, "Ours is a perfectly legitimate transaction. All NRIs donations to my NGO have been duly scrutinized by all concerned authorities of government."
