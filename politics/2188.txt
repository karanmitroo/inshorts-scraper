Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who co-founded the AAP, on Thursday said that Delhi people rejected 'immature' CM Arvind Kejriwal because his blame-game irked them. "It is very unfortunate that a party which was formed on a promise of alternative politics, on the promise of practicing transparency, accountability, internal democracy and not resorting to power politics broke all promises," he added.
