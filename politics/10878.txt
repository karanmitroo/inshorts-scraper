Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee took on the BJP on Monday saying its tally in West Bengal would be reduced to zero after the next general elections. “The BJP had one seat. They have gained one more seat. But the way they are campaigning and behaving, it seems as if they have achieved a lot,” she added.
