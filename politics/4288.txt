Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has demanded the resignation of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on moral grounds as irregularities were reportedly found in the AAP’s accounts. "[T]he funding details of AAP are fudged," Tiwari alleged. AAP kept three accounts, one for the public, another for the Election Commission and Income Tax Department and third, the “actual” fund collection, he stated.
