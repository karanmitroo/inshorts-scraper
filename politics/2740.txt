Following the announcement of Yogi Adityanath as the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, a user tweeted, "#YogiAdityanath has a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Is more educated than Sonia Gandhi and much younger than Rahul Gandhi". "The new CM of UP is Hindutva personified. Perhaps an indication that the BJP's social agenda is now taking center stage", read another tweet.
