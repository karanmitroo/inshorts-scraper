The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, was published in London on February 21, 1848. Hailed as one of the most influential political pamphlets in history, the manifesto, originally in German, analyses class struggles and problems of capitalism. Marx predicted imminent revolution in Europe and ended his manifesto with the words, "Workers of the world, unite!"
