Various Sikh organisations in Nawanshahr, Punjab on Saturday sought action against Hindu Shiv Sena activists for allegedly blocking the Nawanshahr-Chandigarh road, following the death of the outfit's national President Abhishek Batta in a car accident. Batta's brother alleged that it was a planned murder as he was targeted by pro-Khalistani forces and had received many death threats.
