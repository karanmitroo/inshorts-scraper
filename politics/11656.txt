A WhatsApp video showing BJP's Rajkot candidate Mohan Kundariya walking over school children's backs has gone viral, causing major embarrassment for the party. The video was taken at a yoga camp organised by Arya Samaj. Kundariya has defended himself saying the organizers forced him to walk on students; he further said it was done to demonstrate the students' yoga skills.
