Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has called Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar a "poor lame duck", stating he has his sympathies with Parsekar. "Thanks Amit Shah ji for accepting Parsekar as a Robot with his Remote in Parrikar's hands," he tweeted. His remarks came after Shah said people of Goa must vote thinking that government will work under ex-CM Manohar Parrikar's guidance.
