TMC leader Saugata Roy today said the alliance between CPI(M) and Congress will have no effect on Trinamool Congress in the upcoming elections in West Bengal. "TMC has won last few elections with handsome margins, fighting all alone against the opposition parties," he said. He doubted if the alliance would be successful in transferring their votes to each other.
