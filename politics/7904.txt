Maharashtra forest minister and BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar on Tuesday said he will gift Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray a fibre-made tiger replica as a "symbol of friendship" between the two parties. The 7ft long, 3.5ft wide replica will also symbolise our 'Save Tiger' campaign, he added. Last week Sena had slammed Mungantiwar for the death of four tiger cubs.
