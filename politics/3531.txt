On the polling day in Punjab, Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Saturday labelled AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal as 'ISI-sponsored', alleging he is having dinner and breakfast with Babbar Khalsa. "Punjab wants a government that coordinates with the Centre and not one that has issues with Centre every day and ruined Delhi," she further said.
