Former Delhi Law Minister Jitender Singh Tomar, who was arrested in June for enrolling as an advocate on the basis of a fake degree, was granted bail by the Delhi court on Thursday. However, he had to furnish a bail bond of Rs 50,000. His bail was once rejected before, as the police had claimed the investigation was ongoing.
