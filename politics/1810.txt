Several posters that have been put up outside AAP office in Delhi have termed party leader Kumar Vishwas as a "traitor" and accused him of indulging in anti-party activities. The people who have put up the posters are yet to be identified. This comes after Vishwas asked the party's volunteers in Rajasthan not to stay in five-star hotels and farmhouses.
