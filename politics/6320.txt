BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday called Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar a "vote katwa (splitter)" who will try to divide BJP's votes in the 2017 Assembly elections. Asserting that the Bihar CM knows he cannot win even a single seat in UP, Shah claimed that he is campaigning in the state to help the ruling Samajwadi Party retain power.
