AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that his party MLA Jitender Singh Tomar had kept him in the dark regarding his educational qualification. "...but now I've taken a strict action against my MLA," he said. Kejriwal further challenged PM Narendra Modi to do the same with Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje in the Lalit Modi row.
