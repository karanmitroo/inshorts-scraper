Preparing for Narendra Modi's maiden 'Hunkar rally' in Patna on October 27, BJP has reserved 11 trains, more than 3,000 buses and would install a 30-feet dynamic LED screen as a backdrop on the stage at Patna's Gandhi Maidan. For a comprehensive coverage of the rally, the party had decided to use service of around 12 of its own cameramen.
