Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has urged PM Narendra Modi to take some tangible action against terrorism instead of making speeches about it. "I want my government to talk less and act more. We are tired of hearing from our Prime Minster, Defence Minister about their possible retaliations, but despite that soldiers are dying," the former Union Minister stated.
