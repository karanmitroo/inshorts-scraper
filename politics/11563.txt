Sonia Gandhi has reportedly refused to hand over a copy of her passport to a US Court in connection with a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, saying the Indian government will not allow it. She was asked for the copy after she denied receiving any federal summons saying she wasn't in US from Sept 2-12, 2013 when the summons were served.
