Accepting Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse's resignation, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today said a retired High Court judge would conduct an inquiry into the allegations. Khadse had demanded the inquiry after being charged with allegations of impropriety in a land deal and alleged calls from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. He had tendered his resignation earlier in the day.
