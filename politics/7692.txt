AAP leader Kumar Vishwas on Monday sought an apology from his critics over his "character assassination" after the Delhi police reportedly gave a clean chit to him in an alleged molestation case. Vishwas, in a Facebook post, hit out at "supari-journalists, political parasites, ill-intended people" for "running negative hashtags" and claimed that another "conspiracy" has been exposed.
