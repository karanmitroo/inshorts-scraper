BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's car was pelted on Saturday with tomatoes and eggs in Kanpur by protesters who also showed their dissent by waving black flags as Swamy's convoy passed by. The protesters attempted to surround his car and stop the convoy when Swamy was on his way to VVSD college in Nawabganj to attend a seminar on global terrorism.
