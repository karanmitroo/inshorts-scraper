Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar Sunday alleged that former PM Manmohan Singh is paying for the 'sins' of his party saying that the Congress high command did not allow him to auction the coal blocks. The BJP leader added, "I sometimes feel pity for Manmohan Singh...he wanted auction route for coal mining, but couldn't muster the courage to say this."
