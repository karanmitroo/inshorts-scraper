Slamming PM Narendra Modi's recent visit to Pakistan, the Shiv Sena on Monday said that politicians who tried to get "too close to Pakistan" have "not been able to remain in politics for long." The editorial in the Sena's mouthpiece, Saamna, further termed Pakistan's soil as “cursed” saying that it is soaked in the blood of lakhs of innocent Indians.
