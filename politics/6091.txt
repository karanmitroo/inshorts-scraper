BJP’s Dalit MPs have urged the NDA government and the party to send out a strong message against incidents of cow vigilantism. "It’s the responsibility of the party and government to create an atmosphere in which all humans are respected,” said Nagina MP Yashwant Singh. These incidents are against our Constitution and culture, said Etawah MP Ashok Kumar Dohrey.
