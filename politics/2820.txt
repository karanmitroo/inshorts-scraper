Congress party's Okram Ibobi Singh on Monday resigned as Manipur's Chief Minister after refusing to quit claiming that the party had enough support to form the government. This comes after BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate N Biren Singh met Governor Dr Najma Heptulla to stake the party's claim to form the government, and the Governor asked for Ibobi Singh's resignation.
