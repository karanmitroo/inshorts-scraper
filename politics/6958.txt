Senior Vice President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Sunday said that the National Panchayati Raj day function addressed by PM Narendra Modi in Jamshedpur was a flop. "Modi did not announce anything new but kept repeating unfulfilled assurance in his address to panchayat representatives from across the country," he added, and termed JMM's protest against domicile policy as 'historic'.
