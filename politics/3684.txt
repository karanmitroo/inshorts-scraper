Lok Dal President Sunil Singh has alleged the Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav has been kept under house arrest in his own home. "Akhilesh Yadav has kept him under 'nazarband' (house arrest). No one is allowed to meet him," Singh apprised Home Minister Rajnath Singh. "Some unfortunate incident can happen to him (Mulayam) like Kanshiram and Jayalalitha," he added.
