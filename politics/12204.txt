Adarsh Shastri, the grandson of former PM late Lal Bahadur Shastri, quit his job at Apple and joined Aam Aadmi Party on Friday. "I had a cushy life with a great company. But somehow it did not feel right. I was inspired by Arvind (Kejriwal) and felt compelled to do more," Adarsh said. Notably, Adarsh's father is a long-time Congressman.
