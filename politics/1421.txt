Goa CM Manohar Parrikar said that social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp will be misused extensively ahead of the August 23 Panaji Assembly by-polls. His comments came a few days after a fake news claiming that Parrikar would rejoin the Defence Ministry if he lost the upcoming by-polls went viral. "Someone created bogus news and quoted it everywhere," Parrikar added.
