The National Commission for Women (NCW) has received a complaint wherein Patidar leader Hardik Patel is accused of sexually exploiting a girl. The complaint wasn't filed by the girl herself and a team from NCW will travel to Gujarat's Surat to meet the girl. The victim said she will talk to NCW confidentially as she was scared to come forward.
