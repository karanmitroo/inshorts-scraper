Former PM Manmohan Singh at a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on Finance on Thursday asked if the RBI was given sufficient time to hold discussions on the demonetisation move. He also suggested that the panel, which is looking into the demonetisation decision, call government officials to depose before it hears RBI Governor Urjit Patel on January 18 or 19.
