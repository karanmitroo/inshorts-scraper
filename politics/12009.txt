Congress has decided to remove Uttarakhand CM Vijay Bahuguna ahead of the national elections, with union minister Harish Rawat being the frontrunner to replace him on Saturday, according to highly-placed sources. Bahuguna has been in the firing line for his inept handling of the relief and rehabilitation work carried out by his government after last year's flash floods.
