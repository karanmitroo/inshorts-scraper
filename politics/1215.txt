Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday thanked External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj "for recognising Congress governments' great vision and legacy of setting up IITs and IIMs". This came after Swaraj in her address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) said that India has established institutions like IITs and IIMs while Pakistan had created terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba.
