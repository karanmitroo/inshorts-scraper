RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya has said that Congress was losing it mass base by questioning the RSS and added that it should compete with BJP instead. This comes days after Rahul Gandhi slammed the RSS over lack of women in the organisation. "The Sangh has decided not to include women...Rahul Gandhi should worry about women in his party," he added.
