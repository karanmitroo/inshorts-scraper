BJP MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker has been appointed as the Protem Speaker for floor test in Goa Assembly, which is scheduled for Thursday. The Congress had accused Goa Governor Mridula Sinha of flouting the norms by giving the BJP the first chance to stake claim over the state government. Notably, the Congress was the single largest party in Goa Assembly polls.
