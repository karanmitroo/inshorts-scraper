Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal on Wednesday remarked that officers are "scared" to appoint women as their personal assistants after the passage of the bill to prevent sexual harassment of women at workplace. "This law may also be misused like the anti-dowry law and may result in a situation in which the women themselves are deprived of justice," he said.
