Criticising the Union Government, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday tweeted a news report on the Global Hunger Index wherein India dropped 45 places since 2014, along with a couplet by poet Dushyant Kumar. Union Minister Smriti Irani replied with a couplet of her own, alleging that he was hungry for power and was trying to malign the nation.
