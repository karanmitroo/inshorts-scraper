Rajya Sabha was disrupted twice on Friday after the Opposition protested against the Government over minister VK Singh's 'dog remark' and questioned RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's comment over Ram Temple construction. Congress leaders and BSP chief Mayawati asked for VK Singh's removal and Samajwadi Party's Ram Gopal Yadav said Ram Temple issue was pending in courts.
