Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Friday said the main problem that Congress faced was that the party leaders were unaware of the expectations of the masses. "We don't try to know what people expect from us. What can we do if we don't understand their needs?", Priyanka said at a meeting of Congress leaders in Rae Bareli.
