J&K CM and PDP supremo Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday suggested that after revoking AFSPA in few areas of the region, situation can be assessed and if successful then it can be revoked entirely. Mufti's suggestion came after she met Home Minister Rajnath Singh who is on a two-day visit to the Valley to take stock of the Kashmir unrest.
