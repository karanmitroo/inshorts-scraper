PM Narendra Modi on Monday paid tribute to Jawaharlal Nehru on his 127th birth anniversary and said, "Your family and party abuse me, but I'm here to fulfil your vision." "My decision (demonetisation) is a little harsh. When I was young, poor people used to ask for 'kadak' (strong) tea but it spoils the mood of the rich," Modi added.
