Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday accused PM Narendra Modi of "narrow-mindedness" and indulging in "low-level politics" by criticising his political opponents on foreign land. "No other PM has ever criticised and sullied the image of his political rivals on foreign soil. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done so, showing his narrow mindedness and low-level politics," she said.
