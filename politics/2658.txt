Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Jet Airways, and GoAir on Friday announced their decision to ban Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad from flying on their flights with immediate effect. Gaikwad had recently hit an Air India staffer with his slippers. "We believe that exemplary action should be taken in such incidents to protect employee morale and public safety," a statement stated.
