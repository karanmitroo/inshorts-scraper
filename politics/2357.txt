Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday blamed the media and voters for the electoral loss in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Media only highlighted the family feud, while the people were befooled by BJP, he asserted. Meanwhile, the state BJP unit claimed that Yadav was "putting a question mark on the wisdom of the people of the state".
