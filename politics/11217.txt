BJP leader Subramanian Swamy called social activist Medha Patkar a Maoist on Facebook recently, for speaking out against death penalty for the likes of convicted terrorists, Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab. Responding to it, Patkar said, "Let him prove I am a Maoist...Maoists themselves would never claim the same. Non-violence for us is a value and not merely a strategy."
