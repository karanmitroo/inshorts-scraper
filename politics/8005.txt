BJP MP Kirti Azad was on Wednesday described as a "hero" by party MP Shatrughan Sinha, after Azad backed allegations of corruption in the DDCA during Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's tenure as its president. Sinha also said the "Party With a Difference" had become the "Party With Differences". He further asked Jaitley to fight the issue "politically" instead of "legally".
