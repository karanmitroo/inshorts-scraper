Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi was on Saturday stopped from entering UP's clash-hit Saharanpur after he was denied permission to visit the area by the district administration. "I wanted to go to Saharanpur but was told law and order could deteriorate... Dalits are being crushed not only in Saharanpur but all over India and the BJP-led Centre is responsible," Gandhi said.
