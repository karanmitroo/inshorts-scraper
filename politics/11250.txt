Speaking to reporters during his election campaign in Amethi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said - "We will not support any front. We will get the required number (of seats)". Rahul's statement comes just a day after CPI(M) asserted that Congress may be forced to support a government of secular parties to keep the BJP out of power.
