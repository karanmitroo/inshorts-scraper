After BJP Uttar Pradesh Vice President was sacked for comparing Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) chief Mayawati to a prostitute, BSP MLA Usha Chaudhary on Thursday called him an illegitimate​ child. "I think there’s something wrong with Dayashankar Singh’s DNA. He himself is an illegitimate child that's why he made such a comment against 'behenji' (Mayawati)," she said.
