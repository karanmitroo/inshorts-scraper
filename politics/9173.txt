A suspected snooping device has been recovered from the office of the newly appointed Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) chief MK Meena. Reportedly, the spy device, disguised as a pen, was spotted by Meena himself while cleaning his desk. Delhi Lt Governor Najeeb Jung had appointed Meena after replacing AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal's hand-picked candidate SS Yadav for the post.
