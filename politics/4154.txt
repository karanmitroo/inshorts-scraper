The Election Commission, which is the binding authority in disputes regarding party symbols, follows the Symbols Order when parties split. The EC tests the strength of party organisation’s support among the splitting factions. However, the Symbol Order applies only to recognised political parties’ disputes, and in the case of unrecognised parties, EC may advise them to approach the court.
