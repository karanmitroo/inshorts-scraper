Minister in Punjab CM Amarinder Singh's Cabinet, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, was caught on camera while threatening to suspend a school principal after he found his name in the third spot on the inauguration stone. "I can suspend you immediately for this mistake. Aren't you aware, who is the chief guest?" Dharamsot allegedly said in the video.
