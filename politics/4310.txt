Following reports of cash deposits of over â‚¹104 crore in party accounts, BSP supremo Mayawati on Tuesday asserted that the party followed rules and procedure to deposit its money. It is donation money collected from Uttar Pradesh before demonetisation, she said. Accusing BJP of having an anti-Dalit mentality, Mayawati alleged that it was using state machinery to malign BSP's image.
