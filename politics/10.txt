Nagaland CM and Naga People's Front leader TR Zeliang on Tuesday resigned from his post after the BJP stood by its pre-poll alliance with Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). Zeliang, whose party secured 27 seats in the Assembly elections, had earlier refused to resign and said he will seek support from the BJP.
