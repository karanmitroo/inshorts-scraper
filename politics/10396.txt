While the BJP government celebrated Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary by calling it National Unity Day, the Congress has taken a cue and organised massive celebrations for Jawahar Lal Nehru's birth anniversary. The Congress will be organising one of its biggest ever pre-election rallies in the capital on Thursday to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru.
