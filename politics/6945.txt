Shiv Sena on Saturday threatened action against its leader Haji Arafat Shaikh for his statement that activist Trupti Desai would be welcomed with slippers if she tried to enter the Haji Ali Dargah. Notably, Desai, who earlier fought for women entry to the Shani Shinganapur Temple's sanctum, is now demanding entry for women in the Haji Ali Dargah.
