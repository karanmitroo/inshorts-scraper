The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Tuesday decided to extend the tenure of Congress President Sonia Gandhi by another year, putting on hold Rahul Gandhi's elevation to the post. The deadline of December 31 for organisational elections was also extended. Speaking at the meeting, Sonia Gandhi lashed out at the Modi Government saying it failed on delivering its election promises.
