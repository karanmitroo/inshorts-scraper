Cups carrying photographs of PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah with an appeal to become a BJP member were found on the Delhi-Amritsar Shatabdi Express. Northern Railways officials said the cups to be used by the BJP in their rallies were supplied to the railways by mistake. A probe has been ordered into the matter.
