AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday tweeted that PM Narendra Modi is working for BJP-mukt Bharat and not Congress-mukt Bharat. "People have started hating BJP so much that for the next 20 years no one will vote for the party," the Delhi CM added. He also said that the PM has become a subject of ridicule internationally.
