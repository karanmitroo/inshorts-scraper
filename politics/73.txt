PM Narendra Modi on Saturday said the Congress does not consider Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh as its own, adding that he is an "independent solider". Singh said PM Modi's remarks were "frivolous" and will not create a difference between him and his party. The Congress has full faith in my leadership, the Punjab CM added.
