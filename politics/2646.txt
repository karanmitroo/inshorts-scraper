Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav has said that if UP CM Adityanath is a 'Yogi' and an honest advocate of religion, he should totally ban liquor in Uttar Pradesh like it is in Bihar. "Yogiji, don't divert people's attention and constitute [an] anti-daru squad (anti-liquor squad)," he said. Alcohol is more harmful than Gutkha or Paan Masala, he added.
