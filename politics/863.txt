Lalu Prasad Yadav has been elected as National President of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for the tenth consecutive time. He was the only person to file a nomination for the post of the party President. Following Lalu's election, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar took a dig at RJD calling it a "private political party" and a "family political asset".
