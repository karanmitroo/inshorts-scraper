BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain on Saturday said that Muslims should "come forward to demand a ban on the sale of beef in their respective states to promote communal harmony." "Decisions are taken by the government based on public sentiments. The Maharashtra government too has banned the sale of beef after taking public sentiments into account," he added.
