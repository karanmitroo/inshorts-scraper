BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday said in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh that 'BIMARU' (ill) states -- Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan -- have improved, but not Uttar Pradesh. Notably, MP and Rajasthan are currently being ruled by the BJP. Bihar is being governed by Grand Alliance under the leadership of JD(U) Chief Nitish Kumar, earlier a part of the NDA.
