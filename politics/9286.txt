Former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh Sunday presented BJP-led NDA government's report card and claimed Narendra Modi to be an arrogant Prime Minister. He saw MODI as an abbreviation of Murder of Democratic India, accusing him of bypassing the parliament for 48 out of 53 bills through the year. Ramesh further saw it analogous to Mamta Baneerjee’s “one-woman government” in Bengal.
