In a move to discourage habitual absenteeism from party meetings, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has said that party leaders found absent from 3 consecutive meetings will be removed from their posts. This comes after several leaders reportedly skipped a meeting called to plan the one-year anniversary of demonetisation. Leaves cannot be taken for flimsy reasons, Tiwari added.
