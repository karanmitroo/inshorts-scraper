After Pankaja Munde, another Maharashtra minister Vinod Tawde is facing allegations of irregularities in a contract for fire extinguishers for schools allegedly awarded by him without a tender. The Rs 191 crore contract has been put on hold after the finance department objected to it. Tawde, however, refuted the allegations saying, "I haven't given a single rupee to any contractor."
