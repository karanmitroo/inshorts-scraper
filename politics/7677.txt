Assam CM Tarun Gogoi on Monday said that the forthcoming assembly election in the state will be a showdown between him and PM Narendra Modi. He added that the BJP "will be vanquished in the assembly elections" similar to how the Assamese 'crushed' the Mughals. Notably, Gogoi was responding to BJP state president Sarbananda Sonowal calling him a Mughal general.
