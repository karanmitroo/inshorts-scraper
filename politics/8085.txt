Slamming extremist elements, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday told BJP party workers and common people to "listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home minister Rajnath Singh, not Sakshi Maharaj." He added that people like Maharaj "don't represent the views of the government." Gadkari also claimed that the Opposition is building a psychosis among the minorities against Modi.
