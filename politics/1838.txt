Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi said that he will be taking a break from politics to visit his grandmother in Italy and the BJP termed it as "picnic" of a "kid during summer vacations". "You can't expect Rahulji to be worried about the country or the farmers. He does politics to enjoy his picnics," Madhya Pradesh BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said.
