JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Thursday said PM Narendra Modi crossed limits of decency in his remark on former PM Manmohan Singh. "Had someone else said it, it would have been different. PM should not have said so, it was in bad taste," Yadav added. Modi had said that only Manmohan knows how to take bath while wearing a raincoat.
