Actor-turned-politician Khushbu quit the DMK on Monday ‘with a heavy heart’. In a letter to party chief, M Karunanidhi, Khushbu said, "My tenure in the DMK had been a one-way-traffic and I have always fulfilled the responsibilities given to me with 100% involvement. This is known to the leaders as well as the cadres.” Khushbu had joined DMK in May-2010.
