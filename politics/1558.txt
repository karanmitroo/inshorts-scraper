The Patna High Court on Monday rejected two Public Interest Litigations challenging the formation of the new JD(U)-BJP government in Bihar. The court said no intervention was required after the new alliance won the floor test in the state assembly. The petitions called the new government "unconstitutional" as the people's mandate in 2015 Assembly elections was for the Grand Alliance.
