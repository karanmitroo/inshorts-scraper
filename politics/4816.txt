BSP leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui has said that the Samajwadi Party used Muslims like ‘tejpatta’ (spice) is used in the biryani for aroma but is removed after the dish gets ready. He further said that the SP had promised the release of Muslim youths implicated in terror cases before 2012 assembly elections but has not done anything in this regard.
