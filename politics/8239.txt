At the BJP-led ‘India Ideas Conclave’ in Goa on Monday, J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed praised PM Narendra Modi's leadership and development agenda but cautioned against "loose cannons in the party”. Mentioning that development has taken a backseat, Mufti said the BJP-PDP "historic alliance" in the state came into being just for the "larger good".
