Former J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Sunday said that his party National Conference (NC) is "not power hungry" and remains unchanged in its decision to not form an alliance with the BJP. Omar was clarifying his father and NC president Farooq Abdullah's earlier statement which he claimed was misconstrued. "He never said NC will support the BJP," said Omar.
