Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday slammed Union Minister Sushma Swaraj over the Lalit Modi UK travel case and said that she was an expert in theatrics. Reacting to Swaraj's question that whether Sonia would have helped Modi's ailing wife if she were in her place, Gandhi said, "I'd have done my best to help... but not by breaking law."
