BJP National President Amit Shah on Tuesday claimed that the party will form the government in Gujarat by winning over 150 seats in the state assembly elections. Taking a dig at Congress, Shah said that the rival party should clarify under whose leadership it is fighting polls, adding that Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi has no vision for the state.
