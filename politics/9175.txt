Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked the Narendra Modi-led NDA government over the proposed bullet train project in India. Gandhi said that the bullet trains will only be beneficial for people with 'suit-boots' and not for the poor. "They acquire farmers' land for the benefit of industrialists. In return, they are not benefited in any manner," he added.
