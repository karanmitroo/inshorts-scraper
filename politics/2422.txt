Karnataka's BJP President and MP BS Yeddyurappa has been caught in a video handing over money to a farmer's family, ahead of the by-polls to two state Assembly constituencies. However, Yeddyurappa said he was giving relief of â‚¹1 lakh to the family of a farmer, who had committed suicide recently. It had nothing to do with the elections, Yeddyurappa added.
