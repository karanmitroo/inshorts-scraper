Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday extended support to the protesting Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) workers who have been on strike since January 27 over non-payment of dues. Kejriwal, through tweets, hoped that the HC verdict on Tuesday will bring some solution. Earlier, Deputy CM Manish Sisodia blamed the BJP for misappropriation of funds and the strike.
