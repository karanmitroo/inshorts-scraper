Denying any link to fraud-accused jeweller Nirav Modi, Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi has said Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her colleagues are liable to civil and criminal defamation for "patently false allegations". "What the Defence Minister said is false. Neither I, nor my wife or my children have any relation with Mehul Choksi or Nirav Modi," Singhvi added.
