The Samajwadi Party on Thursday alleged discrimination by the Centre in releasing funds for Uttar Pradesh. Sloganeering SP members stormed the Rajya Sabha well demanding the Centre's assurance for the funds, following which the upper house was adjourned thrice. The party said ₹1,425 crore for SC/ST scholarship, ₹4,742 crore for hailstorm-hit areas haven't been allocated to UP yet, among others.
