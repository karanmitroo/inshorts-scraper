CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury took to Twitter on Sunday to slam Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah for their 'silence' over the alleged stalking of a girl by the son of Haryana’s BJP chief. "Clearly someone is helping the accused here. Why are the PM and BJP President so silent about stalking of women?” he tweeted.
