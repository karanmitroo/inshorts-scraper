BJP leader Giriraj Singh Wednesday apologised for the racist remarks he made against Congress president Sonia Gandhi, saying that his comments were meant to be "off the record." "... if Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were hurt by my remarks, then I apologise," Singh said. Earlier, Giriraj had said that Congress wouldn't have accepted Sonia if she wasn't "white-skinned".
