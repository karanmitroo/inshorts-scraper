High Court Tuesday exempted former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit from Rs 3 lakh fine imposed on her by a Delhi court in a defamation case. The fine was imposed on her for not appearing in court in the case filed by her against BJP leader Vijender Gupta. "The impugned order is not sustainable and same is set aside," HC said.
