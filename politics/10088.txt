Former BSP leader Haji Yakoob Qureshi has offered a reward of Rs 51 crore for the gunmen who attacked the office of the French satirical newspaper 'Charlie Hebdo' in Paris, killing 12 people. People who disrespect Prophet Mohammed must be punished, he said. Qureshi was suspended from the BSP in 2011 for anti-party activities.
