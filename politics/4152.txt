Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday said that PM Narendra Modi in the last 32 months has done nothing except packaging and marketing UPA schemes as his own new schemes and taking credit for them. "The only thing new which he has done is Demonetisation which is turning out to be a disaster," he tweeted.
