The Delhi government has accused Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung of spying for the Prime Minister. The accusation comes after the Ministry of Home Affairs wrote to the LG seeking details of all officers on deputation with the AAP government. Alleging that the BJP wants to destabilise Delhi government, AAP leader Sanjay Singh called it "an attack on India's federal structure".
