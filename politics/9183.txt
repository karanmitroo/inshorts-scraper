Amid the ongoing controversy over Yoga and Surya Namaskar reportedly being made compulsory in schools, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday clarified that there is “no compulsion” in this regard. Reacting to the objections being made against the same by the Muslim law board, Rajnath said, "Yoga should not be related to any caste, creed and religion."
