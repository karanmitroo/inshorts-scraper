A Delhi court on Tuesday dismissed a criminal complaint against CM Arvind Kejriwal for allegedly using "defamatory and seditious" words against PM Narendra Modi. The court said Kejriwal's words were not intended to disturb the tranquillity of the state. Last December, Kejriwal had allegedly tweeted, "Modi is a coward and a psychopath", after CBI raided the former's Principal Secretary's office.
