In connection with a criminal defamation complaint filed against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal by BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, the former was Monday directed by a Delhi court to "positively appear" before it on May-21. Previously, Kejriwal was summoned Monday but he didn't appear saying that he was busy in campaigning for the elections.
