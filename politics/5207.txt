UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Monday reportedly broke down at the Samajwadi Party office, stating, “Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) taught me to fight against injustice. Why will I form a new party...I will fight the conspiracy against me and Netaji.” "I was hurt when Amar Singh said that by November I won't be CM in UP," he added.
