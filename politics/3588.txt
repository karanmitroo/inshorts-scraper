Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti on Monday said those against Article 370 are similar to those forces who want only one religion in Kashmir. Notably, while RSS and BJP are against Article 370, the hardliners want one religion in Kashmir. Her statement came after ex-J&K CM Omar Abdullah had said BJP can use the judiciary to scrap Article 370.
