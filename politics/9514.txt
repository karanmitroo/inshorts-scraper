A crucial meeting of the Aam Aadmi Party's 320-member National Council began on Saturday amid senior leader Yogendra Yadavâ€™s dharna outside the venue. "I am told that at least 15-20 legitimate members, who have been sent invitations, are not being allowed inside," Yadav alleged. Later, he went inside, saying that he will register his protest at the meeting.
