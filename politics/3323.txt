An all-party meeting convened by Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan in Kannur on Tuesday decided to take joint efforts to turn the state's Kannur area into a 'violence-free' zone. This comes amid several reports of party workers amassing armaments in the district. Last month, a 52-year-old BJP worker was stabbed to death allegedly by CPI(M) activists in the district.
