Dharmapal Siwach, president of the Haryana Hindu Mahasabha, has stirred a controversy by appealing to Hindu youth to marry girls from other faiths as a counter to 'Love Jihad'. The 'Bahu Laao Beti Bachaao' campaign would be launched from February, Siwach said. "We will ensure the dignity of the girls of other religions in the campaign," he added.
