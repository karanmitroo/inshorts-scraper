Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has declared a virtual war on the people of Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday. "It has become LG vs farmers, LG vs advocates, LG vs women, LG vs Delhiites," Kejriwal tweeted. He made these comments after appealing to Jung not to cancel the public welfare decisions taken by the AAP government since 2015.
