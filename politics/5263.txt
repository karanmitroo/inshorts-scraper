Chhattisgarh MLA RK Rai, suspended by the Congress on Tuesday, has alleged that he was suspended because he spoke against Rahul Gandhi. “I can’t call a donkey a horse...If the party feels my observation is wrong then either it’s blind or acting like a blind person,” Rai said. The Chhattisgarh Congress, however, claimed that he was suspended for “anti-party” activities.
