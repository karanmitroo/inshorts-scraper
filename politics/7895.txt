Responding to Union Minister VK Singh's jibe of being jobless these days, Congress leader Manish Tewari on Monday hit back saying he has more work than the Ministers of State (MOS) in the Government of India. The former General Singh's statement criticising Tewari was in response to the former Minister's confirmation of "unfortunate" troop movement at Raisina hill in 2012.
