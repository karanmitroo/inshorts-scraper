The Madras High Court on Monday closed a petition filed by expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa against Sasikala Natarajan's appointment as the party's General Secretary. Pushpa had alleged that as per AIADMK by-laws, the person contesting for the General Secretary post must have been a continuous member of AIADMK for five years, and Natarajan did not fulfil this norm.
