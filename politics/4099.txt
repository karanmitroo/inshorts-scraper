The by-polls for Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in Punjab are scheduled to take place on February 4 along with the state Assembly election. The by-polls were due in Amritsar after former Congress MP Captain Amarinder Singh had resigned from the constituency in protest against the Supreme Court ruling on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal row.
