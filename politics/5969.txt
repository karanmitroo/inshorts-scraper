BJP's Kailash Vijayvargiya has blamed India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Had Nehru "given liberty to the Home Minister Sardar Patel to integrate Jammu and Kashmir with India... such a problem would not have arisen", he said. Nehru granted special constitutional status to Kashmir as he had "special attraction" towards it, Vijayvargiya added.
