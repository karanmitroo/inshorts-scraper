Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) workers on Saturday burnt the effigy of AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal in Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab. The workers were protesting against the usage of Golden Temple's image superimposed with the AAP's election symbol 'broom' on the cover of its youth manifesto. A SAD leader alleged that Kejriwal was "playing with the sentiments" of Sikhs for "political gains".
