Superstar Salman Khan's father and noted scriptwriter Salim Khan on Wednesday launched the Urdu version of BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi's official website. "I share personal relation with Narendra Modiji, so we launched the website at my place. I had given this suggestion of a website to Modiji. This is not BJP's strategy for Muslim voters," Khan said.
