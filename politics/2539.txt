After some political parties raised question over the reliability of EVMs, Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh Yadav's daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav on Sunday demanded that future elections should be conducted on ballot papers. "If the allegations against EVM machines are proved, then the elections must immediately be dismissed. If not, then the elections must be held on ballot paper," she added.
