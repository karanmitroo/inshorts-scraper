Shiv Sena on Saturday slammed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for going ahead with the Indo-Pak cricket series in December and asked whether it was in honour of 'Team Kasab'. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna said, "Pakistan had sent its cricket team who made a double century by killing innocent people and 20 policemen."
