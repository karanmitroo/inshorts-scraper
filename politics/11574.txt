The Election Commission has asked the Gujarat Energy and Petroleum Minister Saurabh Patel to disclose his relationship with the Ambani family. He was asked to do so, in connection with his complaint against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, who had accused him of favouring Reliance, being the "son-in-law of the Ambani family".
