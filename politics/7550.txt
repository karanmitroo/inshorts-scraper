While discussing JNU controversy in the Parliament, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that "hate speech isn't freedom of expression". "Does the right to free speech give me the right to break the country?", Jaitley questioned. "JNU isn't a sovereign territory where police cannot enter. If IPC is being violated, police is in its right to enter," he added.
