RSS ideologue Professor Rakesh Sinha on Wednesday affirmed that the Sangh Parivar and Hindu Samaj are very determined about the construction of the Ram temple and there is no relation between Ramayana museum and temple. His remarks came after BJP MP Vinay Katiyar asked the Centre to intensify its efforts to construct Ram temple instead of giving 'lollipop' (Ram museum).
