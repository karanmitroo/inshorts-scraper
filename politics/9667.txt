In a controversial statement, Uttar Pradesh Tourism Minister Om Prakash Singh on Monday called the BJP leaders â€œnajayaz aulad" (illegitimate children) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He alleged that the Union Ministry of Tourism did not sanction any fund for 2014-15.  The minister also accused Modi of making false claims of development and not delivering anything in reality.
