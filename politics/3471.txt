Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said that the BJP has allied with the BSP thrice to form a government in the state, yet PM Narendra Modi included BSP supremo Mayawati's name in his 'SCAM' remark. Modi had recently asked UP voters to get rid of 'SCAM' and expanded the term as 'Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav, and Mayawati'.
