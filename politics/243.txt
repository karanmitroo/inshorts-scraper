Congress on Wednesday shared a Valentine's Day video dedicated to PM Narendra Modi with  'Pehla Nasha' as its theme song. It has messages like 'Break up with hatred', 'Hug less and work more', 'Love all Indians equally' and 'Like every relationship, make promises that you can keep'. The video ends with a caption 'Ab ki baar dher sara pyaar'.
