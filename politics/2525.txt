Congress leader P Chidambaram on Saturday accused the Modi government of controlling the owners of media houses. "Today, believe me, thereâ€™s all pervasive, systematic, infringed control over the owners of the media. You talk to any journalist in Delhi, they will tell you that. Stories are simply killed. This is a serious problem," he added.
