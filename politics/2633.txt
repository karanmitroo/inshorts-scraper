Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on Saturday opposed BJP MP Subramanian Swamy's plea seeking to summon witnesses in the National Herald case. The Congress leaders contended that Swamy's plea was "in the nature of a fishing and roving enquiry which is not permissible in law". Meanwhile, Swamy has sought more time to prepare the argument.
