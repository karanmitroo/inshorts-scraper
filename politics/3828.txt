The BJP on Tuesday demanded that the Election Commission freeze the election symbol of the Congress, alleging that its Vice President Rahul Gandhi violated the model code of conduct by linking his party symbol "hand" with various religious figures. "This is a clear-cut case of corrupt practice. There should be action against both Congress and its leader," the BJP said.
