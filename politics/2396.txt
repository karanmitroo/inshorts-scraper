The Public Works Department of the Delhi government has issued a notice to AAP National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal asking him to immediately vacate the party's Rouse Avenue office. This comes after Lt Governor Anil Baijal ordered cancellation of the office allotment to AAP in the wake of Shunglu Committee's report which pointed out irregularities in government accommodation allotments.
