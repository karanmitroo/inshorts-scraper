Five objects, suspected to be crude bombs, were found at an election rally of West Bengal state Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, in Murshidabad on Friday. They were found beneath the stage from where he was to address the rally. After the incident, Chowdhury alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress was "trying to create an environment of terror across Bengal".
