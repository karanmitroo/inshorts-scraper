Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday along with his senior party colleagues and workers took a suburban train in Mumbai as he kicked off his Maharashtra tour. Passengers trying to board the local from Andheri were inconvenienced and at AAPâ€™s destined station Churchagate, there was a mad rush. A group of youths showed Kejriwal black flags as he was leaving the station.
