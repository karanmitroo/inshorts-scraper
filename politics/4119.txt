Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara on Thursday termed the recent Bengaluru mass molestation case a conspiracy to defame the state's Congress government and the Information Technology city. Earlier, he was reported as saying "these things do happen" over the case. However, the minister said that he was misquoted by the media and promised to make Bengaluru safer for women.
