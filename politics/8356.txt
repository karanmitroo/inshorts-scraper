The BJP registered a complaint with the Election Commission (EC) on Friday, alleging that the Grand Alliance was polarising voters during the Bihar elections. A delegation led by Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told the EC, “The Congress-­RJD-­JD(U) have been engaged in a conspiracy to disturb communal harmony in the state by making provocative and derogatory statements against BJP leaders."
