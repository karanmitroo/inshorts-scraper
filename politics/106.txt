Ahead of the announcement of the Tripura Assembly election results, a leader of the ruling-CPM on Friday said the results will have far-reaching consequences for the national politics as well as the party. The party, which has been ruling the state for 25 years, also said it might "adjust" with the Congress, if required, to stop the BJP from winning.
