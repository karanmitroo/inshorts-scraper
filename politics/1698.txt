BJP MPs submitted 18 out of the 46 leave applications received by the current Lok Sabha in its three years. It was followed by nine applications from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and four each from Congress and BJD. MPs submit applications to the speaker for longer leaves as non-permitted absence over 60 days can lead to disqualification from the House.
