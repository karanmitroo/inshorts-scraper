Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday said that terming Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakore, and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani as "HAJ" was "playing the communal card and divisive politics". This comes after posters depicted Gujarat polls as a "RAM and HAJ" face-off, wherein "RAM" stood for CM Vijay Rupani, BJP chief Amit Shah, and PM Narendra Modi.
