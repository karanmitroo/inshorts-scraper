Following a crushing defeat of the Aam Aadmi Party in the recently concluded elections, party leader Ilyas Azmi has accused Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh of "bossism'', saying they had destroyed the party's chances. "I don't know how far it is true but allegations were made that tickets were sold. That damaged us,'' Azmi further said.
