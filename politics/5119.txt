Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav's 'rath' broke down just after one-kilometre in the Samajwadi Party's statewide 'Vikas Rath Yatra' campaign, reports said. Efforts were being made to repair the Mercedes Benz bus which was modified as the 'rath'. Notably, amid reports of a feud between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh, the campaign was flagged off by the party supremo Mulayam.
