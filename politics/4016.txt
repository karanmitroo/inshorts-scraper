Former PM Manmohan Singh on Monday said demonetisation will have a "very significant adverse effect" on the country's GDP. Citing that he made the statement in the Parliament during Winter Session, Manmohan added the subsequent developments have proved him right. Releasing the Congress manifesto for Punjab polls, Manmohan said that Assembly elections would be fought on the demonetisation issue.
