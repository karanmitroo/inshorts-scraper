Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not taking any action over scams, just like his predecessor Manmohan Singh. "The same system is prevailing, earlier it was 2G scam, now it is Vyapam, earlier it was Coal scam now it is AgustaWestland, only the names of the scams have been changed," added Kejriwal.
