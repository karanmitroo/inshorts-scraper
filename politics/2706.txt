Punjab CM Amarinder Singh has said Navjot Singh Sidhu's ministry might have to be changed if he wants to continue working in TV. "If it's permissible then we have no issue. Otherwise, he has Culture Ministry and we may have to change his portfolio," Singh said. Sidhu earlier said there was no conflict of interest due to his TV work.
