Maharashtra Minister Pankaja Munde, who is allegedly involvement in a Rs 206 crore scam, said on Wednesday the allegations against her were politically motivated. "The earlier Congress-led regime purchased such items at a cost of Rs 408 crore during its tenure. You call that a purchase and term the procurement made by us a scam," she added.
