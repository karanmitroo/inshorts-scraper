Commenting on Modi’s humble background, Mani Shankar Aiyar said Friday - "I promise you in 21st century Modi will never become the PM… But if he wants to distribute tea here (AICC meeting place), we will find him a place." Earlier, Modi has said that people who are ruling at Centre "don't know what poverty is, but I know it."
