The AIADMK today passed a resolution to sack party's jailed interim General Secretary VK Sasikala from all posts, during a general council meeting. It also added that late state CM J Jayalalithaa is the party's "eternal General Secretary", and all office bearers appointed by her will continue. Further, the unified AIADMK will retrieve the party's 'two leaves' symbol, it said.
