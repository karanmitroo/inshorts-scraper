A day after Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's Twitter account was hacked, the same hackers on Thursday took control of Indian National Congress party's official Twitter handle '@INCIndia'. In a series of tweets, the hackers wrote, "Inspiration on the way for the common people - Fight the atrocious system till the day you die!" Another tweet read, "Justice shall strike!"
