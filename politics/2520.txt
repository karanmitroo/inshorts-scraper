Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday demanded that the Election Commission release electronic voting machines (EVMs) for an investigation into allegations of tampering and deliberate fixing. Addressing reports of a machine registering votes only for BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Kejriwal said, "Recent observations are alarming, paper ballots should be considered to replace EVMs."
