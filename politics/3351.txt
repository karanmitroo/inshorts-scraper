NCP on Monday dared Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to withdraw his support from the present Maharashtra government if he had any guts. NCP leader Nawab Malik also called the constant warnings from Shiv Sena to pull back the support as mere threat. He asserted that NCP will not support any party and was ready for a mid-term poll.
