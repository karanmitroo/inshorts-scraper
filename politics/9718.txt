AAP leader Yogendra Yadav Tuesday alleged BJP of projecting Kiran Bedi as the CM candidate of Delhi after the party had smelled that it was going to lose the assembly elections. "Kiran Bedi's coming definitely hurt the BJP's prospects, but she was brought in after the party realised that it was losing," said Yadav.
