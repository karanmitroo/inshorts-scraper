Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) members on Wednesday brandished weapons like pistols and swords while protesting against the Amarnath terror attack. "If Centre does not avenge Amarnath terror attack within 15 days, Bajrang Dal will have to take law in their hands to protect pilgrims," a Bajrang Dal leader said. They also raised anti-Pakistan slogans and burnt effigies.
