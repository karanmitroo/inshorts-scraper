A day after Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's "we have given Muslims proper sanctity despite not getting their votes" remark, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said, "Who is the minister to say BJP gave us sanctity? It is the constitution who gave sanctity." Owaisi further said, "Government and parties will come and go but constitution will remain as it is supreme."
