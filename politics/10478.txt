Ahead of assembly polls in Jharkhand, Congress on Friday called off its alliance with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), after sharing power for around 16 months in the state. Congress would contest the Assembly polls in Jharkhand along with RJD and JD-U, the party senior official said. Notably, the state will go to five-phase assembly polls from Nov 25.
