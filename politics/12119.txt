Notwithstanding Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's stand against taking any security cover, Ghaziabad police has decided to provide Z category protection to him from Monday. Thirty personnel would be deployed round-the-clock to provide security to him and two escort vehicles will accompany Kejriwal when he is on the move. On Saturday, UP government had decided that Kejriwal would be provided security.
