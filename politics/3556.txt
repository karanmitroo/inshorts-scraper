Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday criticised the Centre for presenting the Union Budget just hours after the death of former Minister E Ahamed. It was "improper, unfortunate and amounted to showing disrespect" to the departed leader, he said. Calling the Budget presentation a "grave mistake", Vijayan said it has hurt the sentiments of the members of the House.
