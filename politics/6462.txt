The Communist Party of India has criticised the recently 'finalised' military logistics sharing pact with the US, saying it undermines India's "long-standing position of independence from any military alliance". The CPI claimed the pact will negatively affect India's bilateral relations with other nations. It also accused the government of buying "useless and defective" nuclear reactors from US.
