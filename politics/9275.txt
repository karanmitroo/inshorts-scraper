The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has changed its logo as Sunil Lal, a party volunteer who claimed to have designed the logo, had last month asked the party to stop using the same. Lal also alleged that AAP had failed to meet people's expectations. The previous saffron-green logo has given way to a blue-coloured one.
