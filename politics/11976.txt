Following a night-long operation by five police teams, the UP cops on Sunday successfully traced down the seven buffaloes which were stolen from the farmhouse of minister Azam Khan. Interestingly, the cops went through hours of CCTV footage at the meat factories to verify the entry of livestock into the premises. Ten people have been detained so far.
