Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh today responded to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's speech in Lok Sabha, calling his comments on the Naga peace accord 'completely false and baselessâ€™. Singh asserted he had several rounds of consultations with PM Narendra Modi before the accord. Gandhi had earlier claimed that Modi did not consult his Cabinet before signing the accord.
