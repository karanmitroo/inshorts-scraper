Congress members in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday accused the state police of lathicharge and staged a protest in Madhya Pradesh's Shivpuri district. The party members alleged that police lathicharged them after they complained about a BJP MLA trying to bribe voters ahead of by-polls. The members further alleged that instead of seizing the MLA's vehicle, police allowed him to escape.
