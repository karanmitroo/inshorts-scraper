BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday claimed that the JD(U) decided not to contest UP Assembly polls under pressure from RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav. "Apparently the RJD supremo threatened to review his partyâ€™s role in the ruling grand alliance," he added. In 2012, JD(U) had contested on 225 seats in UP, but it won no seat, said Modi.
