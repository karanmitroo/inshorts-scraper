The Election Commission on Monday asked the district magistrates of Patna and East Champaran to submit a report regarding the 'sting' operation of JD(U) minister Awadhesh Kushwaha. "We will first look into the inquiry report," Additional Chief Electoral Officer R Lakshmanan said. The sting, that surfaced on Sunday, had exposed Kushwaha accepting a bribe of Rs 4 lakh.
