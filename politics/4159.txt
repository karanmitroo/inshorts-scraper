Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin was on Wednesday elected as the party's working President in the general council meeting. The meeting had earlier been scheduled for December 20, but had to be cancelled in view of 93-year-old DMK President M Karunanidhi's hospitalisation. The meeting was chaired by party General Secretary K Anbazhagan.
