YSR Congress Party President YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has said there is nothing wrong if Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu is shot dead in public for duping people and seeking sympathy votes. "The CM is known for his duplicity, double-dealing and treachery. The people should take a vow to eliminate this Kaliyuga Rakshasa (new age monster)," Reddy added.
