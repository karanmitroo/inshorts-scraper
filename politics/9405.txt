Addressing a farmers' rally at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan on Sunday, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi attacked the Narendra Modi government on the land Bill and accused it of working only for the rich. "Today, when a farmer goes to bed, he doesn't know what will happen to his land the next day. He is living in fear,” he said.
