Delhi CM and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that MLA Somnath Bharti has become an embarrassment to the political party. Kejriwal took to Twitter and added that Bharti should surrender and cooperate with the police. Notably, Bharti, whose arrest in a domestic violence case is due following the rejection of his bail plea, has been absconding since yesterday.
