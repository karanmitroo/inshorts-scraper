National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah, who is contesting the by-poll for the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat, on Sunday slammed the PDP-BJP government for failing to provide a conducive atmosphere for peaceful elections. This comes after at least six people were killed in clashes that broke out between protesters and security personnel at a polling booth in the state's Budgam district.
