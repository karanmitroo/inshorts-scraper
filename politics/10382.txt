A total of 14 congress MLAs were on Tuesday suspended from the Telangana Assembly for a day as they interrupted proceedings over the defections issue that rocked the House for the second consecutive day. The main opposition Congress criticized CM Chandrasekhar Rao for encouraging defections, in violation of the Anti Defection Law and the Constitution.
