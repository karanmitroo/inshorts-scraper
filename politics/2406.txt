BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday said, "With the ruckus that is happening in Kashmir, the EC should cancel the elections for at least two years so that peace prevails and violence issues are sorted out." "The government should send 10,000 soldiers with lots of arms, ammunitions, and money, so they can maintain law and order in Kashmir," he added.
