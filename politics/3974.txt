Addressing a rally in Mohali ahead of Punjab Assembly election, Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia told the voters to cast their vote assuming Delhi CM Kejriwal is the chief ministerial candidate. "Your vote should be in the name of Kejriwal," he added. This comes months after AAP had announced that the party's CM face will be from Punjab.
