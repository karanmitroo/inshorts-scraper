Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Wednesday asked the Centre not to give any evidence or video proof to anyone, just counter the propaganda being spread by Pakistan. “Respond to the propaganda in the same way as the Army responded on the border. The country is with you,” he said. Propaganda can be countered through other ways also, he added.
