Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that the 21st century police cannot be a brute force but will have to be a civilised unit. "Patience and control has to be practised and followed by police forces and the personnel on ground while dealing with hard and challenging situations like riots and protesting crowds," Rajnath added.
