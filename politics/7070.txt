Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that he would strive for forging the "largest possible unity" against the BJP by bringing together the Congress, Left and regional parties, before the 2019 general elections. "Unity among non-BJP parties mean[s] togetherness of ideology and common programmes of governance," he said, adding that BJP will not return to power in 2019.
