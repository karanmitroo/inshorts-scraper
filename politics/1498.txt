Tamil Nadu Chief Minister EK Palaniswami on Friday said that '420' is the apt word for AIADMK Deputy General Secretary TTV Dhinakaran. Addressing the media after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the AIADMK merger, Palaniswami said that the party will sail through if the opposition DMK brings a no-confidence motion against them in the Tamil Nadu Assembly.
