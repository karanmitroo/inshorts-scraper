BJP leader Shazia Ilmi has filed an FIR against several AAP supporters who allegedly posted obscene remarks against her on social media. Ilmi, who had earlier approached the cyber cell to complain about online trolls, claimed that she was being targeted because of the forthcoming Delhi civic polls. "I want to know who these men are," she said.
