The Opposition staged a walkout from the Maharashtra assembly, demanding a probe into the allegations of rape by a woman against a minister of the Devendra Fadnavis-led government. Opposition leader Ajit Pawar claimed he had a CD to prove the allegations. Fadnavis, however, clarified that the victim withdrew her complaint the next day saying it was filed owing to misunderstanding.
