Addressing a rally ahead of BMC polls, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Tuesday alleged Shiv Sena is using its Founder Balasaheb Thackerayâ€™s name to hide its corruption. He further said Sena wants to usurp the plush sea-facing Mayor Bungalow under the name of Balasaheb memorial. "And they (Sena) plan to shift the Mayor inside the Zoo premises," he added.
