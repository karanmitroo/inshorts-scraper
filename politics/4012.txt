Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that Jallikattu, a bull-taming event held during Pongal, is a traditional sport and nobody should have problems with it. He added that the government is getting suggestions to allow Jallikattu, which was banned by the Supreme Court recently. "I don't know whether I should be saying this as a minister," Naidu said.
