Samajwadi Party leader from Uttar Pradesh, Azam Khan, on Tuesday said that the government should focus on developing smart villages instead of smart cities. Criticising the smart city project, Azam claimed that developing smart villages would reduce migration of people from rural India to urban areas. "The smart city project will result in more migration," he added.
