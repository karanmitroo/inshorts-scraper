As UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and PM Narendra Modi traded barbs over 'Gujarat donkeys', Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Friday tweeted that the latter "indeed worked like a donkey". His tweet came after PM Modi said he takes inspiration from the "loyal" and "hard working" animal and was amused that Akhilesh Yadav was afraid of Gujarat's donkeys.
