The Congress on Friday observed ‘Bhagoda Divas’ against the alleged absence of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his ministers from the city which is currently reeling under dengue and chikungunya outbreak. The party also issued a ‘charge-sheet’ on the ‘failures’ of the AAP government in Delhi. It further demanded Kejriwal to hold an all-party meeting to fight the diseases.
