A week after Swami Saswathikananda's family moved Kerala High Court to reopen the case related to his death, Kerala home minister Ramesh Chennithala has said that the crime branch would probe on fresh allegations that Sivagiri mutt head was murdered. Swamiâ€™s body was reportedly found in a Kochi river in 2002 and police had closed the case claiming he drowned.
