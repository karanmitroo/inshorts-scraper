AAP Karnataka Saturday launched 'Selfie with Mufflerman' - a new fund raising campaign to collect funds for the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls. In the campaign, 25 participating donors would be selected through a lucky draw, who will get an opportunity to take a selfie with party chief Arvind Kejriwal. Anyone contributing Rs 500 and above can participate in this programme.
