Backing Union Minister Kiren Rijiju over his 'declining Hindu population' remark, Vishva Hindu Parishad on Tuesday said that the remarks were in the nationâ€™s interest made by a responsible leader who himself is a Buddhist. "Those criticising Rijiju are indulging in cheap politics and minority appeasement which will not only impact the country but also Muslims," said VHP.
