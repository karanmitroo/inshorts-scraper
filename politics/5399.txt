BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday asserted that India can not go to war with Pakistan with an anti-national character like Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in power. India should not respond to Pakistan's claims as it would not take any reaction even if proofs were provided, he added. Kejriwal had earlier asked PM Modi to furnish proofs of the strikes.
