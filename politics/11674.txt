A lawyer named Manoj Dubey has filed a case in a Varanasi court against BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi, party general secretary Amit Shah and city mayor Ram Gopal Mohale over a slogan hailing Modi. Dubey alleged that the "Har har Modi, ghar ghar Modi" slogan, which likens Modi to Lord Shiva, has hurt his religious sentiments.
