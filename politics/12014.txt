Responding back to Kejriwal’s allegation (India’s most corrupt leader), Union minister Kapil Sibal on Saturday said - "I am surprised that a person holding the chief minister's post is making such allegations. I will give him two days' time. If he is able to prove allegations against me, I will quit politics. If he can't, he must leave his position.”
