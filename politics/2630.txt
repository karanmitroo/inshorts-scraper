BJP's Member of Legislative Council Lal Babu Prasad in Bihar was suspended on Tuesday for "unruly conduct" in the house earlier. However, the suspension was withdrawn at the request of BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi even before the day's session ended. Prasad had claimed that he was suspended after "pressure of the ruling Grand Alliance government".
