Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram has said all political parties, including the Congress, have become family-owned enterprises, making it difficult for aspiring politicians to fit in. Further, Karti also said the top leadership of the political parties is reserved for the founding family or the leadership's family which would pave way for alternative platforms.
