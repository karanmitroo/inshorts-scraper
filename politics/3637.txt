The Congress on Sunday said that the BJP has given 21 years exile to Lord Ram as the party has been mentioning the construction of the Ram Temple in its election manifestos since 1996. "Even Lord Ram would have lost faith in the BJP. Who will wait for 21 long years," said Congress leader Tom Vadakkan.
