Less than a month before Assembly elections in West Bengal, a sting operation was aired on Monday showing 11 leaders of the TMC, including state ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Farhad Hakim, allegedly accepting bribes. The sting was conducted by Narada News, a news website. Most of the alleged conversations were held over two years between 2014 and 2016.
