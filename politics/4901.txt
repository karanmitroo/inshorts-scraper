After Indian preacher Zakir Naik's NGO Islamic Research Foundation was issued a ban notification, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said that the move shows the government has zero tolerance for terrorism. "If the government has taken any action, I canâ€™t see any reason why anyone would find fault with such action being taken especially in regard to national interest," he added.
