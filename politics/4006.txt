Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday said north India is more tolerant than south India. "If I have to choose a place to live, I will choose it in north India. Travelling in Bihar, UP and Jharkhand, I find that people are more tolerant," he said. "The elites of south India have seceded from the rest of India," he added.
