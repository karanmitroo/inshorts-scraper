West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has urged the citizens of the state to stay away from the Maoists and denounce them, adding, "They are not going to help you, but I will." Banerjee made the statements while speaking at a public rally at Bhangar, where an alleged Maoist-led agitation against a power grid had claimed two lives five months ago.
