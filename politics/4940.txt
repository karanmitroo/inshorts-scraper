Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's mother exchanging old currency at a bank, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal said that "no good son" would ever want his over 95-year-old mother to face such a situation. "If a son cannot look after his own mother, how can one expects him to look after the people of the country," said Congress leader Rashid Alvi.
