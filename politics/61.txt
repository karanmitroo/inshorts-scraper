Congress leader PL Punia has called BJP's proposed alliance with National People's Party (NPP) and others in Meghalaya "lethal for democracy". Adding that this happened earlier in Goa and Manipur where BJP formed coalition governments, Punia called it an attempt to destabilise people's mandate. The Congress is the largest party with 21 MLAs, however, NPP has claimed 34 MLAs' support.
