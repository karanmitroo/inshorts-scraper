Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi "should be booked for murder" for over 70 deaths linked to his demonetisation move. Since demonetisation, over â‚¹5 lakh crore has been deposited in banks while people have been able to withdraw only 25% of it, creating a panic situation, Nirupam said at the 'Note Pe Charcha' show.
