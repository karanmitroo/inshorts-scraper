AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday said Jallikattu protest is a lesson for Hindutva forces. "Uniform Civil Code cannot be imposed because this nation cannot have one culture. We celebrate all," he added. Meanwhile, Congress leader Shehzad Poonawalla tweeted, "Sangh speaks about Indian culture but doesn't tell Modi to bring law to save Jallikattu. Isn't Tamil culture part of it?"
