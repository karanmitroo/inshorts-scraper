Leaving the Uttarakhand​ Assembly after the floor test on Tuesday, former CM Harish Rawat said, "I thank SC, democratic forces, people of Uttarakhand and gods. Uttarakhand will be victorious tomorrow." Rawat, however, did not reveal whether he could prove his majority in the confidence motion and said, "Won’t comment on what happened inside. Clouds of uncertainty will soon vanish."
