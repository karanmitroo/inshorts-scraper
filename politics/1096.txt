After being defeated by the BJP in the Bhandup bypolls, the Shiv Sena on Saturday accused the party of muzzling the opposition's voice using money and power. "All possible corrupt means are being used to win elections," an editorial in the party's mouthpiece 'Saamana' read. It further alleged that the BJP poached members from other parties to win civic elections.
