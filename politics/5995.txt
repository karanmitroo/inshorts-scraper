Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi has called the passage of the GST Bill a ‘good step for the country’ while pressing for a cap of 18% on its rate. “We earlier had three major differences on GST and we have worked that out. We still have an issue on the 18% cap, which will be discussed in December,” he said.
