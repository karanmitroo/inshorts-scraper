BJP MLA from Hyderabad, T Raja Singh, said, "Hindus in Bengal should respond to people involved in communal violence just like the Hindus in Gujarat did. Otherwise, Bengal will turn into Bangladesh soon." Asking "Bengal tigers" to unite to protect themselves, Singh added, "If you don't demand security, you will be banished from your own state like Kashmiri Hindus were."
