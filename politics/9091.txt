Union Minister Kiren Rijiju apologized on Thursday for inconveniencing the passengers of Air India flight AI-446, which was delayed for an hour in Leh on June 24, in order to accommodate the Minister. An IFS officer's family was "offloaded", to make place for Rijiju. "I must apologize to the off-loaded passengers. They deserve to be treated properly", Mr. Rijiju said.
