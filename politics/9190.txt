Delhi law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar resigned on Tuesday night, hours after being sent to four-day police custody, for allegedly forging his law degree. Tomar doesn’t want this issue to affect party’s or government’s image, an AAP spokesperson said. AAP leader, Ashutosh alleged that the arrest was a home ministry conspiracy. However, Home Minister Rajnath Singh rubbished the charges.
