The Election Commission on Wednesday ordered repolling in five polling stations in Sanis (Nagaland), to be held on May-15. Meanwhile, the ruling Naga People’s Front (NPF) lodged a complaint with EC against the decision of repolling. The repoll has been ordered despite the positive report of “free and fair” elections and on “mere allegations” of the Congress, the NPF alleged.
