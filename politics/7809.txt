CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Monday said that there would be no alliance with the Congress in West Bengal. Earlier, former West Bengal CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appealed to the Congress to jointly work towards defeating the TMC government. Yechury added, "We had said defeat the Trinamool, save Bengal and oust Modi... What Buddhadeb said is in accordance with that."
