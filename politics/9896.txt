BJPâ€™s chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi Saturday said she would host a 'Dil Ki Baat' programme every month similar to PM Narendra Modi's 'Mann Ki Baat' initiative. Expressing confidence that the BJP would form the government in Delhi with absolute majority, Bedi said she will deploy civil defence and home guards for the security of women after becoming Delhi CM.
