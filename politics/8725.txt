The Shiv Sena has demanded that the name of Islampur, a city in Maharashtra's Sangli district, be changed to Ishwarpur. As per Islampur's Sena leader Anandrao Pawar, such a request has been pending since 1986. The move came after a Hindutva organization, Shiv Pratisthan, had sent a memorandum to the Sangli collectorate demanding the change in name.
