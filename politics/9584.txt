During discussion on the Insurance Bill in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, JD(U) president Sharad Yadav called the South Indian women “saanvli" (dark) and praised their dancing skills. When DMK MP Kanimozhi raised objection to his comment, he justified it by saying, “Just because it is a serious discussion, it doesn’t mean one has to be serious all the time.”
