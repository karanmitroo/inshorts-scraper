The AAP and BJP Sikh leaders on Thursday demanded that former PM Rajiv Gandhi be stripped of his Bharat Ratna for justifying the 1984 Sikh riots and rewarding the involved rioters. They also released a deleted video where Gandhi, addressing Congress workers on November 19, 1984 says, "When a big tree falls, the earth shakes".
