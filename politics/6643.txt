Criticising Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, RJD MP Mohammad Taslimuddin on Saturday said he is "not even fit to be a mukhiya, forget about being a Prime Minister". "They are falsely claiming that law and order has improved in the state," he alleged. "I want the RJD-JDU alliance to break today itself if possible, but it's Lalu ji's decision," Taslimuddin added.
