Kiran Bedi, the BJP's chief ministerial candidate for Delhi, is likely to begin her own radio chat 'Dil ki Baat'. "I will start a radio address like PM Modi's Maan Ki Baat. I may call it 'Dil Ki Baat' where youth can call me. I will take live questions and address the problems as CM directly," she said.
