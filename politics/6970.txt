The AAP on Thursday accused the BJP of setting Delhi's dump yards on fire to sabotage the AAP-led government's odd-even restrictions. These fires are "creating [a] health hazard" and polluting Delhi, AAP leader Dilip Pandey alleged. "Such a hatred against Delhiites is not good, Modi ji... You are playing with the lives of Delhiites through MCD," he added.
