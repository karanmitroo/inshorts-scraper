Senior Congress leader and former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said in an interview that "it is possible to hold an honest opinion that the Afzal Guru case was perhaps not correctly decided". Chidambaram added, "There were grave doubts about his involvement (in the 2001 Parliament attack) and its extent". Notably, Chidambaram was the Finance Minister when Afzal was executed.
