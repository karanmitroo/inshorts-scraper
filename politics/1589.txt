Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday claimed that he knew about Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's plans to leave the Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance and form a new government with BJP for the past three or four months. Adding that people go to any extent for power, he said there was no rule or credibility in Indian politics.
