AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan on Tuesday expelled 20 other leaders including interim CM O Panneerselvam from the party. The expelled leaders included several party members who had declared support to Panneerselvam like K Pandiarajan, C Ponnaiyan, and PH Pandian, among others. This comes after the Supreme Court handed a 4-year jail term to Sasikala over the disproportionate assets case.
