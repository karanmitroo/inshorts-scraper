BJP President Amit Shah has reportedly said that the party considers AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi as a bigger opponent than Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Lalu Prasad Yadav. AIMIM is speculated to have the ability to influence the vote bank of 17% of Bihar's total population comprising Muslims. Shah also denied the allegations of Owaisi being a BJP “agent.”
