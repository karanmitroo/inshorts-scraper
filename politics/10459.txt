A bailable warrant was issued against Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Saturday by a Delhi court, after he failed to appear before it in a criminal defamation case lodged against him by union minister Nitin Gadkari. The court issued a bailable warrant against Singh after his counsel moved a plea seeking exemption from personal appearance for the day.
