Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Friday referred to the National Herald case as another "vilification campaign" by the ruling party against the Nehru-Gandhi family. He said, â€œBJP, RSS combine have always considered Nehruvian Ideology and Nehru-Gandhi family as biggest threat to their growth." He said the party would get a "fitting reply" as "Nehruvian Ideology" was ingrained in "Indian ethos".
