A dome shaped pandal (tent) collapsed in Raipur, Chhattisgarh on Friday due to high winds injuring at least 25 people, mostly policemen. The tent was erected for PM Narendra Modi's rally on Saturday, and its fall has questioned the state government's preparations for the event. State PWD Minister Rajesh Munat was also in the tent when the accident happened.
