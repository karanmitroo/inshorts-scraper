Addressing the BJP workers in poll-bound Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress of conspiring to send him and BJP President Amit Shah to jail. Slamming the Congress for "reducing the standards of politics", PM Narendra Modi said, "When nothing worked for Congress, they started abusing development." Development politics by the BJP will beat Congress' dynastic politics, he added.
