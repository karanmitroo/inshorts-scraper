In addition of assuring a regular water supply, better roads and women's safety, the Aam Aadmi Party candidates, during their door-to-door campaigns, are also handing out copies of affidavits saying they will not use "lal-batti ki gadi", live in government accommodation or take police protection, if elected. The affidavit also says candidates will consult the public for all decision making.
