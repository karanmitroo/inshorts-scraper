Shiv Sena, in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', has said that the Bharatiya Janata Party does not respect its allies and backstabbing them is BJP's "modus operandi". The editorial added that the party betrayed Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu the same way it betrayed Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. This comes after Chandrababu Naidu's party announced that it may quit the BJP-led NDA.
