Karnataka's BJP slammed the state CM Siddaramaiah for his comments on PM Narendra Modi, alleging that the CM's behaviour was not "civilised". This comes after Siddaramaiah failed to get an appointment with PM Modi and accused him of not having time to meet a state delegation. The BJP unit also accused the Congress of trying to politicise "every little matter".
