Congress leader Manish Tewari on Friday attacked the Centre over filmmaker Karan Johar's remarks on 'freedom of expression and democracy' and said the government is against all intellectuals and right thinking people. "Except for Anupam Kher, most artists... are speaking in the same tone," Tewari added. Union minister Mukhtar Naqvi hit back saying that those questioning intolerance are "ignorant".
