Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday appointed Amar Singh as the party's General Secretary. Singh, who was expelled from the Samajwadi Party in 2010, rejoined the party recently. Notably, Singh's re-induction into the party was opposed by Mulayam's son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.
