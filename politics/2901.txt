Cricketer-turned-politician and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu won from the Amritsar (East) constituency by over 42,000 votes. While reacting to his party's victory, Sidhu said this is the revival of Congress, and this was just the beginning. "Congress will spread from here," Sidhu said. Notably, Sidhu had switched sides from BJP and joined the Congress ahead of the Assembly elections.
