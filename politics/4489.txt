Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday said he felt "really sorry" that nobody in this country took Rahul Gandhi seriously. "His talks are not serious and nobody trusts his words. So how do you expect me to comment on his remarks," he added. Gandhi had on Wednesday claimed he had "detailed information" about PM Modi's "personal corruption".
