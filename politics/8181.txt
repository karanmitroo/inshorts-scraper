Asking the Aam Aadmi Party members to not run after polls, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the AAP was not in the 2019 general elections race. "We are not here for power politics... We just have to keep working hard", he said. Citing AAP's Delhi victory, Kejriwal added that the party could get a similar opportunity in Punjab.
