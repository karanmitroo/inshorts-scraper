Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, on Tuesday expressed concern over ceasefire violations and alleged that the Centre was confused in its Pakistan policy. "The BJP government is totally confused on its policy towards Pakistan as earlier its leaders used to oppose talks with Pakistan on grounds that talks and terror cannot go together," he said.
