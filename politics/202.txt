Addressing a rally in poll-bound Meghalaya, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has alleged the BJP attempted to offer crores of money to the Church in the Christian-majority state. He further accused the BJP of "buying MPs" and admitted that many from Congress had defected due to monetary reasons. "With their arrogance, the BJP actually believes they can buy God," Gandhi said.
