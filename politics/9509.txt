Deepening the rift in the Aam Aadmi Party, a new audio sting of Arvind Kejriwal emerged on Friday, in which he was allegedly heard abusing Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav. In the tape, Kejriwal is talking to Umesh Singh, a Varanasi AAP leader, and is saying that he will form a new party, breaking away his 67 MLAs in Delhi.
