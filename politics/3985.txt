Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has said it was unfortunate that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was “busy in Goa’s politics” while terrorists were attacking the Army. Parrikar may have started his career from Goa but currently, he is the Defence Minister, Raut added. This comes after three civilians, working as labourers, were killed in a terror attack at a camp.
