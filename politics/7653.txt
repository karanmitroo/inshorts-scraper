Following the arrest of the JNU Students' Union President Kanhaiya Kumar over sedition charges, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday criticised the Modi government saying that bullying an institution like JNU is "completely condemnable". "While Anti-India sentiment is unquestionably unacceptable, the right to dissent & debate is an essential ingredient of democracy", tweeted Gandhi.
