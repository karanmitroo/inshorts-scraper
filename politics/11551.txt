Within only 24 hours, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee backed down from her confrontation with the Election Commission and agreed to transfer five SPs and a district magistrate as directed by the poll panel. The CM called a press conference on Tuesday to announce that she would agree to the transfers but not the replacements decided by the poll panel.
