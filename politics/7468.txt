The BJP on Saturday expressed concern over the discovery of a cross-border tunnel along the international border in Jammu, and said Pakistan should "mend its ways and stop support to terrorism". On Thursday, BSF had detected a 30-metre-long tunnel from Pakistan to the Indian side. It was the fourth such tunnel unearthed by the BSF in the region since 2012.
