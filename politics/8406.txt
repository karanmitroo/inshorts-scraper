Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said the BJP was conspiring against him and trying to dethrone him from his post. He made the allegations after several Congress ministers asked for his removal, raising demand for a Dalit CM. "BJP has hatched a conspiracy to divide us... why this demand wasn't raised when BJP was in power (in Karnataka)," Siddaramaiah said.
