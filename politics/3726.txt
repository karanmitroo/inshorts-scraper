Congress leader Ahmed Patel on Monday said, "On radio, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about republic and democracy. Narendra bhai has nothing to do with this. All he knows is dictatorship." He added, "BJP leaders are quiet for now, but they are waiting to take out their swords. They are waiting for the results of elections in five states."
