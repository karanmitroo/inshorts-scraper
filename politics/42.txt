After the NPP-UDP-BJP alliance staked claim to form the Meghalaya government with 34 MLAs, state Congress President Vincent Pala on Sunday said that the mandate was actually given to the Congress. "We do not have pre-poll alliance with anybody. Right from the time of campaigning, we knew that the BJP, the NPP, and the UDP were together," he added.
