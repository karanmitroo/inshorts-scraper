RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya on Friday said that the caste-based reservation should end at some point. "Ambedkar said that such a reservation policy is not good for any country if it continues perpetually," he added. However, RSS leader Dattatreya Hosabale clarified Vaidya's remark, stating he meant till there is discrimination against certain population groups, caste-based quota should continue.
