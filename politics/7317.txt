Union Ministers Bandaru Dattatreya and Ram Kripal Yadav on Saturday appealed to the Yadav community "to identify its strength and unite" so that their voice "is not ignored by any government". A large number of Yadavs live with poverty and lack of education, but no state government has taken any steps due to the community's lack of unity, Yadav added.
