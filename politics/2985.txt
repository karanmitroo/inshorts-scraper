Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, during a TV show on Monday, said curfews in hostels protect girls from "hormonal outbursts". "When you are 16 or 17 you are also hormonally very challenged. So to protect you from your own hormonal outbursts, perhaps a lakshman rekha (deadline) is drawn," she stated. She, however, advocated the same deadline for both boys and girls.
