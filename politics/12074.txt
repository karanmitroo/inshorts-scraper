The National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday issued a notice to the Delhi government seeking a report on deaths of homeless persons at the streets of the city allegedly due to cold and rain. "The state government had failed to make a shelter plan and a policy for the homeless persons despite directives from the Supreme Court," the statement said.
