Former Supreme Court judge Justice Markandey Katju on Saturday predicted a clear majority for the Samajwadi Party led by Akhilesh Yadav in UP polls stating, "BJP will be routed, getting even less than the BSP seats." Backing his prediction with reasons, he said, "Demonetisation was perhaps done to create a wave, but it has not succeeded in doing so."
