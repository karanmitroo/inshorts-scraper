Denying the corruption allegations levelled against him by sacked AAP leader Kapil Mishra, Delhi's Health Minister Satyendar Jain has said he would file a criminal defamation suit against Mishra, according to reports. Mishra had accused Jain of handing ₹2 crore to Arvind Kejriwal and "settling" a ₹50-crore land deal for the Delhi Chief Minister's brother-in-law.
