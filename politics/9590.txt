Senior AAP leader from Maharashtra Anjali Damania resigned from the party on Wednesday soon after the release of the audiotape which alleges that Arvind Kejriwal had indulged in horse trading. Damania, an anti-corruption activist, took to Twitter to announce the news, "I quit. I've not come into AAP for this nonsense. I backed Arvind for principles, not horse-trading."
