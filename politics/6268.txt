Responding to criticism of the Cabinet expansion, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said the size of the ministry is well within the prescribed limit. “For a country of our size and the range of issues to be addressed... 78 ministers are certainly not many,” he asserted. The Constitution limits the maximum size of the council of ministers at 82.
