The BJP has reacted to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's statement terming demonetisation as the 'biggest scam' and claiming that his speech over the issue will cause an earthquake. BJP National Spokesperson Sambit Patra said, "Gandhi's speeches cause tremors within his party and not outside... Those who have been at the epicentre of scams for 60 years talk of earthquake today."
