Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said his government will conduct an "opinion poll" and not a "referendum" on the issue of full statehood for Delhi. Speaking during his live interactive session 'Talk to AK', Kejriwal, who had earlier spoken about a referendum on the issue, said there is no provision for it in the Constitution.
