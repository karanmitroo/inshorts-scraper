Responding to Digvijaya Singh's allegation that Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh helped Naxalites, BJP has said the Congress leader had opposed an operation against the Naxalites in 2013. "Congress had lost their valuable leaders in a Naxal attack... Chidambaram wanted to launch an all-out attack against Naxalites but it was Digvijaya Singh who had opposed it," BJP leader Sudesh Verma said.
