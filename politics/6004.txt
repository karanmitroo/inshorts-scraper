BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday placed a demand before the Rajya Sabha that Ram Mandir case be heard on a daily basis. In the BJP manifesto, we had assured that we will find a solution to this matter through courts, Swamy told the House. It’s necessary to have a discussion on the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, he added.
