Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday said in a press conference 95% people of the state want a peaceful solution through dialogue. "The issue has, however, been hijacked by 5% people who believe in violence," she added. Reportedly, Mufti later left the conference 'midway' when journalists asked questions about her role in dealing with the current unrest.
