SP leader Azam Khan on Friday asked Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath whether he would "prefer to offer Namaz" since he had said it was similar to Surya Namaskar. "He would have been handcuffed had he made such comments," Khan added. Recently, Adityanath claimed Surya Namaskar postures are similar to Namaz postures and "nobody ever tried to bring them together".
