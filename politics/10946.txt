Trinamool Congress on Wednesday said it wonâ€™t take any action against its MP Tapas Pal, who had threatened to 'kill and rape' his political opponents, and has accepted his unconditional apology. Pal in a letter said, "Some remarks made by me in the heat and dust of the election campaign have caused dismay and consternation. I apologize unreservedly for them,"
