Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written a letter to Prashant Bhushan, terming the state government's decision to cull stray dogs as 'misleading'. This comes after Bhushan said he would go to court against the state's order. "It's rather unfortunate that even a person of your stature has been carried away by the misleading reports," Vijayan said in the letter.
