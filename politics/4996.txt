Criticising the government’s demonetisation policy, senior Congress leader Manish Tewari on Sunday tweeted that India doesn’t need demonetisation, but “DEMODISATION” (a reference to PM Modi). “India needs BJP-mukt bharat in 2019 if it has to be rescued from social unrest  and economic chaos,” he said. “BJP should tell how much it deposited in banks between July-Nov 2016,” he added.
