Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday challenged BJP to hold mid-term polls in Maharashtra. "If you feel others would get frightened if you mention mid-term polls, let me tell you we wonâ€™t. If you tell us that you would conduct mid-term polls tomorrow, I would say, conduct it today," he said.
