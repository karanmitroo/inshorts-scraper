The Congress on Friday held the BJP responsible for the birth of the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) by releasing its founder Masood Azhar. "Had he not been released, there wouldnâ€™t have been such attacks," said Congress leader Kapil Sibal. He further reminded the BJP that Indian Army had also crossed the border during the 1965 and 1971 wars.
