Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday criticised the BJP over the Ram Temple issue and said that it has no intentions to build a temple but is keeping the issue alive for political gains. “They just want to exploit people’s feelings for Ram," said Nitish adding that the BJP has been treating Ram as if he were a party member.
