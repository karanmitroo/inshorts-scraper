A group of Congress MLAs in Goa have blamed the party’s top leadership for the failure to form the government in the state despite being the single largest party. "I am very upset with the way our party leaders handled the situation after the (Goa Assembly poll) results…I feel let down," said Vishwajit Rane, who won from the Valpoi constituency.
