The Peopleâ€™s Party of Arunachal Pradesh (PPA) has called for a fresh floor test in the Assembly. This comes after the Supreme Court restored the Nabam Tuki-led Congress government in the state. The PPA claimed that Tuki, who has the support of 15 MLAs in the 58-member Assembly, does not have the majority required to form the government.
