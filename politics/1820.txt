With protests demanding separate Gorkhaland state turning violent in Darjeeling, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said, "Five years you enjoyed, now when elections are coming you start violence." Terming 'bandh' in the area as illegal, she added, "What is happening is a deep-rooted conspiracy. These arms were not collected in a day, they were collected over time."
