Local administrators  have denied permission to AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi to hold a rally in Allahabad on Mar 15. While the administrators cited "apprehensions of law and order disturbances" as the reason behind the denial, the AIMIM has alleged that the administrators are "acting upon instructions received from the SP government in the state, especially Cabinet minister Azam Khan".
