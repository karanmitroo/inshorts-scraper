AAP's promise to sweep away corruption from Indian political system is a "difficult" goal to achieve, says American political scientist John Echeverri-Gent, who’s written several books on Indian politics. “Until AAP plays a big role in (national) legislature, such goals are difficult to achieve," Echeverri-Gent added. Moreover, Echeverri-Gent said the party won't win over 50 seats in 2014 LS elections.
