BJP spokesperson Shaina NC on Wednesday said that it would have been better had filmmaker Karan Johar expressed solidarity with the Indian armed forces after Uri and Pathankot terror attacks. This comes after Johar said that he will not work with Pakistani artistes in future, following criticism over Fawad Khan's presence in his upcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'.
