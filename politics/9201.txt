Talking about PM Narendra Modi's communication skills, former PM Manmohan Singh on Tuesday said, "[M]y successor has been a more adept salesman, event manager and communicator than me". The UPA story should not be lost because of inadequate communication, Singh said at a Congress CM's conclave. Congress President Sonia Gandhi also asked party members to improve their communications skills.
