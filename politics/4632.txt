After three weeks of protests during the Parliament sessions, BJP leader LK Advani on Wednesday slammed both the government and Opposition for not letting the House function. "Neither the Speaker nor the Parliamentary Affairs Minister is running the House," he said. "They [Opposition] are not interested in any debate. The Speaker should find a way or remove them", he added.
