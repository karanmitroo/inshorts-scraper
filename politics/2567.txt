Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Friday accused the ruling Trinamool Congress of encouraging illegal abattoirs to flourish in West Bengal. "Even my constituency Asansol is filled with illegal slaughterhouses," said the Lok Sabha MP. "They are thriving in Asansol because (Trinamool leader) Moloy Ghatak, the local MLA is extending support to the illegal slaughterhouses," he added.
