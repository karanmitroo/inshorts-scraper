AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, arrested for allegedly threatening a woman who visited his residence to raise the issue of power cuts, was granted bail by a court on Thursday. "The woman has already got adequate police protection so there is no possibility of tampering with prosecution evidence... no purpose would be served by keeping [Khan] in jail," the court said.
