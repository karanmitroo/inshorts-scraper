PM Manmohan Singh on Thursday said he was ready to be questioned by CBI regarding the allocation of Talabira-II coal-block to Hindalco, saying he wasn't above the law and had got nothing to hide. The coal ministry had originally rejected Hindalco's bid for a share in Talabira, but allocated 15% share after Singh reviewed the decision on receiving Birla's letter.
