SP President Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said, though UP CM Yogi Adityanath is one year older to him in age, he's far behind in work. During his speech in the Parliament recently, Adityanath had said he came in between Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh due to the difference in their age.
