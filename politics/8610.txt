A video showing Abhay Kushwaha, the JDU candidate from Gaya for the upcoming Bihar assembly polls, dancing with a pole dancer has gone viral on social media. Other images from the event also show Kushwaha showering cash on the dancer. Earlier this year, when Kushwaha was in Delhi, a parcel bomb had exploded in Kushwaha's house which killed his bodyguard.
