Former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah on Saturday told reporters that his National Conference (NC) party is "open to an alliance" with the BJP in the state if they received "any such offer". The former CM also blamed the Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP for the "uncertainty in the state" over government formation and the "differences between parties" for the stalemate.
