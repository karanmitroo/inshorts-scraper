Reacting to the recent reunion of the BJP and the JD(U) in Bihar, former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah tweeted, "Rishta mubarak. Khush raho, aabaad raho, ab saat raho." Notably, Nitish Kumar had left the NDA before 2014 general elections to form Grand Alliance and has now returned to join hands with the BJP to form government in Bihar.
