Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is an asset to the party. "Priyanka has been of tremendous help to me and I have been to her. Whether she campaigns or not is her choice," he added. Earlier, several Congress leaders had said that Priyanka had negotiated the deal with Samajwadi Party for the alliance.
