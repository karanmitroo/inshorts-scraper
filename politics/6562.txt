State BJP on Thursday declared it would boycott the swearing-in of Mamata Banerjee as West Bengal Chief Minister, although some Union Ministers including Arun Jaitley would attend it. "When our workers are being attacked throughout the state, how can we join the swearing-in ceremony?" state BJP said. Notably, Congress and the Left Front have already decided to boycott the ceremony.
