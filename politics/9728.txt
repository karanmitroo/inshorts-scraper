The AAP plans to expand in at least four major states in the next five years, party strategist Yogendra Yadav said. “In next 3-5 years, we want to become viable in more states than Delhi and Punjab,” Yadav told PTI. He termed coalitions like the Third Front as “arrangements of convenience”, and said AAP will not join any such groupings.
