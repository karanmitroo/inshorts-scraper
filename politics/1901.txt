Maharashtra's Minister of State for Social Justice, Dilip Kamble, said on Saturday, "Journalists write anything for money and they should be thrashed with shoes." However, he was later criticised by people and clarified by saying, "I spoke against the bad elements in journalism...not honest journalists. I have always respected the fourth pillar of democracy and will continue to do so."
