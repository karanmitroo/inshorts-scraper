Referring to PM Narendra Modi’s alleged comments about the state of affairs in Maharashtra, Congress leader P Chidambaram Saturday said, “It is unfortunate and disappointing that outsiders are coming and calling people of Maharashtra useless”. He added that, “Modi seems to be forgetting that he is India’s PM. He is thinking that he is the PM of Gujarat.”
