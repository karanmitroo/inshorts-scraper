Tamil Nadu political party PMK's chief Ramadoss on Saturday urged the state’s CM Jayalalithaa to exert pressure on the Centre for passing an ordinance to facilitate holding ‘Jallikattu’. Jallikattu is a bull-taming sport played in the state during Pongal celebrations. It had been banned by the Supreme Court in May 2014 over animal welfare issues.
