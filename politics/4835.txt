Former J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Tuesday slammed the Centre saying that it did not take long for terrorists to get ₹2,000 notes, while he does not have them yet. This comes after ₹2,000 notes were recovered from terrorists killed in J&K. Abdullah also slammed the government's plan of demonetising currency to block terror-funding, saying it seems to be failing.
