In a scathing attack on Narendra Modi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said, "Modi must have deranged as he talks rubbish things and he is needed to be treated in a mental hospital." Pawar said, "Modi is talking about Congress Mukt Bharat. Whether Modi knows the sacrifice and contribution of Congress in freedom struggle? Because of Congress' ideology, we got freedom."
