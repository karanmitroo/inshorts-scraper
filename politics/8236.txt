Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Monday termed BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's charges against Rahul Gandhi as "baseless". "BJP's dirty tricks department... is resorting to petty and mindless mud-slinging", he said. Surjewala added that since birth, Gandhi has held an Indian citizenship. Swamy had alleged that Gandhi had declared himself a British national while registering a company.
