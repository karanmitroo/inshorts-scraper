In a major move on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav sacked as many as 70 SP leaders holding minister of state rank allegedly for non-performance and serving their own interests. The action comes fortnight after SP general secretary Ram Gopal yadav had said that many of these 'ministers' were involved in 'nefarious' activities and recommended strong action against them.
