A bill has been tabled in the Lok Sabha, under which MPs and MLAs can be recalled within two years if 75% of those who voted for them are not satisfied with their performance. The bill was tabled by BJP MP Varun Gandhi. "[I]f...people have...power to elect their representatives, they should also have the power to remove [them]," Gandhi said.
