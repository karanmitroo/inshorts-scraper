The Aam Aadmi Party has slammed Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari for distributing sweets to people for supporting demonetisation. The Arvind Kejriwal-led party also said Purvanchalis (people from East UP and parts of Bihar) were the worst hit due to the note ban. Further, the AAP questioned, "Is Manoj Tiwari distributing laddoos because the Purvanchalis lost their jobs?"
