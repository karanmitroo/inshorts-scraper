Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu today asked the Congress to clarify the statement by former Home Secretary GK Pillai of there being 'political interference' in the Ishrat Jahan case. On Thursday, Pillai, who served under former Home Minister P Chidambaram, claimed that Ishrat Jahanâ€™s possible links with terror group Lashkar-eTaiba were omitted owing to political pressure.
