Former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Wednesday announced that he will contest as a PM candidate in the August 17 parliamentary elections by forming a coalition. However, Maithripala Sirisena, the new leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party which Rajapaksa led for 10 years prior to his downfall, has reportedly ruled out appointing Rajapaksa as the PM candidate.
