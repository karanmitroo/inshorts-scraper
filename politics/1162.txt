Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said that BJP President Amit Shah came to the state and became like a wet cracker. "The BJP is trying to break secularism with the power. The BJP now shows the intolerance towards Kerala. Kerala does not have to learn any lesson on peace from you," he added.
