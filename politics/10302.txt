Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday said his party will file a defamation case against BJP for alleging that AAP was diverting funds from NGOs of its leaders. Kejriwal has accused BJP of "terrorising" those who have donated money to AAP and also challenged the party to disclose the list of their donors the way AAP has done.
