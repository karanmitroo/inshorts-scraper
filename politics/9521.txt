Rebel AAP leader Yogendra Yadav, who was Sunday expelled from the party's key panels, Monday tried to reach out to party chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. "...You are incorruptible, I am sure you would give Delhi very good governance... Be careful of your means... Arvindbhai. I remain your admirer, I remain your friend, I remain your well-wisher", Yadav said.
