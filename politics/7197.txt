Union Minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday accused the Congress of plotting plans to "divide India" to suit its political interest. “Congress in its political interest has set aside the sacrifices of Indian youth and soldiers to stand with those on the other side,” Irani said. She further alleged that the youth in Assam are being denied jobs due to corruption.
