RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh on Friday slammed Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for seating his party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav in the audience during the Prakash Utsav event. "There's mahagathbandhan in Bihar. So, every leader of the alliance should have been there on the stage. But it seems now that only the JD (U) is ruling the state," he added.
