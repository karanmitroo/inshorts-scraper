Acknowledging the defeat, Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said, "Through this election, the public has given us a message. He added, I think the AAP involved a lot of people who the traditional political parties did not involve. We are going to learn from that and do a better job and involve people in ways you cannot even imagine now."
