The BJP on Monday attacked Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for his remarks comparing JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar with freedom fighter Bhagat Singh. It further announced a three-day programme to commemorate Bhagat Singh's martyrdom. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Congress may have distanced itself from Tharoor's comments but it was not adequate as he had not withdrawn them.
