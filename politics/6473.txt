Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Sunday said that certain private airlines were "favoured" by the previous UPA government and that allegations in this regard are being investigated. He also criticised the 5/20 policy started by the previous government that only allows carriers with a minimum of 20 aircraft fleet and five years of operational experience to fly overseas.
