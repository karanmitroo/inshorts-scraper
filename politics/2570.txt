Shiv Sena leader Arvind Sawant on Saturday said that people are looking at one side of the coin in the Air India-Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad issue. "A person who is known for his balanced behaviour was provoked, is what I can say. Even he (Gaikwad) was harassed but no one is speaking on it," Sawant added.
