Former Congress MLA Ram Kishan Gujjar and two others were on Tuesday held guilty by a court for the suicide of a journalist in 2009. Pankaj Khanna, a journalist from Haryana's Ambala district, had committed suicide by consuming poison in 2009. In his suicide note, Khanna alleged that the MLA harassed him and got him booked in a false case.
