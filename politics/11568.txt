While campaigning in Delhi on Tuesday, Arvind Kejriwal was slapped again by an auto-rickshaw driver. Mr Kejriwal was in an open jeep when a man in a blue shirt reached up, garlanded the AAP chief and then struck him hard on his left cheek. This was the second time that Mr Kejriwal has been attacked in the last four days.
