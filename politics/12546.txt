Chaudhary Birender Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP from Congress, has sparked yet another controversy with his remarks 'Politics has nowadays become the safest profession to make billions'. Former IPS-officer Kiran Bedi and members of Aam Aadmi Pary have supported his remarks. Mr. Singh was earlier in news for his controversial 'Rs 100-crore for a Rajya Sabha seat' remark.
