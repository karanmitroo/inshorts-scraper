Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday invited Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for his swearing-in ceremony to be held on November 20 in Patna. However, Uddhav "may not be able to attend the ceremony" and will depute senior leaders to attend the event, Sena spokesperson said. Invites were earlier also sent to BJP leaders LK Advani and Shatrughan Sinha.
