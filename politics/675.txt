Criticising PM Narendra Modi over his election rallies ahead of the second phase of Gujarat Assembly elections, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said, "Modiji talked about Modiji for 90% of the time." He also claimed that the BJP keeps switching its campaign's focus from the Narmada to the OBC issue and then to 22 years of development in Gujarat.
