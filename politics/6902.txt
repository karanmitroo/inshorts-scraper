Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday asserted that India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru did not die due to any disease, but due to the 'shock' of the 1962 India-China war. Notably, Nehru's health began declining steadily after 1962, and he spent months recuperating in Kashmir through 1963. He died on May 27, 1964.
