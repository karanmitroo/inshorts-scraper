The total donations over ₹20,000 received by the BJP in the financial year 2015-16 are three times more than all other national parties combined, an ADR report has claimed. The BJP received ₹76.85 crore in such donations, which is an 82% drop from the previous year. Notably, Mayawati-led BSP declared they did not receive any donations over ₹20,000 during 2015-16.
