Anna Hazare on Thursday said his support to the West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee was only for coming Lok Sabha elections. "She is the only leader who responded to my letter seeking support on 17 issues for good governance," he noted. He also mentioned having sent the same letter to Arvind Kejriwal too, but not having received a reply yet.
