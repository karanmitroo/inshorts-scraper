BJP-ally Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant has said PM Narendra Modi's speech in the Parliament on Wednesday was an "election speech, similar to the one the PM gave during campaigns." "It's time that Modi ji realises it has been 4 years now...People want to hear about your schemes and not the criticism of Congress." Shiv Sena Spokesperson Manisha Kayande said.
