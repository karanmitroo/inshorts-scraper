As PM Narendra Modi Friday flagged off the "Run for Unity" marathon in Delhi in memory of Sardar Patel, his government stayed away from Indira Gandhi's memorial. For the first time no one from the central government was present to mark the death anniversary of the former PM. PM Modi paid his tribute to Smt. Indira Gandhi on Twitter.
