Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the country has suffered due to "backseat driving" and asked the people of Assam, which is amid Assembly elections, not to hand over the "remote control" to anyone. "If by chance in Assam an unstable government is formed, forces trying to break the country will try to benefit," he added.
