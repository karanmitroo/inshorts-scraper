While protesting against demonetisation, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said, "I am taking a pledge that either I'll die or live, but will remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Indian politics." Banerjee further said, "Markets, cinema, theatre... everything got affected due to demonetisation, but he (PM Modi) didn't care about the common people."
