AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi, in an interview to journalist Barkha Dutt, said, "who gives talaq to behan (sister)" when he was asked why is he soft on Mayawati-led BSP. Notably, Owaisi had earlier said that UP will give triple talaq to Modi, Akhilesh and  Congress without mentioning BSP. He further did not rule out the possibility of BSP-AIMIM alliance.
