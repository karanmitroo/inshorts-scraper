Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday suspended Badaun MLA Abid Raza from Samajwadi Party and the legislature group over alleged anti-party activities. This comes after Raza accusedÂ Dharmendra Yadav, his party's MP from Badaun, of involvement in cow slaughter and illegal mining in the district. He had also claimed that he would "expose" the leader in the state Assembly.
