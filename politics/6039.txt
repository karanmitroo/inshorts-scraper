Congress on Wednesday protested JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar being refused entry into the Maharashtra Assembly, asking if he was a "terrorist" that he was stopped. In a democratic setup, anyone can watch the proceedings of the house, former CM Prithviraj Chavan said. Notably, Kanhaiya claimed that he possessed a valid visitors gallery pass duly issued by the authorities.
