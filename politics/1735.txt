Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said that the central government and the BJP have no role in the CBI raids against Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family. "CBI is doing its duty and it is allowed to do so. Earlier it was not allowed... after our government came there is no interference," Naidu added.
