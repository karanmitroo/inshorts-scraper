Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra has slammed the BJP for listing Vinay Katiyar, who made sexist remarks against Priyanka Gandhi, in the star campaigners for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Vadra said, "Really shocks me to see a name in star campaigner list with tainted past and who completely disrespects women with his comments. God save us."
