The Shiv Sena on Monday said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' that PM Narendra Modi should stay in the country and worry for the people. "Modi has become a global leader now and he is going across the world... People of this country are reeling under drought and are dying of hunger and thirst," Sena added.
