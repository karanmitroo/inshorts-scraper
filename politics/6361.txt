After being dropped as a Karnataka minister, Actor-turned-politician Ambareesh on Tuesday slammed CM Siddaramaiah by asking "are we like slippers to use and throw away?" Ambareesh claimed that he was not informed about the removal and said they should have had a "dignified" removal. Ambareesh also resigned as an MLA after the cabinet reshuffle in which 14 ministers were removed.
