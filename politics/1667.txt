The counting of votes in the Presidential election takes place under the supervision of the Returning Officer. The invalid votes, ones which are not cast in the prescribed format, are removed first. The ballot box of the Parliament House is opened first, while those of the states follow next, in an alphabetical order. There are total eight rounds of counting.
