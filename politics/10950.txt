Congress VP Rahul Gandhi took part in the party's protests in Lok Sabha against price rise on Monday. Rahul, who always sits in the back benches, stood on the aisle joining other members, disrupting normal business of the House. A BJP leader took a swipe at Rahul saying that he has become more active after his party came into opposition.
