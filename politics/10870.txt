Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray Thursday backed his MPs after a video footage of party MP, Rajan Vichare forcing a fasting Muslim worker to eat, triggered outrage on Wednesday. "The Opposition is making it political to target Sena. MPs were telling him to eat food he serves. Religion was not written on the face of the caterer", Thackeray said.
