Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said that there was no scam in the deal regarding 36 Rafale jets and it should not be compared to the Bofors deal. She added that Congress was welcome to raise the issue in the Budget session of the Parliament. This comes after Congress alleged the deal negotiated under its rule was cheaper.
