Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday joined a protest by students in Delhi over Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula's suicide and said the government "seems to be at war with the students". Rahul Gandhi, who also joined the protest, slammed the government for not including issues like JNU and Vemula's suicide in the President's inaugural address of the Budget Session.
