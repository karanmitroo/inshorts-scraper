Three women supporters of rebel AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran have been arrested for allegedly distributing cash to voters in poll-bound RK Nagar. Earlier, the bypoll that was scheduled for April got cancelled after Dhinakaran was accused of trying to bribe voters. The election for the seat that fell vacant after late TN CM Jayalalithaa's demise, is scheduled for December 21.
