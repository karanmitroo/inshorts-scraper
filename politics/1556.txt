RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat said only India can rescue the world from clutches of capitalism. He added, "We need to build a Hindu community not because it is in problem...but because it is our own". He added, as long as religion is surviving no power can harm India, if religion vanishes, then no power would be able to save India.
