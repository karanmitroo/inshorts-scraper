Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said that she would resign from her post as the MP in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday as she was not being allowed to speak in the House. "It's a shame. If I'm not able to put forward the concerns of my weaker sections in the Parliament, I don't have the right to stay," Mayawati said.
