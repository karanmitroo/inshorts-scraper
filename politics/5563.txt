Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said that the Mewat double murder-cum-gang-rape case and the beef controversy are trivial issues to which he doesnâ€™t pay much attention. These were petty issues compared to golden jubilee celebrations of Haryana and could take place anywhere in the country, he added. Notably, Haryana will celebrate its 50 years on November 1.
