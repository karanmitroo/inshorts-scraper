A YouTube video shows AAP leader Madan Lal advising his party volunteers to 'distribute liquor' in order to make Arvind Kejriwal's rally successful. The rally about which Madan Lal is talking in the video, is the same rally where a heavy turnout forced Kejriwal to reschedule the decision to file his nomination.
