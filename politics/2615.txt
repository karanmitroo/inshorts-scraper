Refuting media reports, BJP has clarified that it would not impose a beef ban if it comes to power in the three northeastern states which go to polls next year. "The reality here is very different and our central leaders are aware of that," it added. Notably, beef is widely consumed in the Christian-majority states of Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya.
