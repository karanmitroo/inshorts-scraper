Addressing a students' convention in Delhi, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said that those people who cannot keep India clean have no right to chant Vande Mataram. "We eat paan and then spit and say Vande Mataram. Do we have the right to say Vande Mataram? People who work tirelessly have the first right to chant Vande Mataram," Modi added.
