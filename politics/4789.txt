Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday admitted that he was "shivering" on his first day in office. "I put up a brave face...but in reality, I didn't even have knowledge about the rank of military officers," he said. "I did nothing much for last two years but told army that if anyone attacks, you are free to retaliate", he added.
