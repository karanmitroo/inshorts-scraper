The Congress on Thursday pulled out a video clip - showing BJP leader Uma Bharati describing Narendra Modi as 'vinash purush' instead of 'vikas purush' - to claim that this was the true picture of Modi. The clip was reportedly shot after Uma had quit BJP to float her own political outfit in 2006. She rejoined BJP in 2011.
