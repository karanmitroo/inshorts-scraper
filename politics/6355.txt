Former Member of Parliament Nirmal Khatri on Tuesday night resigned as the President of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee. However, the party high command has reportedly not taken a decision on it yet. The resignation comes amid reports that the party is looking for a new chief for the state from the Brahmin community ahead of the 2017 state assembly elections.
