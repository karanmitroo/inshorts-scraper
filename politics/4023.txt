After the CBI arrested two Trinamool Congress MPs over Rose Valley chit fund scam, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee dubbed the investigation agency as the “Conspiracy Bureau of Investigation”. “I have worked under many governments... but haven’t seen such a vengeful government in my life," she said. “Modi may arrest all of us...  We do not care,” she added.
