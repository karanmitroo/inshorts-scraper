Responding to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's claims that a dog runs his Twitter account, Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has tweeted, "Still remember you busy feeding biscuits 2 him while we wanted to discuss urgent Assam's issues." In an earlier interview, Sarma said he felt humiliated when Gandhi "made it clear the pet was more important to him".
