Slamming Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) for not celebrating ‘Telangana Liberation Day’ officially, BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday said that the TRS President is scared of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi. “Do you (KCR) feel that Owaisi will help you in holding onto power,” he asked. Notably, on September 17, 1948, Hyderabad was liberated from Nizam’s rule.
