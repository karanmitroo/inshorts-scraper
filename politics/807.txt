Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit on Saturday asked "why a so-busy PM Narendra Modi has to visit Gujarat every other day" when the BJP claims to have carried out so many development works in the state. Speaking in Gujarat's Gandhinagar, she claimed that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has realised that people are in a mood to change the government.
