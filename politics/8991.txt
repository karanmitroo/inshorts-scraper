The Karnataka Legislative Assembly on Tuesday passed the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Bill, 2015, that seeks to divide Bangaloreâ€™s civic body, Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), into two or more entities. The bill will now go to Governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala for approval. The Governor reportedly wants to postpone the BBMP elections, due soon, fearing defeat.
