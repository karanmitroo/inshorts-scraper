Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal criticised the no-detention policy on Independence Day, saying it has ruined the education system. "Previous governments introduced no-detention policy till class 8. It ruined the education system. When students took their first exam in class 9 they failed en masse," Kejriwal said. He also assured readmission of 60,000 students who failed in class 10 this year.
