Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Monday suspended six Congress MPs for five days over their "highly unbecoming" conduct. The Congress MPs reportedly tore official papers and threw the shreds towards the chair four times during a parliamentary discussion on mob lynching and cow vigilantism. The House was adjourned and the MPs were declared suspended after the adjournment.
