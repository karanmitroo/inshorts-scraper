The AAP on Saturday demanded that a Supreme Court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe the alleged role of leaders, including CM Manohar Lal Khattar, during the Jat Quota stir in Haryana. It also demanded the suspension of the 90 officials found guilty of "deliberate negligence" by the Prakash Singh Committee, which probed violence and destruction during the February protests.
