Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday alleged that I-T officials who raided Energy Minister DK Shivakumar's properties in August had asked him to join the BJP in order to avoid raids. While addressing a rally against demonetisation in Bengaluru, he said, "The central government is controlling the I-T Department, the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI to threaten people."
