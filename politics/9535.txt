Reacting to the recent communal attacks in India, Congress leader Salman Khurshid said Sunday that PM Narendra Modi should either admit to not being strong enough to stop it or being 'complicit'. He further said, "If Modi claims to be strong, he must explain why the attacks are happening." Khurshid added, "Minorities have to be 'vigilant' under the Modi government."
