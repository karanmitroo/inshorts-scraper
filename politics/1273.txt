A legal notice was reportedly sent to RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav, seeking apology for allegedly making objectionable comments against Bihar CM Nitish Kumar during a rally last week. The notice was sent by a lawyer representing Uday Kant Mishra, a long-time friend of Nitish and a member of the state disaster management authority.
