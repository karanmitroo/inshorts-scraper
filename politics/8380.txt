Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s sah sarkaryawah Dattatreya Hosabale on Friday called the people who have recently returning their awards “pseudo-seculars” and “intolerant”. Addressing the media after the Sangh’s executive body biennial meeting, Hosabale said, "The so-called intelligentsia are finding themselves a misfit in the new order of things as the country has stopped listening to their views.”
