BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday alleged that Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad was "mentally deranged" and was "Sonia Gandhi's sycophant". "What if I say Ghulam Nabi Azad is a Muslim and can be considered as a member of ISIS, how would he feel," Swamy questioned. He was reacting to Azad's recent comments drawing a parallel between ISIS and RSS.
