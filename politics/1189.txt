Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday said, "Why do we need terrorists or enemies like Pakistan? It seems that our own Railways are enough to kill people." He further said, "Until the present infrastructure of the local railways is made better, not a single brick will be allowed to be placed for a bullet train in Mumbai."
