Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Monday said, "PM Narendra Modiji has said that the problems will end after December 30. But I can say with confidence that it will not be so." Claiming that 99% of people who don't have black money have been targeted by the demonetisation drive, Gandhi added, "These hardships will continue for six-seven months and beyond."
