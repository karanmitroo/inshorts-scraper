Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh on Monday hailed the Centre's move to put the proposed one-day ban on Hindi news channel NDTV India on hold. He called it a "victory of democratic forces." Further, Singh said it was clear that the government had been forced to surrender in the face of widespread resentment evoked by the "arbitrary and dictatorial decision."
