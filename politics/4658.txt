Following the passing away of former AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa on Monday, Karnataka Law Minister TB Jayachandra said it was unimaginable that although she was born in Karnataka, Jayalalithaa ruled Tamil Nadu as the Chief Minister. The minister further called her the greatest woman in the Indian politics. Notably, she passed away in Chennai after being hospitalised for 75 days.
