The mother of BJP's Dayashankar Singh, who was expelled for comparing BSP supremo Mayawati to a sex worker, on Friday lodged an FIR against Mayawati and other BSP leaders for insulting and abusing her family. Alleging that BSP leaders shouted slogans seeking "killing" and "hanging" of Dayashankar during the protests in Lucknow, she claimed her whole family was in danger.
