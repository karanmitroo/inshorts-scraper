Calling the Centre's demonetisation-cum-remonetisation drive as a 'Fair and Lovely' scheme, Congress on Monday alleged that it would only help the corrupt turn their black money into white. "This 'suit-boot' government is only for the suit boot people and not for the common people", Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had termed demonetisation a Modi-made disaster.
