Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav is a good boy, but he wasn't allowed to work. Gandhi said this while responding over Congress' earlier slogan '27 saal UP behaal' (27 years, UP in tatters) in a joint press conference with Akhilesh. 'Progress, prosperity and peace' is the SP-Congress alliance's motto, Gandhi added.
