AIADMK spokesperson Avadi Kumar on Wednesday alleged that O Panneerselvam raised his voice only after the Chief Minister's post was taken away from him. Kumar said Panneerselvam also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after resigning on his own choice. Notably, Panneerselvam had earlier alleged that he was forced to propose Sasikala Natarajan's name as the CM.
