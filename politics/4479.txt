The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Saturday stayed appointments of 668 panchayat secretaries in Punjab. This comes after over 30 people challenged their non-inclusion in the list despite having the required degree from a certified institute.  The list of selected candidates was issued on December 13 by Subordinate Services Selection Board.
