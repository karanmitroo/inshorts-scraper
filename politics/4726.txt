The Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Tuesday said he has seen 11 PMs, but he has not seen Modi-like "attitude" or such "contempt for Parliament" by any of them. Claiming that PM Narendra Modi addresses BJP MPs at Parliament library every Tuesday, Azad said the PM's decision to not "show up" in Parliament is "baffling".
