Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has said that AAP won 67 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly in the 2015 elections by God's grace. "Probably he (God) knew that after three years these people would declare 20 of our MLAs disqualified," he added. This comes after President Ram Nath Kovind approved the Election Commission's recommendation to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs.
