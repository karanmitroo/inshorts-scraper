BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra has accused the Congress of politicising the "internal matter" of the Supreme Court. He slammed Congress President Rahul Gandhi for holding a press conference on the concerns voiced by four senior-most SC judges over the judiciary's administration. Claiming that people have rejected the Congress, Patra said he was "surprised and pained" by the party's move.
