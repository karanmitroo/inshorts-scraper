Out of the eight seats campaigned by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, the party has lost seven seats in Jharkhand. "Rahul Gandhi had campaigned in all these seats, but we should not blame him for the loss. A review will be conducted to know what led to the loss," Congress state chief Sukhdeo Bhagat said.
