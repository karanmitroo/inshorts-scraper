Former Delhi Law Minister Jitender Singh Tomar on Tuesday withdrew his bail plea from a sessions court in an alleged fake degree case saying, since he has been sent to four-day police remand, he doesn't want to pursue the matter right now. The court has accepted Tomar's plea saying it is his right whether to pursue the matter or not.
