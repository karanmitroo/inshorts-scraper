In a surprising move, former Andhra Pradesh CM and president of Jai Samaikyaandhra Party (JSP), Kiran Kumar Reddy, has opted out of the contest in the May-7 elections in the state. Instead, he fielded his younger brother Kishore Kumar Reddy as the JSP candidate. Kiran opted out as he would be busy campaigning for the JSP candidates, sources said.
