Uttar Pradesh Tourism Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi on Tuesday clarified that the Taj Mahal has been mentioned in the Uttar Pradesh government's recently released tourism booklet. "This conflict is completely unnecessary, and there should be an end put to it. The controversy arose probably because the photo (of Taj) is missing, otherwise, it is mentioned in the booklet," Joshi said.
