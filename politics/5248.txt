Amid the ongoing controversy surrounding upcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', BJP MP Babul Supriyo has called Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) "a party of goons." Saying that the MNS should not have the right or audacity to create ruckus at theatres, Supriyo added, "MNS can't decide what people must watch...they don't have any right to play with law and order."
