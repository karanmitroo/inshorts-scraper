All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) General Secretary Hannan Mollah on Wednesday said political parties should not be taxed as they were not business or commercial organisations. Political parties were working for the public, he added. This comes after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recently said the government was planning to set a threshold criteria for political parties to enjoy tax exemptions.
