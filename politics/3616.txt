The BJP has alleged that former PM Manmohan Singh helped Vijay Mallya get bank loans for his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Citing letters written by Mallya to Singh, BJP said, "A bailout package was given to Kingfisher Airlines on Manmohan Singh's insistence." Only on Singh's insistence the I-T Department "went soft" on Mallya and his accounts were also unfrozen, it added.
