The ruling People's Party of Arunachal on Saturday suspended four more Arunachal Pradesh MLAs from the party. Earlier, the party had expelled Chief Minister Pema Khandu and six other MLAs for alleged anti-party activities. An Arunachal government spokesperson, who was also one of the suspended MLAs, had said on Friday that Khandu was the CM with an absolute majority.
