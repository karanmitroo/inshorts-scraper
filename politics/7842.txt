Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that his party won't support a Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill that doesn't have a "cap on taxes" to be charged from the people. "There are three issues with regards to GST that we differ with the BJP," Gandhi said while addressing a group of management students at a B-school in Mumbai.
