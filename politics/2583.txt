Ahead of the MCD polls, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday rejected Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India's plea seeking a common symbol to contest the civic polls. The Delhi State Election Commission had earlier stated that it doesn't have the power to allot symbols to unrecognised but registered political parties. Yadav had formed Swaraj India after being expelled from AAP.
