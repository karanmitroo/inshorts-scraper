Promising to promote local industry in Jaunpur, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that when ex-US President Barack Obama's wife would cook food in her kitchen, she would read 'Made in Jaunpur' on utensils. He also took a jibe at PM Narendra Modi's roadshow, stating his roadshows after roadshows did not work, so now he is travelling on foot.
