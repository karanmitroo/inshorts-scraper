PM Narendra Modi is set to launch 'Jann Ki Baat' to mark the completion of three years of the NDA government, aiming to get people's feedback on the Centre's policies. Similar to Modi's monthly radio address 'Mann Ki Baat', the initiative is part of the government's 20-day celebrations beginning on May 26 wherein BJP leaders will address events across India.
