BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday suggested that India should cluster bomb terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed's headquarters in Muridke near Bahawalpur in Pakistan. His remarks came after seven Indian soldiers were martyred as militants attacked an Army camp in Jammu and Kashmirâ€™s Nagrota. Earlier, Swamy had said that if Pakistan desires war then India is ready for it.
