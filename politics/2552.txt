Ahead of the MCD election in Delhi, CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said if BJP or Congress wins, the power and water tariff will increase. He further alleged that both BJP and Congress have "hatched a conspiracy" to snatch these departments from the Delhi government. Our government has halved power tariff in Delhi and provided free water, he added.
