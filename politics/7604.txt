Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan today came out in support of JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar saying he did not say anything "anti-national". "Versions of Kumar's speech that appeared in various telecasts did not show what the Union government has been saying", Khan added. He further accused the Modi-led NDA government of conspiring to "saffronise" JNU.
