Union Minister Jairam Ramesh admitted that the Congress is facing anti-incumbency after 10 years in power. Ramesh said that itâ€™s a challenge as the party lost the battle of perception because the top leadership was "not communicative". He acknowledged that it is a "challenging" campaign in the elections ahead, but maintained that the party would get a respectable three-digit number.
