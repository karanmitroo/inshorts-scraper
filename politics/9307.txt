Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Narendra Modi-led BJP government of stalling development and taking credit for the projects initiated during UPA regime. Gandhi, who is on a three-day visit to his constituency Amethi, took up the food park issue again to slam the BJP. He referred scrapping of the project as a 'revenge from the farmers'.
