Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal lost his cool during an interview with BBC Hindi and slammed its journalist when the latter said that all 55 deaths cannot be linked to demonetisation. â€œI feel ashamed that journalists like you say that the deaths cannot be linked to demonetisation. How did they die? And you say that there's a little inconvenience," Kejriwal stated.
