Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged that while visiting Assam recently, RSS workers prevented him from entering the Barpeta Satra temple. Slamming BJP's alleged political ploys, he added, "This is the way the BJP operates." Earlier, Assam CM Tarun Gogoi had also claimed that BJP and RSS had indeed conspired to stop Rahul from entering the temple.
