Requesting 'special status' for Andhra Pradesh, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said it is the Prime Minister's responsibility to fulfil the UPA government's promise after the state's division. Highlighting the "disappointment and pain" of people due to the government's failure in giving special status, Gandhi had written to the Prime Minister in this regard four months ago.
