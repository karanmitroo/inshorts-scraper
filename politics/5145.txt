Union Minister General VK Singh on Wednesday said that the mental state of the ex-jawan who committed suicide on Tuesday in protest against the government's failure to implement OROP must be investigated. Accusing Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for politicising the issue, the former Army chief said that the OROP scheme should be kept away from politics.
