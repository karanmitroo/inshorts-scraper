Patidar leader Hardik Patel on Saturday said the people of Gujarat wanted to see the contributions made by the BJP during their 23-year rule, rather than seeing a 23-year-old's video. This comes after a sex video allegedly featuring Patel went viral ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections. He further alleged CM Vijay Rupani spent â‚¹40 crore to release the CDs.
