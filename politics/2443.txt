Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister in an interview to Doordarshan said, "There's nothing wrong with the concept if that serves the interests of the people and country." He further said, "The Supreme Court has defined Hinduism as a way of life. It helps our people bring in peace. If Hindu Rashtra improves our life, there is no problem in accepting it."
