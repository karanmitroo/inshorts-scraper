A day after meeting PM Narendra Modi, Tripura CM Manik Sarkar has criticized the NDA government for "not taking pro-people policy". Sarkar has called for a movement to force the NDA government to change its outlook for the benefit of the marginalised people. The BJP "took decisions for the sake of the capitalists in the country and abroad," Sarkar said.
