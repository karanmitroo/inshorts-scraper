Union Environment Minister Anil Dave, who passed away today at the age of 60, had listed his last wishes in a legal document titled 'My wish and will' on July 23, 2012. Demanding no memorials, statues, prizes etc to commemorate him, Dave urged people to plant trees and preserve water bodies but avoid using his name while doing so.
