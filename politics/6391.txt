Ahead of the International Yoga Day, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday said Yoga was "irrelevant without imposing ban" on the sale of liquor. Calling on PM Modi to ban alcohol across the country, Kumar accused BJP of making the International Yoga Day a "party affair". "I have been doing Yoga since childhood but have never publicised it," he added.
