Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Friday called the AAP a "band of fugitives" and "anti-Punjab elements". He asked people not to fall for AAP's "misleading propaganda" and called its leadership "inexperienced and novice". He added, "AAP has no definite agenda for the overall development... their sole agenda is to rule Punjab... just to satiate their lust for power."
