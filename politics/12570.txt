In an interesting development, Gurgaon MP and former minister of state Rao Inderjeet Singh who had asked for a CBI inquiry into the land deals of Robert Vadra, has resigned from the Congress party. Mr. Singh had said IAS officer Ashok Khemka deserved a fair trial and blamed the current Bhupinder Hooda-led government for its lax approach on the issue.
