According to a Times of India report,  Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti tried to influence a witness and tamper with evidence in a case he had handled last year. The report quotes CBI Special Judge Poonam Bamba who in August last year hauled up Bharti and his client Pawan Kumar after the CBI accused them of influencing a prosecution witness.
