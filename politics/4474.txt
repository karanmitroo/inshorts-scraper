NDMC Mayor Ravinder Gupta was caught on camera while singing the National Anthem wrongly. Gupta, who is seen standing amidst a small gathering in the video, pronounces 'Bharat' as 'Jarat' and makes a few more mistakes. This came after the Supreme Court made the playing of National Anthem mandatory in cinema halls.
