While speaking during an interview, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said that if Narendra Modi fulfils his poll promise of revoking Article 370 from the Constitution, then it would destroy the constitutional bridge between J&K and the Indian Union. Notably, Article 370 of the Indian constitution is a law that grants special autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir.
