BJP MP Nana Patole has slammed Maharashtra's BJP-led government alleging that the number of farmers committing suicide have increased under the present regime. Terming the conditions imposed by the government in granting loan waivers as unjust, he demanded a blanket loan waiver. He added it was his duty to criticise CM Devendra Fadnavis as he was his friend.
