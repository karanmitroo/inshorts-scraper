Punjab Congress Chief Amarinder Singh on Saturday said former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu's new party ‘Awaaz-e-Punjab’ is "like a Tonga party of four people", and the claims of a fourth front are insignificant. ‘Awaaz-e-Punjab’ was started by Sidhu, along with former hockey captain and MLA Pargat Singh and two Ludhiana MLA brothers, Simarjit Singh Bains and Balwinder Bains.
