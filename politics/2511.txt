Ex-Congress leader Savio Rodrigues filed a FIR on Tuesday against Swaraj Abhiyan member Prashant Bhushan for his recent tweets calling Lord Krishna a 'legendary eve-teaser'. The complainant said that he had given 48-hour time to Bhushan to delete the controversial tweets and apologise, but he failed to do so. Notably, Bhushan apologised on Twitter this morning.
