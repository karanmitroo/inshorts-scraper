The BJP will be offering PM Narendra Modi’s ‘lucky chair’ to him so he could sit on it during his Kanpur rally scheduled to be held on December 19. Modi had, reportedly, sat on the chair when he had launched his campaign for the 2014 General Elections by addressing the first ‘Vijay Sankhnaad’ rally in Kanpur on October 19, 2013.
