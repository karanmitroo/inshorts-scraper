Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh has said that there is an urgent need to make laws for 'nasbandi' (sterilisation) in the country to control population. He further claimed that India has 16% of world's population and adds population which is equal to Australia every year. To the contrary, in October Singh had urged Hindus to produce more children.
