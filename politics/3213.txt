Prime minister Narendra Modi attacked the SP government for its failure to maintain law and order in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday while addressing a rally in Fatehpur. â€œThe SC had to intervene to get the FIR registered against Gayatri Prasad Prajapati. Goonda raj is prevailing all over UP and police stations have become Samajwadi Party office," he said.
