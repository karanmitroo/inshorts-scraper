A day after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar launched a campaign to ban liquor in Jharkhand, BJP on Wednesday said he should focus on his state and reduce the crime graph there. "[T]he matter is in the Speaker's court and some people have also approached the High Court. Nitish should have waited till the verdict," BJP spokesperson Pradip Sinha said.
