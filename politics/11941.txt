Escalating his confrontation with the state government on the toll issue, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday said - "My meeting with CM Prithviraj Chavan to resolve the (toll) issue has proved futile. I am left with no option but to continue my agitation against the collection of toll." Thackeray dared the government to arrest him.
