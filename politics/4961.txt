Referring to the demonetisation of old notes, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday said, "Crocodiles are surviving, small fishes are dying." Alleging that scrapping old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes has caused mayhem, Yechury said India has virtually stalled as demonetisation had been announced without adequate preparation. Notably, 33 deaths have been reported due to demonetisation-related issues.
