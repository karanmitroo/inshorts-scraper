A senior BJP MLA and former minister in Maharashtra has been allegedly 'caught on tape' criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Questioning the style of functioning of the party's central leadership, he allegedly said, “There is nothing called collective leadership. It is dhokha [cheating] … One who says that he will rule with collective leadership is a fraud.”
