BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday termed the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls a 'corrupt' one. Akhilesh Yadav is not confident of a win and therefore, has formed an alliance with the Congress, he added. While referring to Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi as 'princes', he said that they are making fake promises to the people.
