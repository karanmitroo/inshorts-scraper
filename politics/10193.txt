In a major setback for the National Conference party of J&K, its leader and outgoing CM Omar Abdullah Tuesday lost the Sonawar seat to PDP's Ashraf Mir. He, however, won the Beerwah seat, defeating Nazir Ahmad Khan of Congress by a narrow margin of over 1,000 votes. Omar tweeted to congratulate rival Ashraf Mir on his victory from Sonawar.
