A Delhi court will hear criminal defamation complaint filed by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari against AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Dec-20. The matter was put up for the next date after Metropolitan Magistrate could not conduct proceedings. Gadkari had alleged that he was defamed by Kejriwal who had included his name in the party's list of "India's most corrupt".
