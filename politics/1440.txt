Former Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela has said that he would neither join any political party nor would accept any post relating to a governor. However, he added, "I will not retire from politics." This comes after Vaghela resigned as an MLA on Wednesday, following his resignation as Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly and the Congress party in July.
