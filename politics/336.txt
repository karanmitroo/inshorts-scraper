IPS officer Dawa Sherpa, who has been appointed as Additional Director General heading Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur zone, had served as a BJP leader in his hometown of Darjeeling. Sherpa was involved in Gorkhaland politics during the four years he was "absent" from police service. Criticising his appointment, the Opposition questioned his return to police service after being involved in politics.
