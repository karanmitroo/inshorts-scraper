A 60-year-old rickshaw-puller, resident of a slum in the Connaught Place area, Saturday inaugurated the renovated Palika Maternity Hospital in central Delhi in the presence of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. "Never in my dreams I had thought that I would be inaugurating a hospital with the chief minister at my side," said Bijay Baba, whose name was recommended by Kejriwal.
