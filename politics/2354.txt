The Delhi Police has booked AIADMK (Amma) chief VK Sasikala's nephew and party's Deputy Secretary TTV Dinakaran for allegedly offering a bribe to get AIADMK's two leaves symbol. Dinakaran has, however, denied the charges, stating he will fight in court. The Election Commission had frozen the symbol ahead of the RK Nagar by-poll following the split in AIADMK.
