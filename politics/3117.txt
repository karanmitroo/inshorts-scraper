Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit has said that Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, who is in his 40s, is still not mature and he should be given time. "He is not yet prime minister because that opportunity will come later but he is doing things," she told the Times of India. "He is one person who speaks his mind," she added.
