Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi queued up at a bank on Friday to exchange demonetised currency notes. "The poor are suffering. I've come here to exchange â‚¹4,000. My people have suffered. I'm standing by them," he said. "Can you see suited-booted people here? Everyone here is a common man who is suffering, but Modiji isn't bothered," he added.
