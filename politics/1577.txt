Union Minister Ramdas Athawale has said that there was nothing wrong if one didn’t recite the national song ‘Vande Mataram.’ Athawale added that the issue of the national song was being brought out to cause feud among communities. The Madras High Court recently made singing ‘Vande Mataram’ compulsory once a week in government schools, colleges and universities in Tamil Nadu.
