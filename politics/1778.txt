External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj took a dig at the Opposition's Presidential nominee Meira Kumar by tweeting a video from Kumar's tenure as Lok Sabha Speaker. The video, captioned, "This is how Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar treated the Leader of Opposition", shows Kumar interrupting Swaraj during her speech. Swaraj mentions Kumar interrupted her 60 times in a six-minute speech.
