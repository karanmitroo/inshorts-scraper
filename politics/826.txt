The TTV Dhinakaran-led AIADMK faction on Wednesday announced that he would contest the bypoll from RK Nagar, the assembly seat that was held by late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa. The seat fell vacant after her demise in 2016. This comes days after the Election Commission assigned the two leaves party symbol to the faction led by CM Palaniswami and Panneerselvam.
