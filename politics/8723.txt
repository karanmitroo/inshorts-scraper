The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) is planning to contest the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections on its own, as per reports. The JMM's alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has reportedly hit a deadlock over the issue of sharing of seats. "There is utter confusion among the top leaders," a JMM leader said.
