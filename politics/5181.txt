Responding to a question on Samajwadi Party’s CM candidate for 2017 UP polls, party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday said it will be declared only after the party gets the majority. He further left the decision of reinstating sacked ministers in UP Cabinet on CM Akhilesh Yadav. "It's true, the majority was in my name in 2012,” he added.
