Communist politician Prakash Karat said on Thursday that the BJP government is similar to the previous UPA regime as both were indulged in corrupt practices. Karat, the former CPI-M General Secretary, said, "BJP captured power at the Centre promising a corrupt-free government, but during the last 14 months of its rule, it has indulged in heavy corrupt practices."
