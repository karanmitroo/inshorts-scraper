After reports emerged that Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao has told the Centre that he cannot invite Sasikala Natarajan to form the government, Rao's office clarified that no such communication took place. Reports claimed that the Governor sought to delay Sasikala's swearing-in until the Supreme Court rules on the 19-year-old disproportionate assets case against her.
