The government on Monday told the Opposition that it should not 'obstruct' the Parliament during its Winter Session following Mahagathbandhan's (grand alliance) victory in the Assembly polls in Bihar. "To interpret the results as mandate to disrupt Parliament is questioning the wisdom of people of the state," said Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu.
