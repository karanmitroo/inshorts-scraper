Mizoram CM Lal Thanhawla has revealed that he has faced a lot of racial abuse in India. "Some 20-25 years ago, one gentleman said to me 'You don't look like an Indian' to which I replied 'Tell me in one sentence what does an Indian look like?'" he said. Even politicians don't have a basic idea of India, he added.
