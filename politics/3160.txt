Tamil Nadu's opposition party DMK on Tuesday submitted a letter to the Assembly Secretary for a No-Confidence Motion against Speaker P Dhanapal. This comes in the backdrop of the February 18 trust vote, in which CM Edappadi K Palanisamy proved his majority. Notably, the DMK MLAs were removed from the house before the trust vote, after they allegedly heckled Dhanapal.
