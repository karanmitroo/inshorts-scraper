Protesting against the alleged attacks on BJP cadres by TMC workers, West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh has threatened to beat TMC workers "black and blue". "Breaking the neck with bare hands is no big deal for us,” he added. Notably, Ghosh had recently called Jadavpur University girl students "shameless" over their molestation charges against ABVP student workers.
