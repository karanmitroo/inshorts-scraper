Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi has requested the Maharashtra Government not to close down a Mumbai school run by a trust linked to Zakir Naik-run NGO Islamic Research Foundation (IRF). Last week, IRF was banned by the Centre for five years for its alleged involvement in terror acts. The ban will affect activities of all bodies affiliated with the NGO.
