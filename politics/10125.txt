AAP volunteers have launched a mobile game with the name 'Muffler Man' in order to increase donations. In the android-based game, the main character goes by the name of Muffler Man and overcomes hurdles like corruption and bribe to win the game. The app is free of cost and will soon be made available on Apple and Windows, officials said.
