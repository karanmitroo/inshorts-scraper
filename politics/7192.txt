Peoples Democratic Party President Mehbooba Mufti will be sworn in as the first woman Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir on April 4, said late CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's advisor Amitabh Mattoo. PDP and BJP reportedly conveyed the mutually-agreed date to Governor NN Vohra. This comes after a two-month long deadlock on government formation after the death of CM Sayeed.
