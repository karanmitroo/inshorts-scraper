Ahead of BMC polls, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Wednesday said he is still firm on his stand against migrant North Indians and the agenda of reserving jobs for Maharashtrians. He further said his party intends to contest all 10 municipal corporation elections. "If there's corruption in BMC, BJP is also party to it," he added.
