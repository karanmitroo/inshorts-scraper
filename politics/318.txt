In an alleged reference to Tripura CM Manik Sarkar, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said the people of Tripura had been wearing the wrong 'Manik' (gemstone) and should instead wear a 'HIRA'. Speaking at a rally in the poll-bound state, PM Modi said the HIRA he got for them stands for 'Highway, Information way, Railway and Airway'.
