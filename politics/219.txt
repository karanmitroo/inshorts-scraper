Gujarat Police on Sunday detained MLA Jignesh Mevani while he was on his way to attend a rally over the death of a Dalit activist who immolated himself. A tweet on the MLA's Twitter handle read, "Jignesh Mevani was pulled out of the car in a very uncivilised manner." The police said he was detained to maintain "law and order".
