CPI(M) leader Surjya Kanta Mishra on Tuesday questioned the source of funds for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's helicopter rides for campaigning. "She doesn't undertake road trips but only chopper rides," Mishra alleged. Referring to violence during Monday's voting, he said, "They (TMC) are afraid of people's alliance and that is why voters are being terrorised on the day of polls."
