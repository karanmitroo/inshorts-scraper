Former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Sanjay Dina Patil was allegedly seen drawing his licensed revolver at an NCP event in Mumbai while publicly fighting with the party spokesman Nawab Malik, reports said. However, it is claimed that the ex-MP drew the gun for self defence as Malik's supporters were planning to attack Patil with swords.
