AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal will address over 85 rallies in the national capital over the next two months, party sources said. He is likely to address 25 rallies in December and 60 rallies in January, with at least one rally in each constituency. There is also a demand from party candidates for comedian Bhagwant Mann to campaign in their constituencies.
