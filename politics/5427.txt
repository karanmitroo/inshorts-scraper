Actor and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly, who had played the role of mythological character Draupadi in the hit television series Mahabharat, was on Tuesday nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Ganguly was nominated by President Pranab Mukherjee to the seat vacated by cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned recently following differences with the BJP leadership.
