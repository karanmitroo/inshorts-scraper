Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav publicly scolded his son and Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav at an event on Tuesday. Mulayam reportedly lost his cool as Akhilesh was talking to someone and apparently did not hear the SP chief's question. Last year in March also, Mulayam had reprimanded the 42-year-old on a public platform.
