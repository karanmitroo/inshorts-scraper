The Central Information Commission has issued fresh notices naming top leaders of six national parties, including Rajnath Singh, Mayawati, Sonia Gandhi and Prakash Karat among others. CIC asked them to appear before it for not responding to RTI queries. The notices were issued after CIC was alleged of adopting double standards, having named only Sonia Gandhi in an earlier notice.
