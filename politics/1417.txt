Two AIMIM corporators were suspended on Saturday after they remained seated when 'Vande Mataram' was sung at the start of the day's proceedings in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation. Soon after the AIMIM MLCs refused to stand, the ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporators started protesting against them and also raised slogans of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'.
