Lauding RBI's move of slashing 0.25% cut in interest rate, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the rate cut is positive for the Indian economy. Jaitley said, "Rate cut will leave more money in the hands of people for greater spending and it will certainly help in reviving the investment cycle the government is trying to restore."
