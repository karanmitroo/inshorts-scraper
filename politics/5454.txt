Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray has apologised for the alleged controversial cartoon published in 'Saamana', mocking the Maratha silent rally over Kopardi rape case. In the cartoon, the words 'Mook Morcha' (silent rally) were changed to 'Mooka Morcha' (kiss rally), following which the Maratha community had demanded an apology and called it an insult to people protesting for a cause.
