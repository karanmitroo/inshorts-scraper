Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Wednesday said if Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal asked Akali workers to turn violent, AAP workers will not be alive. She further accused AAP MP Bhagwant Mann of encouraging voters to turn violent ahead of the state polls. Notably, her comments come after a shoe was hurled at the Punjab CM on Wednesday.
