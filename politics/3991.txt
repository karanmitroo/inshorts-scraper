Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that 'acche din' (good days) would only come when the Congress comes back to power in 2019. "They (the BJP) ask us 'what the Congress has done in 60 years'... We don't owe an answer to them. People know about the blood and sweat our leaders have shed for India," Gandhi added.
