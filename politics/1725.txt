The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said that lynching people in the name of cow protection is against Hindutva. "Those who were safeguarding cows were Hindus till yesterday. Today, they have become murderers," an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said. Further, they called for a national policy on beef as it affects the eating habits, businesses, and employment of many people.
