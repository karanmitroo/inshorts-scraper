Actor Anupam Kher and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor engaged in a war of words on Twitter when Tharoor responded to Kher's recent remarks that he is scared to openly say he is a Hindu. Tharoor tweeted saying that he proudly says he is Hindu but "not the Sangh's kind of Hindu". In response, Kher called Tharoor a Congress 'chamcha'.
