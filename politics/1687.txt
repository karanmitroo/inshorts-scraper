The Central government on Friday blamed West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for the unrest related to demands for separate state 'Gorkhaland' in Darjeeling. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said, "There must be peace. If the quiet hills have been set on fire, then the reason is the Chief Minister's attitude and her handling of the issue."
