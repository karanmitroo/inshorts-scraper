With the Bihar Assembly polls nearing, CM Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) on Thursday launched the first-phase of its ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (Knock at Every Door) campaign across 1,500 places in the state. The party plans to personally knock at the door of 1 crore families in a bid to “out-think” the BJP. The 10-day long phase will end on July 11.
