Mumbai Congress workers took out a protest rally outside Maharashtra Housing Minister Prakash Mehta's residence on Saturday, demanding his resignation over graft charges against him. "His involvement is clear in corruption of SRA scheme. If CM can remove IAS Mopalwar for graft charges...then why he isn't removing Prakash Mehta from his ministerial berth," Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said.
