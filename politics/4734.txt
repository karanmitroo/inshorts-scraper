Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Idris Ali on Wednesday said that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's photograph should be kept in every household in the country. "Just like people keep the photograph of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, I think, her (Banerjee's) picture should also be hung in every household across the country," Ali said.
