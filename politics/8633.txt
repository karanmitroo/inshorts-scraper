Separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani's passport was suspended by the Indian government on Tuesday for four weeks. As per reports, the move was made to prevent Geelani from attending a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), scheduled to be held in New York on September 27. Geelani was issued a passport in July this year.
