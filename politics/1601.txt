Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Friday said that he changed sides by splitting from the Grand Alliance and joining hands with the BJP for 'sewa' (serving), and not 'mewa' (profit). "I faced lot of resistance trying to run the government in the best interest of people of Bihar and preserve the Mahagathbandhan, but failed due to RJD's attitude," he added.
