A Lord Hanuman-like painting on a wall at the Indian Institute of Technology, Powai, was removed after the Shiv Sena objected to it, stating, "it hurt the religious sentiments of many people." The painting depicted a man carrying a mountain in one hand and holding a pen instead of a mace in the other.
