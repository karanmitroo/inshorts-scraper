Foreign minister Salman Khurshid on Sunday said President Pranab Mukherjee's reluctance to clear the anti-graft ordinances had stalled the anti-corruption measures pushed by Rahul Gandhi. "The President is after all the head of the country...we must bow to his wishes," he added. It is the first time that a Cabinet minister has spelt out the reason in as many words.
