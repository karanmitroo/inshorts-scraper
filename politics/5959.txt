Senior Bihar BJP leader Gopal Narain Singh on Friday said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s regime is "super jungle raj". “[T]he revival of jungle raj… is evident from the fact that incidents of loot, kidnappings, ransom etc have become the order of the day," Singh added. He also termed the "prohibition" of liquor in Bihar as a "cheap publicity" gimmick.
