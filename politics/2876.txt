Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar on Saturday submitted his resignation to Governor Mridula Sinha following his loss from the Mandrem seat by over 7,000 votes. None of the parties could manage a clear majority in Goa, with Congress winning in 17 constituencies followed by the BJP victory in 13 seats. Notably, AAP failed to win in any constituencies in Goa.
