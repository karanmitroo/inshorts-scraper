The Congress party on Wednesday moved a privilege notice against Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, for allegedly misleading the Parliament over the appointment of anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal. Congress' KC Venugopal said Jaitley misled the house by saying that the Lokpal Bill was pending with the standing committee when President Pranab Mukherjee has already given his approval to the bill.
