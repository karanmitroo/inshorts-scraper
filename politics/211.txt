Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has said that he is ready for a no-confidence motion against the NDA government to get "justice" for the state, but only as a last resort. This comes after the YSR Congress chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Sunday said that the party is ready to move a no-confidence motion in the Parliament.
