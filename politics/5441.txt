Delhi Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra on Tuesday asked Jammu and Kashmir CM to clarify her stand on slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani and Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. “It can’t be that you don’t accept Burhan Wani as a terrorist and then expect tourism to increase. Terrorism and tourism can’t go together,” he said.
