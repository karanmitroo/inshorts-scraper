BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said it was a big mistake by the Indian Government to allow the Pakistani cricket team to participate in the ICC World Twenty20. He alleged that along with the team "all kinds of ISI people also come in the name of spectators". Earlier, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also opposed cricket matches with Pakistan.
