Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday accused RSS and BJP of “deliberately” creating tension in Kannur, stating that the government proposes to hold peace talks to end the blood-shed. “The government was taking all initiatives and police was acting impartially,” he said while replying to a notice seeking adjournment motion on the frequent clashes between CPI(M)-BJP workers in Kannur.
