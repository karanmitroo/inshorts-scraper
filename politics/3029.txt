A shoe was hurled at Gujarat Home Minister Pradipsinh Jadeja on Thursday outside the state Assembly by a man identified as Gopal Italia. However, Italia missed his target and was immediately caught by security guards. I had approached the minister several times in the past with complaints against liquor mafia but Jadeja ignored my plea, said Italia.
