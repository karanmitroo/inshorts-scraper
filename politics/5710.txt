BSP supremo Mayawati has accused PM Narendra Modi of ignoring his constituency Varanasi during the floods, stating he has not "bothered" to visit the flood-affected people. “When he has not come to listen to the people of Varanasi, how can he be expected to visit flood-affected areas in Mirzapur and Allahabad?” she added.
