After Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having a habit of "peeping into people's bathroom", the BJP responded that the comment reflects Rahul's own habit. Rahul Gandhi's comment was in reference to Modi's remark in the parliament that only former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh knew the art of taking a bath wearing a raincoat.
