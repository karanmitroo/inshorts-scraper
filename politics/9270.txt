Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday said that Rahul Gandhi was expected to become the Congress President this year. Stating Gandhi's intent to build regional-level leadership similar to that in Jawaharlal Nehru's time, Ramesh claimed Gandhi was perfect for the position. He added that Gandhi's sabbatical brought “Mr Rahul Gandhi who is active, who is proactive and who is reactive.”
