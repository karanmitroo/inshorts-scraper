Former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has said that JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar has finally taken a stand, and should now support BJP. This comes after Nitish Kumar resigned as Bihar Chief Minister citing a crisis in the ruling Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance, and PM Narendra Modi congratulated Kumar for joining the "fight against corruption".
