Ahead of his rally in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency Amethi, Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas Saturday faced protest, with a youth from Bijnor throwing eggs on him over an alleged remark against a community. Saif Zafri (25), who created ruckus at his press conference, reportedly belongs to Mulayam Youth Brigade.
