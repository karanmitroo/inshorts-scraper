After charging Rs.5 per head for Narendra Modi's Hyderabad rally, BJP will be charging Rs.10 for his Bangalore rally scheduled next month. The party has also decided to charge Rs.5 for a similar rally in Bhopal next week, but to be paid only by party-workers. However, BJP said it wasn't a charge but voluntary-contribution and a good-change in Indian politics.
