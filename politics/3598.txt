Days after filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali was manhandled on the sets of his movie Padmavati, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that Rani Padmini (Padmavati in the movie) was shown in a bad light as she was Hindu. "Had she not been a Hindu, perhaps they would not have dared to do so," the BJP MP added.
