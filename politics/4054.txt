BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj, who recently sparked a row for indirectly blaming Muslims for the population boom, said, "We are four brothers...all are ascetics (sanyasi). We should be given a prize." Justifying his statement, the MP said, "Population is increasing and the land is limited. I said, women are not machines; four wives, 40 children, triple talaq won't do."
