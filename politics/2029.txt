Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday and urged him not to treat the Kashmir issue as a mere law and order problem but address it politically. "We will discuss on how to take steps that would benefit in future. We all have to work together to solve this issue," Abdullah said.
