Congress-linked National Students' Union of India (NSUI) on Wednesday won the President and Vice President posts out of the four posts in the Delhi University Students' Union elections. RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) won the Secretary and Joint Secretary positions. However, the Congress party demanded a vote recount claiming that NSUI had won three posts.
