The RJD workers on Monday took to streets and enforced a bandh across Bihar, demanding the release of caste census data. The JD(U), the ruling party in the state and an ally of the RJD, has also extended its support to the bandh call. The RJD workers also allegedly indulged in vandalism to make the bandh call successful.
