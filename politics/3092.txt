Defending himself over the alleged poll code violation, BJP Uttar Pradesh chief Keshav Prasad Maurya on Sunday said he forgot to remove the party symbol at the polling booth. It happened as he went to the booth straight from a campaign rally, Maurya claimed. An FIR has been filed against Maurya for displaying the BJP symbol while casting his vote.
