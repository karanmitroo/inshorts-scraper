In wake of the arrest of Delhi Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Tuesday accused the Modi government of creating an emergency-like situation in Delhi. "Tomar was arrested as if he was a mafia... What was the emergency, especially when a scam is being reopened? There's a deep underlying reason behind his arrest," Sisodia said.
