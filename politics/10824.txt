Press Council of India Chairperson Justice Markandey Katju, on Monday alleged that, the then Chief Justice of India K G Balakrishnan had pushed for the elevation of a Madras High Court judge with "bad reputation" to the Supreme Court. Katju said the collegium "almost succeeded" but lawyers in Tamil Nadu thwarted it by producing "voluminous documentary evidence of his corruption."
