Ahead of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, bandit-queen-turned-politician Phoolan Devi's husband Umed Singh joined Congress on Tuesday. Singh has come back into the party from BSP, which he had joined after quitting Congress. Notably, Phoolan Devi was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1996 and again in 1999. She was a sitting MP from Mirzapur when she was killed.
