Expressing confidence that the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) will form the next government in Goa after polls, the party on Saturday said it will not form any post-poll alliance with BJP. Alleging that BJP does not trust its own candidates, MGP said, "Whether BJP brings in Manohar Parrikar as their CM or not, we have nothing to do with it."
