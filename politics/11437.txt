Repenting about his decision of quitting as Delhi CM, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said, "I think we made a mistake on (the issue of) resignation. Resignation in principle was (however) right". He further added, "We should have consulted people before resigning, the way we did before forming the government, which we didn't do".
