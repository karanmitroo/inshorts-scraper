BJP President Amit Shah on Friday said that corruption to the tune of ₹12 lakh crore took place during the rule of Congress. Shah was referring to cases like the 2G scam, the VVIP chopper deal and the auction of coal blocks. He added that the NDA “gave a corruption-free government to the country” and a Prime Minister who speaks.
