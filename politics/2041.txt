AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj on Tuesday gave EVM tampering demonstration on a dummy device in the Delhi Assembly, claiming that a unique code can be inserted to let a selected party win. Bharadwaj challenged BJP to give AAP the EVMs to be used in Gujarat polls for 3 hours and claimed that it won't win a single booth after that.
