Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said media does not speak from its heart anymore, while earlier it freely criticised the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government. Rahul further advised the media to understand its responsibility at a time when the BJP-led government was instilling "fear" among journalists, reports said. We understand the predicament and the nervousness, Rahul added.
