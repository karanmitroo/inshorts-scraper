West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday reacted to BJP leader Shyamapada Mondal's 'hijra' (eunuch) remark, stating she feels ashamed of such remarks. "How dare they question my birth, my identity, my parents? Who are they? Even we worship Lord Ram, that Ram who worshipped Maa Durga," she said. Mondal had earlier said that TMC chief is a 'hijra'.
