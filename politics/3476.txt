Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi mocks the earthquake tragedy of Uttarakhand and insults the freedom struggle but has no answers to the opposition's questions. His statement comes after Modi said in the Parliament that "earthquake occurred on Monday because 'dharti maa' (mother earth) was upset as Gandhi saw 'service' in the word scam".
