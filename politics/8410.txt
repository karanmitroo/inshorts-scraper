DMK President M Karunanidhi on Thursday said that India should stop treating Sri Lanka as a “friendly country” and make “efforts for holding... independent international probe about war crimes committed by the Sri Lankan army” during the conflict with LTTE. Karunanidhi cited a report tabled in the Sri Lankan Parliament recommending the presence of international judges in war crime investigations.
