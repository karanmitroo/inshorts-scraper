Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has accused the Indian Army of raping women in Kashmir, Jharkhand, and Assam, and added that females beat up soldiers and cut their private parts in revenge. "India's truth is that women are forced to act against Army rapists. It is a message that Hindustan should be ashamed of," Khan added.
