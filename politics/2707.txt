The CPI(M) on Wednesday demanded in the Rajya Sabha to allow the use of mother tongue to write the civil services main examination. "Linguistic rights have to be upheld," CPI(M)'s Ritabrata Banerjee said during the Zero Hour. JD(U)'s Sharad Yadav also backed Banerjee's demand saying, "It is a serious issue. The Government should take note of it."
