JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Wednesday said that RJD chief Lalu Prasad never wanted to be a part of the Bihar Grand Alliance. It was Bihar CM Nitish Kumar who requested Lalu to be a part of the coalition government, he added. "Laluji got ready to become a part of the alliance because of collective pressure and demand," he said.
