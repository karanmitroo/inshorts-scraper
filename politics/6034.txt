Senior Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi on Friday said that PM Narendra Modi government is making every effort to destabilise and defame Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government. "Even a layman can see that the Centre is after the AAP government. It's not right thing. The AAP government is democratically elected and should be given opportunity to work," he added.
