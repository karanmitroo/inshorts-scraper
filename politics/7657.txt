BJP MLA OP Sharma today said that his reaction in the Patiala House Court was "natural" as he was hit first. Sharma claimed he was hit after he "objected" to pro-Pakistan slogans being raised by some people. He said, "the possible natural action... is what happened". Sharma claimed that a picture of a person beating others was not of him.
