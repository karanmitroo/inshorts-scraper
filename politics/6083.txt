BJP chief Amit Shah’s rally, scheduled for Sunday in Agra, has been cancelled as the party reportedly failed to achieve the target of gathering 40,000 Dalits. Though BJP claims that it was cancelled due to rain, reports cite protests by Dalits as the reason. The rally was to coincide with former MP Dhamma Viriyo-led Dhamma Chetna Yatra.
