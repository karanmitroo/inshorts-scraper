Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has said, "Let Muslims solve the problem of triple talaq on their own. Why is BJP dragging this to court?" Singh further said, "One should not interfere more in this matter. The BJP is trying to create an adverse agitating situation." This comes after PM Narendra Modi said, "Triple talaq is causing difficulties for Muslim women."
