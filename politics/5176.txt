BSP President Mayawati on Friday said she will order a probe into "big" economic decisions taken by Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav in the run up to the state Assembly elections, if voted to power. “Now when the elections are just round the corner, the CM is enacting ‘drama’ to woo different sections of society and making announcements,” she said.
