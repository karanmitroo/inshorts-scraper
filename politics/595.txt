A day ahead of the RK Nagar bypoll, rebel AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran's supporter P Vetrivel has released a video showing late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa admitted in Chennai's Apollo hospital. Claiming that the video will address rumours about Jayalalithaa's death, Vetrivel said it provides proof against claims that no one was allowed to meet her in the hospital.
