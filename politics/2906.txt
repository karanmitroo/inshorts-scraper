BSP supremo Mayawati on Saturday alleged that EVMs were tampered with during the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand elections. "Either the EVMs did not accept votes other than BJP, or the votes of other parties have gone to BJP in the EVMs," she alleged. "Most votes in Muslim majority constituencies have gone to BJP," she added.
