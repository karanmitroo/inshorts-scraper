The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday dared the Centre to launch a probe into the alleged discrepancies in its donors' list. This comes after the Income Tax department sent a notice to AAP citing discrepancies in the list. AAP national treasurer Raghav Chadha had admitted that "inadvertent errors" were there in the list, and a revised return was filed later.
