Chhattisgarh PWD Minister Rajesh Munat on Friday said that the sex CD, which former BBC journalist Vinod Verma claimed to have against him, was fake and manipulated. Verma, who has been arrested by the police, said, "I have a sex CD of a Chhattisgarh minister...he is Rajesh Munat and that is why the Chhattisgarh government is not happy with me."
