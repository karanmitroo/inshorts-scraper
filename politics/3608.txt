The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear the petition filed by an NGO seeking disclosure of sources of income by candidates for the parliamentary and assembly elections. The apex court asked the petitioner to approach a high court for relief instead. The petitioner, in his plea, had alleged that assets of four sitting Lok Sabha members had surged 1,200%.
