West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has claimed that there would be a regime change at the Centre in 2019 as the opposition parties have come together. "We are waiting for it. No front has been formed as yet, but the opposition parties have come on a platform and started working. Wait for six months, things will be clear," she added.
