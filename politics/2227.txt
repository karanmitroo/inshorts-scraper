Speaking about reports of NCP President Sharad Pawar being a candidate for the upcoming Presidential elections, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said, "Pawar is Modi's guru, can't say what's in one's heart." Thackeray added that his party had suggested the name of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) supremo Mohan Bhagwat for the post.
