West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh on Friday said the party's state unit did not support the creation of a separate Gorkhaland state. "We are committed to the upliftment and progress of the Gorkha people...But a separate state is out of the question," he added. Notably, Gorkhaland has been a long-pending demand of the people of Darjeeling and Dooars.
