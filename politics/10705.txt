Slamming AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal’s attack on Delhi Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung, the BJP on Tuesday said that its “unfortunate and irresponsible” that aspersions are being cast on someone holding a constitutional post. It further said that, Kejriwal has no moral right to speak of government formation in Delhi, as he lost his credibility after he quit in 49 days.
