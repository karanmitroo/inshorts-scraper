Ending the nine-year old boycott, US ambassador Nancy Powell on Thursday met BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi at Gandhinagar (Gujarat). “The US looks forward to working closely with the government that the Indian people choose,” a statement by US embassy read. Notably, this was the first meeting of any US ambassador with Modi since the visa ban on him from March 2005.
