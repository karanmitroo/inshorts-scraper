The BJP, a coalition partner in Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led government in J&K, criticised PDP's decision to release separatist leader Masarat Alam and claimed that the party was not consulted before taking the decision. Senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra said, "Mufti Mohammad Sayeed should not have released Masarat Alam. There will be an inquiry."
