BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday said, "The Opposition should also start working instead of doing 'bayanbaazi'. The BJP will return to power with a bigger mandate in 2019." He added, "We are working together with PM Modi who is working tirelessly for the people... The BJP is working on an expansion mode and we believe that we can win."
