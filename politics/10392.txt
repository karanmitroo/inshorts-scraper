Maharashtra govt, Saturday, decided to approach SC against the ruling of Bombay HC that stayed the move to allow 16% reservation to Marathas in public service and educational institutions in the state. The decision was taken at an all-party meeting chaired by CM Devendra Fadnavis. Earlier on Friday, Fadnavis said, "We will take measures to ensure that the quota remains."
