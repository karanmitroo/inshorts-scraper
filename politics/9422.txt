The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded that a criminal case be registered against Shiv Sena and its mouthpiece Saamana's managing editor Sanjay Raut for demanding withdrawal of Muslims' voting rights. It also asked the Election Commission to de-recognise Shiv Sena as a political party and alleged that the demand was made to create communal hatred.
