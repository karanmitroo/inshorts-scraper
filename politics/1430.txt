The Tripura police on Friday launched a probe after a 'fatwa' was issued in a Facebook post, announcing a bounty of â‚¹5.5 lakh for anyone who would "chop off the head of Chief Minister Manik Sarkar". The account-holder, who identified herself as a member of the World Anti-Communist Council, further accused the CM of having "numerous crimes to his credit".
