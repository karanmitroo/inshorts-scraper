North Delhi mayor and BJP leader Preety Agarwal has moved a legal notice against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Saurabh Bhardwaj for allegedly defaming her. The party had reportedly claimed in several posters that Agarwal was 'a corrupt mayor' as she had influenced the assignment of tenders for various projects.
