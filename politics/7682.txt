Following Pakistani artist Ghulam Ali's concert in Lucknow on Sunday, the Shiv Sena on Monday branded Uttar Pradesh as an "Islamic state" in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'. It alleged that the UP state government has begun “anti-national business” for appeasement politics. The Sena also said that the BJP has been reduced to a "mute spectator" to Ali's performance.
