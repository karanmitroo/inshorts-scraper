Congress President Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that hugging PM Narendra Modi and being seen with him in Davos was part of jeweller Nirav Modi's "guide to looting India". The government looked the other way while Nirav "slipped out" of India, he added. This comes after the PNB detected fraudulent transactions worth over â‚¹11,300 crore linked to the billionaire jeweller's firms.
