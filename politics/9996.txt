The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has demanded a clarification from Union Minister Arun Jaitley on his recent meeting with AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa. "This is a meeting to mutually assist each other for political gains and it is not in the interest of people. Arun Jaitley should explain to people about this," said CPI(M)'s Tamil Nadu state secretary G Ramakrishnan.
