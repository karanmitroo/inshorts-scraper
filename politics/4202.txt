Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Yadav was on Sunday seen singing the Hindi song 'Kasme waade' during a New Year's dinner. "Kasme waade pyaar wafaa sab baatein hain baaton ka kya, koi kisi ka nahi ye jhoothe naate hain naaton ka kya," he sang. Earlier in the day, the party had passed a resolution demanding his removal as SP's state chief.
