Former RAW chief Sanjeev Tripathi joined the BJP on Tuesday ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, following the footsteps of several retired bureaucrats and diplomats finding a career in politics. Tripathi, a 1972-batch IPS officer, was the chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) from Dec-30, 2010 to Dec-29, 2012.
