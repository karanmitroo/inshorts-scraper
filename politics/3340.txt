Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on Sunday said that by shedding crocodile tears, AIADMK chief Sasikala Natarajan kept MLAs on her side. Panneerselvam also demanded that the MLAs, currently being put up at a private resort, should be released so that they could meet people and get the public mood. Earlier, Sasikala indicated that she had 129 MLAs' support.
