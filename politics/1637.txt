Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at Bihar's political upheaval by tweeting a song, "Na na karte pyaar tumhi se kar baithe, karna tha inkaar magar ikraar tumhi se kar baithe". Notably, Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar left the NDA before 2014 general elections to form Grand Alliance and has now returned to join hands with BJP.
