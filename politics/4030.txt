Lyricist and former Rajya Sabha MP Javed Akhtar on Saturday said, "In the past, humour against a Prime Minister was passable. But today, if you criticise the Prime Minister's policies, it is deemed as anti-national". Further talking about religion, he said, "Religion should be there definitely. But it should be in the museum".
