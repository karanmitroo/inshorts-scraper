AIADMK on Wednesday rejected speculations that former Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam would be reinstated to the post. "124 MLAs voted for Palaniswami, therefore, there is no question of CM change," party leader M Thambidurai said. This comes after AIADMK (Amma) leaders distanced themselves from party leaders VK Sasikala and TTV Dinakaran to facilitate the merger of the AIADMK factions.
