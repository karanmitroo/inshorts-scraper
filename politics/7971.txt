The BJP on Sunday demanded that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal render a public apology to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for alleged defamation. BJP leader MJ Akbar said, "You have done your inquiry". It was earlier reported that a panel instituted by the Delhi government to probe alleged corruption within the DDCA did not mention Jaitley's name in its report.
