AAP government in Delhi has reportedly planned to spend Rs 526 crore this fiscal year on self-promotion and publicity via radio advertisements. The opposition parties and former AAP leader Prashant Bhushan attacked the government saying spending public money on self-publicity amounted to corruption. "[L]ast year only Rs 24 crore was spent for the same," claimed Congress leader Ajay Maken.
