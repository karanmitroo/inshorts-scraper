BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has praised US President Donald Trump's immigration ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries and stressed the need to implement it in India to contain terrorism. Trump had earlier ordered "extreme vetting" of people entering the US from seven Muslim-majority countries and also banned Syrian refugees' entry to "keep radical Islamic terrorists" out of America.
