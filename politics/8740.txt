Delhiâ€™s AAP government is coming up with an online tracker by which people can rate the government on how much it has succeeded in delivering on its poll promises. This manifesto tracker will be developed in collaboration with Stanford University and is modelled on US President Barack Obama's accountability monitor. The tracker is expected to be launched in December.
