The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has reportedly decided to seize a Delhi farmhouse owned by Lalu Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti. This comes after the ED raided three Delhi farmhouses owned by Bharti, over a money laundering case against a firm linked to her and her husband Shailesh Kumar. The ED was reportedly not convinced with their responses during earlier investigations.
