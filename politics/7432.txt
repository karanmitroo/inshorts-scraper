Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday pitched to pass the pending Women's Reservation Bill at the earliest in the Lok Sabha. Gandhi raised the issue on the occasion of International Women's Day. "The philosophy of this government is said to be that of 'maximum governance, minimum government'. I don't agree with part of minimum government," she added, citing women rights.
