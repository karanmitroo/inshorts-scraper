Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken on Wednesday took the responsibility of party's defeat in the MCD elections and announced he won't take up any post in Congress for one year. "Though we have made a reasonable comeback, I had hoped to do better," he added. Notably, many ex-Congress leaders had joined BJP before MCD polls citing differences with Maken.
