Former CM of Jammu and Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, has asked the Hurriyat (a separatist group) to unite for the cause of Kashmir while also extending his support to it. "We are standing by your side at this hour...We are not your adversaries," he added. He further said that both India and Pakistan were out there to subjugate Kashmiris.
