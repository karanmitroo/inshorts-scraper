Some Lok Sabha MPs on Tuesday wrote to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan requesting AAP MP Bhagwant Mann be sent to a drugs and alcohol rehabilitation centre on the House’s expenditure. The MPs, including BJP’s Maheish Girri, SAD’s Prem Singh Chandumajra and suspended AAP MP Harinder Singh Khalsa, urged Mahajan that he be allowed to speak in the House only after completing rehabilitation.
