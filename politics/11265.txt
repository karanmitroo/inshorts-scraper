Five people were injured and two vehicles damaged as Congress workers allegedly attacked AAP volunteers at separate places in Amethi on Saturday. These attacks show Congress is losing in Amethi, Kumar Vishwas said, adding that "This is not the first time. More than dozen attacks, including an attempt on my life, have taken place since Jan-12 when I arrived Amethi."
