Shiv Sena's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said the party will field its candidates for 200 seats in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls and aims to win 25 to 30 seats. Raut added that his party was untouchable in national politics as it stood for Hindutva principles and did not compromise for the sake of political gains.
