Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk about how Muslim women are losing their husbands and sons due to violence by 'gau rakshaks'. This comes after PM Modi appealed to the Muslim community to find a proper solution to the triple talaq issue. Congress had also criticised Modi's statement as inadequate.
