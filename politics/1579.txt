Reacting to the protests demanding separate state Gorkhaland, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said, "I'm ready to give up my life but I'll never support dividing (the state) into parts." "This is India. It's our duty to protect it, not to divide it...the hills are a part of Bengal and will remain so in the future," Mamata added.
