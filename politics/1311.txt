Lalu Yadav and his son Tejashwi Yadav have sought an extension on their scheduled appearance on September 11 and 12 respectively, in the Railways irregularities case. They said they couldn't appear before the court as they were preoccupied with some prior commitments. Earlier, Yadav family's properties were raided over irregularities in IRCTC hotel tenders during Lalu's tenure as Railway Minister.
