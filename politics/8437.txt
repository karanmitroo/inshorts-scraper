BSP supremo Mayawati on Wednesday said the Dalits in the country are feeling 'insecure' under the BJP rule. Citing the recent Faridabad incident where a Dalit family was set ablaze, Mayawati said, "If the victims aren't provided proper security and compensation by the Haryana government and prompt action isn't taken against the culprits, BSP will take to the streets there."
