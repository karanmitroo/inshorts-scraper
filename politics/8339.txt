Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday accused the Grand Alliance (JD(U)-RJD-Congress) in Bihar of "sheltering terrorists" and thereby compromising on the nation's security. "Do you want terrorism to enter this land of Bihar?", Modi asked while addressing a rally. Further, referring to Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar, Modi said, "The 'jungle raj' and 'jantra-mantra raj'... will ruin Bihar".
