Bihar's Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University on Thursday lodged an FIR, against former Delhi Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar, over his fake law degree. The FIR was filed about four months after the university cancelled Tomar's degree. An enquiry held by the university in 2016 had found that Tomar had fraudulently procured a law degree from the university.
