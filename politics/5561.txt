BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini has demanded that the Rajya Sabha be abolished immediately as it was set up by the British to serve their own interest. Earlier, Jan Adhikar Party leader Pappu Yadav had called the Rajya Sabha a "total waste of hard-earned public money". People try to be in the House merely on money power, Yadav had alleged.
