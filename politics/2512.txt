Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, along with 100 villagers, was on Tuesday arrested for carrying out Navratri march through a restricted route in Hazaribagh's Mahudi in BJP-ruled Jharkhand. Last year curfew was imposed in Hazaribagh after two groups clashed on the last day of the Ram Navami. The Muslim villagers had reportedly objected to Ram Navami procession at certain parts.
