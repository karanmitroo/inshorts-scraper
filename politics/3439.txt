Outgoing Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam has claimed that he has full majority in the state Assembly and all AIADMK MLAs are standing behind him. This comes after Panneerselvam said he was forced to resign as the CM and was continuously insulted during his tenure. Earlier, AIADMK had announced that party chief Sasikala will take over as the CM.
