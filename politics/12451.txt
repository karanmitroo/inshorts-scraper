BJP and Congress have started a 'political war' after Sardar Patel's statue was reported missing from store-room of Jalandhar Municipal Corporation. Congress has criticized BJP-leadership in Punjab and said that while BJP's senior leadership is trying to hijack Patel's legacy, regional leaders are insulting him. The matter came to light after Congress demanded installation of Patel's statue at Patel Chowk.
