According to former Defence Minister AK Antony, the unrest in Kashmir is the result of 17 months spent under the governance of PM Narendra Modi. Antony reportedly said, "If Kashmir had been witnessing cross border terrorism all these years, now the state is facing terrorism from the valley itself." He said it was only Modi's "showmanship" occurring in India.
