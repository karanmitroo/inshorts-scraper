PM Narendra Modi Tuesday warned his party MPs that their statements are hurting the govt's image and that no one should cross the 'laxman rekha'. Reportedly, the PM is displeased by several remarks made by the BJP MPs in the recent past. Last week, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj, sparked controversy by calling Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse a 'patriot'.
