Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday pulled up state's Health Minister Satyendar Jain over the shortage of ventilators at state-run hospitals. Ambu-bags (manual hand-held devices which support breathing) are being used to resuscitate patients due to an "acute shortage" of ventilators at hospitals, reports have claimed. "Satinder, this is unacceptable (sic)," he tweeted.
