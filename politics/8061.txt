Even as Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi led a protest with party MPs outside Parliament urging VK Singh's removal for his 'dog remark' against dalits, Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy defended Singh and said he never made such remarks. Accusing Gandhi of "suddenly waking up", Rudy called it "unfortunate" and said "He is traumatised for that. This is not correct."
