Ajay Maken, who led the Congress in the Delhi Assembly elections with a disappointing result, responded to former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit's allegations by blaming her for the shameful defeat. Maken called it an “extension of the 2013 mandate”. Sheila Dikshit had accused him by saying that he lacked focus and sought to do things alone without involving anyone else.
