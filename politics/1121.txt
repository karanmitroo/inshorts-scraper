Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers on Wednesday protested against the recent deaths due to potholes in Bengaluru with a symbolic dead body outside the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) office. This comes after a woman died earlier on the same day while trying to avoid a pothole. This was the fourth death caused by potholes in the last one week.
