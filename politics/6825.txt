Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Sunday alleged that the Congress MLAs were being threatened and their phones were tapped ahead of the Tuesday's floor test in the state assembly. “Central agencies are harassing Congress people through various ways,” Rawat said. Earlier, a sting video was released by a news channel alleging Rawat of giving money to the MLAs.
