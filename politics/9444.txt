Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said Thursday there was a limit to everything and it hurt when that limit was crossed. Talking about contrarian views in the party, he added, "It is wrong to say there are no contrarian voices among us. But everything happens within a limit. Inside a room, we fight and scream but outside we are a team."
