A Delhi court Saturday warned Arvind Kejriwal and three other AAP leaders that it would initiate "coercive process" if they fail to appear before it on May-24 in a criminal defamation complaint filed against them by Union minister Kapil Sibal's son. All the four accused didn't appear before the court today on the ground that they were busy in campaigning.
