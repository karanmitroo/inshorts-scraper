Reacting to Lalit Modi's claims that he met Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra in London, the Congress on Friday said that 'chhota Modi' is helping 'bada Modi' (PM Narendra Modi) with lies. "[N]either Priyanka Gandhi nor Robert Vadra ever interacted with Lalit Modi socially. If you see somebody in a restaurant, it's not a crime," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.
