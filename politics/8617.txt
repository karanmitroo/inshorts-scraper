The AAP has dissolved all its “bodies in Maharashtra”, the party announced on its website on Thursday. AAP Mumbai head Mayank Gandhi criticised the move by tweeting, "Two types of politics— one that works with people on ground and other that do “chaplusi” in Delhi. The second type has won". AAP, however, claimed that it is restructuring the Maharashtra unit.
