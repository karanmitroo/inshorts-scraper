Former President Pratibha Patil reportedly wants the government to foot her fuel bill, give her an official vehicle, and also allow her to use her private vehicle. According to rules, she can either avail fuel allowance and use her own vehicle, or use a government vehicle. The Home Ministry has asked her to pick one option instead of demanding both.
