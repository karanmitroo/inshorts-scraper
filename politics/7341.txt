RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Monday attributed the change of the RSS dress code to an "aggressive and rational remark" made by his wife Rabri Devi in January. At a party function in Patna in January, Rabri Devi had said, “It does not behove the elders of RSS to wear shorts.” Notably, RSS recently decided to change their uniform.
