Reacting to Rita Bahuguna joining the BJP, Congress leader Raj Babbar on Thursday said that her shift will not affect the party in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls of 2017. Citing that this was the 4th-5th change in Bahuguna's family, Babbar added that because she has been a History professor, she was repeating the history of her family.
