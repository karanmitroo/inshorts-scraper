RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav has dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dissolve the Parliament and then simultaneously hold elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies. This would give BJP the real taste of the popular mood, he added. Assembly elections are due in BJP-ruled Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh and Congress-ruled Karnataka, in 2017 and 2018.
