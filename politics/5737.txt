The Communist Party of India (CPI) has accused the West Bengal government of trying to put down the central trade union strike with an “iron hand” in the state. It accused CM Mamata Banerjee of threatening transporters and having a “vindictive" attitude. If the Centre does not concede, the working class may have to take a "bigger action", CPI added.
