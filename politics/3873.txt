Mocking cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu's past remark that BJP is like his mother, Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said Sidhu keeps on changing his mother every single day. "Sidhu is a human bomb which will explode and ruin things," said Badal. I can guarantee you in next six months he will quit Congress, he added.
