Congress leader and former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday said that the BJP-led central government was considering disbanding the National Green Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body he had set up. "Dilution of the independence of the NGT is a direct dilution of the fundamental right to a clean environment and a balanced ecosystem," he added.
