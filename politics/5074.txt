After receiving flak for banning 'NDTV India', Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said that 21 channels were banned during the UPA regime and claimed that some of them were banned for airing midnight masala. "Whereas we are worried about daylight portrayal of terror activities with running commentary on whereabouts of ammo depot, etc," the Minister of Urban Development added.
