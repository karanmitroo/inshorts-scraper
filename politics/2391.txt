BJP's youth wing leader Yogesh Varshney has announced a reward of â‚¹11 lakh for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's head. Varshney's threat comes a day after police took action against a rally of saffron activists held in Kolkata to mark Hanuman Jayanti. "She never allows Saraswati Puja, fairs during Ram Navami, and always supports Muslims," said Varshney.
