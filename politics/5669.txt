Former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, who was in jail for 11 years in the BJP leader Rajiv Roshan murder case, was granted bail by the Patna High Court on Saturday. “We all know I was framed,” he stated. Shahabuddin was also accused of killing brothers Girish Raj and Satish Raj in 2004. Roshan was the prime witness of these killings.
