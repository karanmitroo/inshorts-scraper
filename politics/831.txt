Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi thought that Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Dr Arvind Subramanian and other economists were stupid. He was responding to PM Narendra Modi's statement terming the Congress' demand to cap GST at 18% as a 'Grand Stupid Thought'. Chidambaram also slammed the government for failing to reduce fuel prices.
