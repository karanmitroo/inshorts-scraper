Addressing the 'Navodhana Sangamam' rally in Kerala on Sunday, BJP President Amit Shah said that "Congress Mukth Bharat" (Congress Free India) is BJP's agenda. He also criticised both, the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the opposition CPI(M)-led Left democratic Front (LDF) saying, "While Congress is becoming obsolete in India, communism has died down worldwide".
