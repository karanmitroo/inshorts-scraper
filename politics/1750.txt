Opposition's Presidential candidate Meira Kumar on Saturday said it is shameful that the presidential election is being seen as a fight between Dalit vs Dalit. "Earlier when the presidential candidates were from a higher caste, no one discussed caste but their qualifications, experiences, and capabilities. However, when Ramnath Kovindji and I were nominated, it became a caste issue," she added.
