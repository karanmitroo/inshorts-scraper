Launching a scathing attack against media on Thursday, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal alleged that there is a nexus between media and Narendra Modi, which is working to promote a positive image of the BJP PM candidate. He threatened that he will open investigations against all those involved in ‘paid media’ and send the guilty to jail, if elected to power.
