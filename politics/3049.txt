Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that poll results would change the fate of the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress. "These three political parties are enjoying freedom in the state, as they have to get out of this election and not rebel, nor be tainted," Modi added addressing a rally in Maharajganj.
