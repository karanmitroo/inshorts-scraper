Rajesh Garg, former AAP MLA, released an audiotape of a conversation between him and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal which alleges that the latter had indulged in horse-trading before the dissolution of Delhi Assembly in 2014. Garg claims that Kejriwal wanted to form government in Delhi by breaking six Congress MLAs so that he can enjoy full majority in the assembly.
