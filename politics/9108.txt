Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Saturday backed former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, saying that he cannot be called an 'absconder' yet. "So far Lalit Modi has not been found guilty of even the smallest offence. So, he could not have been said to be a defaulter or an absconder," senior party leader and advocate Majeed Memon said.
