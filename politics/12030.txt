Congress was left red-faced Friday when the party's new campaign advertisement featuring Rahul Gandhi 'lifted' a tagline used by BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi. BJP alleged that the Congressâ€™s new slogan 'Main Nahi, Hum' was coined by Modi in 2011. BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said, "They are copycats. They are in desperation and are ready to go to any extent."
