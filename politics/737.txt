Responding to Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar calling him "neech", PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said this showed the Congress' 'Mughlai mindset'. Adding that he was from the poor section of the society, PM Modi said he would spend every moment of his life working for them. "Let them keep calling me 'Neech' we will not respond," he added.
