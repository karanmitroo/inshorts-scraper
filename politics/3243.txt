BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday said that the alliance between Samajwadi Party and Congress for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections was a last-minute stopgap arrangement. "A BJP tsunami will soon hit Uttar Pradesh, heralding a major change in the course of country's politics. The results will bring to a halt dynastic and caste-based politics," Shah added.
