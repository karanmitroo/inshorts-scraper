Ram Kripal Yadav, RJD legislator and a close aide of party chief Lalu Prasad, announced on Saturday that he is resigning from all party posts. "I have resigned from all party posts in the RJD but not from Rajya Sabha," Yadav said. This comes after Prasad denied any rethink on the nominations already made for the polls to various constituencies.
