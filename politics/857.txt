Addressing a rally in Porbandar, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that PM Narendra Modi gave ₹33,000 crore for Tata Nano, but would not give even ₹300 crore to fishermen. Claiming that the Congress would set up a separate ministry for fisheries if it came to power, Gandhi added that Gujarat belongs to the farmers and fishermen.
