Aam Aadmi Party, which is carrying out a referendum to get "a sense of what the people want", is likely to form government in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal said over 75% of Delhiites want AAP to assume office. "We will take a final call after our ward meetings through the weekend, but there is an overwhelming pressure from people," added Kejriwal.
