The Election Commission has started an inquiry after finding out the BJP's CM candidate for Delhi, Kiran Bedi, has 2 voter identity cards, with addresses in Uday Park and Talkatora Lane. According to the EC officials, it is a violation of law, and action will be taken if it is found that Bedi didn't apply for cancellation of one card.
