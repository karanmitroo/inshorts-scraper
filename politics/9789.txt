Activist Anna Hazare Tuesday defended Kiran Bedi saying, "She is not responsible for BJP's defeat in Delhi but Narendra Modi is." Congratulating AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal as his party headed for a landslide win, Hazare said, "I extend my best wishes to Kejriwalji." However, he also urged Kejriwal not to make the 'mistakes' he committed earlier.
