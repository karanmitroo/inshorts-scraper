Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said he feels proud that Bal Thackeray was on the hit list of terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Raut further questioned the Mumbai Police and the then Government as to why these facts were not revealed. The Pakistani-American terrorist David Headley had earlier told a Mumbai Court that LeT wanted to eliminate Bal Thackeray.
