Congress on Sunday appointed Dalhousie MLA Asha Kumari as its General Secretary in-charge of Punjab. Kumari, who was convicted in a land grab case earlier this year, is presently out on bail. Earlier, party leader Kamal Nath had resigned from the post after his appointment was criticised by opposition parties over his alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.
