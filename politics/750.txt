Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has termed the disqualification of rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav from Rajya Sabha illegal and unconstitutional. "It is political vendetta. We strongly condemn it and demand that disqualification be revoked," Kejriwal added. This comes after Vice President Venkaiah Naidu ruled that Yadav "voluntarily gave up membership" of the party by indulging in anti-party activities.
