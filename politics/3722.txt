The Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police has ordered a probe on a complaint filed by an NGO against alleged corruption by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's brother-in-law Surender Kumar Bansal. The NGO has claimed that Bansal, who had the tender to construct a drain, had submitted fake bills and invoices to the Public Works Department and made huge profits.
