AAP leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan Wednesday wrote a letter to party volunteers accusing Arvind Kejriwal of trying to strike a deal with Congress to form a government in Delhi after the Lok Sabha elections. "We have also asked the party Lokpal to investigate the allegations made against Bhushan and me," Yadav said.
