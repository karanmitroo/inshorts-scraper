AlMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has decided to adopt a village in Mulayam Singh's constituency Azamgarh (under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana), for both political and practical reasons. "Hyderabad is an urban constituency, it doesn't have villages, so I have decided to identify and apply to the concerned ministry for the adoption of a village in Azamgarh," Owaisi said.
