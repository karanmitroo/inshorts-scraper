Days before civic polls in Delhi, the BJP on Saturday expelled 21 members for six years allegedly for anti-party activities. The expelled members include five sitting councillors, out which four are contesting the civic polls against the party's official candidates. Notably, the BJP has decided not to give tickets to all its sitting councillors in the three corporations.
