The Congress has denied reports that party Vice President Rahul Gandhi declared himself as a non-Hindu while entering Gujarat's Somnath Temple. The temple maintains a register at the entrance where non-Hindu visitors are required to declare their identity. Congress said the picture of Gandhi's signature in the non-Hindu register was fake and blamed the BJP for diverting from real issues.
