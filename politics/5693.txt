After sparking a row for defending Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar in a blog, Senior AAP leader Ashutosh asked the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), "Should I be hanged for writing a column?" He also posted a copy of DCW's notice that he received. Terming Ashutosh's blog 'misogynist', the DCW slammed him for calling rape accused Sandeep's act 'consensual' and 'private'.
