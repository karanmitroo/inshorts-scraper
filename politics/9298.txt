Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said the RSS doesn't pressurise the Modi government in any way. "After listening to you, they (RSS functionaries) may say what they feel but will tell you to do as deemed fit by you," he said. "What I want to say is that there is no political meaning behind people meeting Sangh," Gadkari added.
