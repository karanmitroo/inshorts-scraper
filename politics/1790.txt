West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh on Saturday said the party had never talked about Gorkhaland nor was it in favour of formation of states on the basis of any linguistic group or community. "If states are to be created on this basis, we will have to support everybody like Kamtapuris, Rajbanshis. They also demanded separate states," Ghosh added.
