The Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) on Friday questioned Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia for close to three hours in connection with its probe into an alleged recruitment scam in Delhi Commission for Women (DCW). ”I don't understand why they summoned me”, said Sisodia. Ever since the AAP government has been formed, ACB has questioned three ministers in different cases.
