Condemning RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat's calls for reviewing India's reservation policy, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said that the RSS is like BJP's "Supreme Court". "RSS view is final... if RSS chief says something then BJP has no say", he said. Kumar also dubbed Bhagwat's views as "dangerous and extra-constitutional".
