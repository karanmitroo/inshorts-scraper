Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said the Congress' walkout from the Parliament shows that there was "someone very powerful" involved in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam. He also said it was the "weakness" of the party which forced them to do so. Congress leaders had on Wednesday staged a walkout, following Parrikar's statement on the issue.
