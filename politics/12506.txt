Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit, who is leading Congress' campaign for a fourth successive victory in the polls, admitted on Tuesday that AAP has drawn people's attention. However, she considered BJP as their main contender as she doubted if AAP would make any impact in coming assembly polls. AAP has decided to field candidates in all 70 constituencies of Delhi.
