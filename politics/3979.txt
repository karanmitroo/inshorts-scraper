Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said India needs bold decisions and that time has come to clean up the table. "Demonetisation is going to have an impact over the course of our lives... it'll lead to cleaner and larger GDP," Jaitley said. "Difficult decisions initially pass through difficult phases. Historic decisions have temporary pain attached to them," he added.
