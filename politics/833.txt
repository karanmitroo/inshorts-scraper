During an event in poll-bound Gujarat, BJP President Amit Shah said he didn't know if 47-year-old Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi could be considered a 'ladka' (boy). He was replying to a question about how Gujarat polls were bringing young leaders like Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakore closer to Gandhi. "Till what age do you consider someone ladka?" asked Shah.
