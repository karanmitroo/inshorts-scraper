Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has said that the state Excise Minister HY Meti will have to quit if the alleged sex CD in which the 71-year-old minister is in a "compromising position with a woman" actually exists and is released. "I will not tolerate such shameful conduct as it goes against my own ethical values too," the CM said.
