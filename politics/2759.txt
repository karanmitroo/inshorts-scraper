Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was running the party for the past 10 years, while his mother Sonia Gandhi was party president only for namesake. "The Congress is a sinking ship come what may," he added. His comments come after the Congress' recent loss in the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Assembly polls.
