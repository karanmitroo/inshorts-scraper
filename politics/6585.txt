Delhi Legislative Assembly Deputy Speaker Bandana Kumari reportedly resigned from her post on Saturday. The AAP leader's resignation has been submitted to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, although the norm is to send it to the Speaker. Kumari was reportedly dissatisfied with the party, as it refused to nominate a candidate suggested by her for the recent MCD by-polls.
