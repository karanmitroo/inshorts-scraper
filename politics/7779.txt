DMK leader M Karunanidhi on Monday demanded a judicial probe to look into the alleged suicide of three students in a private institution in Tamil Nadu. The parents have denied suicide, and have alleged that the college was charging exorbitant fees and harassing the students, he said. The reasons behind the deaths should be ascertained, Karunanidhi added.
