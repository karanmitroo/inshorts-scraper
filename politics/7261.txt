BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday criticised Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, calling him a 'buddhu' (fool). ".. he can do anything foolish; he has lost the respect of the public...The Congress Party is not growing because of people like Rahul Gandhi," Swamy said. He was reacting to the recent meeting between JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar and Rahul Gandhi.
