Punjab Deputy CM and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday called the Congress an "anti-national" party while accusing its leaders of sharing stage with groups having links with Pakistan's ISI. Further, he said that the Congress was forming alliances with terrorist organisations for political gains. "Congress under Rahul Gandhi is bringing back 1984 tension," Badal added.
