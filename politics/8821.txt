The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Monday asked the Congress to allow debate in Parliament on issues that were being brought up. SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, at a meeting called by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, said the government should be allowed to answer the allegations. The SP had earlier extended support to the Congress after Congress MPs were suspended.
