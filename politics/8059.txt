On his first visit to Kerala as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi on Monday said the BJP has suffered "political untouchability" in the state from other parties. "[T]wo coalitions have been ruling the state and looting its people", he said. Further, the PM added that the BJP will replace the leading parties (Congress and CPI(M)) in the assembly elections next year.
