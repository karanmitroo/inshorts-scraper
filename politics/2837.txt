After Manohar Parrikar was appointed as the CM of Goa, Digvijaya Singh took to Twitter and alleged, "money power has won over people's power". "I apologise to the people of Goa as we couldn't muster the support to form the government," he tweeted. "But our struggle against communal forces and money power politics shall continue," he added.
