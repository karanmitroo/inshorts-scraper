Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claim that he is not being allowed to speak in the Parliament, Congress leader PC Chacko on Monday said that the PM is an expert in misleading people. "He (Modi) has failed miserably in bringing back black money from abroad, so he has diverted people's attention through demonetisation," Chacko added.
