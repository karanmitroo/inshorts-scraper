Condemning Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for his 'donkey' remark against PM Narendra Modi, BJP has demanded his suspension from the party. "The party on which Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru used to feel proud once, has a leader like Digvijaya Singh," BJP's Siddharth Nath Singh said. "Modi ji... you indeed work like a donkey," Singh had tweeted.
