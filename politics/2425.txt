Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that everyone should sing Vande Mataram and not singing the National Song was a matter of serious concern. Not singing Vande Mataram shows a prejudiced mind, Adityanath further added. However, he asserted that in the 21st century, the issue of 'not singing Vande Mataram' should not be the most discussed topic.
