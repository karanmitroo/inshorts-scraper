Hundreds of Youth Congress activists Monday took out a protest march in the national capital against the BJP government's Land Acquisition Bill. The opposition parties have called the Bill as 'anti-farmer' and said it is only beneficial for businessmen. The bill was passed in Lok Sabha last week via a voice vote and nine amendments were also adopted.
