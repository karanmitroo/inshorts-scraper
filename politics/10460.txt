The Samajwadi Party Friday announced the names of six party candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections scheduled next month. They are Ram Gopal, Javed Ali, Chandra Pal Singh, Neeraj Shekhar, Ravi Verma and Tanzeem Fatima. Contrary to speculation, former party leader and outgoing Rajya Sabha member Amar Singh was not given a ticket though he had lobbied hard for it.
