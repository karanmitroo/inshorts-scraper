The Maoists on Thursday triggered an IED and blew up a bus carrying the polling party, who were returning to Dumka (Jharkhand) after completion of the voting. The incidence resulted in killing of at least three polling officials and five policemen. The incident has once again raised concerns of security of polling staff.
