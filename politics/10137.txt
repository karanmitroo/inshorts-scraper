Haryana state government has decided to introduce the Gita for class V and above in all schools from the next academic session. "A committee of educationists would decide on the inclusion of specific shlokas of the Gita in various standards", education minister Bilas Sharma said. Doubting BJP's intentions, the Congress said it would not allow saffronisation of state's education system.
