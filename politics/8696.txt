Bihar's former Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Modi said on Monday that the party would give most of the tickets to young candidates as 56 percent of the state's population is aged 18-40. “That is a demographic which will define this election. The young want sync between the Centre and the State for development,” Modi added.
