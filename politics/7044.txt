Reacting to the Election Commission's show-cause notice, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said she does not "regret" what she said and will "say it thousand times". "These people are dancing to the tunes of the BJP. It won't work," she asserted. The EC earlier issued the notice against her for an alleged Model Code of Conduct violation.
