BSP supremo Mayawati has said that Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh did not celebrate his birthday this year "not out of any sympathy for the train tragedy (victims)", but because of "pain over demonetisation". "Had he been this sensitive and concerned over the issues of common people, why would they have organised Saifai mahotsav post Muzaffarnagar communal riots," Mayawati said.
