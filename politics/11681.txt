Dwarka Peeth Shankarachayra Swaroopanand Saraswati has raised objection to "Har har Modi" slogan in favour of BJP PM nominee Narendra Modi; and has registered a strong protest with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to stop it. He considers the traditional chant "Har har Mahadev" raised to hail Lord Shiva being "modified" into "Har har Modi" as an insult to Lord Shiva.
