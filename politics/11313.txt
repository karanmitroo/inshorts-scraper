In a major embarrassment to the Congress, PM Manmohan Singh's half-brother, Daljeet Singh Kohli, Friday joined the BJP in the presence of its PM candidate Narendra Modi. â€œKohli joining BJP has doubled our strength," Modi said while welcoming Kohli into the BJP fold. Notably, Kohli had remained apolitical even after his elder brother Manmohan Singh became PM.
