The voter turnout in assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry is less than the 2011 polls, the Election Commission said. The voter turnout recorded in Tamil Nadu was 69.19%. Meanwhile, Kerala and Puducherry recorded a poll percentage of 71% and 81.94% respectively. The figures, EC officials said, are likely to increase when the final figures are out.
