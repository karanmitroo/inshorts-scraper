West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has attacked PM Narendra Modi for abolishing the Planning Commission and alleged that this move had affected the country's federal structure. "Earlier, there was at least a Planning Commission. The chief ministers had a platform to voice their views and worries. But now where should we go and speak about such issues?" she said.
