One of the founder members of the Aam Aadmi Party, Shanti Bhushan, has created a controversy, by criticising its convener, Arvind Kejriwal. "He (Kejriwal) is a great leader, a great campaigner but in my opinion he lacks the ability to organise party affairs...AAP under him has failed to expand across India." said Bhushan during an interview on Wednesday.
