RJD chief Lalu Prasad has said that CM Nitish Kumar will take a call on the issue of Deputy CM in Bihar as it is the CM's prerogative. "The Mahagathbandhan has got huge mandate because people of Bihar, especially Dalits, Mahadalits, minorities, backwards and all other suppressed, oppressed and exploited groups have total faith and trust in us," Lalu added.
