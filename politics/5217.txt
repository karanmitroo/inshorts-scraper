Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy has said that Rahul Gandhi has worked hard to strengthen Congress at Central and state levels, and now "he should take over as the party chief". This comes after former UP Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi recently quit Congress to join BJP, slamming Rahul Gandhi for being "unresponsive" to people in the party.
