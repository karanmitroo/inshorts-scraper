Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Choudhry was on Monday suspended for a day from the Lok Sabha for unruly behaviour by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan after he banged his placard on the speaker's table. "Despite my repeated requests, the protest with the placard didn't stop... Adhir Ranjan Choudhury disregarded authority of the chair", Mahajan said before adjourning the House.
