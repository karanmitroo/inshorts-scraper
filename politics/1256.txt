Expelled BJP Muslim leader from Assam, Benazir Arfan, has claimed that there is no place for minorities in the political party. Arfan further said, "The party is also doing lip service in the name of being there for minorities. They are not serious about our issues and no genuine leader from the community is allowed to rise."
