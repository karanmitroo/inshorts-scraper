The BJP has removed its Ghaziabad district chief Ajay Sharma after he staged a protest outside the wedding reception of an interfaith couple, claiming that the marriage was a case of love jihad. Sharma was supported by over 100 members from various right-wing groups. Police had resorted to lathicharge against the protesters, who staged a sit-in protest for five hours.
