The Election Commission on Monday told the Supreme Court that a candidate should not contest elections from two constituencies. This comes after a plea was filed by a BJP leader challenging Section 33(7) of The Representation of the People Act of 1951, that allows a person to contest elections to Parliament and state assemblies from two constituencies.
