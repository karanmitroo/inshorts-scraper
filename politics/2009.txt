The BJP on Saturday sought the imposition of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in Kannur (Kerala) a day after an RSS office-bearer was hacked to death. The BJP leadership also accused the activists from the ruling CPI(M) of the murder. The victim was one of the accused in the July 2016 murder of a CPI(M) worker.
