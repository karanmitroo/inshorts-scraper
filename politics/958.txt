Terming GST as "Great Selfish Tax", West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday tweeted that the tax was aimed at harassing people and finishing the economy. She further urged Twitter users to change their display pictures to a black square as a sign of protest on November 8, the anniversary of demonetisation.
