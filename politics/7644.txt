Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of having a political mandate to erase multiculturalism from India. Gandhi, who was in Assam ahead of the Assembly elections, said that RSS "cannot respect or appreciate other cultures”. “The RSS agenda is dangerous for a multicultural state like Assam where people follow different faiths," added Gandhi.
