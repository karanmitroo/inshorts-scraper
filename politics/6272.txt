Prakash Javadekar was appointed the Human Resource Development Minister, replacing Smriti Irani from the post after the Union Cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday. Irani, who took oath as the HRD Minister after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, has now been shifted to the Ministry of Textiles. Javadekar had been serving as the Minister of State for Environment since May 2014.
