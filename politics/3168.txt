Suggesting BJP to "mind its own business before trying to harm other", Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday said that in the recently concluded Punjab Assembly election no one has voted for the party. "Only because of mistakes committed by the Congress, the BJP had come to power at the Centre. It will not be repeated," she added.
