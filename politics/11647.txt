Wife of Loknath Mahto - a three-time MLA and now a Lok Sabha aspirant - sells vegetables at the Barkagaon village mart (in Jharkhand). Poverty isn’t a reason for his wife’s profession as Mahto has declared assets worth Rs 2 crore but this work gives her ‘financial independence’ and she has been doing it for a long time.
