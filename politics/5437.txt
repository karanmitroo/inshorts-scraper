The Shiv Sena on Tuesday equated Goa RSS rebel leader Subhash Velingkar to Lord Krishna, stating he will guide the non-BJP and non-Congress parties to victory in the 2017 Goa Assembly polls. "The upcoming state Assembly election fight is like a final war in Mahabharata. BJP are 'Kauravas' and others who are against them are ‘Pandavas’,” the Shiv Sena added.
