BJP workers Raju Mahali and his wife Geeta Mahali, who hosted lunch for party President Amit Shah at West Bengal's Naxalbari almost a week ago, have joined the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress. While the BJP has alleged that the couple was abducted, TMC leader Goutam Deb has said they joined the party without any pressure from anyone.
