Former Union Home Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said that there's no evidence that terror is funded by fake currency only. “Fact is that in J&K, since September 30, 33 security personnel lost their lives…compared to 2015, the number of security personnel who lost lives in J&K doubled in 2016,” he claimed. "Situation worsened instead of getting better," he added.
