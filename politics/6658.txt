Reacting to the Assembly elections result, Shiv Sena on Friday said the “Modi magic” did not work in dethroning regional parties easily. Although the BJP could win in Assam, it could not win in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the Sena said in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’. In Kerala, "Acche din" for BJP managed to open their account, it added.
