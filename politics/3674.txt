Addressing a poll rally in Punjab's Jalandhar, PM Modi on Friday said that the Congress is a boat that has sunk. He also criticised the Congress move to ally with the SP in Uttar Pradesh. "The Punjab people will vote like they did 5 years ago. They will again bring back Parkash Singh Badal as the chief minister," Modi said.
