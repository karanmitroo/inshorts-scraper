Himachal Pradesh Election Commission has said that the firm that was responsible to ensure webcast of all polling stations during the state assembly elections lacked adequate manpower and technical support. The inquiry revealed that webcasting was done only from around 500 out of 2,307 polling stations in the state. Webcasting was required to ensure regular monitoring of the polling booths.
