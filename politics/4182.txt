Odisha's ruling BJD government on Monday alleged that the newspaper advertisement of PM Narendra Modi announcing packages for farmers, self-help groups, and others is in violation of the Model Code of Conduct. The regulations are in force in the state for the three-tier panchayat elections in Odisha. The state government has submitted a petition to Election Commission in this regard.
