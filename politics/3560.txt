Reacting to the notice on bribery remark, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Thursday said, "I'm disappointed because the Election Commission published the notice on website without handing me the notice first." He further said, "Is this the correct way of doing it, the appropriate way was to hand me the notice first and later they could have published it."
