Tamil Nadu's opposition parties, the DMK and the DMDK, have filed petitions alleging that afternoon rallies by the AIADMK amount to "gross human rights" violations. The DMK wrote to the National Human Rights Commission, while the DMDK petitioned the Election Commission as well. On Wednesday, two AIADMK supporters died of suspected sunstroke at AIADMK Chief and CM Jayalalithaa's Salem rally.
