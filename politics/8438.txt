Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday attacked PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government over the recent case of alleged caste discrimination wherein a Dalit family was set afire in Faridabad. Paying a visit to the victims whose children died, Gandhi said, "People are dying in this country left, right and centre... There's no government here that works for the poor".
