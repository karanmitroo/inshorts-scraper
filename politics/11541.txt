The autorickshaw driver - who slapped Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday - apologized after Kejriwal called on him, admitting that it was a "big mistake" on his part. He added that he was unhappy and wanted to meet Kejriwal but couldn't; and even went to janata durbar but failed to meet him there as well.
