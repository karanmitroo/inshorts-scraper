Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Sunday asserted that Congress President should be appointed through consensus, not elections, as it helps bind the party. He also said it was up to Sonia Gandhi if she wanted to continue as party chief for another term. "If she wants to go, I think Rahul is in a position to take over," he added.
