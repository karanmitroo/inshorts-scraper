DMK leader MK Stalin has warned the Tamil Nadu government to withdraw the 240 police personnel deployed at late state CM J Jayalalithaa's residence or he would take a legal recourse. Noting that there are 19,157 vacancies needed to be filled up by the TN Police, he further urged the state government to redeploy these police personnel at appropriate locations.
