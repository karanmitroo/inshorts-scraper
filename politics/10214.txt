Most exit polls have revealed that no single party can lay a stake to form the government in Jammu and Kashmir. While the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) is expected to bag most number of assembly seats, BJP will be closely behind. With PDP getting a maximum of 36 seats in the 87-seat Assembly, J&K may witness a hung assembly.
