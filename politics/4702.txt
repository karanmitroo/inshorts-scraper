Yoga guru Swami Ramdev has called RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav India’s ‘heritage’, adding, “His health is a matter of concern for us. Lalu should remain healthy for the politics of the country”. Ramdev rejected the rumours that he met Lalu due to the possibility of marriage between Ramdev’s niece and Lalu’s elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav.
