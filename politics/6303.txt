Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday called the AAP an "anti-Punjab and anti-Sikh outfit" and alleged that it is getting funds from "foreign shores". Further on Congress state unit chief Amarinder Singh, Badal said it is "laughable" that he is "day dreaming" about becoming the Chief Minister as he is "facing revolt" from his own party.
