Trinamool Congress Chief Mamata Banerjee on Saturday criticised the CPI(M)-Congress alliance for the West Bengal Assembly polls, and asserted that both the parties will realise it was a "mistake". Banerjee described the TMC as "transparent" and a party of the people, and further urged the people not to listen to the 'smear campaign against her party'.
