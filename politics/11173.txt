Expecting a positive outcome, the Mumbai unit of BJP has placed an order for 2000 kg laddoos, to ensure the delivery on time. "We have put up giant LCD screens to watch the results and as soon as Modi wins a majority we will start distributing laddoos, burst crackers and celebrate with colour," Mumbai BJP Spokesperson Atul Shah said.
