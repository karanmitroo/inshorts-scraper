Over 5,000 BJP workers in Meghalaya have quit the party to protest against the Centre's new rules that aim to prevent sale of cattle for slaughter. A party leader who quit called the rules an attempt to "suppress the tribal and other communities who consume beef." BJP state VP John Antonius Lyngdoh said, "We cannot go against our food habits."
