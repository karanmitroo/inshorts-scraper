AIADMK supremo and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Monday sacked party MP Sasikala Pushpa for bringing "ill fame" to the party. Pushpa had allegedly slapped DMK MP Tiruchi Siva on Saturday for criticising Jayalalithaa. Meanwhile, Sasikala broke down in the Parliament claiming there was threat to her life and that she is "being compelled" to resign from her post.
