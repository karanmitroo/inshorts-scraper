Eight Left and six Congress members from West Bengal’s 38-member Malda Zilla Parishad on Monday joined the Trinamool​ Congress. TMC's in-charge of Malda Suvendu Adhikari has said that the members didn’t approve the "unethical alliance" between the Congress and Left during the 2016 Assembly election. This gives the Trinamool​ Congress control over the district's council.
