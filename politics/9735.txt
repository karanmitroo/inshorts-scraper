Congress workers took their protests against the ruling BJP, over the multi-crore Madhya Pradesh exam scam, to the state assembly on Wednesday. The police, in reply, used water canons to disperse the hundreds of protesters. The protest came few days after Congress alleged that CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan was involved in the scam and demanded his resignation.
