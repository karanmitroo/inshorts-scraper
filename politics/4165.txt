Ousted SP Vice President Kiranmoy Nanda, who was sacked for attending the National Executive meet, has alleged that party chief Mulayam Singh's signatures were forged on the two January 1 orders. While one signature had his full name, the second signature was incomplete, Nanda claimed. The two orders declared the convention unconstitutional and sacked Kiranmoy Nanda from the party.
