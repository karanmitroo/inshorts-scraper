Congress’ Delhi unit on Saturday held a protest against the Centre's decision to implement the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission. Calling the announcement a "betrayal", Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said that the Commission had recommended a 14.27% salary hike of government employees, the “lowest” so far. The party demanded a minimum monthly pay of ₹25,000 for government employees.
