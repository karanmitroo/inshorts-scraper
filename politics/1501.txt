Former Gujarat Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela on Thursday said that he is neither joining the BJP nor forming a new political party. "Except me, other MLAs are likely to join the BJP," he added. His statement comes a day after Congress expelled eight law-makers for cross-voting in the Rajya Sabha election.
