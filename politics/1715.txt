UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has banned red carpet welcomes and special arrangements during his visits and asked bureaucrats to "keep it simple". He also warned officials not to arrange special towels, air conditioners or particular sofas. Earlier, officials covered up a muddy road with red carpet when Yogi went to meet slain CRPF sub-inspector Sahab Shukla's kin in Gorakhpur.
