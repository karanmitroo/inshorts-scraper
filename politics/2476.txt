Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad has said in the Lok Sabha, "I apologise to the Parliament if I have caused any hurt, but not to the Air India official." He further demanded that the ban on him by airlines be removed and said, "What crime have I committed? What is my offence that I'm put under media trial without probe?"
