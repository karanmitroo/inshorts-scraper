Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday rejected Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's contention in the Lok Sabha that the UPA government left behind “double-digit” inflation. "FM said UPA bequeathed double digit inflation. In June 2014 CPI (Consumer Price Index) was 6.77 and WPI (Wholesale Price Index) was 5.66. Did FM add the two numbers? Voodoo statistics!" Chidambaram tweeted.
