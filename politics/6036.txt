Leader of the Patel quota agitation, Hardik Patel, on Friday said that Gujarat CM-designate Vijay Rupani is Amit Shah’s loyalist, hence the state will now run on the orders of the BJP President. Further accusing the BJP government of misleading the Patel community, he advised the state’s Deputy CM-designate Nitin Patel to resign to save his image.
