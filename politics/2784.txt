BJP MLAs in Rajasthan on Thursday chanted 'Jai Shri Ram' in the House to celebrate the landslide victory of the party in the recently held Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. It all started when Rajasthan Minister Rajendra Rathore asked the Opposition to congratulate them for their party's victory which led to a verbal altercation between the BJP MLAs and Opposition MLAs.
