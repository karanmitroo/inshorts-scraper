At least 52 AAP MLAs, including Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, were detained by the police on Sunday, as they marched towards PM Narendra Modi's residence in protest. This comes after a police complaint was filed against Sisodia, accusing him of intimidating businessmen. Reacting to it, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had earlier tweeted that Sisodia will 'surrender' before the PM.
