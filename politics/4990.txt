Terming terrorism as the biggest challenge in the world, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said, "Na hume aata chahi, na hume Tata chahi, hume Pakistan me sannata chahi." The statement means "we don't need flour, we don't need Tata, we only need silence in Pakistan". Making the remark in Bhojpuri, Rajnath asserted their government is respectful towards the language.
