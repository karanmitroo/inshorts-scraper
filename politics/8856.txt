Slamming Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for remarks against its national chief Amit Shah, the BJP on Sunday said, "Shah was falsely implicated by Congress and now he has been discharged in all the cases." BJP was responding to Nitish's barb at Shah that he must have learnt all bad things during imprisonment in connection with criminal cases.
