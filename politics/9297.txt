Days after PM Narendra Modi visited China, the Shiv Sena criticised the country in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' for having a policy of "hugging from the front and stabbing from behind". "On one hand they gave a grand welcome to PM Modi during his visit... and on the other, wiped off Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh from India's map," the party said.
