Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday accused the Election Commission of playing a partisan role by filing an FIR against him for alleged Model Code of Conduct violation. "If necessary, we will fight it out in the court," Gogoi said. Arun Jaitley also conducted a press conference a day before the poll, but no action was taken, he alleged.
