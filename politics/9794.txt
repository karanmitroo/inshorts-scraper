AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, whose party swept the 70-member Delhi Assembly elections with a historic majority of 67 seats, will take oath as the CM on "Feb 14" in Ramlila Maidan, said party spokesperson Ashutosh. Interestingly, Kejriwal had resigned from the post on "Feb 14" last year, after serving the government for 49 days in his previous tenure.
