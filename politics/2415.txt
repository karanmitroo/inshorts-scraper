Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday said Congress and other Opposition parties should stop banging their heads over the faulty EVM issue and accept defeat. The Opposition should introspect as to why they lost instead of crying foul over the EVMs, he added. Earlier, the Election Commission threw an open challenge to prove that EVMs could be tampered with.
