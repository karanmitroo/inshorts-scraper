CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has moved a privilege motion against HRD Minister Smriti Irani in the Rajya Sabha for making "baseless allegations" against him on the Hindu Goddess Durga issue. Yechury said he was being â€œinundated with phone calls and messages full of profanity, obscenity and threats" due to the allegations levelled against him by Irani on February 26.
