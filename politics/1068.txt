The Congress on Friday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for wearing Italian glasses at the Kedarnath shrine, saying he promised to develop a 'New India' through those Italian glasses. "He spoke with arrogance at baba's shrine," Congress spokesperson RPN Singh said, adding that this was the first time somebody gave a speech with his back towards the shrine.
