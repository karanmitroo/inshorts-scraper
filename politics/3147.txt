Expelled Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh on Tuesday alleged that the feud in the party's first family was a "programmed drama", in which all of them were given a role. "I subsequently realised that we are being used... I came to realise it was a ploy to distract from the anti-incumbency, law and order situation," he added.
