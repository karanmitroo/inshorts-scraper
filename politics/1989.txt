Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has advised BJP MLAs in the state to be patient and polite over the phone as their conversations could be recorded and later misused on social media. "The CM has asked us to prefer meeting people over any issue in person and minimise conversations over the phone," said one of the MLAs.
