Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes all Indian citizens are thieves. Terming demonetisation as a "Modi-made disaster", Gandhi said that the basic concept of the Indian economy is "all cash is not black and all black is not cash". He slammed the government for not listening to the pain of the people.
