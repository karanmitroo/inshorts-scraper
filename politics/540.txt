Eight MLAs from Meghalaya, including five from the ruling Congress, resigned from the state Assembly on Friday to reportedly join the National People's Party, a BJP ally. The strength of the Congress in the 60-member Assembly has now decreased to 24 from 29. Four of the five Congress MLAs were sacked from the state Cabinet by CM Mukul Sangma earlier.
