Campaigning for Congress in UP's Bijnor, party Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Monday imitated PM Narendra Modi and began his address with 'Mitron' — a word usually used by Modi while addressing his audience. "Mitron I’m destroying your hard-earned money and making it a piece of paper," he said. "Mitron you will never see a suit-boot thief in queues," he stated.
