Following Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel's resignation, #WhoWillBeNextPuppet was a top Indian Twitter trend on Wednesday. Users reacted to it with tweets like "Indian politics is all 'A puppeteer & its lots of puppets'" and "How does it matter? Puppets don't matter. Ask who will be the Next Puppeteer?" Another user's tweet read, "#WhoWillBeNextPuppet Hopefully not someone with a criminal background".
