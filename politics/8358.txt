As per BJP's expenditure for the Delhi assembly elections filed with the Election Commission (EC), â‚¹1.06 crore was spent on the "Selfie with Modi" campaign. The campaign allowed people to click selfies with a virtual image of Modi in various constituencies. The campaign was largely unsuccessful which is why the BJP reportedly decided against this virtual campaign in Bihar.
