West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday termed the central government's Union Budget as 'misleading' and 'full of jugglery of numbers and hollow words'. "A controversial Budget 2017 is clueless, useless, baseless, missionless, actionless, and heartless," Banerjee said. "No roadmap for the country or the future from a government that has lost all its credibility," she added.
