Aiming to provide an "alternative political vehicle", Swaraj Abhiyan leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan on Sunday announced launching a political party by October 2. Yadav, however, said that Swaraj Abhiyan will continue to function after the new party is formed. Yadav and Bhushan had formed the Swaraj Abhiyan after being sacked from AAP last year for alleged "anti-party" activities.
