Congress leader Manish Tewari on Saturday asked AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to release a list of ministers who were sacked by him for alleged "malfeasance and wrongdoings" during the last year. He asserted that several AAP ministers were facing serious criminal charges. Kejriwal had earlier demanded Congress President Sonia Gandhi's arrest over alleged involvement in the AgustaWestland chopper deal.
