Opposition parties on Sunday targeted the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government over an alleged molestation of a Belgian national by a taxi driver. Congress leader Sheila Dikshit claimed there was an increase in crimes against women in Delhi under the AAP government. Meanwhile, BJP leader Vijender Gupta alleged that the government has "gone back" on its promise to improve women's safety.
