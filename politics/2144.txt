CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said that Mamata Banerjee-led TMC is "feeding Muslim fundamentalism" and Amit Shah-led BJP is "fanning Hindu communalism". "Hate and communalism of both TMC and BJP are just a distraction from real problems that neither the state nor the Centre wants to tackle," he added.
