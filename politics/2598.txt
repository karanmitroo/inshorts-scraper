Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MP Jayadev Galla suggested in the Lok Sabha that "big currency notes can have expiry date so that we can have demonetisation from time to time." Galla added that ₹200 notes should be introduced and ₹2000 notes should be withdrawn. Galla also suggested that in order to motivate taxpayers, some facilities should be provided to them.
