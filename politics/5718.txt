Suspended AAP leader Sandeep Kumar’s wife on Sunday said that her husband is innocent and she stands by him. She further called the rape charges levelled against Kumar a ‘conspiracy’. Kumar had on Saturday surrendered before the police following a complaint filed by a woman who reportedly featured in the ‘objectionable’ CD with him.
