Aam Aadmi Party MLA, Rajesh Garg, has questioned party chief Arvind Kejriwal about the internal party democracy, and also on whether the former Delhi CM should have consulted people on conducting fresh polls in Delhi. He also batted for not conducting fresh polls in national capital as it would mean a loss of Rs 1,000 crore of public money.
