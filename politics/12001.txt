Claiming support of five legislators, expelled AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny Sunday threatened to pull down the Arvind Kejriwal-led government if his demands were not met within 48 hours. Flanked by JD(U) MLA Shoaib Iqbal and independent legislator Rambir Shokeen, Binny said he would also form a political front with two other AAP MLAs, who are in touch with him.
