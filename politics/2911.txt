Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Saturday said, "All the people who talk about 'Congress-free India' should take a look inside their heart. Congress resides in the soul of this country." He added, "The BJP is losing in Punjab and Goa CM from BJP has also lost from his seat, isn't this a hint at PM Narendra Modi's leadership?"
