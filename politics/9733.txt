After warning them to quit the Manjhi government, JD(U) on Tuesday suspended seven ministers of Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhiâ€™s camp from the party. This comes after Manjhi's expulsion from the party. Manjhi, having the support of 12 MLAs, largely relies on the support of BJP, which has not disclosed its stand yet.
