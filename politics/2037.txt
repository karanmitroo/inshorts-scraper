The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Wednesday expelled senior leader and prominent Muslim face Naseemuddin Siddiqui and his son Afzal Siddiqui from the party for carrying out anti-party activities. BSP General Secretary Satish Chandra Mishra claimed that Siddiqui has slaughterhouses and 'benami' properties in his name and he also took money during Assembly polls which resulted in the party's defeat.
