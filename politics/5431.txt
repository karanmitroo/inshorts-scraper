Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has called PM Narendra Modi and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval “war-mongers”. “This kind of strikes have taken place earlier also. The only difference is this chest-thumping and media sort of going overboard,” he said. His remark came after MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “Modi’s chest is not 56 inches but 100 inches now.”
