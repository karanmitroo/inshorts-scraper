Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit on Sunday said that China can destroy any nation for its selfish motives. His remarks came after Baloch Republican Party founder Brahamdagh Bugti alleged that military operations are being carried out in Balochistan to facilitate Chinese companies. International institutions and organisations should interfere in this matter, urged Dikshit.
