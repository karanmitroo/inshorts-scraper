Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday asked BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa "not to be under illusion" of becoming CM again and asserted that the Congress will retain power in the 2018 Assembly polls. This comes after Yeddyurappa recently said Siddaramaiah's three-year tenure had pushed Karnataka into "misery" and he would ensure that Siddaramaiah is the last Congress CM in Karnataka.
