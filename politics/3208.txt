BJP-backed Maharashtra MLC Prashant Paricharak has mocked jawans, which drew flak from the Opposition. "A soldier gets a telegram from his wife that she has delivered a baby. He distributes sweets...his colleagues ask him the reason behind it...He happily tells his wife has given a birth to a baby boy...but he hasn't visited home the whole year," Paricharak said.
