Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that there is an atmosphere of "total anarchy" in Uttar Pradesh. “Rape cases have increased by 161% under the present regime. In past 13 years, SP and BSP... both of them looted the state,” Singh added. He also said that "corruption has become institutional" in Uttar Pradesh and "rapes are committed on highways".
