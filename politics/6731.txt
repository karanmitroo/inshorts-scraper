The Election Commission has deferred the by-election to Arunachal Pradesh's Kanubari Assembly Constituency which was scheduled to be held on Monday. This comes after the Supreme Court on Thursday passed a stay order on the resignation matter of MLAs Gabriel Wangsu and Wanglam Sawin. Wangsu had alleged he was made to resign under duress and had sought the Governor's intervention.
