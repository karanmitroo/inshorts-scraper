Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Saturday said that he would resign if he lost majority on the floor of the state assembly. His statement comes after nine rebel Congress lawmakers revolted against him and supported the BJP's demand for a conscience vote on Friday. Further, a BJP delegation met Governor KK Paul, seeking a dismissal of the Congress government.
