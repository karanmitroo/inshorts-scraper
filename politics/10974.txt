Bodoland People's Front on Thursday snapped its eight-year-old alliance with Tarun Gogoi-led Congress govt in Assam, amid indications that it was planning to join hands with BJP. In the 126-member Assam assembly, BPF has a strength of 12 and one nominee in the Gogoi cabinet. However, it's departure will not pose any threat to the Congress government.
