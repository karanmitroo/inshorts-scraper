An editorial in Shiv Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Tuesday said that senior BJP leaders have made Prime Minister Narendra Modi a 'God' by issuing statements calling him god's 'avtar'. "A Ram Temple may not be constructed in Ayodhya but there will be 'shlokas' chanted in the name of this new God," the editorial further said.
