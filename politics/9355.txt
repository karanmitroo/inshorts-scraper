CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday ruled out any alliance with the Congress but said his party will cooperate with the Congress on issues in the Parliament. The veteran Left leader further alleged that the Modi government was "patronising a hardcore Hindutva agenda" and sought co-operation of all "secular" opposition parties to fight against the Centre's economic policies.
