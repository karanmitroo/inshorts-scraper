Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday called the JD(U)-led government in Bihar "a government of rapes and murders," and said that the law and order situation would not improve as long as Nitish Kumar remains Chief Minister. Paswan said, "The entire law and order has deteriorated," and claimed no one would be punished in the Gaya road rage incident.
