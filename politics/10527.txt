In a move to end ‘minority politics’, the Aam Aadmi Party launched its ‘minority cell’ on Saturday. The party asserted that the aim behind this move is to connect with the minority groups based on “issues” and not merely to serve as a “votebank.” Former JD(U) leader Irfan Ullah Khan was made the president of the party’s minority cell.
