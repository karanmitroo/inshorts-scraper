In controversial comments, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi has said that Muslims who do not vote for his party are not "true Muslims". "A Muslim, who does not vote for SP and talks against it is not a Muslim. His DNA test should be conducted. See whether he is from RSS," he said while addressing an election rally.
