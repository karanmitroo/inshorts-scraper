Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi has slammed the media for reporting 'every' rape case in the country. "The press after the 2012 (Nirbhaya) incident has adopted a zero-tolerance policy. In other countries, press doesn't report rape and molestation anymore. Our press reports every incident. So it is on top of the mind," Maneka said.
