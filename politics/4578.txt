Citing a report in medical journal The Lancet, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday tweeted, "The whole world is appreciating mohalla clinics, but the BJP has stopped construction of more mohalla clinics through L-G". Kejriwal had earlier alleged that his government had set a target of 1,000 new mohalla clinics by December 31, but the L-G had stalled the file.
