Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has slammed the BJP for claiming that the Income Tax raids on Energy Minister Shivakumar were a fight against corruption. He alleged that a number of BJP leaders were facing graft charges. "I am not against raids but look at their timing and the use of central forces for it, which undermines federal structure," he added.
