Addressing BJP party workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged them to market the schemes of the government. "We need to aggressively campaign the work done by the government. We need to utilize the impact of social media," he said. Modi also said the suggestions of the workers should be taken seriously and they should not be annoyed.
