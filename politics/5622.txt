Congress MLA John Kumar on Thursday quit his post to pave way for Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanaswamy to seek re-election from Nellithope Assembly constituency and become an elected member. Narayanaswamy is currently not an MLA in Puducherry. According to the Indian Constitution, a non-member has to get elected within six months of becoming a minister.
