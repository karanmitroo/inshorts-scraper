Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said that Congress "was open to alliance with like-minded parties" for the Assembly polls in Punjab in 2017. "Bihar experiment had proved to be very successful and there was no harm in trying a similar arrangement here", he added. Currently, BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) coalition is in power in Punjab.
