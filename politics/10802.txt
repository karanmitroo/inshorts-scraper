The Aam Aadmi Party hit back leader Shanti Bhushan for calling Arvind Kejriwal 'incompetent' and calling the party non-democratic. The party said that it does not agree with his statement and that the criticism is misplaced. It also said that 'the biggest example of internal democracy is the party's decision to contest Lok Sabha elections...despite opposition from...Arvind Kejriwal'.
