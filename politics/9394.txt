Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy will be fighting Asaram Bapu's case in the court, he said after a meeting with the self-styled godman in Jodhpur Central Jail. "Bail is a fundamental right of Asaram and he would soon file a bail application in the lower court," he said. Asaram had earlier said "Swamy would do something in my case."
