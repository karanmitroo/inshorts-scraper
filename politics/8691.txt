Defying the ban on the sale of meat imposed in Mumbai during the 'Paryushan' festival, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Sunday put up a non-veg food stall outside the Jain-dominated 'Jai housing society'. They displayed banners reading, "Yes, we will eat non-veg". MNS Chief Raj Thackeray had on Thursday offered support to those willing to sell meat in Maharashtra.
