Veteran journalist and former BJP minister Arun Shourie said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a "narcissist" who is running a one-man "presidential government", which is "dangerous" for India. He added the PM treats people like "paper napkins" and is "remorseless"â€‹. However, Shourie also said that under the Modi government, corruption at the Centre has diminished, but cited instances in states.
