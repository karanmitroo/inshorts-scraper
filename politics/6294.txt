A Shiv Sena spokesperson on Tuesday said that the party is "hurt" at being excluded by BJP from the Union Cabinet expansion. "We will keep in mind the treatment meted out to us by our ally in numerous local body polls", she added. Earlier, Sena President Uddhav Thackeray declared his party would not "beg" for cabinet berths.
