An RTI query has revealed that Madhya Pradesh government had appointed Sushma Swaraj's husband and daughter as government lawyers in 2009 and 2013, respectively. Meanwhile, Congress has hit out at CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan for allegedly "obliging the BJP Central leadership". The state BJP has, however, denied any wrongdoing and said the appointments were done on the basis of merit.
