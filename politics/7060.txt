AAP on Wednesday called the BJP "anti-Dalit" over renaming Gurgaon and questioned if the party approved Guru Dronacharya's act of asking "Dalit and Adivasi" pupil Eklavya's thumb. BJP changed the name to "honour Dronacharya", but it "does not remember Eklavya", party added. According to legend, Gurgaon derived its name from Guru Dronacharya, the master of archery in Mahabharata.
