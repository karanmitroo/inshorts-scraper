Addressing a gathering in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday said that Lord Krishna has more followers than Lord Ram. "It's true that we consider Lord Ram as our idol, but we have to accept that Lord Krishna is worshipped across India and abroad and Lord Ram is revered only in North India," he added.
