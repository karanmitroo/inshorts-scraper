PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday said that her party will ask the Centre to grant passport to separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani on 'humanitarian' grounds to allow him to visit his ailing daughter in Saudi Arabia. She also cited names of some other separatist leaders, including Shabir Shah, saying if they can visit foreign countries then why not Geelani.
