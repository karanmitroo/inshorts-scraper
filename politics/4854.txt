West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said "interim small changes" will not work as they are not the solution for problems created by note ban. Banerjee was referring to government's announcement of an exemption list. Adding that the list has nothing for the agricultural, cooperative or unorganised sector, she added that vast sections of society have been left out.
