During a Municipal Corporation Delhi meeting on Thursday, BJP councillor Neeraj Gupta slapped his AAP counterpart, Rakesh Kumar, for allegedly wearing his party's cap. While the BJP has claimed the scuffle happened after Kumar hurled abuses, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter and called the BJP a 'party of gundas'. "Rakesh is Dalit. BJP is assaulting Dalits," Kejriwal added.
