The central government on Thursday dismissed the suggestion for State funding of elections, saying it is not practical in the Indian context. FM Arun Jaitley said, "We don't want an argument where people have problem with every solution. And that's the tragedy of political funding in India. Whichever solution you suggest, people will suggest the problem arising out of that."
