The Himachal Pradesh HC on Thursday barred the CBI from arresting CM Virbhadra Singh in an alleged disproportionate assets case. The HC said the CBI may continue conducting proceedings against him. Singh had filed a petition pursuing the retraction of the FIR filed against him for amassing wealth worth Rs 6.1 crore during his tenure as Union Minister of Steel.
