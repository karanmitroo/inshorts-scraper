Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Working President MK Stalin on Wednesday said that PM Narendra Modi's visit to his father and ailing DMK leader Karunanidhi was not political but on humanitarian grounds. Dismissing reports that DMK deferred anti-demonetisation protests post PM Modi's visit, Stalin said 'black-day' protests were cancelled in eight districts in the state only due to rains.
