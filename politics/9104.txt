Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said that he is ready to probe corruption charges against his minister Pankaja Munde if the Opposition gives him evidence of violation of norms. Munde is allegedly involved in a Rs 206 crore scam in the purchase of items such as chikki, mats and books provided to children under a government scheme.
