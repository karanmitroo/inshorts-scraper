AAP MP Bhagwant Mann has been suspended from attending the remaining period of the Lok Sabha's ongoing Winter Session for video-recording Parliament's security structure and uploading it on social media. The decision was made by a 9-member committee, headed by BJP Lok Sabha MP Kirit Somaiya, probing the incident. The committee found Mann guilty of breaching the security of Parliament.
