Sources in Tamil Nadu's ex-CM J Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence claim that they hear "strange voices that sound like wails" every night. Sasikala's nephew Dinakaran's family also reportedly decided to leave because of the strange voices. "Once, there was another relative of Sasikala who used Jayalalithaa's room...and on that night too, we heard these noises," an employee said.
