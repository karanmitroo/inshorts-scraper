Janata Dal (United) leader KC Tyagi on Wednesday said the attack on African nationals pointed toward "an international jungle raj" in Delhi. Tyagi added, "We have relations with Africans since the age of Gandhi and the clouds of uncertainty are looming over these relations". His comments come after a Congolese national was beaten to death in Delhi.
