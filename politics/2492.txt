Following the "brutal and senseless attack" by cow vigilantes in Rajasthan's Alwar, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday attacked the state government over the "shocking breakdown" of law and order. "When government...allows lynch mobs to rule, tragedies of immense proportion happen," Gandhi added. He said that he hoped that the government would take stern action against those responsible.
