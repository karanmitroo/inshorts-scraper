Sensing confrontation with the union government, the AAP government in Delhi decided not to table Jan Lokpal Bill in Vidhan Sabha Thursday. CM Arvind Kejriwal's office had said the bill would be circulated among MLAs Thursday. Government is planning to make MLAs vote if they agree the Bill should be tabled and it could be tabled in the legislature Friday.
