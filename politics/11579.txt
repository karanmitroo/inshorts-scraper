BJP's plans to release its manifesto on Apr-7 could badly misfire as the electronic media cannot cover its release as per election law. The timing of the release falls within the 48-hour period prior to polling when public display of any election matter is banned. The only option for BJP is to release the manifesto by 5 pm on Apr-5.
