The West Bengal government has replaced the traditional name for rainbow in Bengali 'Ramdhenu' (means Lord Ramâ€™s bow) with 'Rongdhenu' (means bow of colours). Notably, Bangladesh had long replaced the word 'Ramdhenu' with 'Rongdhenu'. "There's no word in  Bengali dictionary as 'Rongdhenu'. It's Ramdhenu. A correct word shouldn't be replaced with a wrong one in our textbooks," a linguist said.
