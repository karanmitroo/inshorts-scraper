Taking a dig at the BJP a day ahead of the second phase of Gujarat Assembly polls, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav tweeted, "Kamal ka phool always banaving April fool." He further urged the electorate to stay calm and vote wisely. He had earlier tweeted, "Where is vikaswa? Someone find it," suggesting that BJP's Gujarat model of development had failed.
