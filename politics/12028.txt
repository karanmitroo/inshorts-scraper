A spoof video of Rahul Gandhi's much talked-about AICC speech was removed four days after it was uploaded on YouTube due to a copyright issue. Rohit Iyengar, an 18-year-old film student from Illinois who had created and uploaded the video, says by that time it had amassed 229,319 views. Iyengar later apologized to Rahul by releasing another video.
