Referring to scrapping of the Planning Commission, former PM Manmohan Singh has said that the country's economic policy has "no sense of direction." He further added that the commission was a "positive dynamic instrument of steering the country's economy". He said this while speaking at a function organised by the Indian Youth Congress on ex-PM Indira Gandhi's 98th birth anniversary.
