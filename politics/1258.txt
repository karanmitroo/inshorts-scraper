Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that the performance of India and China will determine fundamental shaping of the world. "There are two large migrations taking place - one is completely free and the other is centrally controlled... It's not my place to say that China should be democratic or not. They have chosen their path," Rahul added.
