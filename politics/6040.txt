Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson IP Singh on Wednesday said that Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan will realise the seriousness of the Bulandshahr gangrape incident if his own “daughter and wife are gangraped”. The comment comes after Khan earlier called the incident a political conspiracy by the opposition to defame the Uttar Pradesh government.
