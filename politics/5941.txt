In his Independence Day message, Congress VP Rahul Gandhi on Monday said “freedom can never be for the few” and that Indians are aspiring for a country where “ideas... are not crushed violently by... hate and mediocrity”. Unfurling the national flag at the AICC headquarters, Gandhi added that Indians are celebrating freedom from “inequality and prejudice”, which should be 'dutifully defended'.
