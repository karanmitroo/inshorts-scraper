Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will start a countrywide foot march from Vidarbha in Maharashtra by the end of this month, to protest against the Modi government's land bill. According to Congress media managers, Rahul will travel 15-18 km every day to highlight the issues faced by farmers. This comes after his farmers' offensive in the wake of recent crop loss.
