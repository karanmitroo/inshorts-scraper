The Election Commission on Sunday decided to further postpone the Assembly elections in two Tamil Nadu constituencies to ascertain whether polls can be allowed in the "vitiated atmosphere". The poll panel had earlier deferred polling in Aravakurichi and Thanjavur assembly seats citing evidence of use of money power. Polling will now be held on June 13 instead of May 23.
