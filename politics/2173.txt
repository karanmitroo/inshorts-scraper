The Madhya Pradesh government has made photos of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan mandatory in all state government offices and buildings. In a similar order issued earlier this year, the state government had directed that photos of the Prime Minister and President should be mandatorily put on the walls in all government offices and buildings.
