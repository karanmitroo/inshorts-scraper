RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav on Thursday invited former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi to unitedly fight against the BJP. "We are for broader unity of parties against BJP in which everybody, including Manjhi, shall come forward," Yadav said. However, responding negatively to Yadav's invitation, the JD(U) said, "Manjhi is not in the work list of Janata Party unity process."
