Former Miss India Gul Panag Thursday joined AAP and will be its Lok Sabha candidate from Chandigarh, where she was born. Panag said that India is at the threshold of transformational change, by AAP. "I cannot sit as neutral and be a fence watcher...to bring change in the country one need to jump into the political battle field," Panag said.
