RSS ideologue MG Vaidya on Sunday called Nathuram Godse a "murderer" and criticised organisations commemorating his death anniversary as "Shaurya Diwas" or bravery day. Vaidya said, “Some people think that by doing so (killing Gandhi), they have encouraged Hindutva, but that is wrong. In fact, they have insulted Hindutva. I think it was an evil to kill Gandhiji”.
