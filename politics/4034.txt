AIADMK spokesperson V Maitreyan on Monday said it was up to party chief Sasikala Natarajan to decide when she wanted to take over as Tamil Nadu CM. Notably, it has been a party tradition that the General Secretary serves as the CM when the party is in power. Maitreyan also praised late CM Jayalalithaa calling her an epitome of nationalism.
