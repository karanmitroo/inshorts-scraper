Shiv Sena on Wednesday took a jibe at PM Narendra Modi in its mouthpiece Saamana, sarcastically saying, "One man is taking so much trouble to take away the pains of common man." Sena added, "In the middle of this, he is on foreign tours and finishing off pending work and then coming back to solve the problems of common man."
