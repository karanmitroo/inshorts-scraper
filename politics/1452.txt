Goa Congress President Shantaram Naik on Saturday alleged that when CM Manohar Parrikar was serving as Defence Minister, he did not know about the surgical strikes against Pakistan till they happened. Claiming that the strikes were orchestrated by the Prime Minister's Office and the National Security Advisor, Naik added, "Parrikar quit the central ministry because he could not handle pressure."
