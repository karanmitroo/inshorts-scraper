The Tibetan government-in-exile has cancelled an event in Delhi which was to be attended by the Dalai Lama to commemorate his 60-year exile in India. This comes after India asked its officials to keep away from events organised by Tibetan leaders as it is a "sensitive time" for relations with China. The Tibetan government shifted another event to Dharamshala.
