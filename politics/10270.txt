In a controversial statement, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai Sunday claimed that the Taj Mahal was a part of an ancient temple. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan "purchased a part of Tejo Mahalaya temple's land from Raja Jai Singh", Bajpai added, and further claimed that documents to prove it still exist.
