The Maharashtra government had spent â‚¹8 crore from Contingency Fund to meet publicity expenses of PM Narendra Modi's programmes organised to inaugurate various projects. Notably, Contingency Fund is a reserve of money kept for unforeseen future expenses. The PWD stated that the amount was withdrawn from Contingency Fund since the expenditure was of an "urgent nature".
