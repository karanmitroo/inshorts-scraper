The JDU is planning to get Nitish Kumar back as Bihar CM and fight the coming assembly elections under his leadership. JDU president Sharad Yadav is in talks with present CM Jitan Ram Manjhi to convince him to step down. The step is being taken after the approval of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, who recently extended support to JDU.
