Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday alleged that there is "clear and irrefutable evidence of manipulation" of EVMs at polling booths in the Punjab Assembly elections. The party has appealed to the Election Commission to cross-verify the results of all polling booths where voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines were deployed with the paper trail.
