Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Thursday said that the disruptions in the Parliament's Winter Session, majorly over the Centre's demonetisation move, are pre-planned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Further, reacting to senior BJP leader LK Advani's "I feel like quitting Parliament over disruptions" remark, Singhvi said, "The anger of Advaniji is 100% right and against his party."
