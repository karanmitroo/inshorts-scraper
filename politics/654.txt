The Congress has alleged that PM Narendra Modi violated poll code by holding a 'roadshow' after casting his vote in Ahmedabad on Thursday. The party claimed the Election Commission was working "under pressure from PM and Prime Minister's Office". Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala called the EC a "captive puppet of the PM" which has turned into "BJP's frontal organisation".
