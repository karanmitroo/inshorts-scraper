Congress President Rahul Gandhi was seated in the front row of the Central Hall in the Parliament during the President's address on Tuesday. This comes after Congress had criticised the government for giving the party President a seat in the sixth row for the Republic Day parade. Former Congress President Sonia Gandhi was seated in the first row.
