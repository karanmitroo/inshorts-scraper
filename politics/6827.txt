A debate on the state of education in the country that took place in the Rajya Sabha last Thursday was attended by 37 out of the total 245 MPs. "Today when education is being discussed, the entire House is empty. Yesterday when (political) football (over AgustaWestland) was being played, the House was full," said Samajwadi Party MP Neeraj Shekhar.
