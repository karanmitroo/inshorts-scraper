The Lok Sabha worked only for 4.5 hours (6% of the total time) in the just-concluded winter session, making it the worst session since 2010 in terms of performance, says data collated by PRS Legislative Research. The only highlight of the session is the passing of the Lokpal and Lokayukta bill by both houses of the Parliament.
