Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Thursday asked BJP MP Yogi Adityanath to offer Namaz in order to set his mind on the right track. His comment came a day after Adityanath said that Namaz was nothing but a form of Yoga. "[S]ince he wants to use force to adopt any exercise, I'm forced to express my opinion," Azam said.
