HRD Minister Smriti Irani and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi Tuesday indulged in a war of words over the Amethi food park. "Rahul is raising food park issue to lobby for corporates... Why hasn't Rahul developed Amethi all this while?", Irani, who was in Amethi, said. "I hope Smriti ensures Amethi's food park is set up," Rahul said, challenging Irani.
