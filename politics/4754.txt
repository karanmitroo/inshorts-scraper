Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday asked PM Narendra Modi to form an independent committee of "big people" to probe the bank accounts of all MPs and MLAs from all political parties. Proposing that all politicians' accounts over the last five years be checked, Kejriwal added that BJP should also reveal its land purchase details from four months before demonetisation.
