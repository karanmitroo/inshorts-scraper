Three small parties of the Shiv Sena-BJP led Mahayuti (alliance) – SSS, Shiv Sangram and RSP – on Wednesday threatened to quit the alliance and form a parallel alliance. They said the decision of the Sena-BJP to reduce their share considerably from the original 18 was a betrayal. However, smaller allies later softened and said they would be satisfied with 14 seats.
