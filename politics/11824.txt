Ahead of the LS polls, anti-nuclear activist SP Udayakumar with his around 500 supporters on Friday joined Aam Aadmi Party in Tamil Nadu. The activists, who spearhead protests against the Kundakulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP), reportedly decided to take up the political route to continue the anti-nuclear struggle as both Congress and BJP were very much in favour of KNPP.
