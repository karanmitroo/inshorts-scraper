Claiming that the NDA govt would not stop the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) scheme, started by the Congress, PM Narendra Modi Friday called the scheme 'a living example and reminder of UPA's failures'. Reacting to Modi's statement, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, "Speeches don't fill stomachs... Making fun of it (MNREGA scheme) isn't in good humour."
