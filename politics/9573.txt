The upper house of the parliament was Tuesday adjourned amid an uproar created by the Congress over BJP leader Subramanian Swamyâ€™s remarks on demolishing mosques. The Congress members moved into aisle shouting slogans against the BJP-led government. Slamming Swamy's controversial remarks made recently in Assam, Congress leader Pramod Tewari said, "Secularism is the foundation of Indian democracy."
