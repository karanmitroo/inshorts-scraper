Bikram Singh Majithia, Revenue and PR Minister (Punjab) has provoked outrage from Sikh clerics after he incorporated the name of BJP’s Amritsar candidate Arun Jaitley in a hymn by Guru Gobind Singh. The clerics have indicated that Majithia may be summoned to the Akal Takht. Majithia on Saturday submitted them an apology and also sought forgiveness with “folded hands”.
