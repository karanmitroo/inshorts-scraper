Diesel taxi drivers on Sunday protested outside the residence of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and held a rally at Jantar Mantar. The rally was addressed by Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, who said, "Delhi government has failed to effectively apprise the SC of the matter." Notably, the Supreme Court recently banned diesel taxis in Delhi.
