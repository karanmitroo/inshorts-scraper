After the NIA dropped all charges against Sadhvi Pragya in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, the BJP on Friday said that she was framed and blamed the then UPA government for the same. "There was nothing against her (Pragya). There was conspiracy over Malegaon... People associated with politics worked against the country's interest," BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said.
