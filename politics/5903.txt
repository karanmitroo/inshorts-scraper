BJP MLA and ex-Madhya Pradesh minister Babulal Gaur on Monday raised a Congress flag during an event organised by Congress MLA Arif Aqueel to celebrate the Independence Day. I was invited as a guest and on realising that it was a Congress' flag, I returned it, he clarified. Gaur had resigned in June from the state Cabinet citing party orders.
