Election Commission has detected instances of "paid-news" in favour of Madhya Pradesh Law Minister Narottam Mishra in the run-up to the Assembly election for which Rs 42,000 have been added to his poll expenses. Mishra is already contesting 'paid news' charges after the EC in Delhi had issued him notices in this regard for the Assembly polls of 2008.
