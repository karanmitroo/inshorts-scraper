Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Monday raised doubts over the escape of eight SIMI members from Bhopal prison, terming it as "conspiracy" and sought a detailed investigation in the matter. It demands probe and administration should be ready to avert riots, he stated. “I had requested the then NDA government to ban both SIMI and Bajrang Dal,” he added.
