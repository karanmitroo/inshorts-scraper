Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Monday said that he would raise the rising communal violence cases at the UN. His statement comes days after a Muslim man was lynched in Dadri for allegedly eating beef. "The RSS and BJP must tell the nation what they expect to do with Muslims who form 18% of the overall population," Khan added.
