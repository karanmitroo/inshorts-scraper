BJP leader and Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde on Wednesday said Congress President Rahul Gandhi's visit to poll-bound Karnataka was good entertainment. He added that his visits will also help the BJP grow stronger in the state. Calling Gandhi and Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah "kota (fake) hindutvavadis", Hegde said he was happy they have at least started remembering they are Hindus.
