Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday termed the Assembly results as "the last rites of the Congress as a political party". "The final rituals of the last rites would be performed next year when Punjab goes to polls," he added. Badal further said these results have "exploded the myth" of incumbency being a negative factor for parties.
