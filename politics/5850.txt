Congress on Tuesday slammed Arvind Kejriwal over his visits to poll-bound Goa, saying that he is professing "an artificial love" for the state. The party accused him of planning to ‘loot and eradicate’ the identity of Goans for "political gains". Notably, Kejriwal recently said that Congress will not win even a single seat in the 2017 Goa assembly elections.
