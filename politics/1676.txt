Nagaland CM Shurhozelie Liezietsu and nine other ruling legislators didn't turn up for the floor test on Wednesday, following which the assembly speaker adjourned the house. Ex-CM TR Zeliang had staked claim to power saying he had the support of 47 legislators in the 60-member assembly. CM Liezietsu's petition challenging the floor test was dismissed by the Gauhati high court.
