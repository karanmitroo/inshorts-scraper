Congress leader Anand Sharma has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre government of favouring diamond firms instead of Public-Sector Units (PSUs) in getting foreign deals. He further alleged that the government had cut out PSU's like Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation of India and Hindustan Diamond in 2015 at a time when diamond purchase pacts were being inked with Russia.
