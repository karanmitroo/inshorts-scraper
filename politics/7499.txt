A complaint was filed against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and three others in Ludhiana for creating "communal tensions" and 'encouraging terrorism' in Punjab. It was filed on the basis of a poster that surfaced before the birth anniversary of Khalistani militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. The poster, featuring Kejriwal, was seen encouraging people to pay obeisance to 'saint' Bhindranwale.
