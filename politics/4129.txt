Opposition parties including Congress, SP and BSP have alleged that an early budget is an undue advantage for BJP, as it would give it a chance to appease voters before polls, reports said. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday dismissed the allegations and asserted that even in 2014, the budget was preponed and there is no requirement of a delay.
