Over 500 members of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) including state spokesperson Manhar Patel quit the party and joined Congress on Sunday. The members were reportedly miffed by two NCP MLAs who voted for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections held last month. "It feels as if younger brother has returned after long," Congress state unit President Bharat Solanki said.
