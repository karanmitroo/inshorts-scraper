Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said he will not resign, even as he has been accused of accepting a â‚¹1.90 crore bribe by solar scam accused Saritha Nair. Chandy said, "The bar hotel owners who lost their case in the Supreme Court are behind the allegations. They want to dethrone the government as its liquor policy had affected their business."
