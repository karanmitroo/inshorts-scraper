The Election Commission on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct at a Trinamool Congress rally in Asansol. Mamata, reacting to the notice, said the people of Bengal will 'show-cause' the Election Commission on May 19 for issuing the notice against her on the Bengali New Year.
