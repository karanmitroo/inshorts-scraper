Continuing its 'ghar wapasi' drive, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad Thursday 're-converted' 59 people in Kerala's Kottayam district. While one family was Muslim, all others were Christians. The government has distanced itself from such events. Criticizing the conversions, Congress leader Rashi Alvi said, "The silence of PM on VHP's conversion activities implies that he is also responsible in some way".
