After being wiped out in Delhi polls, Congress Tuesday said it was working to 'reinvent' itself. It further promised to revisit its "idealogical construct". Party chief Sonia Gandhi and vice president Rahul Gandhi congratulated Arvind Kejriwal and AAP for their landslide victory saying they "respect" the verdict. Defending Rahul, Ajay Maken, said that the election was fought on local issues.
