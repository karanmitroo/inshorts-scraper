The BJP on Friday referred to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi as the "spoiled child of Indian politics" as well as "India's most prominent mislead". According to media reports, party spokesperson MJ Akbar said the Congress was "behaving with complete irresponsibility", and residing in a "world of foolishness" by expecting to deceive the public on Rahul Gandhi's visits abroad.
