Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday showed his torn kurta that he was wearing to the crowd at a rally in poll-bound Uttarakhand. "I am doing politics for the poor. PM Narendra Modi's photo appears with the super rich," Rahul said. "See, I wear torn kurta. You'll never find Modiji wearing a torn kurta," Gandhi added.
