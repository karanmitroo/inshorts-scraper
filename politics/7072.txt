Vijayakanth-led DMDK (Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam) split into two parties on Sunday. The new outfit PDMDK (People Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam) was launched by the party functionaries who had earlier been expelled by Vijayakanth over their opposition to his decision of aligning with People's Welfare Front (PWF) for Tamil Nadu's Assembly polls. PDMDK will be headed by MLA VC Chandrakumar.
