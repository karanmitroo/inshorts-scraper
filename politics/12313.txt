While addressing the ET Awards function on Saturday, finance minister P Chidambaram said India couldn't achieve sustainable growth unless powers of the executive to govern are restored. "Governance cannot be taken away from executive. Parliament must make laws to support executive decisions. Judicial institutions cannot take over governance," he said. He stressed on the balance between legislature, executive and Judiciary.
