The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has offered former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan one of its three seats in the Rajya Sabha, according to reports. The party is entitled to three seats in the Rajya Sabha on account of its victory in the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections. It is reportedly considering professionals and "outsiders" for all three positions.
