Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh has claimed that his party's electoral contest is with the AAP and the ruling Akalis are nowhere in the picture. "Our internal survey suggests that AAP is on number two," said the former Punjab CM. Earlier, Amarinder had said that Akalis won't cross 20 seats, adding, "How about a bet?".
