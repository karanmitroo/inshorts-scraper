PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said on Thursday that Article 370, which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, cannot be touched. Earlier, PDP's coalition partner BJP had agreed to maintain status quo on Article 370. On being asked whether PDP had diluted its stand on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, she said there was no “climb-up or climb-down.”
