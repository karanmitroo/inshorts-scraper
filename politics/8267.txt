Following the death of two people during a protest march held against the Tipu Sultan Jayanti celebrations in Karnataka, the BJP on Thursday asked Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to resign. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra also took a jibe at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi saying if the latter will now care to lead a march and demand Siddaramaiah's resignation.
