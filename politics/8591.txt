Hardik Patel, the face of the Patel agitation, reportedly said on Friday, “If you have so much courage then go and kill a couple of policemen. Patels never commit suicide.” This was in response to one Vipul Desai who said he would kill himself to support the agitation. However, Patel, who visited Desai's house, denied making any such statement.
