UP Congress campaign committee Chairman Sanjay Singh on Saturday said Priyanka Gandhi has not given her consent to campaign in Uttar Pradesh yet. "And when she gives her consent, we'll let everyone know the plan," he added. This comes a day after Congress announced that Priyanka will play a "major role" in the upcoming UP elections.
