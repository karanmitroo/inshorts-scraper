Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asserted that PM Narendra Modi should have taken former PM Manmohan Singh's advice over demonetisation of high-value currency notes as Singh is an eminent economist. Slamming PM Modi for getting emotional during his speeches, Thackeray added that Modi should rather have made more efforts to wipe the tears of the general people.
