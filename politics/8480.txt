The BJP on Friday distanced itself from Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's remarks that Muslims must quit eating beef to live in India. â€œThe views expressed by Khattar are not that of the party. I will talk to him", Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said. "It is not correct to link eating habits to religion", he added.
