Rahul Gandhi "can take credit for the passage of GST and other bills if he lets Parliament function", BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said today. He was reacting to Congress leaders crediting party Vice President Rahul Gandhi for the government's rollback of the proposal to tax EPF withdrawals. Backing Gandhi, the Congress reportedly even started trending the hashtag #RGforcesEPFtaxWapsi.
