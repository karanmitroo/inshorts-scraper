Responding to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's remarks that PM Narendra Modi was dividing the country on religious lines, BJP said he was suffering from "attention seeking disorder". "It is a shameful statement. He does it for a good TRP," BJP's Shrikant Sharma said. None other than Congress knows it better to "divide the country on religious lines," he added.
