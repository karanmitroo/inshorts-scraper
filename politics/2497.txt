Supporting the Supreme Court's observations on the Ayodhya dispute, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said, "Both the sides should re-establish dialogue and resolve the matter." He added, "As the government is not party to it, so the two parties in contention should have a dialogue... If any help of the state government is needed, we are ready to provide that."
