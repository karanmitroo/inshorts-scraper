Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said BSP Chief Mayawati is distressed due to increasing support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi post demonetisation. "We can understand Behenji's (Mayawati) pain. A new kind of economic initiative was taken under demonetisation due to which people's faith has increased... There is a sense of fear and panic in the opposition camp," Pradhan said.
