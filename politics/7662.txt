All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen President Asaduddin Owaisi claimed on Sunday that minorities and Dalits continue to remain backward as they are exploited as only vote banks. "We have to wake up now and we can uplift ourselves by electing from our own", he said. This reportedly is a part of Owaisi's attack on Samajwadi Party and other opponents in UP.
