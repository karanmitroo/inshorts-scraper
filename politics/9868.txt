AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Tuesday that his party will move the Supreme Court, seeking an SIT probe into the funding of Congress, BJP and that of its own. The party also said that it was ready to face any action if found guilty. The AAPâ€™s decision came after it faced with allegations of receiving funds from "dubious" companies.
