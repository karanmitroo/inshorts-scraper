TMC MPs on Friday protested against the Centre in the Parliament House complex, alleging it was indulging in "vendetta politics" in a probe into a chit fund scam. They raised slogans against the Centre saying that it was harassing TMC leaders because the political party raised its voice against demonetisation. TMC also staged a walkout from Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
