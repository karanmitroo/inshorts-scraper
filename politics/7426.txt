Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the CBI issued an informal summons to his staff, in relation to the Delhi Secretariat raid of December 2015. His staff were summoned without a notice, Kejriwal tweeted. Meanwhile, a CBI official has said that Kejriwal is politicising a routine process, as officials have been asked to depose earlier as well.
