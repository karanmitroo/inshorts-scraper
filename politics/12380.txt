Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mamata Banerjee has promised to extend her full support to YSR Congress president Jaganmohan Reddy, when he opposes the Telangana reorganization Bill that is likely to be tabled in the Parliament in winter session. After TMC's support, which has 19 Lok Sabha MPs, the number of MPs voting against the formation of Telangana would become 44.
