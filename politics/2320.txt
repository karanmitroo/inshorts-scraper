PM Narendra Modi on Monday said the Centre has fixed prices for as many as 700 medicines to ensure that poor people can afford it. "This will break the monopoly of big medicine outlets," Modi said. "I wish no one requires hospitalisation, but if the need arises, may he be cured completely" and not visit a hospital again, he added.
