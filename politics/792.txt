Taking a dig at the Congress, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, "BJP has always been seen as a pro-Hindutva party so if an original is available why one would prefer a clone?" Speaking in Gujarat's Surat ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, Jaitley further said the Congress has started making excuses for their defeat even before the results are declared.
