Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday claimed that "Congress will not have many reasons to celebrate" when details of the "Panama Papers", showing alleged offshore assets of Indians, come out. Jaitley also asserted that the probe is being carried out in a "very impartial" manner and rejected demands from AAP and Congress that he should "recuse" himself from the matter.
