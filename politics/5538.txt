Expelled Bharatiya Janata Party leader Dayashankar Singh said that even a rickshaw puller is better than Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati. Singh added that a rickshaw puller does not strike a deal with anyone else once he has settled the fare with one passenger, alleging that Mayawati can do anything for money. Singh had earlier compared Mayawati to a prostitute.
