The Election Commission has directed the Chief Electoral Officer of Goa to file an FIR against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal over his remarks on bribery in Goa. Kejriwal had asked voters to take the money offered by Congress and BJP, but vote only for AAP, during a rally in Goa on January 8. He had repeated this in Punjab too.
