A special court has directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block internet links of the alleged 'objectionable' video featuring sacked AAP leader Sandeep Kumar and a woman. The Delhi Police in its plea had said the video clip harms the modesty of a woman. Meanwhile, Kumar's lawyer has denied the presence of his client in the video.
