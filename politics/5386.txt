Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Monday slammed the militants for targeting the Entrepreneurship Development Institute (EDI), saying they didn't want young Kashmiri boys and girls to stand on their feet. "No wonder for the second time this year they have attacked the institute. They want young Kashmiris to be subservient and bitter not self-reliant," he added.
