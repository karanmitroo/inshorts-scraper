Condemning attacks on Dalits in Gujarat, BJP veteran LK Advani on Monday demanded a probe into the incidents. Atrocities against Dalits shouldnâ€™t take place anywhere, he said. Advani, however, added that attacks on Dalits have been carried out since ages. His remarks came after the Congress alleged that the PM has time to talk on Balochistan, but not for Dalits.
