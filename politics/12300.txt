The newcomer Aam Aadmi Party, born out of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption agitation, today created history by winning 28 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly election. The election saw BJP emerging as the single largest party with 31 seats while Congress managed to get only eight seats. One seat each was secured by Janata Dal (U), Akali Dal and Independent.
