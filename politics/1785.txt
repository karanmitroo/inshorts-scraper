PM Narendra Modi referred to 25 June 1975, the day Emergency was imposed, as the "darkest day" in Indian history. He said that no Indian can forget the time when the nation "turned into a prison" and "press had become ineffective". Modi added that it will be "remembered for the way people of India came together and safeguarded democratic values".
