UP's Congress Committee on Wednesday suspended two office-bearers in Allahabad for putting up hoardings depicting Congress president Sonia Gandhi as ill. It also declared Rahul Gandhi as overburdened and urged Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to contest elections from the constituency of Phoolpur. The hoarding carried the pictures of the suspended leaders along with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.
