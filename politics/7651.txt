BJP President Amit Shah has demanded an apology from Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi for supporting the "anti-nationals" who led protests in JNU. He asked the Congress to clarify whether freedom of expression meant supporting the country's division. Supporting anti-national forces in the name of the Left's progressive ideology is not acceptable, Shah further said.
