A delegation of CPI(M) and JD(U) leaders on Monday met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, asking him to take action against organisations for allegedly using doctored videos of the  February 9 JNU event. The Delhi government had earlier ordered a forensic probe that found two of the videos showing 'anti-national' slogans being raised at the JNU campus to be "manipulated".
