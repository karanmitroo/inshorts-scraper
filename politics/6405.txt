BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday called for the abolition of Income Tax to boost economic growth and savings rate. â€œIf I am in the Government, I will do it within one week, if I am not... I will do it within three years," he claimed. Swamy also suggested nationalisation of funds stashed in tax havens to retrieve black money.
