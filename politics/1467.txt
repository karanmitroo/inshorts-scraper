A book written by former Delhi Chief Secretary Omesh Saigal says that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) can be manipulated. Saigal claims election results could be altered "if a pre-programmed code number was keyed" into the EVMs. He mentions that he had doubts about fairness of EVMs following 2009 Lok Sabha election which saw the return of Congress-led UPA to power.
