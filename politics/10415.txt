Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal Sunday said time has come for Narendra Modi-led government to make Chandigarh the capital of Punjab. Chandigarh is a joint capital of Punjab and Haryana since 1966. Badal said, "Since long Punjab has been the victim of the injustice of Union government; Modi government must give justice to Punjab by handing over Chandigarh to it."
