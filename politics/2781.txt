Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan allegedly lashed out at Uttar Pradesh government officials for making him walk on a muddy stretch after his car was stopped from entering Rampur Mandi. "Did Modiji instruct you to make me go through this?" Khan asked the officials. "Is this why I got you transferred... You were in a ditch," Khan further said.
