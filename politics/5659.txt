A Twitter user recently asked Union Minister Sushma Swaraj the reason for not following her husband Swaraj Kaushal on the micro-blogging website, despite the latter following her. Replying to this, Swaraj Kaushal tweeted, "I have followed her for 45 years- Can't change things now." One user reacted to this, saying, "[H]umour has played a huge role in keeping you'll together."
