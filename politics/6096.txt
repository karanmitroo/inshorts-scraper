MoS for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale, on Saturday said that if Mayawati is a ‘true Ambedkarite’ then she should embrace Buddhism. Asking Mayawati to change her party name from Bahujan Samaj Party to Sarvjan Samaj Party, Athawale said that despite announcing her conversion many times, she remains a Hindu. “She isn’t accepting Buddhism because of votes,” he added.
