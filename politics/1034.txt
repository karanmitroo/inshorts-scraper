Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Monday said 'development' is a joke for the opposition Congress, but it is a priority for the BJP. "Congress is scared of BJP's development drive. They are conspiring against the BJP. For the Congress it's a battle of existence," Rupani added. Earlier, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had said that 'vikas' (development) has gone crazy.
