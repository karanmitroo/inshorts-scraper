Responding to Mayawati's allegations of Electronic Voting Machine tampering, the Election Commission on Saturday said there is no merit in the BSP supremo's claims. After her party's poor performance in the UP Assembly elections, Mayawati had claimed that either the EVMs did not accept votes other than BJP, or have registered votes of other parties in the name of BJP.
