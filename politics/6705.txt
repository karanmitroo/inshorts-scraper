BJP workers on Monday staged a protest against Uttarakhand state cabinet's decision to send a proposal to the CBI asking it to drop the investigation against Chief Minister Harish Rawat. The cabinet had recently informed the CBI that it would form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe itself the sting videos allegedly showing Rawat offering bribe to rebel MLAs.
