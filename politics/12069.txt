The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear two PILs seeking action against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Law Minister Somnath Bharti for creating chaos in the heart of the capital by going on in an unprecedented 10-day sit-in protest. The apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice P. Sathasivam, will hear the PILs on Friday.
