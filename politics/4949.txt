The Supreme Court has said it will hear the criminal defamation case filed against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. The plea was filed by Congress leader Kapil Sibal's son Amit Sibal against Delhi High Court's exemption to Kejriwal from personal appearance. Kejriwal had alleged that Sibal took advantage of his father's position to represent a telecom company in court cases.
