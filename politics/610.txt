Former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah has said, "Pakistan doesn't indulge in conspiracies", in response to PM Narendra Modi's allegations that former PM Manmohan Singh colluded with Pakistan for BJP's defeat in Gujarat Assembly elections. Recalling PM Modi's visit to Lahore to attend the wedding of then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif's granddaughter, Abdullah questioned if Pakistan had conspired back then.
