Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday asked politicians not to interfere in University affairs and accused them of "vitiating the atmosphere" over the suicide of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad. Comparing universities to temples, Naidu said, "politicians should remove their chappal of politics outside the University" and requested them to allow peace instead of blame game.
