The BJP today called Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi a "principal misleader" of Indian politics and said his comments on the JNU protests showed his "willingness" to "twist" the truth. Gandhi had earlier accused the ruling BJP government of muzzling the youth by branding them "anti-nationals", allegations that the BJP dismissed as "baseless and wrong".
