Less than two weeks after the death of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa, party spokesperson C Ponnaiyan on Thursday said it was clear that her close aide Sasikala would be the next General Secretary. Adding that Sasikala had functioned as Amma's "conscience", he said it was the desire of the entire party that Chinnamma should become the General Secretary.
