Amid jibes about his background as a 'chai wallah', Narendra Modi is brewing a campaign through tea stalls across the country. Starting Feb-1, Modi will interact live with people at 1,000 chai shops across 300 parliamentary constituencies using internet and DTH technology. He will address five to eight 'nukkad' (street corner) meetings - 'Chai Pe Charcha with NaMo' - a day.
