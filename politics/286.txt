Sacked AAP minister Kapil Mishra on Sunday said that the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government has wasted â‚¹17,000 crore of public money. The government has allocated the amount to various departments but nothing has been spent on 49 major projects related to education, health, and water, he added. This is the biggest governance failure in the history of India, Mishra claimed.
