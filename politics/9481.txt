After accusing Arvind Kejriwal of horse-trading, former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg Tuesday alleged that the 'fake' calls offering crores to support BJP were made with the 'consent' of the party convener. Garg claimed that he had lodged a complaint against the fake caller. Later, AAP leader Sanjay Singh asked him to withdraw the complaint but he refused, Garg alleged.
