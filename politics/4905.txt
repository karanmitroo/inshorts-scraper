Union I&B Minister Venkaiah Naidu acknowledged that people are being inconvenienced due to long queues post-demonetisation and added that the nation is 'queuing' for a better India. "We have been seeing a lot of queues, there have been inconveniences and some of them, unfortunately, even lost their lives, but despite that the aam aadmi (common people) aren't angry," Naidu said.
