Visiting the Deonar garbage dumping ground in Mumbai, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said, "Merely slogans of Swachh India won't make any difference." He added, "...there seems to be no vision and strategy how to keep India clean and make people free from this menace of dumping ground," saying that the "PM and CM should do something immediately."
