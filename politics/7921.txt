Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia was spotted cycling on the city roads as the odd-even rule to curb pollution in the city entered its second day on Saturday. Before riding the bicycle, Sisodia posted on Twitter, "I'll cycle to AIR and would be in 102.6 FM studios at 8.30am. Then would cycle to my office from AIR."
