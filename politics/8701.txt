Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) founder Jitan Ram Manjhi has questioned Union Minister and LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan's credentials as Dalit leader. Manjhi alleged that Paswan had never spoken for welfare of the Dalit community. Last week, the LJP had asked the BJP not to give tickets to rebel JD-U MLAs who joined the HAM.
