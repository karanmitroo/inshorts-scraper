Hitting out at lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said, "How can a person call himself a government? This will lead to dictatorship in Delhi." In his letter to the LG, the CM further added, "Delhi government cannot be person specific." Earlier, the lieutenant governor had said, "I am the government of Delhi."
