Assam Congress today moved the Election Commission demanding rescheduling of Rajya Sabha elections as it is clashing with the nomination process of the assembly polls. The party said the MLAs will not be able to cast their votes being busy with election work. Biennial elections to 13 Rajya Sabha seats in six states will be held on March 21.
