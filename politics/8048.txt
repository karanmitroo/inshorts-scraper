Congress MLA Naba Kishore Das was on Monday caught on camera watching porn in the Odisha Assembly during the Question Hour. The ruling Biju Janata Dal in the state has demanded action against the MLA. However, Das denied watching any such video and said, "While I was trying to open a web page, the video clip on Youtube inadvertently opened."
