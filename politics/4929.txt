Samajwadi Party on Thursday reinstated Ram Gopal Yadav, who had been sacked for six years last month, as the party's General Secretary and spokesperson. "This was bound to happen, my return is because of Netaji; Netaji was never against me", he said. Yadav had been suspended for allegedly conniving with "communal forces" to destabilise and weaken the party.
