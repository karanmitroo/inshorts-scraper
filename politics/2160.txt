BJP spokesperson Tajinder Bagga has claimed that at least 34 AAP MLAs want Kumar Vishwas to replace Arvind Kejriwal as the Delhi Chief Minister. Bagga, earlier in the week, had claimed that 34 AAP MLAs wanted Kejriwal to consider the MCD poll results as a referendum, and submit his resignation if the party failed to win the polls.
