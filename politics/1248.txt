Pakistan should "take away" Rohingyas as Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar "is fond of them", Union Minister Giriraj Singh reportedly said on Tuesday. Referring to infiltration attempts from Pakistan, the minister said India does not have the capacity to bear more "infiltrators" and added that the Rohingya Muslims will have to leave.
