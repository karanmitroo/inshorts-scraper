BJP leader Vijay Goel on Saturday accused the AAP government of looting people in the name of the odd-even scheme. He claimed the government was "more bothered about advertising themselves with the tax money of the people," and was enforcing the scheme under the â‚¹2,000 fine. Goel added that he would pay the fine on Monday, in a 'symbolic protest'.
