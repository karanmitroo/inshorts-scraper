Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday tweeted that “After PM modelled for Reliance, someone has said that RSS stands for Reliance Swayamsewak Sangh." Earlier, while criticising PM Narendra Modi over his picture in Reliance Jio advertisement, Kejriwal had said, “No PM in independent India sold himself so brazenly to a corporate house.” He had also accused Congress of favouring Reliance.
