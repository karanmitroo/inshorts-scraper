Ahead of the 2018 Karnataka Assembly Elections, the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP have accused each other of tapping phones of political leaders. BJP leader Ananth Kumar alleged that the Congress government was tapping phones of its “political opponents”. “It is not the state government, but the Centre that is tapping phones,” said CM Siddaramaiah in retaliation.
