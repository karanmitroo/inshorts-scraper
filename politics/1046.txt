BJP leader Reshma Patel on Tuesday reportedly raised questions on Patidar stir leader Hardik Patel, asking why he was hiding his face after meeting with Congress leaders in a private hotel where Rahul Gandhi also stayed. Reshma, Hardik Patel's former aide, raised the question after the Patidar stir leader accused the BJP of leaking the CCTV footage of the hotel.
