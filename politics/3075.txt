Reacting to the clashes between two students groups at Ramjas college, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal criticised the city police over its handling of the incident and alleged it has become an "agent of BJP". "It's the duty of police to protect the people of Delhi and not allow the ABVP and the BJP to engage in goondaism (sic)," he added.
