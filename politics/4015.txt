The Election Commission on Tuesday issued a notice to BJP MP from Unnao Sakshi Maharaj for violating the Model Code of Conduct by blaming a particular community for India's rising population. Sakshi Maharaj had recently said India's population rise was not because of Hindus, but because of those who believed in the concept of four wives and 40 children.
