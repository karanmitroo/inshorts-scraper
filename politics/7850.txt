The Congress on Thursday criticised the arrest of comedian Kiku Sharda, popularly known as 'Palak', for mimicking godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said that Kiku should be awarded for making us laugh. Calling his arrest 'a slap on judicial system', he added, "It's shameful that killing people is ok, but mimicking will land you in jail."
