BJP leader Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday filed a defamation case against the outgoing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in a Delhi court, saying that Kejriwal has tarnished his image by calling him corrupt.  "Kejriwal has deliberately released the list of India's most corrupt people mentioning his (Gadkari's) name in a grossly irresponsible manner," the complaint said.
