Speaking about the Centre's demonetisation move, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said, "The RBI is changing rules like the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi changes his clothes." Gandhi further said, "We will stand by the government if it takes any decision to curb corruption, but Modiji's November 8 decision was not against corruption, it was against poor and farmers."
