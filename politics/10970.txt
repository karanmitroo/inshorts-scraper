A two-day orientation programme, starting on Saturday, has been organized to impart training to the newly-elected BJP MPs on enhancing their parliamentary and public conduct. Modi will deliver the inaugural address on Saturday morning, and along with home minister Rajnath Singh, will also try and inspire the new legislators to emulate best practices, party sources said.
