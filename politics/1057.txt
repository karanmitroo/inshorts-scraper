Wishing BJP President Amit Shah on his birthday, former Bihar Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav tweeted, "May he be blessed with good health, success & his wealth multiply 256000000 times.(16000*16000)." This was in reference to the controversy surrounding Shah's son's business enterprise after 'The Wire' reported 16,000 times increase in its turnover following PM Narendra Modi's election.
