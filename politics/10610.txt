The Delhi High Court on Friday asked former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala to surrender on or before October 17, in connection with the JBT recruitment scam case. At present, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief is out of prison on bail on health grounds. He was convicted in January last year for his role in the scam.
