Anand Rai, a whistleblower in multi-crore Vyapam scam, was on Sunday transferred from Indore to Dhar district in MP. His transfer order came days after he lodged a complaint with CBI against senior BJP leader Vikram Verma. Rai, a government doctor, had alleged that Verma used his power to get her daughter transferred to a medical college in Bhopal.
