Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Wednesday said that the Centre was following a confused policy on the issue of bringing back the Kohinoor diamond from Britain. "It's time that this matter was decided in the highest level... by the Prime Minister himself. We would request the Prime Minister that the government should have a clear-cut and precise policy," he added.
