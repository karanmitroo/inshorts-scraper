The police raided the offices of Darjeeling's ruling party Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) even as party leader Bimal Gurung's wife alleged the police and Trinamool Congress Party supporters entered their house and set a car on fire. While West Bengal government officials stated weapons were seized from Gurung's house, GJM claimed household tools and fire crackers were being labelled 'weapons'.
