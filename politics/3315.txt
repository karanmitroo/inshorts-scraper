BJP on Tuesday praised Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar for stalling the CM's appointment by waiting for the Supreme Court judgement. BJP leader Krishna Saagar Rao said the Governor's decision saved another Tamil Nadu CM from going to prison. This comes after AIADMK leader VK Sasikala's conviction in the disproportionate assets case, rendering her disqualified to take over as the CM.
