Former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin has been booked for taking a selfie inside Bihar's Siwan prison after the photo went viral on social media, police officials have said. The four-time MP from Siwan is currently lodged in Siwan jail after the Supreme Court cancelled his bail in the case linked to the killing of a witness in another murder case.
