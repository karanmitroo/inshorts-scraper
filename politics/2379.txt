Goa CM Manohar Parrikar has said his government is planning to ban entry of locals into casinos. "I sincerely believe that gambling isn't goodâ€¦It's human nature to gamble that's why we cannot eradicate it completely, but definitely we cannot encourage it," he said. Parrikar, however, added the casinos will not be closed immediately as some companies have invested in them.
