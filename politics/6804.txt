RJD MP Mohammed Taslimuddin on Monday said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not "PM material" and is "daydreaming of becoming the Prime Minister". "How can a person run the country who could not provide sushasan (good governance) in his own state," he asserted. Notably, RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had earlier backed Nitish Kumar as a Prime-Ministerial face.
