The Shiv Sena has asked the BJP government in Maharashtra if unemployed youth should fry pakodas or commit suicide in front of the Mantralaya. This comes after several suicide attempts were reported at the state's administrative headquarters. Stating that the Mantralaya should reflect the citizens' hopes, the party said the building has become a graveyard of people's aspirations.
