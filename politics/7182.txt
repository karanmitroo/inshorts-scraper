The Election Commission on Wednesday removed Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, after the BJP and Congress alleged that he was being used by the Mamata Banerjee government to conduct sting operations on opposition leaders. The BJP had called Kumar a "snooping cop" who conducts illegal surveillance under the directions of the CM to "facilitate" the ruling party.
