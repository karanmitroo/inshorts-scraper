BJP National General Secretary P Muralidhar Rao has said Karnataka is becoming "another Kashmir" as 15 Hindu activists in the state have been "selectively killed". Alleging the involvement of an international network in the killings, Rao accused the state government of not exposing its financial network or training module. He also accused CM Siddaramaiah of colluding with anti-national groups.
