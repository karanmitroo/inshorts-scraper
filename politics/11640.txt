Congress's Saharanpur (UP) candidate Imran Masood has reportedly threatened to kill BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi. "UP is not Gujarat. There is only 4% Muslim population in Gujarat but in UP there are 22% Muslims here. I will fight against Modi. We will cut him into pieces," Masood is heard saying in a video, while addressing a gathering.
