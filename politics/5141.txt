Ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Tuesday asserted that the state would not share "even a drop of water" with other states. "My government will not accept the ruling of any court on sharing of river water via Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal... We will not allow Punjabis to die of hunger," Badal asserted.
