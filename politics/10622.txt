Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray Tuesday said whether the party withdraws from the NDA or not will be decided only after discussing it with PM Modi, indicating Sena may continue in the ruling coalition. Uddhav, who had Monday said his minister in the Union Cabinet, Anant Geete, would resign, admitted that quitting the alliance at the Centre was "not easy".
