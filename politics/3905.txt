JD(U) leader Pawan Verma on Sunday asserted that the RSS should not pose itself as the spokesperson of the entire Hindu community. The JD(U) also slammed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat over his remark that 'Hindus cannot live freely in parts of India'. Further, Verma added that Bhagwat's comments were an effort to create a divide amongst different communities.
