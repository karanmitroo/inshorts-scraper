The Congress and BSP on Friday protested on the 1st day of the budget session of the Uttar Pradesh legislature and interrupted governor Ram Naik's address, which led to the governor cutting his speech short. Both the parties raised anti-government slogans and posters, which drowned out Naik's address to the joint session. BJP leaders were reportedly seated throughout the ruckus.
