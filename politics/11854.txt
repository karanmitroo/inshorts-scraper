Ex-Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and Actress Rekha, who were nominated to Rajya Sabha around two-years-ago, have spent "zero" rupee of the “MP fund” on development in their respective adopted areas. The MPs get to adopt a district of their choice and get Rs.5 crore a year. While Tendulkar has adopted a district, Rekha hasn't even bothered to do that.
