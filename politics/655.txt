Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the party would leave the Centre no choice but to pass the women's reservation bill, which provides 33% reservation for women in Parliament and state Assemblies. Addressing an event organised by the All India Mahila Congress, he added that the party would have to compensate for not having a woman president anymore.
