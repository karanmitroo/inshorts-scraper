Newly formed political outfit Swaraj India on Tuesday said that the Aam Aadmi Party does not have the democratic spirit or courage to debate political funding. "We had raised five specific questions to the AAP on its shady practices in party funding and invited them for a public debate," said Swaraj India Spokesperson Anupam.
