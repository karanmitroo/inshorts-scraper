Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has suspended MP Baijayant Panda from the party's primary membership for indulging in anti-party activities. After the announcement of his suspension, Panda said he was shocked BJD President and Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik didn't see through the conspiracy against him. In 2017, Panda was removed as BJD's spokesperson after writing an article criticising the party's leadership.
