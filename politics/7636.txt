BJP National Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh today said that based on the revelations made by terrorist David Headley, India should initiate a diplomatic exercise and have Pakistan declared as a 'terrorist state'. Singh also said that Headley's statements prove that there were no non-state actors in Pakistan but only cross-border terror funded by the ISI.
