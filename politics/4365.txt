Shiv Sena leader Manisha Kayande on Saturday said that the foundation stone-laying ceremony of Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial is not a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) function. "It is a proud moment for every citizen of this country... It is a government function and all parties should be taken together for such an event," she added.
