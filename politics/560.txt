Patidar leader Hardik Patel has said that he will get Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel a "good position" in the Congress if Nitin, along with 10 MLAs, quits the BJP. He should leave the BJP if the party does not respect him, Hardik added. This comes after the Deputy CM did not assume office in Gandhinagar Sachivalaya on Friday.
