Shiv Sena on Thursday demanded the resignation of Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse "till an inquiry into the allegations is completed". In response, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis assured that BJP will take "appropriate action" against him. Notably, Khadse was first accused of receiving calls from don Dawood Ibrahim, and later his family's name figured in a controversial land deal.
