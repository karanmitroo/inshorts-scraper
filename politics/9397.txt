Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh Friday sparked a controversy by comparing PM Narendra Modi to Hitler, and addressing the Kashmiri separatist leader Masarat Alam as 'sahab'. "Under what section of the law has the J&K government arrested Masarat Alam sahab?", Singh said. Furthermore, Singh attacked Modi for criticizing the Congress party during his address in Canada.
