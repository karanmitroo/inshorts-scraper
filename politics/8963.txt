Hitting out at AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj said, "people who can't respect Indian system & judiciary can go to Pakistan." Maharajâ€™s statement came after Owaisi questioned the death sentence awarded to Yakub, the lone convict in the Mumbai blasts case. Owaisi had also said that Memon was being executed because he was a Muslim.
