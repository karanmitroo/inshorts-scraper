Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar Wednesday called disabled people a 'mistake of God'. "God forgets to give them certain things. That is negligence on the part of God...", he said while speaking at a festival organised by the NGO Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG). DRAG later criticized his remarks and said the disabled were born to show God's power.
