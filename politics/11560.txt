Samajwadi Party leader and UP minister Azam Khan said Monday that BJP general secretary Amit Shah was a “goonda” (thug) and “qatil” (killer). Khan said, “Humari majboori hai use goonda kehne ki, kisi qatil ko sharif nahi kaha ja sakta. (I am forced to call him a thug. A killer cannot be called a gentleman).”
