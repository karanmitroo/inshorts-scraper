The Election Commission will test the strength of elected MPs, MLAs, and party delegates/office bearers among the splitting factions of the Samajwadi Party. If the support for the factions could not be established within the party's organisation, then EC will test the majority among SP's MPs and MLAs. The faction with such a majority will get SP’s election symbol ‘cycle’.
