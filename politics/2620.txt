The Shiv Sena on Monday suggested that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat should be taken into consideration as the next President of India. "If the dream of a Hindu Rashtra (nation) has to be fulfilled, then Bhagwat should be made the President," Sena leader Sanjay Raut said. Presidential elections are due in July as President Pranab Mukherjee completes his tenure.
