BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha on Tuesday supported Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury by tweeting, "Laugh Renuka laugh! We love you...& wish you well." This comes after she was mocked by PM Narendra Modi for laughing. "Those who oppose women's empowerment & laughter would melt soon. We all will have the last laugh. Long live Nari Shakti," he added.
