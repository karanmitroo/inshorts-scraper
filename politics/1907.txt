The Election Commission has said that Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is the only party willing to participate in the poll panel's challenge to hack Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Further, the EC said the AAP had not expressed their interest in participating in the hackathon despite the party having recently demonstrated the tampering of EVMs in the Delhi Assembly.
