On Tuesday, Congress declared Ajay Rai (a local MLA) as its candidate for the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat. The decision shows that Congress hasnâ€™t found any big name to cross swords with Modi, who seems the favourite in the eastern UP seat. The constituency also has AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal besides other nominees.
