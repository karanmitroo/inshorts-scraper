The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) has alleged that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is “inflicting atrocities” on Hindus to appease Muslim community. “The bans that were imposed on Durga Puja this year were unprecedented. The Jihadi elements, on the provocation of the Muslim Personal Law Board, carried out the most macabre violence in Muslim-majority areas,” said a VHP leader.
