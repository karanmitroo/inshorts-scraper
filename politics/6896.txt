CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Saturday said that the people of Kerala have decided to vote against the corrupt government, which has ruled the state for the last five years. "Left Democratic Front (LDF) will form the next government," Yechury added. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has been ruling the state since 2011.
