Asserting that Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung did not have any power to check AAP government's files, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked whether Jung was their "headmaster or principal". "Only people have right to check our work and...throw us out," he added. Notably, Jung had formed a committee to examine 400 files pertaining to AAP government's decisions.
