Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said the Centre's decision to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes is not a solution. He added that the corrupt people will anyway remain corrupt and are only waiting for the new ₹2,000 notes. Recently, the BJP had claimed that those politicians and parties who are opposing the move are involved in corruption.
