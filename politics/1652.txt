Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Tuesday said that President Ram Nath Kovind has shown that "he has the anti-Ambedkar thinking of the BJP" by not paying tribute to BR Ambedkar's statue in the Parliament premises. Adding that Kovind should have laid flowers of reverence on Ambedkar's statue, she said Kovind became the President because of Ambedkar.
