A Delhi court on Wednesday granted AAP leader Somnath Bharti bail in the domestic violence and attempt to murder case filed by his wife Lipika Mitra. Bharti’s lawyer had claimed that the case was being blown out of proportion allegedly in a “BJP-sponsored litigation”. He had added that Bharti had to look after his parents and urged for the bail.
