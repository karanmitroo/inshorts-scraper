Taking a jibe at PM Narendra Modi's radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat', the Nationalist Congress Party on Sunday said that it is in fact 'Dukh Ki Baat'. "Dukh Ki Baat is that he is an expert in making speeches and incompetent in making them come true," said NCP leader Majid Memon. He further called PM's radio address a political strategy.
