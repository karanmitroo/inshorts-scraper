Assam CM Tarun Gogoi on Thursday claimed that the state has not yet received the flood relief fund of Rs.400 crore recommended by the Centre in October 2014. "Whatever we had demanded, the amount was very less. Still we have not got it," Gogoi said. "The Central government is playing with the lives of ordinary citizens in Assam," he added.
