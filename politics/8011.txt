Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday claimed on Twitter that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been "asked to target all opposition parties n finish those who don't fall in line". Kejriwal has been engaged in a war of words with the Central government after he alleged corruption in Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA) under Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's leadership.
