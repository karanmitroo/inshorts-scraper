Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday alleged that the number of soldiers killed under the current BJP-led Central government is maximum because of BJP's 'surgical strikes' across the border. Further, criticising the Centre over demonetisation, Akhilesh said, "Like achche din never arrived, even this dream of cashless economy will not turn into reality."
