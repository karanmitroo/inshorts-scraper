Congress MP and former law minister Veerappa Moily on Tuesday said the job of managing sports associations is best left to sportspersons and administrators and asked, â€œWhy should politicians, especially ministers, hold positions in sports associations?". Moily added that he had tried to stop this practice during UPA-2 but "leaders of all parties, including many ministers, opposed the move."
