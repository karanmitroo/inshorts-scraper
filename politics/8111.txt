Congress leader Manish Tewari said that the National Security Advisor-level meet held between India and Pakistan in Bangkok on Sunday was a "grand betrayal" by the NDA government. Tewari questioned what had changed between September, when previous NSA-level talks were cancelled, and December. However, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said the talks were held in "the spirit of the Ufa statement".
