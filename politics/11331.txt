To let others "know about Modi's real face", Sayed Imam Shahi Saiyed, the cleric who had once offered a skull cap to Narendra Modi that he had refused to wear, will be campaigning against the BJP's PM candidate in Varanasi. Saiyed had earlier campaigned against Modi in UP assembly elections when he distributed a six-page booklet calling Modi 'Vinash purush'.
