The women's wing of RSS organised a 15-day camp for girls in Delhi and taught them that a man's job is to make money and a woman's quality is motherhood. Adding that "masculinity is a man's quality", the Rashtriya Sevika Samiti said, "A mother is the ultimate creator...she can bring up her child to be a saint or a destroyer."
