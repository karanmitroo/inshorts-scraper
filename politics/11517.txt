A book titled "The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh" by Sanjaya Baru (former media adviser to the PM) has sent ripples across the political establishment. The book says Sonia Gandhi created a parallel power structure and left a weakened PM who "allowed himself to become an object of such ridicule in his 2nd term."
