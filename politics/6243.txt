Denying his alleged remark against Smriti Irani, that being shifted to the Textile Ministry would help her cover her body, JD(U) leader Ali Anwar on Thursday said he was being portrayed in the negative light. He asked the media to apologise for reporting a modified statement. Anwar claimed the statement was made regarding the Textile Ministry and not the minister.
