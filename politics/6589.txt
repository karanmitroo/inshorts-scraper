Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday said that the rise in income of temples in the state is due to “growing sins”. “People are committing sins and to get rid of them they are going to temples and offering money,” he added. He also pointed out that lower liquor sales have led to reduced state income.
