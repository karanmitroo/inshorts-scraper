Former Union Minister Ajit Singh finally vacated the 12 Tughlaq Road bungalow on Friday, after a 118 day unauthorised stay period and a stand off with the government. Singh had resisted the eviction notice sent in June, demanding the conversion of the government accommodation into a memorial, which was rejected as the government had 'banned' conversions in 2000.
