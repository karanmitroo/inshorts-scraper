The impact of Law Minister Somnath Bharti's infamous Jan-15 midnight raid, is taking a toll on AAP’s foreign funding. The party, which received Rs 40-50 lakh/day between Jan-2 and Jan-16, is receiving only Rs.6 lakh daily after Jan-17. Moreover, annoyed with its style of governance, some NRI’s have even started a Facebook page: "I Am Sorry I Voted For AAP".
