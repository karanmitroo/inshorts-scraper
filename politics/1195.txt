Bihar Energy Minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav on Tuesday claimed that the newly launched 'Saubhagya' power scheme was adopted from the 'Bihar model'. The 16,000-crore Saubhagya scheme, launched by PM Narendra Modi on Monday, promises to provide electricity to all rural and urban households. "Providing electricity connection to everybody by organising camps is also part of Bihar model," Yadav said.
