BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday called a meeting of several party leaders to warn them against making controversial statements. This reportedly comes after PM Narendra Modi expressed his displeasure over the recent beef remarks that certain members made. Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, MLA Sangeet Som and MP Sakshi Mahara were among the invitees.
