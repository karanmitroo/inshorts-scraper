Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah will soon try his hand in acting and will be playing himself in a children's movie titled 'Summer Holidays' by director Kavitha Lankesh. "There is the role of a CM in the film. So I thought of bringing in the real CM. When I asked him, he agreed. But this is not a publicity stunt," Kavitha said.
