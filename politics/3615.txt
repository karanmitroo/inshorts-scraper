BJP MLA from Thana Bhawan Suresh Rana has said curfew will be imposed in UP's Kairana, Deoband and Moradabad if he wins the Assembly polls. "March 11 will be the date and a procession will move from Shamli to Thana Bhawan with slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai," he said. Notably, Kairana, Deoband and Moradabad are Muslim-dominated areas.
