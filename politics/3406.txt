Amid the ongoing power struggle, Tamil Nadu Education Minister 'Ma Foi' Pandiarajan and two AIADMK Lok Sabha MPs on Saturday declared their support for Chief Minister O Panneerselvam. "I was handpicked by Amma. I have come here to ensure that the AIADMK does not break," Pandiarajan said. He is the first minister to switch sides from AIADMK chief Sasikala's camp.
