BJP leader Neeraj Saxena has moved the Election Commission against BSP chief Mayawati, accusing her of seeking votes in the name of caste, and demanded that BSP should be debarred from elections. This comes after Supreme Court directed that politicians cannot seek votes in the name of caste, language or religion. Saxena further demanded an FIR for violating SC's directives.
