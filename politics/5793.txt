Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra on Sunday had a verbal spat with BJP MLA Ganesh Joshi at the Dehradun airport over the death of the police horse Shaktiman. 'I told Shaktiman’s killer what I thought of him. He came towards me screaming, shouting and threatening. I told him, if the horse can’t speak, I will,' said Vadra.
