BJP leader and Union Minister Uma Bharti has said that the rift in Samajwadi Party is a "shameful act and dangerous for democratic ethics." "When father and son are not loyal to each other, how can they be well-wishers of Muslims and Yadavs," she further said. Mulayam Singh is "neither a Lohiawadi nor a Samajwadi but a Parivarwadi," she added.
