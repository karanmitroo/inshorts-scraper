BJP and LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan on Wednesday sealed a seat-sharing pact in Bihar that will see Paswan's group contesting seven Lok Sabha seats. Paswan is seen to command the loyalty of a dalit community that is assertive and can add 3-4% votes to BJP's base that includes upper castes and some middle castes as well.
