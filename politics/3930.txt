The BJP on Friday filed a complaint with the Election Commission against Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi following his remark that he found his party's symbol in the photos of gods and saints. His remarks were against the recent order of the Supreme Court, BJP alleged. The SC had earlier ruled that votes can't be sought in the name of religion.
