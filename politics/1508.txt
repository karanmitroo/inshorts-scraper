Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said in the Assembly that as many as 281 cases of RSS-sponsored violence have been registered in the state since the LDF government came to power. His statement comes after Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said that violence escalates in Kerala every time the LDF government comes to power.
