AK Walia, who was Health Minister in former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit's Cabinet, has quit the Congress over ticket distribution in the upcoming MCD polls. Walia has alleged the party has sold tickets to the "outsiders" for the polls. "I am pained. I have worked tirelessly for the party for years and now no one listens to me," he said.
