Following Narendra Modi's allegations that National TV channel, Doordarshan, is struggling to maintain its professional freedom, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said, "The autonomy of Parasar Bharati is guaranteed by the Parliament." He further went on to say that "Prasar Bharati is a board run organisation and the Information and Broadcast Ministry has an arms-length relationship with it".
