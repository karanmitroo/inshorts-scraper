The Swaraj Abhiyan on Sunday said that the AAP government in Delhi was “covertly siding with the liquor mafia”. It alleged that the party has approved the opening of 58 liquor shops during its 17-month rule in Delhi. The Swaraj Abhiyan also claimed that the AAP government’s revenue from the sale of alcohol has doubled in the past one year.
