Amid ongoing uproar in Tamil Nadu Assembly, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said, "Whatever she is, VK Sasikala is much better than DMK". "DMK is a violent and anti-national party," he added. "The biggest losers in this TN drama will be unpatriotic DMK, corrupt Congress and Christian converters which had a secret understanding with OPS," he tweeted.
