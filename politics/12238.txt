In a shake up ahead of the LS polls, environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan resigned from the Union council of ministers on Saturday. As per sources, Natarajan may be drafted for organisation work. Also, some more ministers (possibly Jairam Ramesh, Sachin Pilot and Jitender Singh Bhanwar) could resign, and can come to party organisation in preparation for the elections.
