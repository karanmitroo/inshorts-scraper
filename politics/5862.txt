CM Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday said that Punjab has the sole right on Chandigarh, which is also the capital of Haryana. Former PM Rajiv Gandhi had, in 1986, announced handing over Chandigarh to Punjab in Parliament but then backtracked, he added. He further accused the Congress of divesting the state of its Punjabi-speaking areas.
