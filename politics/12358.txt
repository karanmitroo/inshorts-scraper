The Election Commission on Wednesday rejected Arvind Kejriwal's claims that the Aam Aadmi Party was given a clean chit in the sting operation. Election Commissioner HS Brahma said that the party could only get a clean chit by legally challenging the veracity of the tape. Earlier, AAP had claimed that the tape showing AAP leaders accepting funds illegally was doctored.
