Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said in the Rajya Sabha on Friday that the government was taking steps to put a check on the increasing number of farmers' suicides. "Increasing crop productivity is not the only solution to prevent farmers' suicides but schemes like Prime Minister's Crop Insurance scheme could deter them from taking the extreme step," he added.
