Congress on Sunday suspended Rajasthan leader Bhanwar Lal Sharma, who had called Rahul Gandhi 'MD of Congress circus'. However, undettered by the action, Sharma continued with his attack and described Rahul as a person who lacked intelligence. Notably, Sharma is the second leader to be suspended from the party for criticizing Rahul, after  former Kerala minister TH Mustafa.
