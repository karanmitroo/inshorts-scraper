After the BJP suffered a huge loss in the Delhi elections, party's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi Tuesday apologized to party leaders and workers, for letting them down. "I apologise to every one...I could not fulfill their expectation," said Bedi, who herself lost from Krishna Nagar constituency. "I did not deserve the faith they had in me," she said.
