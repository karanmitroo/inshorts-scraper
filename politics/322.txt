Former Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said she'll work with the party members and other like-minded parties to defeat BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Defeating BJP will ensure India is restored to a democratic, secular, tolerant, and economically progressive path, she added. She also told Congress workers to be ready for early Lok Sabha polls.
