Reacting to President Pranab Mukherjee's address to Parliament on Land Acquisition ordinance, BSP chief Mayawati Monday said that there was nothing new in his speech. "President’s speech always reflects Centre’s policy. It seems this govt is doing less work more talk. At least President’s address indicated that," Mayawati said. “Our party has opposed the ordinance since its beginning,” she added.
