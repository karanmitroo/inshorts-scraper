Six legislators in Tripura, who were earlier a part of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday. The MLAs were earlier sacked by the TMC for anti-party activities after they voted for President Ram Nath Kovind, the NDA candidate in the Presidential elections. Notably, the MLAs had defected from Congress to TMC in 2016.
