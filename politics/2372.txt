National Conference President Farooq Abdullah has alleged that many stone pelters in Kashmir are probably paid by the government to create a situation to discourage people from voting. "This needs to be investigated," he added. Further, while reacting to the 2% voter turnout in Srinagar by-poll, Abdullah said that polling was 29% when he was defeated.
