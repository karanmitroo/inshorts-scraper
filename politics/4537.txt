West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh has said that police could've pulled TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee by her hair and thrown her out of Delhi when she was doing "drama" against demonetisation move. “We have police under us there (Delhi)…but we didn’t do it because we believe in democracy. But when we protest in WB we are lathicharged,” he added.
