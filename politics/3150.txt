BSP National General Secretary Satish Chandra Mishra has said that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had engineered the split in the Samajwadi Party to help BJP. "Akhilesh is fighting elections under BJPâ€™s pressure," the BSP leader added. Further, he said SP grew weaker after the split and so sought Congress' support, which is already in a bad condition.
