BJP MLA Mohan Yadav from Ujjain was reportedly duped by a man claiming to be the party chief Amit Shah’s nephew. The man had complained at the Ujjain railway station that his belongings were stolen in the train he was travelling in. He then called Yadav who asked his friend to give the man ₹50,000, a cellphone and flight ticket.
