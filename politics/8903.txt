The Congress on Saturday said Home Minister Rajnath Singh raked up the phrase "Hindu terror" with a divisive agenda. Earlier, Singh had said the previous UPA government had weakened the fight against terrorism by using the phrase "Hindu terror". "It is the deliberate attempt on the part of the BJP to divide the country," Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said.
