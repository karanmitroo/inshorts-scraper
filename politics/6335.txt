Reacting to 14 Delhi government bills being returned by the Centre, CM Arvind Kejriwal urged PM Narendra Modi to "forget the defeat" in 2015 assembly elections and to not take "revenge on Delhiites". The Centre had returned the bills saying proper procedures were not followed while passing them. However, Kejriwal alleged that the Centre had "no intention" to pass them.
