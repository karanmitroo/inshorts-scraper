BJP MP and actor Hema Malini was mobbed during a public rally in Mathura on Saturday, where she turned rescuer for two young boys who were caught in the melee. Had Malini not helped them, the boys could have been hurt, her close aide Mitul Pathak said. He further added that the MP and the boys were unhurt.
