Alleging that the PM Narendra Modi-led government is targeting state officials to weaken state governments, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said, "You don't have to touch anybody.

Claiming that Centre's actions are "vindictive, unethical, and technically improper", Banerjee added that nothing will deter her from raising her voice against demonetisation.
