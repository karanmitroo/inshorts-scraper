Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah on Friday said that his party had not come to power for a mere 5 or 10 years, but at least for 50 years. "We should move forward with a conviction that in 40-50 years we have to bring major changes in the country through the medium of power," he added.
