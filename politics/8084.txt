Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi was dared to give proof in parliament by the NDA, after he alleged the government was harbouring a political vendetta against the Congress in the National Herald case. Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said, “The House or government has nothing got to do with this either directly or indirectly... Wasting Parliament’s time is not good for democracy.”
