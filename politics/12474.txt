Fourteen non-Congress and non-BJP parties, including the Left parties, NCP, SP, BJD, AIADMK and JD(U) among others, on Wednesday attended the "People's Unity Against Communalism" meeting at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi to fight "communalism" ahead of 2014 general elections. They said the congregation was to fill political space vacated by Congress-led UPA  and not intended to be 'Third front'.
