BJP MP Laxmi Narayan Yadav has said that many people with "dubious reputations" received country's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. Earlier, many 'Nachaiye' (dancers), 'Gawaiye' (singers) and 'chhote bade badmas' (rogues) were given the award, he said. The trend of conferring Bharat Ratna to the undeserving changed after it was given to Dr BR Ambedkar, he added.
