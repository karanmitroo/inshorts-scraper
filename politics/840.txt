The Congress has written to President Ram Nath Kovind over the delay in Parliament's winter session, urging him to direct the Centre to summon the Houses at the earliest. The party accused the NDA government of delaying session "without ascribing any justification for doing so". The government is avoiding answering questions on its "flawed and unpopular" policies, it claimed.
