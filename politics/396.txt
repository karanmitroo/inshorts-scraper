Eleven political parties in Nagaland, including the Congress and BJP, have announced they will not contest the Assembly elections on February 27. The parties have said they would contest the elections only after a political resolution for the insurgency movement in Nagaland. One of the state leaders warned of state-wide bandh if the Election Commission proceeds with the election process.
