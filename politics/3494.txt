Samajwadi Party Founder Mulayam Singh Yadav's second daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, in an interview to journalist Barkha Dutt, said that economic criteria should be followed for giving reservations and not caste alone. "Like I'm a Yadav and I'm financially well-off, so I would not want my daughter to get the reservation on the basis of being a Yadav," she explained.
