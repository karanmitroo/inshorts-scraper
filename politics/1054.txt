Slamming the Congress for criticising the Election Commission over the delay in announcing Gujarat poll dates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said no one had the right to question the body. "Some of them are worried why Modi is coming to Gujarat after Diwali. They can't say anything to me, so they are targeting the Election Commission,"  he added.
