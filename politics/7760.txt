BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday sought Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung's sanction to prosecute Arvind Kejriwal under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Swamy alleged that during Kejriwal's first tenure as Chief Minister, he gave illegal favours to a private firm in exchange for donations to the Aam Aadmi Party. He also sought to prosecute Manish Sisodia for favouring the firm.
