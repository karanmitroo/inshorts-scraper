Claiming that everyone is troubled by the Centre's demonetisation move, Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat said that it has badly hit farmers and labourers. Every step taken to fight black money and terrorism is welcome, but, demonetisation was an ill-thought-out move, Rawat said. "If PM continues to issue 'fatwa' on every issue, it will be advantageous to Rahul Gandhi," he added.
