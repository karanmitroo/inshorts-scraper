AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal has formally invited Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit to an open public debate. Dikshit, looking for a 4th win in the upcoming polls, had been dared by Kejriwal to debate on the "inflated" power and electricity bills and women's safety. Dikshit recently admitted that Kejriwal has caught the people's imagination to a certain extent.
