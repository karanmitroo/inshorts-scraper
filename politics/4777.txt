BJP on Monday asserted that PM Narendra Modi would be re-elected in 2019 whether West Bengal CM lives or dies. "She has certainly...lost her mental balance which should be there as a politician," the party said. Notably, Banerjee has recently remarked, "I am taking the pledge that either I'll die or live but will remove PM Modi from Indian politics."
