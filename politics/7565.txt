BSP Chief Mayawati on Wednesday sought a response from the government in the Rajya Sabha to her demands regarding Rohith Vemula's suicide. BSP members then shouted slogans and entered the well. Angry exchanges took place between the BSP and HRD Minister Smriti Irani, with Irani saying she would cut her own head if Mayawati was not satisfied with the response.
