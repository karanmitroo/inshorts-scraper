Shiv Sena on Wednesday demanded an investigation into the incident where a bureaucrat was physically assaulted by NCP MLA Suresh Lad. Such behaviour does not suit the position of an MLA, said Shiv Sena MLA Arvind Sawant. However, he also maintained that at times bureaucrats do not extend help for the welfare work and the politicians get helpless and angry.
