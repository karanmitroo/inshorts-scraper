JD(U) on Wednesday rejected the reports that Bihar CM Nitish Kumar may join hands with the NDA as 'impossible and baseless'. "Our alliance is strong and working for Bihar's development," JD(U) leader Shyam Rajak asserted. Notably, JD(U) was once a part of NDA and had walked out of the alliance in 2013 when Narendra Modi was declared the PM candidate.
