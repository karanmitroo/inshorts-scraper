West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee asked the central government to frame a national policy on iron ore in her speech at the inauguration of a new corporate office of Coal India on Friday. She claimed Bengal to have insufficient access to the mineral for the development of its steel sector due to poor linkages to states like Jharkhand and Odisha.
