Addressing party workers ahead of Karnataka Assembly elections, BJP President Amit Shah has said they should look at PM Narendra Modi's photo and the lotus symbol, and not their local candidate. He told them to focus on winning their assigned booth, against the BJP's earlier 'panna pramukh' strategy where one worker was assigned one page of the electoral roll.
