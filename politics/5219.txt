UP Governor Ram Naik on Saturday said there is "no constitutional crisis" in the state despite the infighting in the ruling Samajwadi Party. However, if such a crisis does emerge, then action will be taken "in accordance with law", he added. The Governor was responding to a question on the alleged feud in the SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's family.
