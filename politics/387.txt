Former Finance Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram has said "if selling pakodas is a job, then so is begging". This was in response to PM Narendra Modi's recent remark, "If a person selling pakodas earns â‚¹200 at the end of the day, will it be considered employment or not?" Chidambaram said the NDA government is "clueless" about job creation.
