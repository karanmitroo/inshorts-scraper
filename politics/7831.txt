Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia called the incident of ink being thrown at CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday "a BJP conspiracy", and claimed the police was "a part of the conspiracy". BJP can "kill people" as they "cannot stand the success of the odd-even scheme", he added. While the BJP called the incident "stage-managed", the Delhi Police refuted the allegations.
