Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday called for 40% reservation for youths in all organisational positions in the party's bodies. The Congress already has 33% reservation for women and 20% reservation for Scheduled Castes, reports said. The 40% quota for youth would be over and above this, meaning among women and SC/STs, 40% should be youth, reports added.
