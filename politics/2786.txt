Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said, "I have met PM Narendra Modi a few times and I have found that he is open to ideas. He is not authoritative." Speaking at India Today Conclave, she added, "Contrary to perception and allegations by some, Modi is not centralised. He wants to make a true federal system in the country."
