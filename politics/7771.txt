Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday suspended JD(U) MLA Sarfraz Alam who allegedly molested a woman on Dibrugarh-New Delhi Rajdhani Express. Earlier in the day, Nitish had said that action would be taken against the MLA "as such conducts can't be tolerated". However, Alam has denied the charges and said that he has not even travelled by that train.
