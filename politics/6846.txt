Lok Sabha BJP MP Arjun Ram Meghwal on Friday said in the Parliament that women were afraid to fly MiG-21 fighter planes due to their high accident rate. In reply, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said, "Don't say like that." After this, Meghwal said that what he actually meant was awareness should be organised at school level against the fear of flying.
