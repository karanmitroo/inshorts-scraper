The Delhi Assembly suspended BJP MLA OP Sharma for two days after he made derogatory remarks against AAP legislator Alka Lamba on Monday. During a discussion on night shelters, Sharma reportedly referred to Lamba as "bazaaru mahila" and said she roamed around all night. Speaker Ram Goel has said he is considering informing the Ethics Committee of the matter.
