Another statue of Russian communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin was destroyed in Tripura amid clashes between BJP and CPI(M) supporters. The incidents come days after BJP won the state assembly elections with 35 seats, ousting CPI(M) which was in power for 25 years. Meanwhile, the communist party has called the incident an example of "communist phobia".
