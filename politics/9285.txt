National BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Sunday said, dissolution of Article 370 of the Constitution continues to be part of the party's core ideology and it will work in that direction whenever it garners the required numbers in Parliament. Repealing Article 370, which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
