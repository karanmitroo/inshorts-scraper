As part of its 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign, AAP will launch a "broom yatra" in Gujarat on Jan-26. "During the yatra, we will expose the Gujarat government's corrupt practices. We aim to clean the political filth in the state," said AAP's Dinesh Vaghela. The party had earlier said that it may contest all the 26 Parliamentary seats in Gujarat.
