Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday said that the ruling BJP has “changed the meaning of secularism” and is taking up issues that would “divide people on communal lines”. Further, Singh added, “Those who oppose BJP are being termed as anti-nationals.” He also charged the BJP with taking political advantage out of the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers.
