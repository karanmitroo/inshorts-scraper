A video purportedly shows BJP MP Vitthal Radadiya from Porbandar, Gujarat kicking an elderly man at a religious function, which was held about a week ago. However, the minister has denied assaulting the person, saying that the man was "trying to spread superstition". The video also shows Radadiya gesturing at the man to leave the place.
