The Congress party has sent a defamation notice to a US-based website over its alleged defamatory statements made while reporting an Italian court's judgment on the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal. It threatened to seek legal action unless the website apologises unconditionally and withdraws the "false and defamatory statements" relating to party President Sonia Gandhi and other leaders.
