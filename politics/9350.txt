Nitish's JD(U) and Lalu's RJD are in tough negotiations over seat sharing formula ahead of upcoming Bihar polls. The disagreement is over the base year which will decide seat distribution. RJD wants 2014 Lok Sabha elections as the reference where JD(U) was decimated and the latter wants 2010 assembly election as reference where RJD got just 22 of 243 assembly.
