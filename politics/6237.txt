The Congress party on Wednesday demanded Arunachal Pradesh Governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa's resignation after the Supreme Court quashed all his decisions which led to the imposition of President's rule in the state. Earlier, the SC reinstated the Nabam Tuki-led Congress government which was dismissed after 21 Congress MLAs had rebelled and formed a new government with 11 BJP MLAs' support.
