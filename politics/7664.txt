The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) faced criticism on Wednesday for promoting RK Pachauri, who is accused of sexual harassment, as its Executive Vice Chairman. Congress leader Shobha Oza said that Pachauri should not be holding any positions until he comes clean. She added that this incident shows that India is not taking sexual harassment at the workplace very seriously.
