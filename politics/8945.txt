Former AAP member Prashant Bhushan has sent a legal notice to AAP leader and Delhi's Education Minister Manish Sisodia over Delhi government's teachers selection policy. Bhushan's move came after Delhi govt promised that existing guest teachers would be given preference and a separate exam would be conducted for them in selection of permanent teachers.
