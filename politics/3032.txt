PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday took a jibe at Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, stating the party has such talented people whoâ€™ll sell "coconut juice" in London and set up "potato factories" in UP. "Juice is of lemon, orange. Have you seen coconut juice?" PM asked. "Coconut is grown in Kerala, he wants to extract its juice from Manipur," he added.
