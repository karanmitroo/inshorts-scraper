A team of 16 CBI officers conducted a search on Tuesday at activist Teesta Setalvad's house in Mumbai. She is accused of violating the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act and illegally receiving funds from abroad for her NGO, Sabrang, without seeking the home ministry's permission. However, she has denied all charges and appealed to the Supreme Court to prevent an arrest.
