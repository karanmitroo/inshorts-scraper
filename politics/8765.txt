Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar is planning to stitch up a 'third' option in poll-bound Bihar by seeking to join hands with Left parties. Anwar said he was disappointed by the decision of JD(U)-RJD to give just three seats to the NCP. The former Union minister further said he would take along small regional parties in his grouping.
