Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that former PM Indira Gandhi did not go for a note ban exercise when needed. Adding that Congress was "angry" at demonetisation as it was still feeling its effect, he said, “Few people who faced the heat of demonetisation are still complaining and are planning to observe November 8 as ‘black day’."
