Addressing a rally in poll-bound Gujarat's Gandhinagar, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that every time someone clicks a selfie, a Chinese youth gets employment. Gandhi's statement was aimed at criticising PM Narendra Modi's 'Make in India', suggesting that the campaign to boost foreign investment in Indian manufacturing failed and that jobs were going to China instead.
