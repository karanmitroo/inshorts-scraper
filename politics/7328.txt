The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday ruled out investigations into the sting video that showed its members allegedly taking bribes. "The party does not believe it, why should we seek investigation?", TMC Secretary-General Partha Chatterjee said. He also said a procession would take place on Friday in Kolkata to protest against a "smear campaign" by opposition parties against the TMC.
