Gujarat Assembly Speaker Ganpat Vasava on Wednesday suspended all 55 Congress MLAs after they hurled lollipops towards the Assembly's treasury benches and Chief Minister Anandiben Patel. The MLAs also raised slogans in support of the Patidar reservation stir. They started protesting after being denied the introduction and debate on a bill providing 20% reservation for economically weaker sections.
