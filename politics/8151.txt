BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav on Saturday said that the “Hindustan is for Hindus” statement made by acting Assam governor Padmanabha Balakrishna Acharya was being misinterpreted. Regarding the Assam government's demand for Acharya's removal, Madhav said, "People always demand many things. They say he must be removed or she must be removed. Is it done in that way?”
