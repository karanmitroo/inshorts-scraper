Senior Congress leader Naseem Khan on Monday attacked Mumbai Congress Chief Sanjay Nirupam and claimed that "the kind of terminology used in compiling the articles" criticising Jawaharlal Nehru and Sonia Gandhi in the party's mouthpiece, came from "the dictionary of RSS." Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena "congratulated" Nirupam for his boldness to tell the truth about the party's (Congress) icon (Nehru)."
