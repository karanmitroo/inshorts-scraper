After Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu along with 32 other MLAs of the Peopleâ€™s Party of Arunachal (PPA) joined the BJP, the PPA on Saturday alleged the BJP hijacked its government. "Now it has become clear that Khandu and his supporters, who had originally belonged to the Congress, used the PPA as a transit camp," PPA Chairman Khafa Bengia stated.
