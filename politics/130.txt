Former Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid has accused PM Narendra Modi of never telling the opposition parties the truth about Pakistan. Claiming that India's policy on the neighbouring country is a dead-end, the Congress leader said PM Modi never disclosed his meeting with Pakistan and what they were promising. "Giving it back to them" is not a good policy, he added.
