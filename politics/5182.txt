Former Arunachal Pradesh Governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa has claimed that former Chief Minister Kalikho Pul had left behind "secret notes" of 60 pages with content so "explosive" that it can cause "tremors in Indian politics". Rajkhowa said he has not seen the notes himself. Pul was found dead in his home less than a month after being unseated as CM.
