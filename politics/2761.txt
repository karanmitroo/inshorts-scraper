Taking a dig at Lalu Prasad Yadav, BJP leader Sushil Modi on Sunday tweeted that the RJD leader was so shocked at Yogi Adityanath becoming the UP CM that he does not know how to react. Yadav responded by mocking Modi for not being invited to the swearing-in ceremony. Modi, however, later tweeted about being present at the ceremony.
