Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the cancellation of AAP's office allotment was part of a larger design to "finish" the party, adding that Aam Aadmi Party was ready to operate from the "streets". The office allotment to AAP by the Kejriwal government was cancelled by Lieutenant Governor after the Shunglu Committee pointed out 'irregularities' in the allotment.
