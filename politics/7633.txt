The BJP hit back at former PM Manmohan Singh on Friday over his criticism of the Modi government’s policies, saying that India’s economic problems are Singh’s “gift to the nation”. Earlier, Singh had criticised the BJP government for being unable to benefit from falling oil prices and “fortuitous circumstances” to boost the rate of investment in the country.
