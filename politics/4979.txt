Shiv Sena has warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to roll black the demonetisation of old currency notes or the government may face a rollback themselves. "Not a single one of them (the rich) has been caught, nor are they standing in long queues...All political parties must join hands...for a roll back of the scheme," party leader Sanjay Raut asserted.
