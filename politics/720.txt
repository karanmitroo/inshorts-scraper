After BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra termed PM Narendra Modi as "desh ka baap", Congress on Saturday demanded that PM Modi should apologise for the 'insult' to the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi. He should show courage by expelling Patra like Congress expelled Mani Shankar Aiyar for his 'neech aadmi' remark, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.
