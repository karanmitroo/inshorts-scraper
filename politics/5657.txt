Union Cabinet Minister of Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal has said that the SAD-BJP government in Punjab will again “create history” by winning the Assembly elections for the third consecutive time next year. The alliance will be voted back because it has worked hard for Punjab's future with an agenda of “development, development, and yet more development”, she added.
