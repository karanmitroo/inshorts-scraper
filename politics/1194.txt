The Madras High Court has summoned Election Commission in a case in which the DMK has alleged violation of poll procedure in an assembly by-election that the AIADMK won. The HC has asked the EC to explain if it had authorised the doctor attending on Jayalalithaa to attest her thumb impression affixed on the election form of AIADMK's AK Bose.
