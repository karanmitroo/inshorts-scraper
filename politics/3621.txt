BSP supremo Mayawati has accused the BJP of "deceiving" people through its "false promises" and claimed that BJP would withdraw caste-based reservation if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh. Adding that the BJP-led Centre has not fulfilled even one-fourth of its promises, Mayawati said the Centre has been doing drama in the name of surgical strikes and fighting black money.
