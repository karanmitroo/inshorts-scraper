Following Navjot Kaur Sidhu's resignation from the party, Punjab BJP chief Vijay Sampla on Sunday said his party "tolerated" the indiscipline of the Sidhu couple for too long, which wasn't the party's "obligation". "Everyone today knows... that they never felt suffocated in BJP. She (Navjot Kaur) continued speaking against the party even when she was part of it", he added.
