Congress leader Ashok Gehlot on Monday said had the former Madhya Pradesh CM Digvijaya Singh focused on state affairs, the party would have been in a stronger position there. "Singh became inactive in state politics after his tenure as the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister ended," Gehlot said while responding to Digvijaya's suggestion that he should become active in national politics.
