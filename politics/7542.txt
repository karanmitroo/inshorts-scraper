Congress MP Pramod Tiwari on Friday said that 'Freedom 251', the â‚¹251 smartphone launched on February 16, was a "fraud" and objected to the presence of BJP leaders at its launch. "This is a scam in which leaders of BJP are involved. They talk about 'Make in India' but what they are doing is 'Make in Fraud'", Tiwari said.
