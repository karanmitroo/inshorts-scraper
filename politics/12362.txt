Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik on Sunday extended its support to Jaganmohan Reddy in the fight against carving out Telangana. Patnaik said - "The division of a state should be done through consensus and not for narrow political interests." Patnaik's assurance comes four days after Reddy met Mamata Banerjee, and urged the party to oppose the Telangana Bill in Parliament.
