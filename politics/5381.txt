BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh on Sunday said that the ‘bad product’ Congress would gain nothing in 2017 UP polls even if it ropes in party president Sonia Gandhi’s daughter Priyanka Gandhi. The people of Uttar Pradesh have rejected the Congress and have now decided to vote for the BJP for the state's development, he added.
