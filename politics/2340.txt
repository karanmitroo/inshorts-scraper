The Delhi BJP on Saturday said it has lodged a police complaint against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for dubbing the Election Commission as 'Dhritarashtra', and over "misleading" hoardings put up by the AAP. Slamming the poll body over tampering of EVMs, Kejriwal had said the Election Commission acted like 'Dhritarashtra' to help son 'Duryodhana' (BJP) win the recent Assembly elections.
