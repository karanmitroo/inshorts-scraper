The Election Commission on Monday asked poll officers in Uttar Pradesh to file FIR against the editorial heads of media group Dainik Jagran for violating the code of conduct by publishing an exit poll. It was a violation of Section 126 A and B of the Representation of the People Act, which bars media houses from publishing exit polls.
