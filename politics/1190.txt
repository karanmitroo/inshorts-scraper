Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took to Twitter to react to senior BJP leader and former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha's column slamming the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre's financial policies. "Ladies & Gentlemen, this is your copilot & FM speaking. Plz fasten your seat belts & take brace position. The wings have fallen off our plane," Gandhi tweeted.
