The Bharatiya Janata Party has released its own 'Khau Sena' cartoon, inspired by Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's mascot, for the upcoming Mumbai civic polls. Replacing the leo with a tiger, the cartoon series launched unofficially by BJP workers features senior and junior tigers symbolising Uddhav and Aditya Thackeray and takes a dig at Shiv Sena's mismanagement and corruption in BMC.
