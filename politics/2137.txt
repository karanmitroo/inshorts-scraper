BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday tweeted, "I am a strong critic of Mamata's suicidal M appeasement policy. But let us not forget she single handedly terminated an entrenched CPM (sic)". His remark came after BJP leader in West Bengal, Shyamapada Mondal, called state CM Mamata Banerjee a eunuch, stating she is practising the politics of appeasement.
