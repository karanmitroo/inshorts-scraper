Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused the Centre of helping black money holders by amending the income tax law to return 50% of the unaccounted cash to them. This comes after the Lok Sabha passed an amended tax law, under which black money declarants will have to pay 50% tax, including surcharge and penalty.
