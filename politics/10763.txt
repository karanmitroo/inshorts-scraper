Railway minister DV Sadananda Gowda's son Karthik Gowda was booked on charges of rape after a woman, claiming to be his wife, complained against him. The woman is a small-time model and a Kannada actress. Though Karthik, who got engaged on Wednesday, has denied all such claims, a case has been booked under IPC section 376 (rape) and 420 (cheating).
