Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde has said it was "partly true" that the controversial chikki and khichdi deals were made on a rate contract basis though such purchases were banned for contracts worth Rs.1 crore and above. Mundeâ€™s statement came after the Bombay HC sought her reply in chikki contracts worth Rs.206 crore cleared by her department in one day.
