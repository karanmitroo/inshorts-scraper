Bhartiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said that the non-deserving and useless people are returning their awards. "They do not deserve the award and it is good that they have returned it," Swamy said. Protesting against the rising intolerance in India under the current NDA government, around 40 renowned writers have returned their awards.
