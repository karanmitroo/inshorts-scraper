Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the only non-Congress politician to be elected as the country's Prime Minister thrice. He held the office for 13 days in 1996, for about a year in 1998-99, and completed a five-year term after he was elected in 1999 again. Vajpayee, also the only non-Congress PM to complete a full term, turned 92 on December 25.
