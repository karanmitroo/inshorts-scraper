Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah has alleged that mismanagement by the previous BJP government has led to flood-related problems in Bengaluru amid heavy rainfall. He said that the BJP government had failed to clear encroachments and improve basic infrastructure during its tenure. The Congress-led state government is taking all necessary precautions to ensure that such tragedies do not occur, he added.
