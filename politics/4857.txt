PM Narendra Modi's younger brother, Prahlad Modi on Sunday asked the Teli community to prefix "Modi" to their names, saying that Narendra Modi is the pride of this community. He further alleged that leaders of this community use names of sub-caste for selfish gains. "If we start with 'Modi', our community's population will add up to 14 crore," he added.
