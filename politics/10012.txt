Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday that his party was considering contesting the Delhi polls to be held next month. "We are thinking about contesting the Delhi polls. A final decision will be taken soon. However, there has been no talk so far on a poll alliance with anyone," he said. The party is BJP's ally in Maharashtra.
