Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh on Tuesday alleged that the Akali Dal was deliberately trying to promote AAP with the hope of dividing the anti-incumbency votes during the 2017 polls. Referring to a recent protest by AAP against the SAD-BJP government, Singh contended that the two parties were just playing a "friendly match" as they are feeling threatened by Congress.
