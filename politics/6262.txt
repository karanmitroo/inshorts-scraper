Jammu and Kashmir BJP leader Hina Bhatt on Saturday said the separatists have always backed the terrorist groups. "[T]he protests continue to take place one after another and innocent get killed," she added. Her statements came after separatists called for a shutdown in J&K following the death of Hizbul Mujahideen's top commander Burhan Muzaffar Wani in an encounter on Friday.
