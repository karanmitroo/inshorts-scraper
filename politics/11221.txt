Ulf Holm, head of the Swedish India friendship group in the Swedish parliament, on Sunday said that the Nordic country will engage openly with Narendra Modi as India votes for change. "Hopefully Modi has realized that the riots in Gujarat were wrong and a blot on his governance and he won't allow a repeat of it," Holm added.
