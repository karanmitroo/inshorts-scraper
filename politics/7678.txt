Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said that the state government is not planning to exempt foreigners from the beef ban as there are no such provisions in the act passed in 2015. This comes two days after Khattar expressed his openness towards relaxing the ban for foreigners. The Congress alleged that the CM is politicising the issue.
