Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi saying that his full name is Negative Dalit Man, meaning Dalit virodhi (against Dalit). "Modi has been resorting to a lot of 'nautanki' (drama) by calling himself the adopted son of Uttar Pradesh," Mayawati added. This comes after Modi termed the BSP as Behenji Sampatti Party.
