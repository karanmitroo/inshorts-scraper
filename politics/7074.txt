Trinamool Congress on Sunday announced an internal probe into a sting operation by 'Narada News', that showed the party's leaders accepting bribes. TMC leaders including CM Mamata Banerjee had earlier slammed it as a “conspiracy”. Further, the party accused the CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury of being allegedly involved with IVRCL, which was constructing the recently collapsed flyover.
