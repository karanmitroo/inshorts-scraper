Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh has said he would not mind being called a villain as long as party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is with him. Moreover, he also added that he won't mind his expulsion from the party but would feel bad if Mulayam discarded him from his heart. Singh had earlier said he wasn't behind the Akhilesh-Mulayam rift.
