Former Kerala Finance Minister KM Mani-led Kerala Congress (M) on Thursday was recognised as a separate bloc in the Kerala Assembly by the Speaker. The party had recently severed its 30-year-old ties with the Congress-led UDF Opposition in Kerala. This comes as a setback to the UDF, whose strength in the 140-member Assembly will now come down to 41.
