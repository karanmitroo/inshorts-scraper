Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said that "political intolerance" is a genetic trait of the Congress. Giving the examples of Emergency and the exodus as well as genocide of the Kashmiri pundits, Naidu said, â€œCongress talking about intolerance is like devil quoting scriptures." He added that Congress' ongoing campaign was aimed at derailing developmental momentum in the country.
