BJP leader Narottam Patel has said that Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel is upset over not being appointed in-charge of the departments of his choice. "This is a mistake, and must be rectified," he added. Earlier, Patidar leader Hardik Patel had offered Nitin a "good position" in the Congress if he, along with 10 other MLAs, quits the BJP.
