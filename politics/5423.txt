Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has called the surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Army across the Line of Control as fake. "Every Indian wants surgical strikes against Pakistan but not a fake one," Nirupam tweeted. "I respect the Indian armed forces, but the way the political gains are being usurped by the BJP it is wrong," he added.
