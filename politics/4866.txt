Criticising the government over its demonetisation policy, Patidar community leader Hardik Patel has urged his community members to uproot the BJP in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly polls. “Those in power must not forget that if you bring tears in the eyes of farmers, youths and labourers, a revolution would come and people in power would be thrown out,” he added.
