Backing Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's remark on Muslims' votes, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said, "We are the government of 100% people, that includes Muslims." Prasad had said though Muslims don't vote for BJP, the government is giving them "proper sanctity". "After polls, we don't see who all voted for us, so what Prasad is saying is correct," Swamy added.
