Social activist Anna Hazare has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not reply to the 30 letters that he had written to him over the last few years as he has "an ego of his prime ministership". Hazare, who led 'India Against Corruption' movement in 2011, has recently announced plans to start another agitation in New Delhi from March.
