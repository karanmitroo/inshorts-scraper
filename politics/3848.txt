Sitting MLA from Sahibabad (Uttar Pradesh) Amar Pal Sharma, who was earlier expelled from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), joined the Congress on Tuesday. Sharma was expelled on Monday from the BSP for allegedly indulging in "anti-party activities". A BSP leader said that the party workers were upset with Sharma for not giving enough time to his constituency.
