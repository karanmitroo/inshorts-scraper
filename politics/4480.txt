BJP President Amit Shah on Friday called SP, BSP and Congress "saapnath" and "naagnath" (poisonous snakes), alleging they were stalling Uttar Pradesh's development and forcing its youth to migrate to other states for menial jobs. He further criticised the UP government and said that the central assistance to the state was "usurped by chacha-bhatija" (Shivpal and Akhilesh).
