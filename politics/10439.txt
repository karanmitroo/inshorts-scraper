Karnataka's leader of opposition in Vidhana Parishad KS Eshwarappa has struck a controversy by saying that the state's Home Minister and Chief Minister do not consider everyone as their own. “Don't think HM or CM considers everyone as their own. Maybe when their own daughters are raped they might act differently,” Eshwarappa said. The comment has got much criticism.
