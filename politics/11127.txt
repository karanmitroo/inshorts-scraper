With the arrest of four gangsters, Bangalore police have busted a plot to assassinate MIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, sources said. The gang, that had reportedly taken 'supari' (or a contract) to assassinate the MIM leader, was trying to gather information from their counterparts in Bangalore. Notably, Owaisi had escaped an assassination attempt in Hyderabad in 2011.
