Union Minister Vijay Goel has favoured unification of three MCDs — North, South and East — in order to deliver the services more effectively. "Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged," he said. MCD was trifurcated into EDMC, NDMC and SDMC in 2012.
