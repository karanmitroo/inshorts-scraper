Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is crossing all limits of morality by speaking a lie in shameless fashion. "Today, Narendra Modi's government is working with honesty... but Rahul Gandhi is troubled because the corrupt people, whose money is at stake, most of them have the protection of the Congress," Prasad added.
