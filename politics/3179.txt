The Congress has moved the Election Commission seeking withdrawal and de-recognition of the BJP's poll symbol "lotus" over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Diwali, Ramzan discrimination" remark. "If there's electricity during Ramzan, then it must also be available during Diwali," Modi had said. Congress leader KC Mittal termed Modi's remark as provoking people's feeling and violation of the court.
