An Iranian student has filed a complaint that he was beaten up in JNU during celebrations after India's victory over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Sunday. While members of BJP's student wing ABVP were mentioned among the 10 accused in the complaint, the organisation countered the allegations, saying its members were manhandled by those not happy with India's win.
