DMK working president MK Stalin on Monday alleged that the ruling AIADMK government led by Chief Minister E Palaniswami is worried more about the RK Nagar by-polls than farmer issues. "Farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have extended their support for Tamil farmers... Even BJP minister Pon Radhakrishnan met the farmers but our CM is least bothered," Stalin added.
