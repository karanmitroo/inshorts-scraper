Congress spokesperson Shashi Tharoor on Sunday applauded PM Narendra Modi's speech at the United Nations. "Strong speech by @PMOIndia at #UNGA2014. Soaring internationalism, support for democracy & environment, anti-terrorism. Good reply to Pak," Tharoor tweeted. On the other hand, he also said it was unfortunate for an Indian PM to "refer to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir as Pakistan".
