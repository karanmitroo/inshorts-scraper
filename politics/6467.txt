A BJP MLA on Saturday cross-voted for an SP candidate in the Uttar Pradesh Rajya Sabha elections. “I voted on the basis of development done by the Chief Minister and I am ready to make any sacrifice,” Vijay Bahadur Yadav said. While BJP MLA Krishna Paswan alleged she was prevented from voting, MLA Sangeet Som claimed misbehaviour with his legislators.
