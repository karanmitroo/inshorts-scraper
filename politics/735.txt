Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Thursday called PM Narendra Modi a "neech" (despicable) and uncultured man. This was in response to PM Modi's suggestion that the Nehru-Gandhi family had attempted to erase BR Ambedkar's contributions in nation building. Aiyar accused PM Modi of playing dirty politics in the name of the Dalit leader.
