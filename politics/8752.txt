Congress on Saturday accused the Narendra Modi government of not having a coherent approach in its Pakistan policy. "We would advise the government... unless there are firm assurances of tangible deliverables and outcome, there is no purpose (in going ahead with the talks)," Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said. He also accused Pakistan of using Hurriyat to derail the NSA-level talks.
