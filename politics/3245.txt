Former MP from Nagpur Jambuwantrao Dhote, also known as the 'Lion of Vidarbha', passed away on Saturday following a heart attack. Elected to the Lok Sabha in 1972, the 78-year-old leader was a strong supporter of a separate state of Vidarbha. Dhote was also a two-time MLA from Yavatmal, starting his political career with Forward Bloc and later joining Congress.
