Former Karnataka CM SM Krishna said, "Any political party that neglects seniors will have no future." The statement comes after Krishna resigned from the Congress after a five-decade association with the party. "But my self-respect, pride and seniority are precious values. Generations can change, but values cannot change. I have quit Congress with immense pain and agony," he said.
