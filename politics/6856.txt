The BSP on Thursday alleged that there was a "fix match" going on between the BJP and the SP in Uttar Pradesh. "It is for this reason that in spite of the fact that Ram Shankar Katheria (BJP Minister) had also used language of hate against the minority community... no action has been taken," BSP leader Sudheendra Bhadauria said.
