The opposition on Thursday blamed the Maharashtra government for the goof-up at a Martyrs Day event wherein Bhagat Singh's photo was labelled Sukhdev. "Those in power now have nothing to do with... the glorious history of our freedom struggle," NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis was present at the event to pay tributes to the freedom fighters.
