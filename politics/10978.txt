JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar Saturday appealed to arch-rival Lalu Prasad, besides Congress and CPI for support to ensure victory of party candidates in the bypoll for two Rajya Sabha seats in Bihar on Jun-19. “I am making a public appeal to Laluji to frustrate game plan of BJP which is supporting the rebel JDU legislators sponsored independent candidates,” Nitish said.
