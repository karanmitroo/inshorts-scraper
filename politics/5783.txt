Tripura Assembly Speaker Ramendra Debnath has allowed six Congress MLAs who had joined TMC in May to retain their membership. The speaker, after hearing MLAs' views and also consulting legal experts, decided they do not come under the anti-defection law. Meanwhile, Congress expressed disappointment over the Speaker's orders and said it was 'politically motivated'.
