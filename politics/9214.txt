Speaking in support of PM Narendra Modi, Shiv Sena on Monday said that even 100 Rahul Gandhis cannot match Modi's "mega wave". "Rahul Gandhi has started moving and speaking after his 56-day sabbatical... However, the question is how long this renewed energy will last before mega wave of Narendra Modi," an editorial in the party's mouthpiece 'Saamana' read.
