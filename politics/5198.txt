Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh on Monday alleged that Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal were treating the state's ex-servicemen "as pawns on their political chessboard". "The Badals have a history of ill-treating ex-servicemen and the families of martyrs," he said. Singh also called the inauguration of a war memorial in Amritsar a "political gimmickry".
