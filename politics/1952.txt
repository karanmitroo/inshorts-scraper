Karnataka BJP President BS Yeddyurappa, who visited the house of a Dalit family in Tumakuru district on Friday, has been accused of eating food from hotel instead of the meal prepared at the house. A complaint with State Home Minister G Parameshwara has alleged that Yeddyurappa's refusal to eat the food cooked in a Dalit household amounted to caste discrimination.
