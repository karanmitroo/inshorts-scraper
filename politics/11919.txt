Activist Irom Sharmila (42), who has been on a fast for the last 14 years, Friday rejected AAP's offer to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls under its banner from Inner Manipur seat. "Politics according to me is uncertain and vague as the people cannot keep their faith and trust on the politicians all the time," said Sharmila.
