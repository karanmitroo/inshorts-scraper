A group of Congress workers sold tomatoes at ₹10 per kilogram outside the Uttar Pradesh assembly on Thursday. The workers claimed that the move was in protest against the rising prices of the vegetable. Crop damage in tomato-producing states had caused a shortage leading to the price rising above ₹100 per kilogram in some areas.
