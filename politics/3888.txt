Terming BR Ambedkar a "bigger leader" than Mahatma Gandhi, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday said it was the Constitution, given by Ambedkar, which has ensured justice in the society. Ambedkar's secular and class-free Constitution has controlled the level of injustice in the country, otherwise, RSS would not have left any opportunity to spoil the situation, Owaisi added.
