AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday said that the day is not far when the Modi government will nationalise all banks. His remark came after the government announced that banks will mark those exchanging old currency at counters with indelible ink to avoid the crowd. The process is similar to the indelible ink used in elections to tag voters.
