In a major setback to Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, the Patna High Court on Monday restrained his government from taking any policy decisions. The court further said the CM can only work on routine matters till majority is proved on the floor of the House. Earlier, the state Governor had asked Manjhi to prove majority on Feb 20.
