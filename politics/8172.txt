Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said on Sunday that Assam Governor Padmanabha Balakrishna Acharya should be replaced with a 'permanent' governor by the Centre. Gogoi claimed that Acharya had broken his oath by reportedly saying that India was for Hindus, and added that a "person with a broad mind should be appointed" instead. Acharya presently holds an additional charge.
