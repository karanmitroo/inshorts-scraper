Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on Monday said the Centre's "inadequate response" to the apprehension and detention of Indian fishermen "has emboldened the Sri Lankan Navy to harass" them. Seeking a "robust diplomatic response", she wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking up the latest instance of the arrest of 28 Indian fishermen from the state.
