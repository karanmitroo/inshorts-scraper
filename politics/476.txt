A day before Congress President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Amethi, a poster put up in the city showed Gandhi as Lord Ram and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the ten-headed Ravana. The inscription on the poster stated that Gandhi was an incarnation of Lord Ram and will bring 'Ram Rajya' in 2019 by winning the General election.
