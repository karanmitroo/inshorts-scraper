Saying that Home Minister Rajnath Singh is an "object of pity" in the Narendra Modi-led government, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday said that if Rajnath has any "Kshatriya pride" left, he must quit. "Neither any (important) file goes to him (Rajnath) nor he takes decisions in the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet", Digvijaya said.
