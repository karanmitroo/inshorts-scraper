RSS ideologue and notable Chartered Accountant S Gurumurthy has said that the new ₹2,000 notes will be phased out within next five years. He added that the ₹2,000 note was introduced only as a bridge to meet the gap in cash being taken out of circulation. Gurumurthy further claimed that the government was committed to moving towards smaller denomination notes.
