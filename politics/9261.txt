BJP legislative leader Vijendra Gupta on Wednesday said that the Delhi government has the power to recruit 99% of its staff except transfer and postings of IAS and IPS officers. The statement comes after the row between Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and CM Arvind Kejriwal over the appointment of officials.
