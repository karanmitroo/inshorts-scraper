AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal has filed a complaint with the SC/ST commission against Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash for making casteist remarks. The legislator claimed when Prakash was questioned about lack of facilities in a particular area, he replied, "Maine Daliton ki thekedaari nahi le rakhi." Earlier, Prakash alleged he was manhandled by AAP MLAs at CM Arvind Kejriwal's residence.
