Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said it was unrealistic of BJP to expect Congress to facilitate the passage of the GST bill in the Monsoon session. "Government cannot do constitutional murder in Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Meghalaya and expect GST (bill) to be passed," Ramesh added. He further accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "poisoning" the political atmosphere.
