Shiv Sena activists on Thursday held protests outside writer Shobhaa De's residence alleging that her tweets opposing mandatory screening of Marathi films were 'anti-Maharashtra'. Further reacting to De's tweets, Sena said, "Had Bal Thackeray not done 'dadagiri' to preserve Marathi culture, her forefathers would have been born in Pakistan and she would have attended Page-3 parties in a burqa."
