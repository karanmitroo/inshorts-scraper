A BJP tribal worker in Gujarat's Chhota Udepur district got a new toilet facility, a wash basin, an LPG stove and a couple of coolers from the party before BJP President Amit Shah's visit. The worker, Popatbhai Rathwa, had dinner with Shah on Tuesday night, as part of the latter's strategy to connect with the masses.
