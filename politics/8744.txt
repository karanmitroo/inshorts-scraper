The Aam Admi Party on Saturday suspended two of its Punjab MPs, Dharamavira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa, from primary membership of the party for anti-party activities. â€œBoth MPs held a parallel rally at Baba Bakala near Amritsar today despite our requests that this would amount to anti-party activity", Punjab AAP convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur said.
