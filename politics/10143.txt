The BJP on Wednesday criticized SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav for saying he would not allow UP to be won by PM Narendra Modi. Slamming Mulayam, BJP state spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, "Instead of using such arrogant language against the ruling party and its PM, he is better advised to give sermons to his CM son."
