Congress would provide free treatment to cancer patients in Punjab if voted to power, state party chief Amarinder Singh said on Wednesday. Calling the treatment very expensive, he said, â€œIt is a double whammy for the families... they lose their near and dear ones and... they are financially broke." Congress would also pay-off all farmers' outstanding loans, Singh said.
