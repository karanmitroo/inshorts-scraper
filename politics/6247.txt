Ex-Mumbai Police Commissioner and sitting BJP MP Satyapal Singh on Saturday said the Mumbai Police had sent a report "questioning" Islamic cleric Zakir Naik's activities to the then UPA government in 2008, but no action was taken on it. The activities of Naik's trust and its funding are currently under the Centre's scanner for allegedly "attracting" youths towards terrorism.
