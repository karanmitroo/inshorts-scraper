Congress on Friday gave a plea to the Election Commission over Narendra Modi's affidavits on his marital status. "In his affidavit in Vadodara, Modi informed that he is married. Prior to that, none of his affidavits mention this. It is hence proven those affidavits were wrong," Congress leader Kapil Sibal said after lodging the complaint.
