Senior AIADMK leader C Ponnaiyan on Sunday said that the party will elect its new General Secretary soon in a decision that will be taken unanimously. "Party remained united under Amma and will follow the same in coming days," Ponnaiyan added. Notably, the party's General Secretary's post was earlier held by J Jayalalithaa, who passed away on December 5.
