Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia has said that they will continue with religious re-conversion until central govt ban the practise. Claiming that conversions resulted in the "dwindling" of Hindu's population, the Hindu-outfit leader added, "We want the govt to either ban religious conversions or allow us to go ahead with our re-conversion programmes."
