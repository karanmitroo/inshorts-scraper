The Centre on Thursday defended the detention of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. Both of them were detained when they were going to meet the kin of an ex-serviceman who had committed suicide. "[The Police] did not beat up anyone...For maintaining law and order, some actions have to be taken," MoS for Home Hansraj Ahir said.
