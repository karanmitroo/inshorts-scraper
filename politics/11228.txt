Narendra Modi on Sunday hit back at the Election Commission (EC) - which had earlier ordered the filing of an FIR against him for violating election laws - and dared it to file "another case against him". â€œIf the EC doesn't like what I am saying, they can file another case against me," said Mr Modi.
