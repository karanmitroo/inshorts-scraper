All Punjab Congress MLAs have resigned on Thursday after the Supreme Court held the state government's law to terminate a water-sharing agreement with Haryana as "unconstitutional". Notably, senior Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh, who was the Chief Minister of the state when the law to terminate the water-sharing agreement was made, has also resigned as an MP over the verdict.
