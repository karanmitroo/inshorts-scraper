After rebel AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran won the RK Nagar bypolls, DMK working President MK Stalin on Sunday said the electoral result was a Himalayan loss for the Election Commission. Adding that it was not his party's loss, he tweeted, "Everyone should ask themselves whether giving out cash helps democracy". DMK candidate Maruthu Ganesh N stood third with 24,651 votes.
