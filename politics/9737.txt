Trinamool Congress (TMC) General Secretary Mukul Roy Sunday rubbished reports that he was forming a new political party, saying, "I do not want to comment on matters which are not related to reality." His comment comes a day after the party chief Mamata Banerjee appointed her close-aide Subrata Bakshi to the post of General Secretary, in addition to Roy.
