Defending the practice of polygamy, Congress leader Ibrahim Kodijal has said that to stop the husband from proceeding to a sex worker, it's essential that polygamy was allowed. “It is necessary for a man to satisfy his sexual desires,” he added. Polygamy is only allowed in Islam if a man is physically and financially sound, he further explained.
