Congress President Sonia Gandhi has removed Ashok Choudhary from his post as President of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee. This comes days after Choudhary accused party insiders of fuelling a rebellion against him using "fake propaganda" that he was trying to split the party in JD(U)'s favour. Kaukab Quadri will be acting President till a new chief is announced.
