The BJP on Wednesday claimed that it had the support of at least five more MLAs from the Congress-led alliance, who are ready to switch over to the BJP's side. This includes "some occupying ministerial positions", BJP leader Munna Singh Chauhan said. Earlier, nine other Congress MLAs had switched sides, leaving the state in political turmoil.
