Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said the BJP-led Centre "totally disapproves" of the hacking of Rahul Gandhi's Twitter account and appropriate action will be taken against culprits. Reacting to the allegations that the hacking was done to divert attention from demonetisation, Prasad added that such notion is "worrying". Notably, Congress' Twitter account was also hacked on Thursday.
