After Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash alleged that he was assaulted by AAP MLAs during a meeting, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said AAP had become synonymous with anarchy. Alleging that the MLAs attacked Prakash on the direction of CM Kejriwal, Patra claimed that a "constitutional crisis" has gripped Delhi. AAP denied the allegations and accused Prakash of using casteist slurs.
