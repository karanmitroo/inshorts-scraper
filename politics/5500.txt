BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said Pakistanâ€™s nuclear bomb may kill around 10 crore Indians, but when India will retaliate then entire Pakistan will be wiped off. Speaking at an ABP News show, he further added that war with Pakistan has begun but the announcement hasn't been made yet. Swamy had earlier favoured surgical bombardment at terror camps in PoK.
