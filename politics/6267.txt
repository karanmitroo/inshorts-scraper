Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday allocated portfolios to the 10 newly sworn-in ministers in the state Council and reshuffled certain portfolios of the existing members. Among others, BJP's Chandrakant Patil was given the Revenue Department, earlier held by Eknath Khadse who resigned from the Council last month over corruption charges. Previously, Patil held the cooperation portfolio.
