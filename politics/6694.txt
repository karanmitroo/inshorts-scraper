BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday claimed "we will start the construction of Ram Temple (in Ayodhya)" by the end of this year. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, however, countered the claim, saying "it is just not possible". Further, Swamy also asserted that the government will repeal Article 370, giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir, by the end of 2017.
