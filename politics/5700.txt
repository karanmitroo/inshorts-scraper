Home Minister Rajnath Singh-led all-party delegation's two-day visit to J&K concluded on Tuesday with allegedly no breakthrough on the Kashmir issue. Before concluding the visit, Singh condemned the separatists for refusing to meet the delegation, stating they donâ€™t believe in Kashmiriyat, humanity and democracy. He also said the delegation would meet in Delhi and discuss the future action plan.
