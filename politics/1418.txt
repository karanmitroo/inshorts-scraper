Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday credited the current narrative of nationalism to Shiv Sena Founder Bal Thackeray's ideology of putting the country first. Adding that he respects the role Thackeray played in public life, Jaitley said, "What he kept saying all his life since the 1960s, is being accepted today." He also praised Thackeray for being a "gifted communicator".
