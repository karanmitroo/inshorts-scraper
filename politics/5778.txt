The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has reportedly decided not to act against its rebel lawmakers before 2017 Punjab Assembly polls to avoid opening “another front”. The action against them would mean diverting the party's energy from the campaign, reports stated. Notably, sacking the lawmakers would mean "freedom" from the ambit of the anti-defection law.
