An unidentified assailant on Tuesday midnight hurled a crude bomb at the BJP state committee office at Kunnukuzhy in Kerala and sped away on a bike thereafter. "We strongly believe that CPM activists were behind the incident and it was [a] well-planned move," said BJP state committee office's Public Relations Officer. However, no injuries were reported in the incident.
