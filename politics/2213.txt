The AIADMK faction led by O Panneerselvam (OPS) on Tuesday demanded that Sasikala Natarajan's portraits be removed from the party headquarters. This comes after the Panneerselvam camp sought removal of Sasikala, her nephew TTV Dhinakaran and their family members from the AIADMK prior to merger talks with the faction led by CM Edappadi K Palaniswami.
