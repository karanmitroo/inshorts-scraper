Puducherry Lieutenant Governor and retired IPS officer Kiran Bedi went on a scooter ride around the city at night to check for herself how safe the place is for women. Bedi, who was riding pillion, used her dupatta to partially cover her face to avoid being recognised. "Found Puducherry reasonably safe at night. But will be improved," she tweeted later.
