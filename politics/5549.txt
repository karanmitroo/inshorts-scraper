Former West Bengal Congress President Manas Bhunia, who was associated with the party for 46 years, quit Congress to join the ruling Trinamool Congress on Monday. Bhunia has reportedly blamed Congress General Secretary CP Joshi's inaction for quitting the party. Last week, he had hailed state CM Mamata Banerjee for the returning of lands to farmers in Singur.
