Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra on Monday broke his fast at the RML Hospital in New Delhi, on the sixth day of his hunger strike. "Those who are making fun of me let me tell you that I came to hospital after five days of hunger strike. Kejriwalji goes to hospital after 15 days of coughing," Mishra said.
