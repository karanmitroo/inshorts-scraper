The BJP has released a campaign advertisement mentioning the name 'Yuvraj', apparently targeting Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi ahead of Gujarat assembly polls. The ad shows a shopkeeper refusing to give his vote to Yuvraj as his shop was burnt down in riots during the Congress regime. This comes after the Election Commission barred a BJP advertisement mentioning 'Pappu'.
