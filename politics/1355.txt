The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed CM Arvind Kejriwal's plea against the single-judge bench's decision to expedite the hearing of a defamation case filed against him by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The court also stated that Kejriwal's request does "disservice to the cause of justice in the long run."
