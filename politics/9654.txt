The Rajya Sabha was briefly adjourned Thursday after opposition members protested against comments by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat who said Mother Teresa worked to convert people to Christianity. JDU leader Sharad Pawar said, "A one-line resolution should be brought to condemn the remarks." Also, TMC's Derek O'Brien said, "It's an 'insult' to all Bharat Ratna recipients as well as Parliament."
