Gopal Chaudhary, an independent candidate from Agra South, has said that he is only contesting the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections to earn and invest money and added that he has no poll agenda. "A person who becomes a PM by fooling so many people must be very talented... Just like that, I will also fool people," Chaudhary added.
