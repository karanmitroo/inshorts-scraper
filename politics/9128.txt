Reacting to JD(U) MLA Anant Kumar's arrest in alleged kidnapping and murder case, party chief and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Friday said that his government won't shield any law-breaker. "The government doesn't work under anybody's pressure. Law is equal for everybody," Nitish said. "Till the time I'm at the helm of affairs, rule of law will prevail...," he added.
