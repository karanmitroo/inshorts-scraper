Explaining why he resigned as Bihar Chief Minister, JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said he quit in the interest of the state. "I want Bihar's welfare and I tried to keep the alliance intact, but it didn't work," he added. Kumar has resigned citing a crisis in the ruling Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance as the reason.
