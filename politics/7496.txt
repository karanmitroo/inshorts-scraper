Rejecting the Opposition's demand for sacking of Union Minister Ram Shankar Katheria, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said there was nothing "objectionable" in Katheria's speech, calling the media reports "distorted and incorrect". Law and order was a state subject and he expected that the Uttar Pradesh government will investigate the case in a "fair and impartial manner", Singh added.
