Congress candidate Sunil Jakhar won the by-elections for Punjab's Gurdaspur constituency, defeating his BJP rival by a margin of over 1.9 lakh votes. The seat, which was earlier held by the BJP, fell vacant in April following MP Vinod Khanna's death. While the BJP candidate Swaran Salaria was second, the AAP candidate Major General (Retd) Suresh Khajuria came third.
