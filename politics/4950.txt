JD(U) MP Sharad Yadav on Wednesday said that the government would not be able to bring back the black money from abroad in the next 10 years. Criticising the governmentâ€™s demonetisation policy, Yadav said that the farmers deal in cash and not in cheques. The move would compel the common man to jump off Rajdhani train, he added.
