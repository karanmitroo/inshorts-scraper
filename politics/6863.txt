Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Chief M Karunanidhi on Wednesday said that he will bring back banned bull-taming sport 'jallikattu' and hold it next year if his party wins the May 16 Assembly elections. Dismissing Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's accusations of "betrayal" by his party on the issue, Karunanidhi claimed he had monitored the proper conduct of the sport in the past.
