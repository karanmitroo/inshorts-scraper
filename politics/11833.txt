Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, UPA government has decided to invoke the emergency powers of the Constitution for promulgating a number of ordinances. These ordinances will cover the bills being pushed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and some others that could not be passed in the concluding session of Parliament. Anti-graft bills are likely to take the ordinance route.
