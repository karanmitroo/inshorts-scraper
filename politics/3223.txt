The Election Commission of India on Friday issued a notice to Sasikala Natarajan on a petition challenging her nomination as the AIADMK General Secretary. The petition was filed by Rajya Sabha MP V Maitreyan, who has declared support for former CM O Panneerselvam. Earlier in the day, Sasikala was removed from the primary membership of AIADMK by the Panneerselvam-led faction.
