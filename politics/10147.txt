Outgoing J&K CM Omar Abdullah Friday asked PDP not to play "mind games" on the issue of support from National Conference. "Looks like PDP is playing mind games with the BJP leaking about a letter of NC support that doesn't exist. Only a verbal offer conveyed," he tweeted. Omar had extended support to PDP for forming a government in J&K.
