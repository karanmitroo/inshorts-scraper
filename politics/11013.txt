Less than a day after quitting Aam Aadmi Party, Anjali Damania has decided to withdraw her resignation. Ms Damania, 45, will continue working as AAP's convener in Maharashtra. AAP leader Mayank Gandhi said lack of communication at various levels and complaints against AAP committee (executive) members by workers had pushed Damania to resign.
