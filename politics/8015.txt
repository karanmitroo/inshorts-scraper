Congress president Sonia Gandhi staged a walkout with party MPs in the Parliament on Friday over the Arunachal Pradesh political turmoil. They were protesting not being allowed to have a say in the matter, and raised slogans like “stop dictatorship”. Earlier, Congress CM Nabam Tuki failed a 'no-confidence motion', and the Guahati High Court stayed all proceedings till February 2016.
