Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi allowing the Pakistani JIT to probe the Pathankot terror attack was his "overture" to secure a "Nobel Peace Prize". Saying the Modi would next attempt to "destablise" the Delhi and Himachal Pradesh governments, Kejriwal dared the BJP to "buy" even a single AAP MLA.
