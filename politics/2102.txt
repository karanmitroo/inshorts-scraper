West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday highlighted her government's achievements in dealing with Maoists in the state. "So far, in West Bengal, 328 Left-wing extremists have surrendered. This includes 111 Maoists in 2017. 205 surrenderees have already been enrolled as Special Home Guards," she said. "Apart from employment, surrendering Maoists get financial incentives," she added.
