BSP chief Mayawati on Wednesday said if PM Narendra Modi is honest, he should share the bank account transaction details of BJP leaders for the past 10 months. Claiming that BJP leaders converted their black money into white before November 8, Mayawati added that Modi is fooling people by asking BJP leaders to submit their bank details post demonetisation announcement.
