The flag of actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan's newly launched party Makkal Needhi Maiam depicts six hands holding onto each other with a six-pointed star in the middle. Speaking at the launch of his party, Haasan said the flag showed the "new map of south India", with the hands representing the south Indian states and the star representing "people's justice".
