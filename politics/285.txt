Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Monday slammed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, saying that he has disrespected the country's Army and martyrs. Bhagwat on Sunday said that unlike the Army which takes 6-7 months to prepare the personnel, the RSS will prepare a military force in 3 days. "The RSS Chief's speech is an insult to every Indian," Rahul Gandhi tweeted.
