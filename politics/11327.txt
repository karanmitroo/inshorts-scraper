The Aam Aadmi Party in Kurnool on Saturday distributed 'Rs Zero' notes to voters to protest against the distribution of cash by other political parties. The zero rupee note carries a pledge for citizens that they would not pay or take bribe and a message that they should not fall for "vote for note" tactic which devalues their invaluable vote.
