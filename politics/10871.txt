Three political parties, besides current ally JMM, want to form alliance with Congress for the coming state assembly elections, Pradip Balmuchu, former Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee President, said Sunday. The parties are, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik), Janata Dal (United) and Trinamool Congress. Theyâ€™d have to choose either JVM or JMM as both cannot co-exist in the alliance, Balmuchu added.
