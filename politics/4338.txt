RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's son and Bihar Minister Tej Pratap on Monday said, "The government will try to ensure total cow slaughter ban." He further said, "Export of cow meat is not coming down because the ban on cow slaughter has been ineffective." He had earlier asked the Centre for an effective ban on cow slaughter across the country.
