Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit on Friday said the MCD polls are a litmus test for the Congress' Delhi unit chief Ajay Maken. "Let us wait for the election results...If Congress wins a good number of seats, then what we are thinking would be proved wrong," she added. Notably, Dikshit's name wasn't in the party's top campaigners list.
