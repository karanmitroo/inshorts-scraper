Responding to the AAP leaderâ€™s comment, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar Wednesday said - "Who is Aam Aadmi Party to decide whether I should be the Prime Ministerial candidate? It is for my party to decide. I can think if party asks me to." The AAP leader had earlier said, BJP should nominate Parrikar and not Modi for the top job.
