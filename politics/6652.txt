Punjab's Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Friday said he filed a defamation case against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his supporters over drug syndicate allegations. Earlier in March, AAP leader Ashish Khetan had accused Majithia of providing personal residence, political patronage and state police official vehicles to facilitate the movement of drug smugglers within Punjab.
