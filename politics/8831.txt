Union Minister Uma Bharti (56) said, “I am not yet married and there is no scope also,” when Speaker Sumitra Mahajan recently addressed her as ‘Shrimati’ by mistake. Bharti also said, “There is no vacancy board now”. Bharti has been called ‘sadhvi’, meaning one who has renounced worldly life, many times now.
