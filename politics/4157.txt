Defending his decision to join BJP, former Congress minister Srinivasa Prasad said, "I have joined BJP and decided to continue in public life to redeem my pride, which was dented by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah." Further, Prasad said, "I have always practised dignified politics without compromising on my self-respect...I cannot tolerate anything that pricks my pride. So I quit Congress."
