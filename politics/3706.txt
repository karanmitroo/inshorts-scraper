Senior Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal on Monday said that the party President Akhilesh Yadav will be the prime ministerial candidate of the non-BJP alliance in the 2019 General Elections. "Our main aim is to form a secular alliance before the 2019 parliamentary elections to prevent communal forces from grabbing power at the centre," he added.
