Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad assaulting an airline staffer was not a matter that called for a disciplinary action, party's MP Sanjay Raut has said. Further, Raut said any person, be it a minister or common man, can lose their temper if someone misbehaved with them. However, reports said Gaikwad has received a 'dressing down' from party chief Uddhav Thackeray.
