Referring to Rajasthan government's new ordinance limiting probes against public servants, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "Madam Chief Minister (Vasundhara Raje), with all humility we are in the 21st century. It's 2017, not 1817." He also shared a news report which claimed that the ordinance barring media from reporting on the probe until sanctioned, was against free speech.
