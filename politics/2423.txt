The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has extended its support to Congress for the by-polls in Madhya Pradesh's Ater Assembly seat to take "revenge" for the former's defeat in Uttar Pradesh elections. The Ater seat was left vacant after the death of former leader of opposition Satyadev Katare. Congress has fielded his son Hemant Katare from Ater to retain the seat.
