Congress President Sonia Gandhi Wednesday slammed PM Narendra Modi for running a one-man government in the country. Alleging that the PMO has all the authority, Sonia said the other ministers don't have real control. Further, she said that the NDA government has done nothing concrete since it came to power last year. "Abroad our country is being criticised...," Sonia added.
