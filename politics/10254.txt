The BJP Delhi corporator Simmi Jain demanded the Election Commission on Sunday to issue orders against the use of the tricolour in parties' flags, as that is an attempt "to attract emotionally and influence psychologically the masses and voters...". She also requested the withdrawal of Congress' hand symbol, as it shows a part of body cut off, instigating violence.
