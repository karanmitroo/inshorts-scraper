Army chiefs should only be allowed to enter politics after a gap of five years following their retirement, former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said on Saturday. "Since Independence, I've never seen an Army Chief making comment on political parties. Army's main role is maintaining the security...It is not their business to look into the political affairs," he added.
