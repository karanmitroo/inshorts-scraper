Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday said that people in Goa will not be treated at hospitals if they do not show a valid ID proof. "Whatever the criticism, I will do it... Our government has to protect the interest of the Goan people. We are not denying anybody treatment, but some charges will be levied," Rane added.
