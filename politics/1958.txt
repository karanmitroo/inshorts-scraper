The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday arrested the Chartered Accountant (CA) of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Misa Bharti in an alleged money laundering case. Reportedly, the CA provided money to Misa's company and his arrest comes after BJP leader Sushil Modi alleged that she laundered money through a shell company to buy a ₹100 crore property at ₹1.4 crore.
