Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Chief Mayawati on Thursday said that there is no bigger Ajmal Kasab or terrorist than Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah. Her remark comes a day after Shah devised 'KASAB' as an acronym for describing Congress, Samajwadi Party, and Bahujan Samaj Party. Mayawati further said that Shah's statement shows the cheapness of the BJP.
