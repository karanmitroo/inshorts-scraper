During a rally on Wednesday, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh told his party leaders that polls cannot be won with 'dabangai' (strong arm tactics). "I want unity in the party and a government with clear majority," he added, referring to the upcoming UP assembly elections in 2017. He further asked party leaders to "back the party", instead of supporting individuals.
