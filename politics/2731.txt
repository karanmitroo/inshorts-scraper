BJP's Lok Sabha MP Kirit Somaiya on Monday said that PM Narendra Modi is the leader who "will emerge in the East, and take India to new heights", as predicted by the French soothsayer Nostradamus. Interestingly, Nostradamus is said to have predicted several historic events, including the rise of Hitler and the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001.
