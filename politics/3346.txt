Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Sunday alleged that students, minorities, Dalits and media are living in fear under the Narendra Modi-led BJP regime. "Most channels today are cheerleaders and most newspapers today are mute. It is a sad state of affairs in a democracy," he added. He, however, praised the regional media for being "independent".
