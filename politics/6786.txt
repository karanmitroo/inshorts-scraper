Delhi University's Registrar Tarun Das on Tuesday clarified that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BA degree, as circulated by BJP, is "authentic". He added that the discrepancies being alleged by AAP in the marksheet "exist in university records as well". Earlier in the day, a delegation of AAP members had also visited Delhi University seeking details of his degree.
