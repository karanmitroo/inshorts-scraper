As the central government is planning an official Raksha Bandhan celebration on August 29, the BJP has asked its workers to launch a campaign to persuade men to gift the government's affordable accident and life insurance schemes to their sisters. BJP president Amit Shah gave this call during a meeting of the party leaders from the southern states on Sunday.
