Questioning the Maharashtra government’s hurry in executing Yakub Memon, NCP leader Majeed Memon on Wednesday said that Yakub was being hanged 'early' because he was a Muslim. "Government of Maharashtra is appearing to be interested in executing this man for political reasons, communal reasons, for extra-legal considerations...,” Majeed, who is a noted criminal lawyer by profession, said.
