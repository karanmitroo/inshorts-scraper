Unhappy with CPI(M)'s alliance with the Congress, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) has said it "would be next to impossible" to stay in the Left Front if the alliance continues. "We are opposed to both Congress and BJP. For us both are equal," the party said. The Left Front consists of 10 parties including CPI(M), CPI, RSP and Forward Bloc.
