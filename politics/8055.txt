Opposition staged a walk out on Friday even as Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that Virendra Singh, the BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh who allegedly made "derogatory " remarks against Congress was supported by the government. Demanding an unconditional apology or Singh's suspension, Kharge added that even the speaker who reportedly expunged the remarks agrees that Singh was wrong.
