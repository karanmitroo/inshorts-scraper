The Delhi High Court on Monday ruled that AAP government's Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) has the jurisdiction to arrest policemen. Party convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has called the judgement a "huge embarrassment" for the Centre. Earlier, the Home Ministry in a notification had barred the ACB from registering any case against officers and political functionaries of the central government.
