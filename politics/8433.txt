Ahead of the crucial third phase of the Bihar polls, BJP on Friday inducted former JD(U) minister Bhim Singh into its fold at the BJP headquarters in Bihar. Singh who was part of CM Nitish Kumar's cabinet was at the centre of a controversy in 2013 when he had jokingly remarked that 'people join the Army to get martyred'.
