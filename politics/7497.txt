Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on Thursday said that he would take the required steps, after Congress and BJP MLAs urged the government to set up cow shelters across the state. The issue was raised after the MPs said that cows were often abandoned after they stopped yielding milk. Singh said, "The government will protect all such cattle/cows."
