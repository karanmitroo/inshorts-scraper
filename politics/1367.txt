BJP leader Subramanian Swamy slammed former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda for demanding President's rule in the state following the violence after Ram Rahim's conviction. "As per the Supreme Courtâ€™s Bombay judgement, there are certain rules to impose President rule. Hooda ji is illiterate like Rahul Gandhi. He should once read the Bombay judgement then demand such things", he said.
