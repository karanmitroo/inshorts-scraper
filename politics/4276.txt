AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that Delhiâ€™s Rajouri Garden MLA Jarnail Singh will contest Punjab elections from Lambi, CM Parkash Singh Badal's constituency. Interestingly, Jarnail Singh had flung a shoe at P Chidambaram in 2009. This comes after Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur said, "even if Kejriwal contests polls against CM, he will forfeit his security deposit".
