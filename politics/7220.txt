Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said that the recent events in the Hyderabad Central University (HCU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) were 'ultra-Left movements' also involving a small section of 'jehadis'. The name of Dr BR Ambedkar was 'unfairly used' in the HCU case where protests erupted after the suicide by a research scholar Rohith Vemula, Jaitley added.
