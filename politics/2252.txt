A day after 25 jawans were killed in a Naxal attack in Chhattisgarh, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh slammed the government saying, "Neither corruption nor Naxal problems got solved post demonetisation." "I've been saying this from the very beginning that the Naxal problem will not be solved in this Naxalite belt till villagers will not be taken into confidence," he added.
