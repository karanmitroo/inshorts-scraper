All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Muslims to stand in support of triple talaq just like the people of Tamil Nadu stood against the ban on traditional bull-taming sport Jallikattu. "We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do," Owaisi said.
