Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh on Thursday alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party was backing the cow vigilantes across the country. "An extortion going on in the name of cows. Akhlaq was lynched in Dadri. A man is killed in Alwar. Who has given you right in this regard? The people are being beaten and killed at several places," he added.
