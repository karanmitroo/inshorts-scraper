A group of AAP MLAs has raised a request with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to increase their monthly allowances, which amount to Rs 84,000 including all perks. MLAs reportedly find the amount insufficient, considering the costs of maintaining an office in their constituencies, transportation and personal expenses. Most complainants are first-time MLAs and former India Against Corruption volunteers.
