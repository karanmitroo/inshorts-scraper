In a relief to BJP chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi, the EC Thursday gave a clean chit to her in the matter of having two voter identity cards with separate addresses. The poll panel clarified Bedi had applied for deletion of her Talkatora Lane address. The former IPS officer now only holds voter identity card having Uday Park residential address.
