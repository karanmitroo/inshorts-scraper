AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday alleged that the supplier of ink and silver threads used in currency notes is the same for India and Pakistan. What is the government going to do about it (to end counterfeit menace), asked the Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP. He also demanded a couple of months time for people to exchange the old currency.
