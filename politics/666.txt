Congress Spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi has said the party may oppose a proposed legislation criminalising instant Triple Talaq if it's in violation of a Supreme Court judgement on the matter. However, Singhvi said the party has neither seen the bill's content nor its scope, therefore, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the bill yet to be presented in the Parliament.
