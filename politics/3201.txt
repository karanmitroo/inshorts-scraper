A day after Edappadi K Palanisamy won the trust vote in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, DMK working president MK Stalin has announced a hunger strike on February 22 in all state party offices. The announcement comes following allegations by DMK MLAs that they were manhandled in the Assembly. Notably, DMK MLAs were expelled from the house for creating a ruckus.
