Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday tweeted a prayer for PM Narendra Modi over the latter's remark that BJP suffered more adversities in independent India than Congress did during British rule. "Lead me from ignorance to truth - from darkness to light - from death to immortality. Let there be peace for all living creatures," he tweeted.
