Congress leader Gurudas Kamat on Thursday withdrew his resignation from the party and said he will resume charge as the Congress General Secretary. Earlier this month, Kamat had resigned, saying he would "like to take a backseat to enable others to get the opportunity.” Kamat, a five-time MP from Mumbai, was reportedly unhappy with the city's Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam.
