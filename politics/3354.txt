A 20-year-old BJP worker was hacked to death in Kerala's Thrissur on Sunday by a group of alleged CPI(M) workers, police said. Identified as Nirmal, the worker was stabbed during a temple festival on the outskirts of the city, it added. The BJP has called for a day-long bandh in the district on Monday to protest against the killing.
