AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa's supporter Shihan Hussaini crucified himself Monday and demanded her return as the CM of Tamil Nadu. A video shows Hussaini's aides digging 6-inch nails into his hands and feet as dozens of AIADMK workers watched. He remained hanging from the wooden cross for more than six minutes.
