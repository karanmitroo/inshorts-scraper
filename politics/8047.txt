Kerala CM Oommen Chandy has decided not to participate in an event to be organised in Kollam as part of PM Narendra Modi's 2-day visit to the state on December 14-15 to unveil a statue. Chandy said that the main organiser informed him that some activists were "agitated" with Chandy over corruption allegations and would try to disrupt the event.
