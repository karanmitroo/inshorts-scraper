BJP leader and former Home Secretary RK Singh on Sunday said Islamabad is being isolated globally as the entire world knows Pakistan is the centre of terrorism. "Wherever terrorist attacks have taken place in the world, it has been somehow linked with Pakistan", Singh added while condemning the J&K incident where an Indian soldier's body was mutilated reflecting "Pakistan's brutality".
