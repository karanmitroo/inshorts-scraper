Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav has said there were "lapses" on the part of the administration and intelligence network regarding the Mathura violence. The police should have been prepared, but there was no information that the encroachers would have so many arms, Yadav added. Twenty-four people, including police officers, were killed in a clash between encroachers and policemen on Thursday.
