Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said that the current state government led by Manohar Lal Khattar adds up to nothing more than a 'big zero'. "All they are doing is to rename schemes rolled out by the Congress," Hooda said. "They've failed to deliver on even one of the 154 promises listed in their election manifesto," he added.
