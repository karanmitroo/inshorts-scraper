BJP ally Shiv Sena on Monday slammed the former for its poor show in the Bihar Assembly elections. "Those who had taken the Delhi Assembly election lightly will have to take the Bihar results seriously," read an editorial in Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana'. "[T]he BJP couldn't even win 60 seats while its allies have been buried 20 feet underground," it added.
