Congress President Sonia Gandhi returned to India late Thursday night accompanied by her son Rahul Gandhi. She had left the country earlier this month to an undisclosed destination for a "routine medical check-up". The party Vice President Rahul Gandhi had left on March 16 to join his mother soon after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Punjab CM Amarinder Singh.
