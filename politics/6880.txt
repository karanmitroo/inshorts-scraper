BJP on Monday dismissed as a "diversionary tactic" the demand of Congress for a discussion over "anomalies" in Gujarat's KG basin project. "Ever since names of some Congress leaders have surfaced in the AgustaWestland chopper scam, they are making irresponsible statements out of fear," BJP alleged. Congress had earlier alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's involvement in the KG basin scam.
