BJP President Amit Shah on Friday termed the demonetisation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes as "a masterstroke of PM Narendra Modi" and said the inconvenience being faced by common people is temporary. "It's the political parties that are afraid of the Modi masterstroke. The common people aren't facing any problems. The move would greatly benefit the economy," Shah added.
