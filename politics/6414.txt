Congress-backed candidate RK Anand on Friday filed a police complaint against the BJP-backed candidate Subhash Chandra,â€‹ for conspiring against him to win the allegedly "rigged" Rajya Sabha polls in Haryana. Anand said a wrong pen was given to the Congress MLAs so that their votes could be rejected. Earlier, 14 Congress votes were declared invalid, which led to Anand's loss.
