Income Tax raids have been conducted on ten properties linked to Karnataka minister DK Shivakumar in Bengaluru, Chennai, and Delhi, reportedly as a follow up to raids conducted earlier. Congress leaders had alleged the raid was a "political witch-hunt" as Shivakumar had hosted 44 Gujarat MLAs to reportedly prevent them from switching to the BJP ahead of Rajya Sabha elections.
