It has been revealed, the Delhi law minister Somnath Bharti was part of a web business ‘topsites.us’ (around 2003-2004) that many allege was "unethical". The business was to spam website owners and make them pay for directory services they never solicited. However, Bharti claims that once he got to know of the "unethical" practices, he severed links with the business.
