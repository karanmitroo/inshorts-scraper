BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao on Friday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi can be compared to Uttara Kumar of the Mahabharata who is known to make tall claims but is indeed coward and comic. Claiming that Gandhi is not taken seriously by his own party, Rao added, "He has no political gravitas to really make comments that make sense."
