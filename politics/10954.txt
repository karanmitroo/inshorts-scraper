Almost 32 Congress MLAs, led by Punjab unit chief Partap Singh Bajwa and CLP leader Sunil Jakhar, on Monday broke barricades to reach CM Parkash Singh Badal’s residence in Chandigarh. They staged a dharna to raise issues like drug menace, non-payment of farmers’ dues, rollback of property tax and disbursement of pensions and shaguns on time. Badal accepted their memorandum.
