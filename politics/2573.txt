Terming the NDA government as a 'pro-farmer' regime, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday alleged that water crisis and farmers' suicide were contributions of the Congress. "I do not comment on those who are defeated and frustrated people," he said referring to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's allegations that PM Narendra Modi was neglecting the farmers and helping the rich.
