Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday demanded an independent probe into Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's "nexus" with militants and gangsters in the state. These "dangerous" links pose a "major threat to Punjab's security and safety", he asserted. Notably, this comes after Nabha jailbreak mastermind Gurpreet Singh Sekhon's recent arrest from the alleged house of an AAP worker.
