The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has threatened to quit the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance in Bihar if it does not get at least 12 seats to contest in the upcoming Assembly elections. "The Mahagathbandhan leaders have deceived us by making false promises of protecting our interests at the time of seat sharing," NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar said.
