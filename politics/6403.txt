The Congress party on Monday said the FIR filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau against former Delhi CM and Congress leader Sheila Dikshit in the water tanker scam was a "routine procedure". Congress leader PC Chacko said, "Any inquiry, which is legal investigation, we welcome that." This is in connection with the irregularities found while hiring water tankers during Dikshit's tenure.
