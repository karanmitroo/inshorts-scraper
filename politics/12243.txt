Aam Aadmi Party convener Arvind Kejriwal will be sworn in as Delhi chief minister on December 28 at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi. Kejriwal will lead the youngest cabinet ever and probably the first in which all members, including the CM, are debutant MLAs. Invites will be sent out to Anna Hazare, Kiran Bedi and Santosh Hegde for the ceremony.
