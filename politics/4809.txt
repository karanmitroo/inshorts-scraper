Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday asserted that Goa was on its way to become India's first cashless society. This would fulfil PM Narendra Modi's dream who is pushing for a cashless society through demonetisation. "Currently, none of the State Government's payments is done through cheques. All the payments are through electronic transfers," Parrikar added.
