Former Congress MLA from Delhi, Amrish Gautam, on Monday said that he quit the party to save his self-respect. "Even I was made to wait for more than eight hours at the doors of Congress leaders entrusted with power of finalising the tickets," he added. Notably, Gautam joined the BJP ahead of the upcoming Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls.
