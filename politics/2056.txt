Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said to transform India into a "Hindu Rashtra", RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat should become the next President. "For the first time, we (BJP-led NDA) have received such a strong political mandate. The formation of a Hindu Rashtra is the primary objective," Thackeray added. Notably, Bhagwat had ruled himself out of the presidential race.
