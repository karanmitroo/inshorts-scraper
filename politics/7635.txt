BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma, who assaulted a CPI activist outside the Patiala House Court on Monday, said he would have shot him if he had a gun. "If someone abuses our mother, wonâ€™t I beat him up", Sharma asked. MLA Sharma was earlier suspended from the State Assembly for making derogatory remarks against AAP MLA Alka Lamba.
