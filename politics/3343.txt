Reacting to Union Minister Kiren Rijiju's "Hindu population is reducing as they never convert people" remark, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that he is a minister of India for all Indians not for Hindus only. Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy came in support of Rijiju, saying that what he said was factually correct and there is nothing wrong with it.
