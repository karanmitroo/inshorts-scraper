Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Monday urged Hindus not to cut cakes on their birthdays, but rather go to temples to offer prayers. "In Indian culture, there's no tradition to cut a cake. It's unfortunate that we are moving towards western culture," he said. "These days children are addressing their mother as ‘mummy’ instead of maa or maiya," he added.
