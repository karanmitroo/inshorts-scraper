Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and his two Deputy Chief Ministers, Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma on Monday took oath as members of the state Legislative Council. They were elected unopposed in by-elections to seats that fell vacant after sitting members resigned. Notably, Adityanath and his deputies needed to join one of the two state legislatures to continue as ministers.
