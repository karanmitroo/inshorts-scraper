Pandava queen Draupadi is the world's first feminist, BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav said. Draupadi, a female character in Mahabharata, had "five husbands, (but) she won't listen to any of them. She only listened to (Lord) Krishna, who was a friend", he added. The Mahabharata war that caused the death of 18 lakh people resulted from Draupadi's stubbornness, he added.
