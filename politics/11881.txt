Former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari has stirred a hornet's nest by rubbing shoulders with Raj Thackeray at an event in Nashik on Saturday. Gadkari praised the MNS chief, who has been sharply critical of Narendra Modi recently, for planning a theme park in Nashik; while Raj lauded Gadkari for constructing flyovers in Mumbai during his ministerial tenure in 90s.
