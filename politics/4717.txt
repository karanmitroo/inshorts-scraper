Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Saturday affirmed that the JDU-RJD alliance in Bihar will last its full term. "As far as the Centre's approach against corruption through demonetisation is concerned, I am in support of such a move," said Kumar. Notably, while Nitish has supported the demonetisation move, his ally Lalu Prasad Yadav has criticised it.
