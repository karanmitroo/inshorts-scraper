AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said that no beef ban in three Northeast states which will go to polls next year reflects dual standards and hypocrisy. "In UP, BJP is doing appeasement of Hindutva forces," he added. His remark came after the BJP clarified that it will not impose a beef ban in Northeastern states if voted to power.
