Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday came under attack from opponents for allegedly promoting the use of e-rickshaws for the benefit of PGTL, a company run by his wife's brother Rajesh Totade. Gadkari, however, shrugged off the charge denying any link with PGTL which is one of the seven companies authorized to manufacture e-rickshaws.
