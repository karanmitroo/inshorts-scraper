Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed PM Narendra Modi-led government, accusing it of deliberately weakening the labour laws. "Like we fought for the rights of farmers, we will fight for the cause of the workers and stand with them and would not retreat an inch. We will fight BJP, Modi and RSS," Gandhi added.
