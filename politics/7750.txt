Amid speculation over the next Jammu & Kashmir CM, PDP President Mehbooba Mufti has vacated the bungalow allotted to her late father Mufti Sayeed when he had been the Chief Minister. This reportedly is causing further speculation over the fate of the BJP-PDP alliance in J&K. The final decision on the alliance and the next CM is expected in February.
