The central government on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) foreign funds were investigated and nothing was found in violation of the law. The court reserved the order on the public interest litigation (PIL) that sought a CBI probe into foreign funds the AAP received in the past and now in violation of law.
