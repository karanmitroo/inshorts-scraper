BJP President Amit Shah, who was re-elected for a full three-year term, met veteran leader LK Advani at his residence on Sunday and sought his blessings. Advani, who had reportedly criticised Shah post the Bihar polls, had skipped his re-election meeting along with senior leader MM Joshi. Shah will meet Joshi and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Tuesday.
