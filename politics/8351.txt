PM Narendra Modi on Sunday accused Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav of jointly demanding "a review of the reservation policy on religious basis" in 2005. "These people don't have any issues in the election... that's why they are raising the bogey of scrapping of the reservation", Modi said, adding that no political party can change India's reservation policy.
