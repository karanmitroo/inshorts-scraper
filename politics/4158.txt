Former Puducherry Agriculture Minister and Speaker VMC Sivakumar was hacked to death on Tuesday by an unidentified gang in the Union Territory's Karaikal, reports said. The gang nurtured a previous enmity towards Sivakumar, who had sought police protection over it, police said. The 67-year-old was a five-term MLA and served as the Puducherry Assembly Speaker from 1996 to 2000.
