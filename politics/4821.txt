Gujarat government on Thursday invited Patidar reservation movement leader Hardik Patel for talks on quota issue. Hardik accepted the invitation saying an eleven-member team will meet the government to maintain their demand of OBC quota and not accept any "lollipop" scheme. Notably, Hardik Patel was ordered to stay outside Gujarat in a sedition case and is currently in Rajasthan's Udaipur.
