Addressing a population control campaign in Uttar Pradesh, BJP MLA Vikram Saini said, "I have told my wife to keep producing children, even though she told me that two were enough." Hindus should not stop producing children until a law for population control comes into existence, Saini added. He asserted that Hindus have accepted the two-child policy, but others haven't.
