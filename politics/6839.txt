A total 91 workers of the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) were arrested on Saturday for staging a black flag demonstration against Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi ahead of his rally in Coimbatore. TPDK workers, including 15 women, protested against the "failure" of the UPA regime in safeguarding Sri Lankan Tamils during the war against LTTE in 2009, police said.
