The BJP on Wednesday attacked Bihar CM Nitish Kumar by giving an advertisement in newspapers a day before the fifth phase of assembly elections. The ad, which had a picture of a woman hugging a cow, read- 'Mr CM, while your allies were repeatedly insulting the holy cow, you kept quiet'. The JD(U) plans to move EC over the ad.
