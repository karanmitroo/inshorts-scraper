To strengthen the country's unity, the MDMK has promised in its manifesto released Saturday that it would rename the country as the United States of India if it takes part in government formation after the Lok Sabha polls. The party, led by firebrand Tamil leader Vaiko, also said it would lift the ban on Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
