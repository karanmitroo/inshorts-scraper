Swaraj India, the newly launched political party, has criticised both BJP and AAP over the mosquito menace in Delhi. When the media stated that Delhi's ministers were abroad, BJP's North Delhi mayor was abroad too, Swaraj India's leader Yogendra Yadav said. "The sheer lethargy of the BJP-led MCD is matched by the political cynicism of AAP," he added.
