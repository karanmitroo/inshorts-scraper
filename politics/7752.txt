DMK leader MK Stalin on Thursday ridiculed Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa's newly launched Amma call centre in front of party workers and claimed that the toll-free number 1100 doesn't work. Stalin also dialled the number twice during his speech but didn't get a response with the operator announcing in Hindi and Marathi that the number is out of coverage area.
