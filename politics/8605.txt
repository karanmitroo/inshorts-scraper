Minister of State for Tourism, Mahesh Sharma, on Thursday described the lynching of a Dadri man over alleged consumption of beef as an 'accident'. Sharma reportedly said that the incident should be considered as an accident without giving any communal colour to it. However, he insisted that law shall truthfully act against the ones who are responsible.
