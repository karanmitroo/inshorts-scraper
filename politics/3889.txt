Senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani on Sunday suggested that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) should give more space to women in its ranks. Advani said this while speaking at a function organised by spiritual group 'Prajapita Brahma Kumaris' in New Delhi. Further, during his address, Advani also lamented that India appears "incomplete" without Sindh in its territory.
