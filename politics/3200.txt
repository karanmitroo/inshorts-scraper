DMK working President MK Stalin has urged the Tamil Nadu Governor to nullify the vote of confidence won by Edappadi K Palanisamy "to protect the spirit of democracy and the Constitution". Stalin alleged that the motion of confidence was moved in the absence of the entire Opposition. Notably, all DMK MLAs were expelled from the house for creating a ruckus.
