The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded Tripura CM Manik Sarkar's resignation after the Supreme Court last month terminated the appointment of 10,323 teachers terming the recruitment procedure illegal, unfair and unconstitutional. Notably, non-BJP ruling state Tripura goes to polls in early 2018 along with Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram, which are also not being governed by the BJP.
