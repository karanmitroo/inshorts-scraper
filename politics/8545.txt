Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organisation launched by BJP MP Yogi Adityanath, is reportedly offering guns to the Hindus of Dadri area where a Muslim man was recently lynched over rumours of beef eating. An official of the outfit termed the lynching as 'sad incident' and said that they will provide 'all possible help' to innocent Hindus who are being harassed.
