The Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday announced its support to JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar to form the government in Bihar after Kumar submitted his resignation. Kumar had resigned citing a crisis in the ruling Congress-JD(U)-RJD alliance. BJP leader Sushil Modi said he will personally call Kumar and "will support the government formed under him".
