BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said that liquor baron Vijay Mallya will have to face the law for taking money of the poor and the downtrodden sections of India. "The government is moving in the right direction, and whosoever is the culprit, will be punished," Naqvi said after the Ministry of External Affairs suspended Mallya's diplomatic passport.
