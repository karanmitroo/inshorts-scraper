Rebel party workers on Saturday ransacked Congress Bhavan in Agartala in protest against the suspension of party MLA Sudip Roy Barman over alleged anti-party activities. The protesters attacked the posters of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, calling them traitors. They contended that Burman's suspension for his protest against the Congress-CPI(M) alliance in West Bengal, was anti-democratic.
