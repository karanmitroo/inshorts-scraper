Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi by invoking eminent Urdu Poet Mirza Ghalib and said, "Har ek baat pe kehte ho ki tu kya hai, tumhi kaho ke yeh Andaaz-e-Guftagu kya hai." This comes after Modi allegedly mocked Rahul saying, â€œThere is a young leader, who is learning how to give a speech now."
