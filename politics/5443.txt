Ahead of the upcoming elections in Goa, RSS rebel Subash Velingkar on Sunday announced the formation of a new political party, Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM). His name, however, did not figure in the released list of office bearers. The Goa Suraksha Manch would be headed by Anand Shirodkar, a senior Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch (BBSM) leader.
