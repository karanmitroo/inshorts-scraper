Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav did not respond to Modi today, who nominated him for the cleanliness drive, by tagging him on Twitter along with eight other prominent people. Suresh Raina, Kaif, Kailash Kher and Manu Sharma were among the others tagged by Modi, all of whom responded. Akhilesh walked away when reporters in Lucknow questioned him on this.
