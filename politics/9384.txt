The Congress office, after their 'Postcard Campaign', has been receiving about 30,000 postcards daily from farmers against the Land Acquisition Bill. Maximum cards have been received from UP, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab; none of which are ruled by the Congress. Each handwritten postcard mentions the clauses of social impact assessment and 80% consent rule for acquiring land.
