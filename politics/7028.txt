The Aam Aadmi Party on Friday said that it will not align with anyone if it contests the 2017 Goa Assembly polls. "Once AAP announces that it is fighting Goa polls, it will be to form the government,” AAP National Secretary Pankaj Gupta said. "We will also see where we stand in Goa in terms of our preparedness," he added.
