BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor should have been taken into custodial interrogation by now, regarding the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar. Tharoor should have been "made to take a lie detector test or a narco test but nothing has happened," added Swamy. He earlier demanded a court-monitored SIT probe into the matter.
