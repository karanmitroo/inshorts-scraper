PM Narendra Modi's slip in his address to the Bhutan Parliament, where he said "Nepal" while praising the nation's royal family, fired up Twitter on Monday. Modi said, "I want to begin with a tribute to the Nepal... Bhutan royal family that ensured democratic values and protected people's rights..." Later, he said "Ladakh" instead of Bhutan.
