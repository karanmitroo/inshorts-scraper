In a major embarrassment for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, TMC MP Srinjoy Bose resigned from the party and Rajya Sabha seat on Thursday. Bose's step comes a day after he was granted bail in connection with the Saradha scam case following three months of jail. Moreover, Bose has quit politics as well.
