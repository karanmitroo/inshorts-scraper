The district administration did not allow anyone wearing black T-shirts or shirts to enter a rally addressed by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Agra on Thursday. This came after Uttar Pradesh Muslim Mahasangh threatened to show black flags to Adityanath, alleging that he had disrespected the Taj Mahal by not including it in the state's tourism promotion booklet.
