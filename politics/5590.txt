Activist Prashant Bhushan and Siwan native Chandrakeshwar Prasad have moved the Supreme Court to cancel the bail granted to former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin. “You should either keep such a person out of Bihar or give him capital punishment,” said Prasad whose three sons were allegedly murdered by Shahabuddin. The Patna High Court had granted bail to Shahabuddin last week.
