AAP leader Mayank Gandhi, along with five others, was on Friday booked for molestation, after an Andheri (Mumbai) resident filed complaint against him. The victim, a tuition teacher, has alleged in her complaint that she was assaulted in a way that outraged her modesty, in an incident that occurred eight months ago. However, Gandhi has dismissed the charges.
