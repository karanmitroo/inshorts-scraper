Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said that there is no gender equality in Islamic religion and added that women have third class status in the community. "There is no doubt that in Islamic practice and preaching women have been given second or third class status. Triple talaq, marrying four wives tradition are examples of that," he added.
