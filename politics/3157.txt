The Madras High Court on Wednesday sought the video evidence of the proceedings in the Tamil Nadu Assembly during Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami's trust vote. This comes after two separate pleas were filed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and advocate K Balu, representing Advocates' Forum for Social Justice, asking the High Court to declare the trust vote as illegal.
