A bomb was thrown at Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh office in Kallachi near Nadapuram in Kerala on Thursday that left three RSS workers injured. While the injured were rushed to a Government Medical College, the police have begun the probe. The incident has happened after an RSS leader announced a bounty of ₹1 crore on Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s head.
