Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Thursday lashed out the media calling them "liars and scum". "I'll speak to the police not to self-appointed liars and scum," he replied when asked why his aides were not speaking the truth in his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death case. Three witnesses in this case had agreed on Wednesday to undergo the lie detector test.
