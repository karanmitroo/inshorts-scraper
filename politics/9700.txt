Shiv Sena, in its party mouthpiece Saamna, attacked the BJP government in Maharashtra on Monday for failing to arrest CPI leader Govind Pansare's killers. "What has changed with the new government? If someone knows please tell us," Saamna said in its editorial. Pansare, 82, died last week after being shot at by two gunmen on February 17.
