The Election Commission on Tuesday ordered repolling in six booths in Gujarat, where the first phase of Assembly elections was held on December 9. This comes as the presiding officers forgot to remove mock drill results stored in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) before the actual poll. The re-election will be held on December 14 along with the second phase.
