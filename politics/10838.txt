CBI court Tuesday rejected Lalu Prasad's petition challenging trial in a case related to the multi-crore fodder scam in which he is an accused. Lalu moved the plea in this case-also pertaining to misappropriation of funds in Chaibasa treasury-because he has already been convicted there. His counsel had pleaded, there is no provision for double sentence in the same case.
