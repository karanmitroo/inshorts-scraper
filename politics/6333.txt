Former Maharashtra CM and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan has said that the Shiv Sena may break off its ruling alliance with BJP in the state before next year’s civic polls in Mumbai and other cities. “The coalition of BJP and Shiv Sena is full of contradictions…once Shiv Sena withdraws the support, the government will automatically go into a minority,” he added.
