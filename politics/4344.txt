A woman, claiming to be a childhood friend of the late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, filed a petition on Monday before the Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Chennai seeking clarity over Jayalalithaa's death. Questioning why Jayalalithaa's footage was not released while she was undergoing treatment, the woman said, "I feel and suspect that there is some mystery in her death."
