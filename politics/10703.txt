Former CM of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that there's a possibility of compromise in a defamation complaint filed against him by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Kejriwal's counsel told a Delhi court that they are in the process of finalising the matter. The court deferred the matter to Oct 18, as the matter was pending before the Delhi HC.
