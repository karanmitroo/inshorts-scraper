Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha said PM Narendra Modi didn't question, nor meant to question "the commitment to this nation of either former PM Manmohan Singh or former Vice President Hamid Ansari". "We hold these leaders in high esteem," Jaitley added. This comes after PM Modi had suggested that Congress colluded with Pakistan to win Gujarat elections.
