Refusing to comment on former IPS officer Kiran Bedi joining the BJP, social activist and anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare on Wednesday said, "I don't want to talk about it or comment on Kiran Bedi. Politics is dirty." Notably, Bedi was a core team member of Hazare-led anti-corruption movement and was also Anna's one-time close associate.
