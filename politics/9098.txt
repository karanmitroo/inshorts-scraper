Following the scam allegations on Maharashtra ministers Pankaja Munde and Vinod Tawde, the Shiv Sena has suggested that the BJP leaders must step down until proved innocent. Sena MP Arvind Sawant on Tuesday said, "When such an incident had happened during Balasaheb's time, ...he asked his minister to resign." He further added, "Similar standards should be applied here."
