Congress on Sunday said the Centre should not try "oblique and indirect methods" to topple Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat. Rawat has always been willing to participate in valid legal proceedings, party leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi asserted. Notably, Rawat has been asked to appear before CBI for the probe into an alleged sting video showing him bribing rebel MLAs.
