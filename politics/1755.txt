Meira Kumar, the Opposition's presidential nominee, on Saturday said that she is not a scapegoat in the upcoming election for the country's top constitutional post. "Anybody fighting for an ideology and appealing to the voice of conscience cannot be a scapegoat. I'm a fighter and I'll fight and I'm sure that many will join me in this fight," she said.
