Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Wednesday accused the central government of not releasing scholarship funds for students belonging to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe categories. “We have released our share of funds. But the Centre has not issued grants from the past two years due to which the students are suffering,” he added.
