Reacting to the assault on five men by cow vigilantes in Alwar, VHP leader Surendra Jain has said the Hindu community is angry and the assault was an expression of spontaneous anger. "These people forget the 1857 freedom movement was based on the symbol of cow. Hindus will continue to be furious if their sentiments are hurt," he added.
