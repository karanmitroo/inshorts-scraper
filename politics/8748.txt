The BJP has accused the AAP government of not being able to address the issue of high onion prices in the city. Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay claimed that the crisis is “man-made,” and said, “The Kejriwal government is not serious and hardly 10 mobile vans have been put into service to cater to a population of 1.5 crore.”
