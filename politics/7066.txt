West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday accused the BJP of bringing "ultra-Hindutvad" to create communal tension and riots. "People will give a fitting reply to those who are trying to divide Bengal on communal lines," she asserted. "Delhi is jealous about peace in West Bengal and so is conducting Assembly elections... in so many phases," Mamata further alleged.
