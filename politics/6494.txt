The BJP and Congress MLAs in Chhattisgarh have come together to save a Hanuman temple built on Raipur's encroached land, after the Supreme Court ordered its demolition last month. The BJP has written to CM Raman Singh seeking revision petition in the SC citing "religious sentiments". Notably, the temple was built by a trust owned by Chhattisgarh Speaker GS Agarwal.
