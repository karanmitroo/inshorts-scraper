Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday alleged that Mayawati-led BSP had "transferred" votes to the BJP which is why it got zero seats, while the BJP won the majority of seats in the 2014 General Elections. "I have data of booths that show votes (of BSP) were transferred to BJP. I can prove it," he said.
