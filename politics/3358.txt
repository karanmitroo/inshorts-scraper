AIADMK General Secretary Sasikala Natarajan on Saturday alleged that the delay in her swearing-in ceremony was an attempt to "create a division in the party". Asserting that she would start a new form of protest from Sunday, Sasikala said, "All party MLAs are fine and happy. We were waiting patiently till this moment for a reply from the Governor."
