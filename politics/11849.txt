Indiaâ€™s electorate for the upcoming general election will be 81.5 crore (52% male), the Election Commission revealed. The EC has added nearly 10 crore new voters to the rolls between 2009 and 2014, one of the largest-ever such increases between two elections. The electorate is now nearly five times what it was when India first voted, over 60 years ago.
