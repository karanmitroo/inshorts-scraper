Shiv Sena on Saturday asked the Director of a Mumbai-based convention centre to cancel the book launch of Pakistan's former Foreign Minister Mahmud Kasuri, which is scheduled for October 12. The Observer Research Foundation Mumbai, which is organising the event, had earlier sought protection from the Maharashtra government following the cancellation of Ghulam Ali's concert.
