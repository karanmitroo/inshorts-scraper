Delhi police told the Delhi HC on Tuesday that former AAP member Yogendra Yadav and 82 others, who were arrested on Monday from a farmers' protest site, have been released. Later, the court disposed of a plea filed by Prashant Bhushan for the release of the detained people and to launch an inquiry against the police personnel who arrested them.
