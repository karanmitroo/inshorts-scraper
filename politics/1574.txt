Talking about his two-year alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said, "I didn't have a choice, I tolerated them a lot." Nitish further said, "Though this happens in an alliance, but I ran out of patience. Lalu ji kept defending his son and never spoke up for me."
