Congress President Rahul Gandhi has accused the BJP led-NDA government of using Aadhaar as "a compulsory weapon to disempower citizens". The Congress led-UPA government had introduced the Aadhaar policy as "a voluntary instrument to empower citizens", he added. The Supreme Court on Wednesday began hearing petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Aadhaar.
