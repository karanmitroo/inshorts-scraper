Speaking at the 50th anniversary event of the Delhi High Court, CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday alleged he has heard that judges’ phones are tapped. “I don't know if it's true or not, but if it's true, then it’s dangerous. Where is the independence of the judiciary then?” he stated. Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, denied the allegation.
