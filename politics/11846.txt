Reacting to Narendra Modi's 'expansionist mindset' remark, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Monday said China has never waged a war to occupy an inch of land of other countries. Earlier on Saturday, Modi had said that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India and had asked China to shed its "expansionist mindset". Notably, China claims Arunachal Pradesh as Southern Tibet.
