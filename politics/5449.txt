The Delhi Assembly on Friday passed a resolution to congratulate PM Narendra Modi and the Indian Army for giving a befitting reply to the "enemy’s forces" across the border. The resolution extended wholehearted support to the measures to be taken by the Centre for protecting India’s territorial integrity. It also urged the government to isolate "rogue elements" in the sub-continent.
