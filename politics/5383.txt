Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Tuesday asserted that to solve the Kashmir issue and bring normalcy, a state new government needs to be formed. "I had earlier said that the perspective of Mehbooba's PDP and the BJP for Kashmir is totally opposite," he said. The problem is in the Kashmir valley where BJP didn't win any seat, Aiyar added.
