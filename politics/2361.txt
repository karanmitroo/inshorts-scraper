As RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav celebrated his 28th birthday on Sunday, his mother and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi said she wants a "homely, accomplished" bride for her son. "We would not insist on being given dowry, but may be a cow as gift," said Lalu who has often displayed his fondness for cows.
