RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday said that the cash circulation in the economy has increased by over â‚¹60,000 crore during the ongoing state Assembly elections, which is "not normal" and needs to be looked into. "Around election time, cash with the public does normally increase...You can guess as to reasons why, we can also guess," Rajan further said.
