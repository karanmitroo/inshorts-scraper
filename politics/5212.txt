Condemning the deal between Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, MNS chief Raj Thackeray and producer Karan Johar over the smooth release of the latter's film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray has slammed the deal as ‘extortion’. “The Indian Army has its self respect. So, it does not need any money eked out of extortion,” he said.
