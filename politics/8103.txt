Shiv Sena on Friday said that Congress has won Gujarat civic polls despite losing them. "The municipal corporations will be ruled by the BJP and the Zilla Parishads by the Congress. In short, the Congress has won the election," Sena said. "The BJP now needs to evaluate why alarm bells have started ringing on Narendra Modiâ€™s home pitch," it added.
