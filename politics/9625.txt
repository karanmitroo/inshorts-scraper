Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' Tuesday said that if the Muslims in India want any special treatment, "they should go to Pakistan". "If they (Muslims) want anything from this country, they must first accept India as their motherland and proclaim 'Vande Mataram'. They cannot demand freedom and yet continue to cling to their religion," the party mouthpiece said.
