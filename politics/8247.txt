Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Monday termed the recent petrol and diesel price hike as "an unjust act" and said the Centre was burdening the common man in spite of getting revenue from excise tax. "While there is no significant change in global oil prices, increasing the rates based on rupee-dollar value basis is not fair," she said.
