Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has reportedly not been invited to some 'Make in Indiaâ€™ week events, which will be held in Mumbai from February 13, including a dinner chaired by PM Narendra Modi. A Sena leader said that during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as PM, the then Shiv Sena President Balasaheb Thackeray used to be invited for such events.
