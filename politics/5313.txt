AAP MLA Gulab Singh on Sunday surrendered before the Gujarat Police after a non-bailable warrant was issued against him in an alleged extortion case. Earlier on Sunday, a Delhi Police team had left for Gujarat to arrest Singh. Reacting to it, AAP has alleged that the move to arrest Singh, who is also AAPâ€™s Gujarat in-charge, is a ploy.
