As the Budget Session's second innings commenced on Thursday, the TMC MPs staged a dharna outside the Parliament against recent killings of Indians in the US. The Parliamentarians from both the Houses demanded a strong response from the Centre to stop the killings. They carried placards saying, "All citizens are our brothers and sisters. We must take care of them".
