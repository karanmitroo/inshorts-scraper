Human rights campaigner Irom Sharmila Chanu on Monday refused to accept the "security escort" provided to her by the state government under the direction of the Election Commission. Asserting that she did not approve of the VIP culture, Sharmila said she had no enmity with anyone and had "nothing to fear about". She was provided with six state security personnel.
