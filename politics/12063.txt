Congress disapproved party leader Manishanker Aiyar on Saturday for his controversial remarks that the party would welcome Narendra Modi to sell tea at AICC meetings. Aiyar had mocked Modi's prime ministerial ambitions and said a place will be identified for the Gujarat CM to distribute tea. BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar had described Aiyar as an "icon of cheap thinking".
