Senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Monday termed party chief Nitish Kumar's decision to join hands with the BJP again as unfortunate and against the people's mandate. "I don't agree with the decision in Bihar. It is unfortunate. The mandate of the people (2015 Bihar Assembly Polls) was not for this," he added.
