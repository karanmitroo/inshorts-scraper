The Uttarakhand High Court on Tuesday stayed the arrest of CM Harish Rawat over a sting video that allegedly showed him offering bribes to Congress MLAs for support in a floor test. Last week, the CBI had questioned Rawat in connection with its investigation into the sting operation. The next hearing in this matter will be held on June 20.
