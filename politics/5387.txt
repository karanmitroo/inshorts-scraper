UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Monday backed Rahul Gandhi over his "khoon ki dalali" remark against PM Narendra Modi and said that if Gandhi said so, he must have said with "some understanding". BJP is using surgical strikes for political mileage, Yadav added. Rahul Gandhi had earlier said that Modi is doing 'khoon ki dalali' over the death of soldiers.
