Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday alleged that Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung is behaving like a 'king' who wants to spread dictatorship in Delhi. "He doesn't have time for... law and order, land and police, which have been provided to him under the Constitution," it alleged. This comes after Jung said he would overturn the "illegal" actions of the AAP government.
