Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Monday said, "TMC will not tolerate those who only care about personal interests. We don't have room for traitors in our party." She was referring to the recent Narada sting operation where several TMC leaders were allegedly caught accepting bribes. TMC had earlier ordered an internal probe into the incident.
