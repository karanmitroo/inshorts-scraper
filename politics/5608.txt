BJP President Amit Shah has sparked a row for wishing 'Vaman Jayanti' ahead of Onam festival and sharing a poster showing Lord Vishnu's Vaman avatar placing his foot on Asura king Mahabali's head. As per mythology, Onam commemorates the homecoming of Mahabali, who is believed to be a good ruler and whose regime was 'cunningly' ended by Vaman.
