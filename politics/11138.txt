Just a day after Nitish Kumar resigned as the CM of Bihar, the Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav Sunday said that the party will elect a new leader. "I have been saying since yesterday that we as a party are different. Once someone resigns in our party, he doesn't come back," Yadav further said.
