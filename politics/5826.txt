BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has "absolutely no political future" and he should quit from politics to save the Congress' future. Swamy said this while referring to Rahul's purported "U-turn" where he had earlier blamed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for Mahatma Gandhi's assassination and later denied the same before the Supreme Court.
