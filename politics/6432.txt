PM Narendra Modi on Monday laid down a seven-point code of conduct for BJP workers ahead of the assembly elections in several states in 2017. Modi listed seven points –  sevabhav (service), santulan (balance), saiyam (restraint), samanvaya (coordination), sakaratmak (optimism), samvedana (sensitivity) and samvad (dialogue) – that should reflect in a worker's behaviour and the party's policies.
