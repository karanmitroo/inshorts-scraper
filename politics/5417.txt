Following Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's appeal to PM Narendra Modi to release proof of surgical strikes against Pakistan, #PakStandsWithKejriwal was a top Twitter trend on Thursday. Union Minister Harsimrat Badal tweeted, "@ArvindKejriwal has proved his anti-national stand. He is not an Indian but Pak's agent", while another user wrote, "2 Minutes of silence for those who voted for AAP".
