Taking a jibe at Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal, BJP Spokesperson Shrikant Sharma on Wednesday said that Gandhi's political party became 'Kejriwalised' as it 'shoots and scoots' away like the Delhi CM. "Rahul lacks credibility. Your own people are quitting the party and joining BJP. Now even other Opposition parties are leaving," he added.
