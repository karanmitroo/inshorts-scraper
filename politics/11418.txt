The police on Friday recovered a bomb-like device from under a culvert on the Suri-Bolpur road (West Bengal) barely half an hour before Mamata Banerjee was to pass through it to address a rally. "We have detained five persons from adjacent areas for interrogation," police said. This comes just a day after her hotel room in Malda caught fire.
