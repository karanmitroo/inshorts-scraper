Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday criticised the Congress over its 'garibi hatao' (remove poverty) slogan and said, "[W]hat they failed to do in 50 years, I will do in 50 months". Attacking the Congress for criticising BJP's 'Jan Dhan Yojna', Modi added, "Those who didn't open any bank accounts for the poor are... seeking my accountability on the issue".
