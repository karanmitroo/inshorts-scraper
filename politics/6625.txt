Several BJP workers on Sunday staged a demonstration outside the CPI(M) office in Delhi to protest against the murder of a 38-year-old party worker Pramod. He was allegedly hit by a brick by the supporters of CPI(M) during a poll victory rally in Kerala, which led to his death. Around 150 protestors have been detained, the police said.
