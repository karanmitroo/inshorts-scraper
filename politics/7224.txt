The BJP will never form an alliance with "Communists" or West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday. This is because the party does not support "infiltration, corruption and fear," said Shah. He added, "Factories were installed in Bengal during Mamata ji's tenure but they were bomb factories, not industries."
