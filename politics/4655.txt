After the demise of former Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, her close aide Sasikala Natarajan is likely to take charge as AIADMK chief. "Sasikala has no enemies in the party now," a senior AIADMK leader has reportedly said. "Both Panneerselvam and Thambidurai will never go against the wishes of Amma...they will listen to Chinnamma (Sasikala)," a party MP stated.
