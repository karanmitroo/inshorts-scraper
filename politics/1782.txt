Reacting to Meira Kumar's nomination as Opposition's Presidential candidate, JD(U) leader and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Friday said, "I've a lot of respect for Meira Kumarji, but has 'Bihar ki beti' been nominated only to lose?" "We have taken independent decisions in the past also, we had supported Pranab Mukherjee as President when we were in NDA," Nitish added.
