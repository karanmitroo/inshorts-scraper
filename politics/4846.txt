Autonomy to both sides of Jammu and Kashmir is the only viable solution to the seven-decade-old problem, National Conference President Farooq Abdullah said on Wednesday. "Borders cannot be changed, but these can be made irrelevant and soft for people-to-people exchange," he added. Abdullah further emphasised that the issues between India and Pakistan cannot be solved by guns.
