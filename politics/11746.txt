Gorkha Janshakti Morcha (GJM) announced extending support to BJP on Monday, ruling out support to Trinamool Congress‘s Darjeeling LS candidate Baichung Bhutia. “I would appeal to all Gorkhas to support BJP,” GJM Chief Bimal Gurung said on Facebook. While GJM had ruled out extending support to Bhutia, the ex-football star has been seeking the Gorkha outfit’s support.
