BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said that he would make a better Finance Minister than Arun Jaitley. "Jaitley is only a lawyer while I am an economist. It is self-evident," he asserted. On being asked about the "India-Pakistan like tension" between him and Jaitley, Swamy said there has always been a tussle between "south and north Indian Brahmins".
