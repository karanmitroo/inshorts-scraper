The AIADMK faction led by Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam has named the party's Presidium Chairman Madhusudhanan as its candidate for the RK Nagar bypoll. The seat was left vacant after former CM Jayalalithaa's demise in 2016. The bypoll was earlier scheduled for April 12 but got cancelled by the Election Commission after reports of money distribution.
