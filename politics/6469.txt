The Election Commission has ruled that failure of a candidate to furnish details of his social media account(s) in the election affidavit cannot be treated as grounds for his disqualification. In such cases, the candidate should be directed to provide the details on a plain paper and should not be asked to file a fresh affidavit, the poll panel clarified.
