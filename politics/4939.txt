Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday criticised the Centre's demonetisation policy calling it as "demonisation" of cash, reports said. Adding that he is sure that Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian was not consulted over the move, Chidambaram said, "this is just an exchange of old notes for new, not demonetisation." I support the objective, not the method, he added.
