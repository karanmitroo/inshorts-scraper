AAP on Monday demanded a public apology from the BJP for their derogatory advertisements about AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. Claiming that the party would also complain about the matter to the EC, AAP spokesperson Ashutosh said, "Either they should withdraw the advertisements or apologize publically. We will go to the Election Commission for the same."
