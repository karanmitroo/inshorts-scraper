Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday said that important portfolios involved in decision making for the state are not with Sena.  Post his meeting with the family of 16-year-old Swati Pitale who committed suicide owing to poverty in Latur, Raut also said that state Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should have a hold over the administration.
