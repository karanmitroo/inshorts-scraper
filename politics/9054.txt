IG (Inspector General)-rank officer Amitabh Thakur filed a police complaint against the Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday, alleging that Mulayam threatened him to mend his ways or face dire consequences. Thakurâ€™s wife, a social activist, said the provocation behind the threat could have been the FIR lodged by her against Uttar Pradesh's Mines minister Gayatri Prajapati.
