AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being hell-bent on destroying the national capital through Lieutenant General Najeeb Jung. "Today, several officers transferred by LG directly. Files not even shown to CM or any minister. Is this Modi model of democracy?" Kejriwal further posted on Twitter.
