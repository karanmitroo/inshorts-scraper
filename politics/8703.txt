Former Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leader Akhilesh Katiyar has said that the agitation for reservation for Gujarat's Patidar community will be intensified. He added that the campaign might even reach poll-bound Bihar "if our community representatives extend support and invite us there." Earlier, the RLSP had sacked Katiyar for helping Patidar leader Hardik Patel in organising a rally.
