The Election Commission(EC) has rejected the demand of Congress to cover lotus  ponds in Mahakoshal, Malwa and Bundelkhand regions of Madhya Pradesh, calling it as "absurd" and "an insult to the intelligence of the voter". A senior EC official said that going by similar argument, even handshakes should be banned to avoid undue influence on the voters in Congress's favour.
