An India Today-Axis exit poll has handed a clear victory to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Uttarakhand Assembly elections, with 46-53 seats in the 70-member house. The exit poll predicted just 12-21 seats for the ruling Congress party and 1-4 seats for BSP. However, an India TV-CVoter India survey projected a tight fight between BJP and Congress in Uttarakhand.
