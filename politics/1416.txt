Tweeting about the government's achievement of illuminating 50,000 km of Indian roads with LED lights, Minister of State for Power Piyush Goyal posted image of a Russian street on Sunday. After people pointed out the error, Goyal deleted his tweet and thanked people for bringing out the issue and said that social media helped "illuminate facts".
