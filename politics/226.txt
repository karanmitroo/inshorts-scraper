Addressing a gathering in poll-bound Tripura, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday claimed that the ruling CPI(M) in the state believed in "gun-tantra" and not 'gantantra'. Stating that the party does not believe in democracy but violence, PM Modi added that Tripura residents had suffered for 25 years due to "misrule". He also accused the CPI(M) of attacking BJP workers.
