Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu slammed the Congress on Sunday for obstructing the Parliament, and said that the Congress and its allies were not hurting the BJP but the nation by not letting Parliament function. Naidu further asked Sonia Gandhi, "when Rajiv Gandhi was the PM, 63 MPs were suspended from the House, was it a murder of democracy?"
