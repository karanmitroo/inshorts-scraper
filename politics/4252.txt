In response to a petition filed over late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's death, the Madras high court on Thursday asked, "Why can't we dig out her body?" The court expressed doubts over Jayalalithaa's sudden death and the absence of a medical report. The petitioner had asked Centre to set up a commission to probe the "mysterious death of Jayalalithaa".
