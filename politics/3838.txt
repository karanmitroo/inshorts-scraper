The Congress' CM candidate for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Sheila Dikshit, on Tuesday said, "I would like to gracefully withdraw, as we cannot have two CM candidates for the polls." Her statement comes immediately after an alliance of Congress and Samajwadi Party under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav was announced by the senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.
