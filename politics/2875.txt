Addressing his first press conference post BJP's landslide victory in the UP elections, outgoing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said, "Samjhane se vote nahin milta hai, behkane se milta hai." He added, "Our cycle was a tubeless cycle. In politics, you can never say what happens... until someone does work better than us, our work will speak."
