Congress Thursday decided not to project party vice-president Rahul Gandhi as its PM candidate. Instead, the party has decided to make Gandhi its campaign committee chief for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Reportedly, it was Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who decided to go against the wishes of the working committee, which wanted the party vice-president to be its PM candidate.
