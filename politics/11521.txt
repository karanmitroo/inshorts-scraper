Days after AAP's Kumar Vishwas praised RSS for being a "secular, disciplined" outfit, Maharashtra Muslim Fund president Farid Batatawala reportedly wrote to AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal demanding Vishwas's suspension from the party. Congress also attacked AAP, saying Vishwas's comment reflected that AAP was inclined towards BJP. Earlier, Vishwas had said between the Congress and BJP, he preferred the latter.
