Hours after the execution of Yakub Memon, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Thursday tweeted that he was saddened by the news that the government had hanged a 'human being'. He argued that such kind of state-sponsored killings diminishes people by reducing them to murderers. Furthermore, he maintained that there is no evidence of a death penalty acting as a deterrent.
