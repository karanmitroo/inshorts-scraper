Talking about playing the lead in the biopic on Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, "I think any actor would have agreed to play his role." Nawazuddin added, "I don't think Balasaheb's life can be shown in three hours." He further suggested that the late leader's life should be shown in a web series with many episodes.
