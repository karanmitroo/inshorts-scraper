Asserting that Muhammad Ali Jinnah did not want a separate country for Muslims, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah on Saturday said that the partition happened due to Indian leaders. It was when Indian leaders refused to keep "special dispensation" for minorities like Muslims and Sikhs that Jinnah demanded Pakistan, he added.
