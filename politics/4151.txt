UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's mentor and SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav on Tuesday claimed that 90% of the Samajwadi Party MPs, MLAs, and MLCs are in favour of Akhilesh. Akhilesh's faction will become the new SP, Ram Gopal claimed. This comes amid reports of a split in the party into two factions led by Akhilesh and Mulayam Singh Yadav separately.
