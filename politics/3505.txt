Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's 'surgical strikes in PoK' remark, Congress Spokesperson Manish Tewari on Saturday tweeted "PM says in Meerut our Army conducted surgical strikes at Pakistan ki Dharti (Pakistan's territory). Isn't PoK integral part of India?" "Parliament resolutions of 1994 and 2012 say reclaiming PoK is the unfinished business of 1947 Partition," he added.
