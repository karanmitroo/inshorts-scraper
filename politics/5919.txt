West Bengal government has said that it wants to rename the central projects which are being almost equally funded by the state. Panchayat Minister Subrata Mukherjee said that they would rename 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana' to 'Rajya Sadak Yojana'. Stating that the states fund 40% of the project's cost, Mukherjee added, "Why should it be called Pradhan Mantri Yojana?"
