Reacting to the leaked "Panama Papers", JD(U) Chief Sharad Yadav on Tuesday said that it was embarrassing to see names of Padma awardees in the list. Calling it a "result of blind liberalisation", Yadav added, "Liberalisation has only benefited the big business houses and they cleverly misused policies. The government should immediately reveal the truth of black money parked overseas."
