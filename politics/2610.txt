Air India has cancelled Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad's Mumbai-Delhi flight ticket booked for Wednesday. This comes after Gaikwad was banned from all flights of Air India and other carriers under Federation of Indian Airlines following an incident wherein he hit an AI staffer with his slippers. Gaikwad had refused to apologise and accused the staffer of being at fault.
