Reacting to her conviction in the disproportionate assets case, AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala on Tuesday asserted that 'Dharma' will win. "In the past, whenever Amma was in crisis, I also suffered. This time also I will take it upon me," she added. Notably, following her 4-year sentence, she has been rendered disqualified to take over as Tamil Nadu CM.
