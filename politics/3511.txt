Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao on Monday accepted Chief Minister O Panneerselvam's resignation from the post. Rao, however, directed him to continue functioning until alternate arrangements were made. Notably, Panneerselvam had resigned from the post after AIADMK MLAs elected VK Sasikala as the legislative party leader. He was appointed as the CM following the death of former CM Jayalalithaa.
