Jitan Ram Manjhi on Thursday accused Bihar CM Nitish Kumar of deploying policemen at the chief minister's residence in order to prevent him from enjoying mangoes and litchis that grow in the gardens of the bungalow. Manjhi, who was sacked as the CM in Feb this year, continues to live in the official residence of the Bihar chief minister.
