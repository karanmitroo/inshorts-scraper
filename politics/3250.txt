The Madras High Court has dismissed a petition to convert late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's residence into a memorial. This comes after former CM O Panneerselvam had started a signature campaign to turn Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence into a memorial. The petition had claimed that the residences of former CM Kamaraj and MG Ramachandran were also made memorials.
