In the run up to Lok Sabha polls, Facebook has launched a special initiative - 'Facebook Talks Live' - which would enable its users to pose questions directly to key political contenders for 2014 general elections. Facebook users can put up their questions for political leaders at a dedicated page on the social networking website from Thursday.
