The 'hat' symbol allotted to the Sasikala faction of the AIADMK clearly indicates party founder MG Ramachandran, who used to wear such hats, Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai said on Thursday. He further asserted that the allocation of the new symbol and name was a temporary arrangement and that there was no split in the party.
