Responding to Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's comments in Parliament regarding the Bofors controversy, Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday, "for 30 years the BJP has lied about my father." Gandhi said, "the judicial system of India has cleared Rajiv Gandhi." Swaraj had alleged that kickbacks were paid to the Gandhis for the sale of Bofors artillery guns to India.
