The West Bengal Congress on Monday moved the Election Commission alleging malpractices in some constituencies during the second day of voting in state Assembly polls. Seeking "protective measures", several leaders demanded intervention of Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi to ensure fair and peaceful polling. They alleged several instances of booth capturing, violence, and cash distribution.
