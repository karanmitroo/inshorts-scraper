Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said one must not be asked for a certificate to prove his or her nationalism. "I've no problem with the slogan of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai',  but why are you asking for a certificate...," he said. This follows AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi's recent refusal to chant 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'.
