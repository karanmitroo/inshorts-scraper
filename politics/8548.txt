The Shiv Sena on Wednesday demanded the cancellation of the concert of Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali which is to be held in Mumbai on Friday. India cannot have cultural ties with Pakistan till the latter does not stop resorting to ceasefire violations along the border, Sena said. Earlier in April, the party had forcefully cancelled a concert of Atif Aslam.
