Commenting on the issue of referring to Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati as 'bua', Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said, "If I don't call her bua (aunt), what should I call Mayawati," adding, "Everyone calls the BSP chief 'behenji', what's wrong if I call her bua." Earlier, Mayawati had objected to Yadav's choice of address for her.
