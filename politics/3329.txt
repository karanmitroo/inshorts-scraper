The Election Commission of India currently has a list of free symbols which can be reserved by a candidate or party for future if they secure enough votes. The list includes a batsman, a balloon, grapes, and a saw, among others. The original idea behind election symbols was to make the voting convenient for the country's largely illiterate population.
