Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, who turned 48 on Tuesday, cut a cake with the picture of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi. AIMIM has demanded action against those who cut the cake. Thackeray previously said that he would put a knife to Owaisi's throat when the latter declared he would not chant 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'.
