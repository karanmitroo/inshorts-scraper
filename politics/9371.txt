The Narendra Modi-led NDA government on Tuesday dropped the names of former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi from the annual awards given on Hindi Diwas. Earlier, there were four categories of Rajbhasha awards, of which two were named after the Gandhis who belonged to the Congress. Now, the Home Ministry has merged the four awards into two.
