The Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha reportedly wants to commemorate Nathuram Godse’s death anniversary (November 15) as ‘Balidan Diwas.’ The Mahasabha plans to organise plays based on Godse's life on that day, and build a rath displaying pictures of revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh alongside Godse. Earlier, the group wanted to build temples in the honour of Mahatma Gandhi's assassin.
