In a move to save ties, Maharashtra BJP has sent a fresh seat-sharing proposal for the Oct 15 assembly polls to Shiv Sena, after the party's core panel discussed it at a meeting Friday. According to sources, Sena will get 140 seats, while BJP will contest 130 and the remaining 18 seats will go to junior partners.
