Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Sunday tweeted, "BJP stealing elections in Goa and Manipur," claiming that any political party that comes second in the elections cannot form the government. Earlier BJP declared Manohar Parrikar Chief Minister for Goa, sealing his candidature by garnering support from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Goa Forward Party.
