Opposing the death penalty even for terrorists, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said that terrorists should instead be put behind bars for the rest of their lives without parole. "When we implement capital punishment, we are actually acting like them. They are the murderers and the state should not act like them," the former union minister added.
