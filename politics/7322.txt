Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that there should be no politics over water. His statement comes after Haryana Irrigation Minister Om Prakash Dhankar asked Kejriwal to get his own canal constructed for carrying Delhi's water as he "stood against the interests of the farmers and people of Haryana." Kejriwal earlier opposed construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal.
