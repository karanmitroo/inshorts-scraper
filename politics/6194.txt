Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday asserted that the political instability in Arunachal Pradesh was due to divisions within the Congress. "The BJP and the central government have nothing to do with whatever is happening in Arunachal Pradesh," he added. This comes amid a change in Congress leadership in the state with Chief Minister Nabam Tuki's resignation.
