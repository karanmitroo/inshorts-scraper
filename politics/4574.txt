Replying to Rahul Gandhi's comment that if he speaks on demonetisation, then an 'earthquake' will occur, Smriti Irani on Friday said, "Rahul is overestimating his debating skills." The former HRD Minister added, "Even he knows how good he is in front of the people. As parliament is the platform of debate and discussion, I welcome him to come forth."
