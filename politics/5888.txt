A day after opposition leaders from J&K met President Pranab Mukherjee over the ongoing Kashmir unrest, BJP leader Ram Madhav and ex-J&K CM Omar Abdullah exchanged words on Twitter. The opposition did nothing to help State bring normalcy, instead helped spread unrest, said Madhav. To this Omar replied, you have your IB, MI, RAW, CID, go prove it.
