Independence activist VD Savarkar's grand-nephew has sent a legal notice to the Congress for a series of tweets posted on the latter’s Twitter handle in March calling Savarkar a ‘traitor’. The notice asks for an "unconditional apology" from the same handle. As per reports, this is possibly the first time a political party has received a notice over a tweet.
