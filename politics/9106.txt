All India Progressive Women's Association Secretary Kavita Krishnan sparked a controversy on Sunday by accusing PM Narendra Modi of stalking daughters. Referring to Modi's #SelfieWithDaughter contest, under which he asked people to share a selfie with their daughters, Krishnan tweeted, "Careful before sharing #SelfieWithDaughter with #LameDuckPM. He has a record of stalking daughters".
