Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday wrote on Facebook, "The Congress Party complains a bit too much. It accused the BJP of 'stealing' the mandate in Goa." He further said, "It unsuccessfully petitioned before the Supreme Court...The Congress did not even submit a claim to the Governor." He asked, "How could the Congress ever be invited to form the government?"
