Congress president Sonia Gandhi Saturday blamed the party's lack of understanding of the mood of the people of the country for its LS election debacle. She said her party failed to gauge widespread anger against it. "The Congress has lost this time but this is not the first time, we have earlier also come back after losses," she added.
