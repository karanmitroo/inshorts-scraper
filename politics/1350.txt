After BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj's remarks on Dera Chief Ram Rahim's conviction sparked a controversy, he has claimed that he was misquoted. "People like Rampal, Ram Rahim, Asaram are no saints. People should think twice before following these so called babas," he added. "Crores of people are supporting him, only one is complaining against him," Sakshi Maharaj had earlier said.
