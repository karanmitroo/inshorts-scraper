Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra took to Facebook to slam Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal saying that the AAP convener should stop inciting people against him. 'Robert Vadra' seems to be the most referred name in the dictionary of the Delhi CM, he further wrote in his post. Vadra also asked Kejriwal to speak to him directly.
