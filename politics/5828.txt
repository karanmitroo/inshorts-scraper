AAP’s Madhya Pradesh unit on Thursday planted saplings in the potholes on the roads in Bhopal and named them after politicians. Before the 2015 civic polls in Bhopal, nearly 800-km long roads were reconstructed, but a majority of those are now damaged, said party’s state coordinator Alok Agrawal. The party further demanded that the roads be repaired within 15 days.
