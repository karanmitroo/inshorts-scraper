Shiv Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, has advocated abolishing the 'triple talaq' system, saying it shows "how tough is the battle of justice for Muslim women in our country". The editorial also slammed the "secular" people who maintain silence on triple talaq while opinionating on the "ill-traditions" of Hinduism at the same time.
