Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is reportedly contemplating legal action against the BJP after the party accused him of facilitating denotification of land worth â‚¹300 crore in Bhoopasandra in order to help his aide. Calling the allegation "baseless, frivolous, and politically motivated", he said that he has not approved any case of denotification during his tenure as Chief Minister so far.
