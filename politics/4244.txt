UP CM Akhilesh Yadav released his own list of 235 candidates for UP polls on Thursday, a day after Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav released the official list of 325 candidates. This comes amid reports of a tussle in SP before the upcoming 2017 Assembly polls in UP. Reports claimed that Mulayam sidelined Akhilesh loyalists from his candidates' list.
