The Nagaland government has appointed Chief Minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu's son Khriehu Liezietsu and has given him the rank and status of a cabinet minister. Khriehu will be entitled to all facilities, allowances, and pay admissible to a cabinet minister. This comes a month after Khriehu resigned from his seat to make way for his father's election as an MLA.
