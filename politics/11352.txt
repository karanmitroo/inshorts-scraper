A local court in Bihar Tuesday issued two non-bailable warrants against the RJD leader Prabhunath Singh, who had earlier threatened Saran's (Bihar) district magistrate Kundan Kumar. The threat against the DM, who had invited Singh's fury by lodging two FIRs against him last week for poll-related offences, was caught on camera. Notably, Singh has several criminal cases pending against him.
