Posters of Congress President Sonia Gandhi going 'missing' have been put up in her constituency Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, as she didn't visit the constituency even once this year. The posters, put up by the "people of Rae Bareli", also promised a "reward for anyone who can locate her". They were later removed by Congress workers.
