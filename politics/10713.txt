Rejecting the suggestion of party alliance with TMK, CPI (M) central committee member Nilotpal Basu said "No one is taking Mamataâ€™s statement seriously because she is trying to divert the public discourse as her party faces serious anti-incumbency threat". The statement came as a response to West Bengal CM Mamta Bannerjee's remarks made in the context of recent Bihar by-polls.
