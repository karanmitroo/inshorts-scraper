Union Minister Uma Bharti on Monday said BJP committed a "huge mistake" by not fielding any Muslim candidate in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh elections. "I am really feeling sorry that we could not field a Muslim," she said. In response, BJP MP Vinay Katiyar said, "When Muslims do not vote for us, then why should we give ticket to them?"
