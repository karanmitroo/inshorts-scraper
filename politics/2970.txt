Campaigning for Congress ahead of MCD polls, party Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused both PM Narendra Modi and CM Arvind Kejriwal of wasting time of people of the country and the national capital. He further accused Modi and Kejriwal of running "individual-centric" governments and "causing losses" to the country. Congress governments echo voice of every countryman, he added.
