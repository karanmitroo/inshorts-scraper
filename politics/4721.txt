Former Home Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram has claimed that "UPA policy brought several years of relative peace and tranquillity" in Kashmir. He further accused the NDA government of destroying peace in the Valley. "Between 2008 and 2012 or 2013 there was no major attack in India that could be clearly traced to a source in Pakistan," he added.
