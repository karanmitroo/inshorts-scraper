Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) were being "fudged repeatedly" in elections and demanded a probe into the matter, terming it as a "serious fraud". He further said, "EVM tampering is possible. If there is no investigation, then how can we know the truth?"
