BJP MP Vijay Goel on Friday claimed that a survey of 4,700 respondents revealed that the second phase of Odd-Even had "failed". He alleged that the scheme had increased the number of cars per household, which would increase the congestion on the city's roads. Respondents said that the scheme was implemented without proper planning and adequate public transport, Goel added.
