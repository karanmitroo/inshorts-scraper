Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Sunday, “Nitish Kumar was a diamond when he was with the BJP and once he quit the alliance and joined hands with Lalu Prasad Yadav, he has been reduced to being (a piece of) coal.” Javadekar also said that Congress and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav were responsible for the deadlock in Bihar’s development.
