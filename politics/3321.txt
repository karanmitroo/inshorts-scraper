Following Union Minister Kiren Rijiju's comment on declining Hindu population, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday said India has democracy only because Hindus are in majority. "As we see in Islamic countries where Muslims are in majority, there is no democracy," he added. He further asserted that Census of 2001 and 2011 indicated a slump in Hindu population.
