To support Narendra Modi in his Prime Ministerial bid, Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) president Gordhan Zadaphia on Monday announced his party's merger with the BJP. The GPP took the call despite getting opposition from ex-CM and one of its founder members, Suresh Mehta, who said that almost two third of GPP cadres will not follow Zadaphia in the merger.
