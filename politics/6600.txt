Independent MLA Engineer Rashid on Wednesday staged a protest inside the J&K Assembly over delay in the magisterial probe into the killing of five people in firing at Handwaraâ€‹ in April. Rashid said the government didn't complete the probe in one month, as promised. The firing had occurred over the alleged molestation of a girl by an Army man.
