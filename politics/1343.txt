The AIADMK in a meeting on Monday passed a resolution to expel jailed interim General Secretary VK Sasikala from the party and nullify all appointments made by her. Notably, the ouster of Sasikala was one of the merger conditions laid down by the Panneerselvam faction. Earlier, Sasikala's nephew and party Deputy General Secretary TTV Dhinakaran was expelled from the party.
