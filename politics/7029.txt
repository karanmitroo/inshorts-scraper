Trinamool Congress (TMC) Vice President Abdul Mannan on Saturday 'warned' people to vote for the party, else benefits availed by Below Poverty Line and handicapped voters would be stripped off. Mannan asked people to cast their votes in pairs so he knows who voted for whom. "If they do not give sufficient votes... there will be adverse effects," he said.
