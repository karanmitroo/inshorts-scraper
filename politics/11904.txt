Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday resigned from his post after 49 days in office. “I will consider myself fortunate if I have to sacrifice the chief minister’s post 1,000 times and my life to eradicate corruption,” he said after his government failed to pass its pet anti-graft legislation (the Lokpal Bill) in the Delhi Assembly.
