Bihar Chief Minister and former Railway Minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday called the Railway Budget 2016-17 'disappointing' and said it failed to focus on improving the Railways' reach and connectivity. He added that freight traffic, the major revenue generator for the railways, has been neglected as the Indian Railways has not been able to achieve the target.
