AAP MLA and Delhi's former law minister Somnath Bharti has gone absconding, said the police after raiding his home and office on Tuesday. The police have been searching Somnath to take him under their custody in a domestic violence case filed by his wife Lipika. Notably, the Delhi High Court had declined to grant him an anticipatory bail earlier today.
