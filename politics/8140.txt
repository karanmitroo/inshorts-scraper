Assam CM Tarun Gogoi has said the Congress is not in favour of 'a grand alliance like Bihar' but is considering some kind of political understanding with friendly parties for the 2016 Assembly polls. "We will fight BJP tooth and nail," said Gogoi. The Congress is in talks with Badaruddin Ajmal's AIDUF, which has a hold on Assam's Muslim population.
