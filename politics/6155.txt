After Parliament witnessed uproar over filming of its security stages by MP Bhagwant Mann, the AAP leader on Friday apologised unconditionally, assuring the act won’t be repeated. “I met Speaker madam, I told her that I must be given an opportunity to explain,” he said. He further clarified that he never wanted to put the security of Parliament at threat.
