Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday accused West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee of indulging in "vote-bank politics" and "sheltering criminals" to use them during the elections to "rig polls for her". He was addressing a rally along with other senior leaders of BJP. This was first of the four big rallies scheduled by the party this month in West Bengal.
