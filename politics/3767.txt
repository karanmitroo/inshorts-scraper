The Election Commission (EC) on Saturday censured Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for violation of Model Code of Conduct during his January 8 speech in Goa. Meanwhile, Kejriwal took to Twitter and said, "EC order against me is completely wrong. Lower court gave the order in my favour. EC ignored court's order. Will challenge EC's latest order in court."
