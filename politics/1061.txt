Patidar leader Hardik Patel has claimed that the BJP has a ₹500-crore budget to buy activists protesting against the government. Claiming that Gujarat's farmers, traders, and workers are fed up with the BJP's rule, Patel said the people cannot be bought by the party. This comes after Patidar leader Narendra Patel claimed he was offered ₹1 crore to join BJP.
