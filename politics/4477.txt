Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday claimed that several politicians have become beggars following the demonetisation of old high-denomination notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A politician even suffered a heart attack and had to later clarify that it was not related to the demonetisation, he further claimed. Parrikar was addressing BJP's Vikas Sankalp rally in Goa.
