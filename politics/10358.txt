Taking a dig at P Chidambaram, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh Sunday said that any party leader can fight elections for becoming its chief. "Chidambaram is free to contest... Gandhi family has not stopped any non-Gandhi from contesting elections," Singh said. Chidambaram had recently said a person other than a member of the Gandhi family could become the president of Congress.
