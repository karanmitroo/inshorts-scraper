BJP workers staged a protest outside Bengaluru's Mahalakshmi Layout Police Station on Saturday, after BJP state President BS Yeddyurappa was summoned by police in an alleged kidnapping case. Protestors claimed that the Congress-led Karnataka government was misusing the police to target Yeddyurappa. They also demanded that the police recorded Yeddyurappa's statement at his residence.
