West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday said PM Narendra Modi's assertion that common people were sleeping peacefully and the rich were searching for sleeping pills was an insult. "This is...in bad taste. My humble suggestion is not to hit the common people like this," she tweeted. PM Modi made the statement in reference to the demonetisation of old notes.
