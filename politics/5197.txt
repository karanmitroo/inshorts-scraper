Addressing a rally in UP's Bundelkhand, PM Narendra Modi on Monday accused both SP and BSP of looting the state in their own turns, stating that when they come to power they don’t take action against the other. “SP-BSP-BSP-SP. The power keeps shifting, and in this game, this land never reached its potential,” he added.
