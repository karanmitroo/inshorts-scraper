Amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Thursday, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "warmonger" for pushing India to a war-like situation with Pakistan. "He sees this as the only option to win the next election," he added. "Please...for the sake of our children's future Pakistan and India should stop playing war games," Singh said.
