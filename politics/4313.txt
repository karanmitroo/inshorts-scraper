Union Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday asked Mayawati whether she was trying to hide her corruption by using the Dalit card. "Is it right to call an investigation as move against Dalits? Is she trying to say that her corruption is a struggle for the rights of Dalits. It is disrespectful to Dalits," Prasad added.
