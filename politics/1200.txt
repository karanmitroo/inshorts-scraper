Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday slammed the BJP and asked the party to refrain from teaching Sena members about patriotism. He alleged that those who favoured demonetisation were considered patriotic while those who opposed the move were termed as traitors. He further criticised the BJP government over the GST rollout and the introduction of bullet trains.
