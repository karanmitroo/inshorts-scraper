Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel on Tuesday rejected the media reports suggesting that BJP is considering her removal. "Nothing like that is on," Anandiben asserted, blaming the media for wrongly drawing the conclusion by connecting her and Health Minister Nitin Patel's visit to Delhi. Recent media reports had claimed that BJP might ask her to step down from the post.
