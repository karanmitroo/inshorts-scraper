Posters bearing AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's picture have been put across the national capital on April Fool's Day. The posters, with the text 'wishing all the Delhiites a very happy April 1 Kejriwal Divas', were reportedly put up by the Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena (BSKS), a New Delhi-based right-wing nationalist organisation.
