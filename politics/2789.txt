West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that the Election Commission should convene all-party meeting to discuss the matter of EVMs tampering. "I have seen the Election Commissioner's version that there is nothing. But I have also gone through a video tape of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in which he says these EVMs can be tampered with," she added.
