VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi on Thursday sparked a controversy by saying there are "one or two terrorists" in Parliament. Her remarks were directed at MPs who were against hanging of 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon. "[I]t is not just an insult to the Parliament but also the Constitution", Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said, demanding action against the Sadhvi.
