BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha has reportedly said he was sidelined by the party and results of Bihar elections could have been different if it had projected him as CM candidate. "I can't say how much difference it could have been, but I can definitely say, some difference would have been there. We could have definitely got more seats," he said.
