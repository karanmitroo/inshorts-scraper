The Congress on Thursday said it supports the Triple Talaq bill, but suggested it be strengthened in favour of Muslim women to ensure that subsistence allowance and maintenance to them is not stopped. Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, "We believe that there is a need to strengthen this law." The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
