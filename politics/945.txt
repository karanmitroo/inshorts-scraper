Former Samta Party leader Jaya Jaitly has released a letter allegedly written by Congress President Sonia Gandhi in 2004, asking the then Finance Minister P Chidambaram to look into the probe against Tehelka Magazine's financiers "on priority." While releasing the letter, Jaitly claimed that Congress benefited from the Tehelka sting that exposed corruption during former PM Atal Bihari's tenure.
