Addressing SP's national convention, Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said it was his duty as a son to act against anti-party elements if there was a conspiracy against Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav). "When the party comes back into power with a majority, Netaji would be the happiest," he added. Notably, Akhilesh was unanimously elected as the party chief at the convention.
