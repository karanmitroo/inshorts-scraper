The Supreme Court on Friday cancelled the bail granted to former Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, an accused in the Rajiv Roshan murder case. “SC said Rajeev Roshan case trial needs to be expedited and Mohammad Shahabuddin has to be sent back to jail,” said senior advocate Prashant Bhushan who had filed a petition against Shahabuddin's bail.
