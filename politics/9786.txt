Commenting on the Delhi elections, the New York Times has called the results "A Defeat for PM Modi". "Fresh from the diplomatic high of a successful summit meeting with President Obama, PM Narendra Modi has been brought down to earth by domestic politics," the US daily said. The defeat will "increase the pressure to deliver" on Modi government, it added.
