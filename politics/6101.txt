Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who on Friday got bail in a defamation case filed by Punjab Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, has dared the latter to get him arrested within six months, while his party was in power. “In the coming elections, people will take revenge from Majithia… After six months (I will) reconstruct a new Punjab," Kejriwal added.
