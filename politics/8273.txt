Prashant Kishor, publicity strategist in PM Modi's highly successful Lok Sabha election campaign, helped Nitish Kumar set up an offensive in Bihar. Reportedly, Kishor's Patna war room helped Nitish counter PM Modi's claims at election rallies. “Our purpose was limited: do not allow a Modi hype to build,” Kishor, who is said to not care for parties or ideologies, said.
