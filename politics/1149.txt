Launching Congress' poll campaign in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government's economic policies have caused unemployment in the country. "The Centre hurried the implementation of GST, which has resulted in job losses. In Gujarat, 30 lakh young men and women have lost their jobs due to GST roll out," he added.
