Following PM Narendra Modi's announcement of a Rs 1.25 lakh crore package for Bihar, former deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Modi said on Tuesday the NDA alliance has an edge in the elections. "What the PM has done is to fulfill his promise. He had said he would return the favour if NDA assumed office," he added.
