Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday took a jibe at the RBI guidelines on withdrawing money for weddings by tweeting that the tradition of giving money to sister-in-laws should include a declaration that they do not have bank accounts. The RBI had asked for evidence of the wedding and declarations that those receiving cash do not have bank accounts.
