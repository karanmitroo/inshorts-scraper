More than two lakh gun-toting paramilitary personnel, thousands of vehicles and nearly a dozen helicopters will be deployed across the country to ensure smooth and violence-free elections beginning Apr-7. Notably, this Lok Sabha election, which will be held between Apr-7 and May-12 on nine dates, has the highest number of phases for any general election held so far.
