Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said that PM Narendra Modi shaking hands with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the recent Climate Summit in Paris shows his 'tolerance'. According to Raut, despite being criticised constantly by the country, meeting the PM of a country that spreads terrorism is the most tolerant thing Modi has done.
