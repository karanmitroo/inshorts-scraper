CM Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has requested the Centre to change the state's governor, Keshari Nath Tripathi before the Assembly polls in 2016. The Governor's recommendation for using central security forces during municipal polls especially irked the state government. In September, Mamata had raised the issue accusing the Centre of using governors to run a “parallel government.”
