BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday launched his party's campaign for the Bihar Assembly elections, expected to be held in September or October this year. Promising to replicate the NDA government's one year of good governance in the state, Shah rolled out 160 'raths' or chariots draped with BJP banners as part of the 'parivartan yatra' or journey of change.
