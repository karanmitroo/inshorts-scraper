Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Tuesday termed Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's 'reform or perish' statement as "pro-capitalist" agenda of the BJP. "Competition is healthy only when there is level playing field for everybody," Gogoi said. Jaitley had earlier said that states should compete with each other to attract investments and that reform or perish was applicable in today's times.
