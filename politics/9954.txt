AAP chief and former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has not been invited for the Republic Day Parade. The party feels that the government is breaking the protocol by not inviting an ex-chief minister. Kejriwal, who was keen to attend the parade, where US President Barack Obama will be the chief guest, is unhappy with Modi government's move.
