Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday said that Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav fears no one except him and his MP son Chirag Paswan. His statement came after Lalu proposed that Ram Vilas should be dropped from the council of ministers and former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi should be inducted in the Cabinet instead.
