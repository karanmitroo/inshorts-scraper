Gujarat Water Supply Minister and BJP leader Babu Bokhiria has said the Congress wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to become the first Prime Minister of independent India in 1947. Intending to take Sardar Patel's name, Bokhiria mistakenly said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name, reports said. Prime Minister Modi, who was born in 1950, was elected to the position in 2014.
