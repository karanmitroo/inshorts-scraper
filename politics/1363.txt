Sidelined AIADMK Deputy General Secretary TTV Dhinakaran on Sunday removed Tamil Nadu CM E Palaniswami from the post of party's Salem District Secretary. Dhinakaran has replaced several party functionaries since the two rival AIADMK factions announced a merger. However, party leaders have maintained Dhinakaran has no powers to carry out such changes and questioned his re-induction into the party.
