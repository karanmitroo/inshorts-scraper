President Pranab Mukherjee Friday decided not to vote in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, in order to express his “neutrality in the political fray”. He had completed all the formalities for voting through postal ballot, thus making him the first Head of the State to do so, but he decided not to vote keeping in tradition with his predecessors.
