RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday tweeted that he strengthens the voice of "Bharat" on "Twitter India" to make 10% VIP Indians realise what 90% common people think. Earlier, he had criticised demonetisation saying that PM Narendra Modi should choose his favourite "chauraha" (roundabout) where people could punish him for creating a chaotic condition.
