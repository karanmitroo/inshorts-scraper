The Congress has filed a complaint with Election Commission (EC) against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for his 'bribe remarks' made at a poll rally on Sunday. The party has demanded action against Kejriwal saying that by making such a statement, he was encouraging people to take the bribe for voting and had "maligned" the electoral process.
