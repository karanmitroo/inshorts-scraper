The Karnataka police have filed a case against alleged BJP and Hindu Jagarana Vedike activists, for celebrating writer Ananthamurhy's death, soon after its news arrived. The writer was against the BJP and had said that he'd leave the country if Narendra Modi became the PM. The activists burnt crackers to 'celebrate' the Jnanpith and Padma award winning author's death.
