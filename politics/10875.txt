DMK chief M Karunanidhi on Tuesday condemned former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju's statement saying that his remarks were an attempt to degrade judiciary. Katju had alleged that political pressure from a 'TN partner' during the previous UPA regime had led to elevation of a Madras high court judge despite charges of corruption against him.
