Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Monday said that the champion of 'mann ki baat' retreats to 'maun vrat' whenever there is a scam in which his colleagues are involved. "He has been conspicuous by his deafening silence on blatant transgressions by his External Affairs Minister and two of his CMs," she added.
