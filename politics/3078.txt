Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has held wrong policies made under India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru responsible for problems in Kashmir. This comes after senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said India has nearly lost Kashmir. Moreover, Naidu also dubbed Chidambaram's statement as "irresponsible and immature". Naidu also called for Congress party clarifying its stand on Chidambaram's statement.
