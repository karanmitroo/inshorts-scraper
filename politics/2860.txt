Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav defended his son and outgoing CM Akhilesh Yadav for the party's loss in the UP elections, saying no one person is responsible for the defeat. "It seems that we were unable to impress the people. Everyone is responsible for the loss," Mulayam said. SP won just 47 seats in UP against BJP's 325 seats.
