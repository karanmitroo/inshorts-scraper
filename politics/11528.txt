The BJP on Thursday sacked Manvendra Singh - expelled party leader Jaswant Singh's son - from its national executive. The move came in wake of reports that he was campaigning against the party's candidate Sonaram Chaudhary in Barmer. 
Manvendra, an MLA in Rajasthan, has been campaigning for his father - who is contesting as an independent.
