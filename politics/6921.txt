BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday reacted to Congress President Sonia Gandhi's statement, "I'm not scared of anybody", made after she was dragged into the AgustaWestland controversy. "BJP leaders fear the Constitution, rule of law and societal norms. And you have rightly said that you do not fear anybody. So, such matters keep on coming to the fore," Shah said.
