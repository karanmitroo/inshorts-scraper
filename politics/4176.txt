A new group has been formed in support of late TN CM J Jayalalithaa's niece, Deepa Jayakumar, in Trichy and has been named "Puratchi Malar Deepa Peravai". "We mainly want Deepa to take the place of Amma. She should become the chief minister," said AIADMK worker Rangaraj. He also claimed that about 10 lakh people have already joined the group.
