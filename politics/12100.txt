The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday launched the ‘Modi for PM fund’ drive to collect donations from the people. Though the party has formally denied that this plan was inspired by AAP, sources said AAP did influence the BJP in going for this move. BJP president Rajnath Singh inaugurated the move by donating Rs.1,000.
