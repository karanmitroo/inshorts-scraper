Journalist-turned-AAP leader Ashutosh Friday broke down during a live TV debate on Aaj Tak news channel while talking to Megha, the daughter of the farmer who committed suicide during AAP rally. Weeping uncontrollably, Ashutosh said, "I'm your guilty, Megha. I couldn't save your father." He further urged BJP leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, not to play politics over the issue.
