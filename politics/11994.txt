Responding harshly to the power supply companies, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday directed the power sector regulator to cancel the license of the two companies, if the city faces balckout. Last week, the two firms, BSES Rajdhani and BSES Yamuna (owned by Reliance Infra Group), had warned of cutting power supply in the city stating that they have run out of money.
