After goof-up in calculations in his tweet questioning PM Narendra Modi on the issue of rising prices, Congress Vice-President deleted it and posted a corrected version. Gandhi had posted the wrong increase percentage in the list of essential commodities he shared along with his tweet. For instance, the list showed cylinder price rise to ₹742 from ₹414 as 179% increase.
