Seven out of ten of Aam Aadmi Party's executive members in Haryana resigned on Thursday, accusing it of being a 'one-man party'. With the resignation, they showed their support towards expelled party leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan's rebel group 'Swaraj Abhiyan'. They further objected to Naresh Balyan's appointment as the state affairs in-charge, replacing Yadav from the post.
