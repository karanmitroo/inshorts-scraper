Actor Kamal Haasan has said that if he ever enters politics in Tamil Nadu, he and his men are so angry that they will come with guns. "Tamil Nadu has not had the best of service from politicians for more than 60 years now.... They are taking it too lightly because they have been charlatans for too long," added Kamal.
