Senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj has opposed the proposed merger of the party with Karnataka's BSR Congress, because the party has among its members the Bellary mining barons and Reddy brothers - Janardhana, Karunakara and Somashekara. Notably, the Reddy brothers had earlier quit the BJP following their arrest in the Bellary mining scam and floated the BSR Congress.
