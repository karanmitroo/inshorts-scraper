Bahujan Samaj Party Chief Mayawati on Tuesday termed the Centre's lottery scheme announcement for using cashless transaction modes 'a bluff'. "The move would not undo the atrocities committed against Ambedkar followers under BJP rule," Mayawati said. She further called upon the Centre to give â‚¹3 lakh each as a relief to the family of those who lost lives over demonetisation.
