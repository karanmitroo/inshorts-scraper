Narendra Modi is the "most searched politician" online in India, followed by AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, a Google survey report said on Monday. The report was based on the search data for a period of 90 days starting from Jan-18. MNS chief Raj Thackeray and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi trail behind Kejriwal, the survey added.
