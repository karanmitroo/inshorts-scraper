Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Wednesday said that the BJP is desperate to form the state's government since March 18 and is responsible for the ongoing political crisis. The Congress filed a petition in the Uttarakhand High court challenging the imposition of President's rule in Uttarakhand and Rawat expects that the court would do justice in the matter.
