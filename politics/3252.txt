Making her maiden speech while campaigning in UP, Priyanka Gandhi slammed PM Narendra Modi for his 'adopted son' remark and asked if the state really needed any leader from outside when it has its own sons. Modi had earlier said he was UP's adopted son. Priyanka said this at a rally with his brother and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi.
