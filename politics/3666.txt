Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to present the Union Budget 2017-2018 after the Assembly elections in five states. In a letter to Modi, the Samajwadi Party chief has asked the government to present the Budget after March 8, fearing that if it is not done, poll-bound states might miss out on central schemes.
