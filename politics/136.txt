Meghalaya and Nagaland registered around 75% voter turnout during the Assembly elections on Tuesday. The turnout is expected to rise in Meghalaya as the Election Commission has not received data from all polling booths in the state, officials said. Elections were conducted for 59 out of the 60 constituencies in the states.
