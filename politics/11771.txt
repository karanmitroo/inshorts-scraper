Following the AAP-BJP clashes in Delhi last week, the Election Commission in its probe blames the AAP for violating the model code of conduct. EC expressed its dissatisfaction over AAP's response to the showcause notice sent by them. AAP replied saying the protest was an "instant reaction" to Kejriwal's detention in Gujarat and not a "planned event".
