Congress leader Anand Sharma on Wednesday filed his nomination for the lone Rajya Sabha (RS) seat in his home state, Himachal Pradesh. Sharma, the deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha, resigned from the House on Monday to contest elections. He will be fighting for the seat, which falls vacant after BJP's Bimla Kashyap retires on April 2.
