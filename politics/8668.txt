The Congress on Friday expressed its dissatisfaction over the Election Commission's decision of not banning PM Narendra Modi's radio show 'Mann Ki Baat'. "The programme shouldn't have been permitted. This is an unfair practice to say something through a government medium," party leader Sandeep Dikshit said. "Constitutional bodies should... not relent under pressure," Cong minister KC Mittal said.
