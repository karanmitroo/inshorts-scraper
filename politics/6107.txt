The government on Wednesday rejected criticism regarding the amendment brought by it in the Lok Sabha to extend the deadline of July 31 for declaration of assets by NGOs receiving government funds. There is no intention to dilute the Lokpal Act, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said, adding that the amendment bill was brought after consulting all political parties.
