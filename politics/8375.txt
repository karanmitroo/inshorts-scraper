The Election Commission on Friday objected to BJP's 'quota conspiracy' ads being printed  in two of Bihar's local newspapers and prohibited media from printing any such ads. The ads reportedly take a jibe at Lalu-Nitish' caste tactics and pitch dalits and minorities against each other. EC warned local leaders of violation, remarking that such ads were capable of creating disharmony.
