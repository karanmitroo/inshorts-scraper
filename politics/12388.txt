Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said, Delhi legislative assembly has served a notice for breach of privilege to me for saying that I would call an open session of the assembly in Ramlila Maidan (to pass Jan Lokpal Bill) after winning. He added that the notice perceived his attempt to be misleading, as the party cannot hold an open assembly session.
