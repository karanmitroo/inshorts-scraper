When asked what role BJP veteran LK Advani will play in a new government, former party president Nitin Gadkari said: “Atalji (Bihari Vajpayee) and Advaniji are our founder members, our most senior leaders. The party’s parliamentary board will take an appropriate decision at an appropriate time (about Advani)." “The guidance of Advaniji is very important,” he added.
