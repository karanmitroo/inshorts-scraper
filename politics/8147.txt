After reports that Rahul Gandhi's questions to students of Mount Carmel College in Bangalore backfired, a student of the college, who was present at the event, said the audience's response to Gandhi was misconstrued. In an open letter, the student, Elixir Nahar, criticised the media's approach to covering the event and said Gandhi was "inspiring and spirited".
