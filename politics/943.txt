During a rally in Himachal Pradesh's Kangra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday compared the Congress to termites, which have to be taken out from the roots. Adding that Congress was getting the "fruit of its sins", he said, "I have heard that Congress has lost the trust of its own leaders and is looking for rebels in other parties."
