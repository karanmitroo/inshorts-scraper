The Aam Aadmi Party as well as the Akali Dal on Wednesday demanded a SIT probe into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, after Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi admitted some party members' involvement in the violence. "We don't want an apology but action against the culprits in the 1984 riots. We demand a SIT probe," said Akali Dal.
