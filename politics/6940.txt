Actor and BJP MP Paresh Rawal on Monday rendered an apology to Delhi CM Kejriwal as he violated the ongoing odd-even scheme in the national capital. "Made a serious blunder... Sorry to Arvind ji and Delhiites," Rawal tweeted after being fined for breaking the rule. Rawal was travelling in an even numbered car on a day for odd numbered cars.
