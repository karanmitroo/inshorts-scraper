Home Minister Rajnath Singh drew flak from RSS leaders in Bengal over his post on social media where he commemorated August 18 as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's death anniversary. West Bengal's RSS leaders said they believe the post was a conspiracy to "hide the truth about Netaji". The post in question was removed from social media after protests.
