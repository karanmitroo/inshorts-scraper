The Election Commission on Thursday allotted sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran a 'pressure cooker' symbol to contest the RK Nagar bypoll on December 21. The 'hat' symbol that was demanded by the Dhinakaran-led AIADMK faction was given to another party. Dhinakaran is contesting the election as an independent, whereas the EPS-OPS camp has nominated AIADMK Presidium Chairman Madhusudhanan.
