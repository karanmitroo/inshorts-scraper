Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Paul, who was arrested over the Rose Valley chit fund scam, has said Union Minister and BJP leader Babul Supriyo had tricked him into the scam. "I am innocent. I am in no way involved... and the truth will come to the fore soon," Paul added. However, the BJP dismissed the allegations against Supriyo as "meaningless".
