Commenting on the ongoing power tussle in the Samajwadi Party, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said this "dangal" will bring "mangal" for BJP in the upcoming polls in Uttar Pradesh. Claiming that people were least bothered about the feud, Naqvi asserted that the public wanted answers from the Akhilesh Yadav-led government with regard to corruption, crime and misgovernance under it.
