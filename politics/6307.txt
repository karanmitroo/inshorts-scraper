Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has accused the BJP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi of trying to protect suspects of terrorist activities. Singh said that while the BJP is “hell bent” on saving the Malegaon blast accused, Owaisi is attempting to protect the youths caught by the NIA for alleged links with the IS by providing them with legal aid.
