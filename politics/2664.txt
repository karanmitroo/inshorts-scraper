UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday directed the top officials of the state to lay down clear guidelines for anti-Romeo squads to prevent "unnecessary harassment" of boys and girls spending time together with consent. Some policemen in UP have reportedly claimed they can "identify a Romeo just by the look in their eyes, their face and the way they stand".
