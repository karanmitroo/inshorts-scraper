BJP's Uttar Pradesh Vice President Dayashankar Singh on Wednesday compared Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati to a prostitute while condemning her ticket distribution policy. "Even a prostitute fulfils her commitment to a man after she is paid. But Mayawati, such a big leader in UP, sells party tickets to anyone who pays her the highest amount," Singh said.
