Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday said his brother Shivpal Yadav did not speak to him before announcing his new secular front. No one in the family or party wanted a split in the 25-year-old party, he added. "As for the front, he has simply given a statement. I will talk to him, pacify him," Mulayam Singh added.
