The BJP on Friday released its Assam Vision Document 2016-2025 for the polls, which promised to ensure sealing the Indo-Bangladesh border. It also promised to pass a law to "deal sternly" with people employing infiltrators. Speaking at the event, Union Minister Arun Jaitley accused the Congress of trying to "destroy and change the demography of the state by encouraging infiltration."
