Separatist Kashmiri leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani on Friday said, "I'm not an Indian by birth. It is a compulsion." He gave the statement while talking to the media outside the passport office. The 88-year-old applied for a passport today to visit his ailing daughter in Saudi Arabia, for which he had to write 'Indian' in the nationality column.
