Reacting to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's post about his pet dog, BJP IT in-charge Amit Malviya posted a morphed poster of Akshay Kumar's upcoming movie 'Padman' with Gandhi's face.
The tweet was captioned, 'Pidi lao, Congress bachao'. Gandhi's post earlier on Sunday had read, "People been asking who tweets for this guy..I'm coming clean..it's me..Pidi..I'm way (cooler) than him."
