Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley criticised BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday for signing a petition to the President against the execution of Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon. Jaitley said it was "extremely sad" that the actor-turned-politician had gone against the party line. The Union Minister further added that Shatrughan "embarrassed" the BJP by signing the petition.
