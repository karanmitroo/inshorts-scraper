West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that the Congress and CPI (M) have entered into an unlawful alliance to halt development taking place under the Trinamool Congress-led (TMC) government in West Bengal. Banerjee further said, "The BJP has also somewhere joined hands with them". The TMC would contest the elections alone, she added.
