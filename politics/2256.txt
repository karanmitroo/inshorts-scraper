Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has slashed the security cover of several Opposition leaders including former state Chief Ministers Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. Security cover of Samajwadi Party leaders Shivpal Yadav, Azam Khan, Dimple Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav has also been downgraded. However, the UP government has reportedly provided Z category security to BJP leader Vinay Katiyar.
