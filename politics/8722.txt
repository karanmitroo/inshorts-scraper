Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday said that the grand alliance of JD(U)-RJD-Congress was a sinking ship as its captain Mulayam Singh Yadav had deserted it ahead of Bihar elections. Slamming JD(U)'s remark that Mulayam had walked out of the grand alliance under pressure from the BJP, Prasad said that it was an "insult" to the Samajwadi Party chief.
