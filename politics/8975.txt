The BJP has accused the opposition Congress of wanting to play politics on the multi-crore Vyapam scam, which has witnessed over 35 deaths. BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi on Monday said, "The Vyapam case is in the purview of the court. If the Congress still makes hue and cry on it, means they just want to play politics on the issue."
