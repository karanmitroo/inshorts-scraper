Ahead of PM Modi's scheduled visit to Jharkhand, a Ranchi resident received a threat SMS that read 'Kill Modi'. Jharkhand Director General of Police (DGP), Rajeev Kumar said, "The text seems to be a prank, but the police is not taking it lightly." The Prime Minister will visit Jharkhand state on Nov 11 to campaign for the five-phase state polls.
