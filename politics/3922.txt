BJP's Haryana Minister Anil Vij has said that Khadi's sales dropped ever since Mahatma Gandhi was linked to it, but adding PM Narendra Modi as a brand has boosted its sale by 14%. "Gandhiji's name is such that our currency started devaluing ever since it was put on notes. Gradually he will be removed from currency notes," he added.
