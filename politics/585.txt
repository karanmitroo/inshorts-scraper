Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde on Sunday said, "We are here to change the Constitution." Adding that those claiming to be secular and progressive did not have an identity of their parents and blood, he said, "I will be happy if someone identifies as Muslim, Christian, Brahmin, Lingayat or Hindu. But trouble will arise if they say they are secular."
