Shiv Sena's veteran leader Manohar Joshi has said that the political party is no longer a partner with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). "We as a party know how to manage alliances. Don't forget, we also worked with the Muslim League for a while...today the Shiv Sena isn't in an alliance with the BJP, it's just an adjustment," he said.
