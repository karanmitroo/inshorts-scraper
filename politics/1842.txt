The Madhya Pradesh police on Tuesday lodged an FIR against Congress MLA Shakuntala Khatik for inciting party workers to violence during last week's farmer protests. The FIR was based on a video clip wherein Khatik was seen asking Congress workers to set the Karera police station on fire. The police raided her residence but the MLA could not be found.
