Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was more interested in visiting Italy than his parliamentary constituency Amethi. "It is not his fault but that of the Italian glasses he wears over his eyes," Adityanath added. He further ridiculed Gandhi for questioning the progress made under the NDA regime.
