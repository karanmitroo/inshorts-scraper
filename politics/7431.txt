Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said that the BJP was engaged in an "ideological battle" with JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar, and that Kumar's posturing after his release was a "victory" for the party. Citing several instances, Jaitley also said it is the "historical tradition" of the communist forces to "speak against the country's interest" and "divide the country".
