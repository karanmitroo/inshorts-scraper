The Kashmir unit of BJP on Friday asked Pakistan to stop dreaming about the Valley and set its own house in order instead. BJP spokesperson Khalid Jehangir said, "Terrorists are running a parallel government there. The so-called political representatives are nothing more than puppets who dance to the tunes of their Army generals."
