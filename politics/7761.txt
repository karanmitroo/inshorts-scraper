In protest against "unreasonable" increase in property tax imposed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee (CPCC) has called for a state-wide shutdown on Friday. According to the protestors, the government is confused about the hike in property tax in the state. The Congress Party might approach the court if the taxes are not cut down.
