Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has allowed his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal free-of-cost government accommodation of his choice "as a goodwill gesture". "The necessary policy changes are being made to accommodate Badal," a government spokesperson said. Notably, the existing policy does not provide for official residence to former chief ministers in the state.
