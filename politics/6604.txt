Former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Wednesday accepted responsibility for Congress' defeat in the Assembly polls. â€œWe will analyse why we faced such a debacle. We must have committed some mistakes. We apologise to the people for that," he said. Gogoi added that Congress workers are not disheartened as the party still got 31% votes against BJP's 29%.
