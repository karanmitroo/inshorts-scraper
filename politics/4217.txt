UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's political advisor Steve Jarding has denied writing an e-mail suggesting about staging a feud in the Samajwadi Party and called the mail a 'slanderous campaign'. The e-mail, which got circulated on the social media, was sent reportedly from Jarding's account suggesting the plan of a fight within the family and in turn 'consolidating' Akhilesh's clean image.
