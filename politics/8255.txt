Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring back Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan's ring from the UK, which allegedly has the name of Lord Rama engraved on it. Khan's demand comes in the wake of anti-Tipu Sultan protests that are currently rocking Karnataka. He also asked Modi to bring back the Kohinoor diamond.
