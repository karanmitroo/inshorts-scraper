Congress MLA and Leader of Opposition, Abdul Mannan was injured in a ruckus that ensued in the West Bengal Assembly over Property Damage Bill. The proposed legislation seeks to deter vandals, rioters, and arsonists, who could face imprisonment up to a maximum of 7 years for damaging property. The ruckus happened after the Opposition demanded more amendments in the bill.
