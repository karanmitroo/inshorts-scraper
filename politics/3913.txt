Union Minister Radha Mohan Singh has held the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government responsible for the Patna boat tragedy and said the incident shows the government's failure. At least 24 people were killed after a boat had capsized in river Ganga in Patna on Saturday. The victims were reportedly participating in a state government-organised event on the occasion of 'Makar Sankranti'.
