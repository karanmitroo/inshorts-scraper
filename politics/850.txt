Comparing Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and Sultan Alauddin Khilji, BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao on Wednesday said Rahul's visits to temples were a 'drama'. Stating that Aurangzeb used to make false promises about building temples, Rao said Gandhi was making similar promises. He is visiting temples to mislead people ahead of the elections, Rao added.
