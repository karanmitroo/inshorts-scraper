The Election Commission on Monday issued a notice to Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal for violating the model code of conduct by allegedly promoting bribery during the party's election campaign in Goa. Kejriwal had asked voters to take the money offered by Congress and BJP, but vote only for AAP, during an election rally in Goa on January 8.
