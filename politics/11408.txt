Seeking to counter the perception that PM Manmohan Singh was silent, PMO's communications advisor Pankaj Pachauri said in the last 10 years, the PM gave around 1,198 speeches - almost one every three days. PMO also issued more than 1,600 press releases. The PMO blamed media for not giving sufficient coverage to Singh's thrust on development and achievements of UPA-2.
