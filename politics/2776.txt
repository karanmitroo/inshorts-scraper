Over a million Muslims, mostly women, have signed a petition moved by RSS-affiliated Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) against the practice of triple talaq. "The representatives from the state and the government must come and sit together to start a debate on this so that Muslim women can claim a human status," the MRM stated.
