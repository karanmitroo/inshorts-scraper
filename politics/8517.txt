Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday alleged that RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav wished to control Bihar using a "remote control" as he considered himself to be "Big Boss". Referring to Lalu's conviction in the fodder scam, Modi said, "What crime did he do that the Indian judicial system had to keep him out of the electoral race".
