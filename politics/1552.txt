Yoga guru Ramdev on Saturday said, "The way China is supporting Pakistani terrorists openly and threatening India of war...the time has come to give them a befitting reply and merge PoK with India again." He further asked the citizens of India to boycott all the China-made products and be prepared to support the Centre if China calls for war.
