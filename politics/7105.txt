Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has moved the Supreme Court against the Lok Sabha's decision to pass the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Ramesh claimed that the Aadhaar Bill has provisions that make it inadmissible as a money bill. Notably, money bills can be passed by the Parliament with or without the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.
