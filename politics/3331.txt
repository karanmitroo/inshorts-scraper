BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday accused 'certain Union Ministers' of meddling with the political affairs of Tamil Nadu. He also filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking the appointment of AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala as the state's Chief Minister. Swamy, however, refused to name the ministers who were taking 'undue interest' in the ongoing political crisis.
