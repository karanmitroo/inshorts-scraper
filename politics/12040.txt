Former TV news anchor and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national spokesperson Ashutosh, who visited Gujarat, on Saturday said he has come face-to-face with the hollowness of Gujarat chief minister and BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's false claims of development. During his visit, Ashutosh said, "to expose Modi's false development propaganda is a challenge before us."
