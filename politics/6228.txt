After the Supreme Court order to restore the Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh on Wednesday, BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma called the verdict 'strange'. "It is a strange SC order as it asks the person with a majority to sit in Opposition and the one with minority support to run the government," Sharma said.
