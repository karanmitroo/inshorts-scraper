After the Election Commission ordered an FIR against AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal over his 'bribery' remark, Union Minister Manohar Parrikar has urged the voters in Goa to take money, but vote for BJP. "I understand if someone organises a rally and you take â‚¹500 for moving around, that isn't a problem. But when you vote, choose the lotus," he said.
