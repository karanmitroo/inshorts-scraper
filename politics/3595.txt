The Shiv Sena on Tuesday asked the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) not to field candidates in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections if it is offering an unconditional support to the BJP. After ruling out any alliance with the MNS for the polls, the Shiv Sena said if the MNS fields candidates, "it is apparent that MNS is BJP's B team".
