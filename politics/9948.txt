Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Thursday alleged that some former PMs had compromised the country's "deep assets". "After all, you have to build deep assets. Deep assets are created over 20-30 years. Sadly, there were some PMs who compromised deep assets", Parrikar said. He, however refrained from naming them. "I am not going to disclose names. Many people know", he said.
