Unidentified men raised slogans in support of BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi and pelted stones during an AAP rally addressed by Shazia Ilmi in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) on Sunday. Later, AAP workers and police chased the men but they managed to flee. AAP's district convener Amit Sharma claimed that anti-social elements of BJP and Congress were involved in it.
