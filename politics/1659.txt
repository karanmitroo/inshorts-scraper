Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said that it is very sad and unfortunate that President Ram Nath Kovind did not mention Jawaharlal Nehru's name in his maiden speech. "Though he did mention his cabinet colleagues BR Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in his speech after assuming the country's top post," Azad added.
