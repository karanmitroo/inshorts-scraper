The Bombay High Court has granted bail to three murder accused men, saying that they did not kill the man over a personal enmity and were provoked "in the name of religion". They were charged with allegedly murdering a Muslim man after attending a meeting of the right-wing group Hindu Rashtra Sena in Pune in 2014.
