BJP on Wednesday named Harsh Vardhan(58) as the party's Delhi CM candidate for the upcoming Dec-4 assembly elections despite opposition by Delhi party chief Vijay Goel. The party expects to put up a tough fight against Congress and Aam Admi Party, which called Vardhan as the "Manmohan Singh of BJP" who was incapable of stemming the "rot" in Delhi's governance.
