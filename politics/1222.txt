Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday demanded an apology from PM Narendra Modi for police action against Banaras Hindu University students during a protest over an alleged molestation incident. "The incident at BHU is BJP's version of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao'... When girls demand their rights, they beat them up. This incident happened in the PM's constituency," Gandhi added.
