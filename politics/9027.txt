Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states may boycott a meeting of the Niti Aayog called by PM Narendra Modi to discuss the Land Acquisition Bill. The Congress has been protesting against the amendments to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. “Our position is very clear on the land acquisition Bill... So there is nothing to bargain or discuss,” a Congress leader said.
