Sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran on Friday claimed that he could get the ruling AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu dissolved if he wanted. He further said that several MLAs have asked him not to topple the government as the people opposing late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa will soon be removed from power. Dhinakaran won the RK Nagar bypolls last year.
