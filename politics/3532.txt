DMK working president MK Stalin on Saturday advised Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam to quit worrying about his post and concentrate on governance instead. "AIADMK head is only worried about removing the CM and coming to that position. As the officers can't work under Panneerselvam without AIADMK head's nod, the state machinery has come to a halt," Stalin said.
