Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party receives less than 8% of its donations in cash as against 70-80% cash donations by the Congress and BJP. He also agreed to IAS officer Ashok Khemka's tweet that suggested that taxing political parties on donations received in cash would be a big step to clean up electoral politics.
