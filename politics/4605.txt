Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday slammed the opposition parties for observing 'black day' in protest of demonetisation, saying, "It's not 'black day', it's 'black money support day' they are observing." "Gandhi ji (Mahatma Gandhi) gave a call for Satyagraha to see that victory of truth prevails; What are so-called namesake Gandhis doing? Observing protest," Naidu added.
