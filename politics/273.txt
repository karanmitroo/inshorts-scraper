After PM Narendra Modi mocked her laughter in the Parliament, Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury has said there is no Goods and Services Tax (GST) on laughter and she does not need anyone's permission. The five-time parliamentarian also added that she had now become conscious of her laughter. PM Modi had remarked he hadn't heard such laughter since the Ramayan serial.
