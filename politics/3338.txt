Addressing a gathering in Uttarakhand on Sunday, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi said PM Narendra Modi took the kachra (trash), thrown out by the Congress, into BJP. "Modiji has no right to talk about corruption. All scam-tainted leaders who were earlier with us are now with BJP," he stated. I had told Uttarakhand CM not to allow corruption, he added.
