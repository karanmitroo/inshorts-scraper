AAP on Saturday launched its Residents Welfare Association (RWA) wing in Delhi and proposed financial powers for them to tackle issues at the locality level. The party also promised to pass an RWA Act to decentralise governance to RWAs. The Act will give legal sanctity to RWAs and provide Rs.4 crore as citizen LAD fund annually to each assembly constituency.
