The Bihar government on Wednesday withdrew a case registered against RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav for stopping a government-appointed photographer in an RJD roadshow during the 2014 General elections. This is the second case against Prasad that has been withdrawn in the last 15 days. Bihar's BJP unit accused the government of being "too selective in case of Lalu Prasad".
