As AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa turned 67 Tuesday, many AIADMK supporters pierced themselves with spears and hooks as penance for 'Amma' to return to power. Special prayers, mass marriages and welfare activities were also conducted to mark the day. Earlier on Monday, a Jayalalithaa loyalist had "crucified" himself for six minutes and seven seconds as part of celebrating her birthday.
