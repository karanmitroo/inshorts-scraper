The CBI on Monday opposed a petition filed by ex-Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda seeking summons to Manmohan Singh and two others in a case pertaining to the coal block allocation to Jindal group firms. "The records not even prima facie show anything to summon the then Prime Minister as accused in the case", Special Prosecutor RS Cheema said.
