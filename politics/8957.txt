The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) in Punjab lambasted Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh on Saturday for reasoning that love affairs, dowry, and impotency were why farmers commit suicides in the country. The union claimed that 40,000 farmers committed suicide in Punjab between 1991 and 2006 due to non-payment of remunerative prices of their produce and increasing debt burdens.
