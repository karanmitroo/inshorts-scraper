AAP leader Somnath Bharti on Monday dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'police' to arrest him if there was truth in him allegedly misbehaving with guards at AIIMS. "The whole event is video recorded... Misusing the police like this, Modi ji and Amit Shah ji, you have lost the mandate," he said. Bharti had been booked on Sunday over the incident.
