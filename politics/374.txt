BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday said that he will not leave the party, but it can expel him if it wants. Sinha, who has recently launched a political platform Rashtra Manch, asserted that an atmosphere of fear is prevailing in the entire country as investigating agencies are being used against people who think differently.
