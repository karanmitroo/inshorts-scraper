BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya on Sunday said that the Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula used to offer namaz for Yakub Memon and organise beef parties, which shows that he was not a weak youth who would have committed suicide. The Minister also added that those protesting against Vemula's suicide are responsible for it and they are defaming the Prime Minister.
