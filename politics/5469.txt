Members of Navjot Singh Sindhu’s new political platform Awaaz-e-Punjab will hold a meeting “in a day or two” to decide whether the forum should forge an alliance with the Congress or the AAP for the 2017 Punjab Assembly election. Awaaz-e-Punjab has ruled out the possibility of joining any fourth front so as to not play “spoilsport” by dividing anti-incumbency votes.
