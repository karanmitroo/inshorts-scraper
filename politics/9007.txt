Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that he would be happy if Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan would return to AAP. In an interview to a TV news channel, Kejriwal admitted that their return would be beneficial for the political party. Yadav and Bhushan were expelled from the party in April and formed a "Swaraj Abhiyaan" campaign thereafter.
