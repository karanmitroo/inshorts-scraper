BJP MP Hukumdev Narayan Yadav on Monday rejected media reports alleging that he travelled alone in an airbus to a Jet Airways flight at the Patna airport, leaving other passengers waiting. "If Jet Airways says I didn't go by bus alone then why spread lies?" Yadav claimed. This comes after a Shiv Sena MP recently assaulted an airlines staffer.
