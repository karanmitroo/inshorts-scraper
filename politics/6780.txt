Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda on Wednesday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not launched any direct programmes to prevent farmers' suicides. "Some of the programmes Modi announced for farmers are not going to create any short-term impact. I have discussed this with Prime Minister. But he never answered," Gowda added.
