After the results of the Assembly elections were declared on Thursday, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the Congress needs more of an introspection than any kind of surgery. The party is losing its powers because of its wrong policies, he said. "The Congress which was once ruling across the nation has now been confined to only 44 MPs," he added.
