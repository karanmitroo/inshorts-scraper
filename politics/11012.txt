The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday decided to expand its national executive from 23 to 33 members and go on an country-wide expansion drive. "It's time to restructure the party... People will be picked who will go from village to village to bring in more people into the party. We'll call it Mission Vistar (expansion)," party convener Arvind Kejriwal said.
