Samajwadi Party General Secretary Amar Singh on Sunday asserted that he was not behind the feud in party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's family. Stating that people are putting allegations against him, he requested Mulayam to let him live and sack him. Singh said if Mulayam Singh truly believed that he had been manipulated, he should reveal it to everyone.
