The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to go into the allegations against BSP supremo Mayawati that she made a statement seeking votes in the name of caste and religion. The apex court dismissed a plea against the Allahabad High Court order which had dismissed the allegations earlier. The court asked the petitioner to seek remedy from the Election Commission.
