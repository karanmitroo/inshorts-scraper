Sparking yet another controversy, Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi Tuesday termed upper caste people as "foreigners and descendants of Aryan race". "Only tribals are indigenous people", he added. BJP senior leader and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi has slammed him for the statement and accused him of "stoking caste tension" in the state.
