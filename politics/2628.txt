BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was the only good human being in the (Nehru-Gandhi) family. Swamy added that the Congress leader had contributed to the awakening of the Hindus. "Rajiv allowed telecast of the mythological soap Ramayana on Doordarshan, the national television network, despite fierce opposition from Congress leaders," Swamy further said.
