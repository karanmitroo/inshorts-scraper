Jitan Ram Manjhi was Saturday sacked as Bihar CM after Nitish Kumar was unanimously voted leader of the house. Refusing to resign, Manjhi had earlier proposed a dissolution of the assembly. His proposal was supported by 7 ministers, while 21 pro-Nitish Kumar ministers opposed it. Nitish Kumar had resigned in 2014, after JDU's poor performance in the state.
