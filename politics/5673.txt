Protestors from the Patidar community on Thursday vandalised an event, organised to felicitate BJP President Amit Shah, by throwing chairs at the police. The protestors raised “Hardik..Hardik” and anti-BJP slogans to disrupt the proceedings. Later, the police used lathis and tear gas to disperse the protestors. As a result, Shah had to cut short his speech.
