A video has surfaced online wherein suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar is seen snatching the mike of news channel Republic TV's reporter. In the video, which starts with Aiyar apologising for using the word "neech" that could be misinterpreted to describe PM Narendra Modi, the reporter can be heard asking Aiyar repeatedly if he would apologise.
