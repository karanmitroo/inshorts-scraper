Amid speculations that AAP leader Kumar Vishwas would contest Lok Sabha election against Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Kumar was unable to participate in 'Jhadu Sandesh Yatra' organised by AAP in Amethi on Friday. Reportedly, Kumar could not attend the rally, as he was busy with preparations for Delhi CM designate Arvind Kejriwal's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi on Saturday.
