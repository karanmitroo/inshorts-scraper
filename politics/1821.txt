Darjeeling's ruling party Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) leader Bimal Gurung on Friday urged the people in the hill station to get prepared for the "final battle" for achieving the separate Gorkhaland state. "The time has come for a do or die fight if we want to achieve our dream of Gorkhaland," Gurung said.
