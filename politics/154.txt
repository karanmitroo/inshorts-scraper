Addressing a rally in poll-bound Karnataka, BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday said Congress President Rahul Gandhi should prove his allegations that the NDA government had waived off industrial loans. He added that he would apologise to the farmers in Karnataka if Gandhi could prove his claims. The Karnataka Assembly elections will be held in April-May this year.
