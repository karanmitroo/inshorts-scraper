Meghalaya BJP leader Bachu Marak has resigned from the party over the issue of beef ban, saying, "Beef-eating is part of our culture and tradition." He further said, "I cannot compromise on the sentiments of the Garos. As a Garo, it's my responsibility to protect the interest of my community. Imposition of BJP's non-secular ideology on us is not acceptable."
