BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday in the Rajya Sabha said that the Italian High Court's judgement mentioned the role of Congress leaders in the AgustaWestland issue. "The judgment described 'AP' as the political secretary. Don't we know who that is?" Swamy asked. He also asked former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to clarify as to whose orders he followed.
