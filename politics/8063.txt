Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said the RSS was a band of patriots and not like the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency. He said, "PM has been pracharak of RSS... Is it a violation of Constitution or criminal procedure code if someone is of RSS?” Gadkari added, "Congress is behaving like a fish without water after being out of power.”
