Cricketer-turned-politician and ex-BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu has formed a new political party named ‘Awaaz-e-Punjab’ along with hockey player-turned-MLA Pargat Singh and independent MLAs Simarjeet Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains. The development came after Sidhu met AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal at the latter's residence a fortnight ago. The Delhi CM had also welcomed Sidhu to join the AAP.
