Tata Steel U.K. Ltd workers and the British union Unite members have voted for a strike against the company. Tata is reportedly abandoning the British Steel Pension Scheme, forcing employees to work five extra years until they are 65-year-old to get their full pensions, or facing a 25% cut in it, despite unions offering it Â£850 million in pension savings.
