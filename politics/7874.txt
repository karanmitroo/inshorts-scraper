BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said that the issue regarding the Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya must not be viewed as a political stunt keeping elections in mind. Inaugurating the seminar on Ram Janmabhoomi Temple at Delhi University, he termed the protesters opposed to the seminar as "intolerant". Student bodies like NSUI, AISA held protests outside the seminar's venue.
