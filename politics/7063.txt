Congress MLA Abdul Sattar on Tuesday demanded that Maharashtra, like Bihar, should have a complete ban on alcohol. He said, "Due to drought, farmers become helpless and consume liquor. They commit suicide after consuming a couple of pegs." Sattar further claimed that the liquor ban in the state's Chandrapur district has succeeded as there have been no farmer suicides there.
