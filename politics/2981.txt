Maulvi Sajid Rashidi, during a debate on a news channel, has allegedly said that BJP leader Shazia Ilmi is not a good Muslim as she celebrates Holi with Hindus. "Why invite regressive Mullahs to shows. Why legitimise their obscurantism? There are enough liberal Muslims who are against Triple Talaq," Shazia tweeted.
