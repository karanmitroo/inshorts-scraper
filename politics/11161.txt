A day after his party's crushing defeat in LS polls, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar resigned on Saturday. Kumar's JDU won just two of Bihar's 40 seats in the polls. His resignation may precipitate snap polls in the state that is due for assembly elections in November next year. Reports suggest he has also recommended the dissolution of the state assembly.
