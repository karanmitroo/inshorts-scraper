BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday called AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi a ‘patriot’, stating "he does defend India when abroad". Swamy, however, tweeted that Owaisi is not a nationalist because he doesn't accept that his ancestors were Hindus. His remarks came after Owaisi asked Swamy to give him in writing that he’s anti-national, which he will keep at his home.
