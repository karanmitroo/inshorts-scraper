In response to Arun Jaitley asking Shiv Sena to indulge in debate and not in vandalism, the party on Thursday said, “Nobody should lecture Maharashtra about tolerance.” It added that Sena is the only party which has "never betrayed people" for the sake of power. Jaitley’s comments had come in the wake of Sena attacking the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai.
