As PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the new BJP headquarters at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg on Sunday, BJP became the first national party to move its office outside Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ). Spread over 2 acres, the office has 70 rooms. Its foundation was laid in August 2016 after a Supreme Court directive that party offices be relocated from the LBZ.
