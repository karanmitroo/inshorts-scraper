A five-member delegation of seers on Friday submitted its report on the alleged Kairana exodus of Hindu families to Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik. The delegation said 160 Muslim families had also left Kairana over a period of 10 years along with Hindus. The report has also indicted BJP MP Hukum Singh, who had earlier highlighted the exodus.
