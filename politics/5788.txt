The BJP on Monday appealed to both the Centre and the Bihar government to join hands to provide relief and rehabilitation to the flood-ridden people of the state. “We do not want any politics in this matter,” party leader Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said. Floods in Bihar have so far claimed 156 lives and affected 12 districts.
