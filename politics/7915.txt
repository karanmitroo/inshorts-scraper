According to reports, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa sacked AIADMK's Deputy Propaganda Secretary Nanjil Sampath for his "insensitive" comments about victims of the Chennai floods. Sampath had responded, “Why should a wedding be cancelled if there is a death at neighbour’s house,” when asked why the December 31 AIADMK General body meeting was extravagant just after floods in the city.
