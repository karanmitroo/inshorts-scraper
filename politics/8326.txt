Led by party President Sonia Gandhi, the Congress on Tuesday staged a protest march to the Rashtrapati Bhavan against "rising intolerance" in the country. “We want the President to make this deaf and mute government understand this issue,” senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid said. The Congress also drew a memorandum on the issue to hand over to President Pranab Mukherjee.
