The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday ordered a probe into the alleged migration of Hindus due to "jihadi elements" from the state's Kairana town. This comes after a BJP MP from Kairana, Hukum Singh, claimed that 346 families had migrated from the Muslim-majority city since 2014 as they were reportedly targeted by the aides of gangster Mukim Kala.
