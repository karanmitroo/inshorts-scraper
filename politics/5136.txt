Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, in his recently released book, 'An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in Indiaâ€™ has said that British ex-Prime Minister David Cameron should apologise to India for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. "You cannot quantify the wrongs done. What is far more important than financial reparation would be an apology," Tharoor said.
