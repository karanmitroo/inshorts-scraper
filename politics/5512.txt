Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi has affirmed that the grand-old party will not forge any alliance for the 2017 UP Assembly election and will stand on its own. We will fight the 2017 polls on the basis of ideology and policies and will not compromise on them, he added. Gandhi is on a ‘Kisan Yatra’ across UP to revive the Congress.
