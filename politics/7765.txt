BSP supremo Mayawati on Thursday attacked PM Narendra Modi for getting emotional in Lucknow over the suicide of Hyderabad Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula and termed his words as a "move driven by politics". Mayawati referred to BJP minister Gen VK Singh's earlier dog remark against Dalits and asked why Centre failed to act against him.
