The newly appointed AIADMK General Secretary Sasikala Natarajan, also known as Chinnamma, was a close aide of late TN CM J Jayalalithaa for around 3 decades. Sasikala, who was born in an agricultural family in 1956, was arrested twice with Jayalalithaa in corruption cases. In 2011, Sasikala was expelled from AIADMK, but within 100 days, she was reinstated by Jayalalithaa.
