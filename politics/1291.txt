The Congress' Punjab unit has released a list of its spokespersons in the state alongside their castes and contact numbers. Of the 24 media panelists listed, 11 are Jat Sikhs, five Hindus, four Scheduled Castes, three Other Backward Castes and one Urban Sikh. The list was reportedly withdrawn later and a new list without the column on castes was released.
