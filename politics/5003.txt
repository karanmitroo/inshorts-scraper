Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal has said that the resignation of Congress MLAs over the Supreme Court's verdict on Sutlej Yamuna link canal is a 'political stunt'. "It's ironical that as polls for Punjab Assembly are due..., all Congress MLAs resigned, but the MPs shied away as they have fairly enough time for their tenure to end," Badal said.
