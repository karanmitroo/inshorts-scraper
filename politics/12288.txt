AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal Saturday met lieutenant governor Najib Jung and asked him for 10-days to take a decision on forming government in Delhi. "Surprised" by the unconditional support offered by Congress and BJP, Kejriwal has written letters to both the party presidents Sonia Gandhi and Rajnath Singh for them to express their stand on AAP manifesto and Lokpal Bill.
