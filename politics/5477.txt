Days after the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) gave an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to leave India immediately, BJP’s UP MLA Sangeet Som has said that Pakistani artistes in India should be ‘beaten up with shoes’. "There are quite a few artistes...earning crores from here, no one cares about them in Pakistan… then they do 'Gaddari' (betrayal) with India,” he added.
