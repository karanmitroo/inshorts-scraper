RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Friday said the RSS wants to write a new Constitution based on the anti-Dalit 'Manusmriti'. He claimed that the RSS has never been able to digest the Indian Constitution which provides reservation to Dalits. He added that RSS chief's statements against reservation were not accidental as he was trained in Manusmriti-based ideology.
