Reacting to the Cobrapost sting operation on the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, BJP has called it ‘an attempt to inject poison in the peaceful and amicable election atmosphere in the country’. The party alleged that the sting was “sponsored”, accusing Congress of using “pawns” to vitiate the atmosphere and urged the Election Commission to issue an order against its broadcast.
