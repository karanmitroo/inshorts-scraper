The BJP has distanced itself from the comments of its MP Sakshi Maharaj that madrasas were teaching terrorism saying this was his "personal view". "Terrorism has no religion and is against peace, humanity and development," said BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma. The Congress also criticised Maharaj's statement saying it did not deserve to be given any importance.
