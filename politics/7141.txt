Maharashtra's Assembly was on Tuesday adjourned twice due to ruckus by the opposition after a BJP MLA alleged that an NCP legislator was seen rubbing his face with the national flag, in a video. After the issue was raised in the Assembly, the opposition shouted slogans and the Speaker adjourned the session for 10 minutes, and later for 30 minutes.
