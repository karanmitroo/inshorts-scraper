BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh's Minister for School Education, Vijay Shah, has urged that Sanskrit should be made the state language and taught in schools from class I onwards. "Sanskrit is our dev-bhasha. It has its own importance in Tamil and Telugu also. Madhya Pradesh does not have its official language apart from Hindi," he added.
