Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit on Sunday said that the Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat talks like a 'sadak ka gunda'. Dikshit added, "While this is expected from Pakistan, who are like the mafia, why does our own chief make such pronouncements?" Slammed for his remarks on social media, Dikshit apologised, while saying, "I genuinely believe what I said was wrong."
