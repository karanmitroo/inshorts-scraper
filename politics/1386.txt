Sidelined AIADMK Deputy General Secretary TTV Dhinakaran has dubbed the merger of two factions of the AIADMK as a betrayal of party General Secretary VK Sasikala. "It is not a merger. It is a commercial agreement reached for self-interest and hunger for positions and to protect posts," he said. "Only god knows how long this (merger) will hold," Dhinakaran added.
