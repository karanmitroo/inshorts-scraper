Reacting to PM Narendra Modi’s view that demonetisation is a cure to a 70-year-old corruption disease, former PM HD Deve Gowda has asked, "Does PM mean the Vajpayee and Shastri governments were corrupt?". “Can he prove one case of corruption in my time?”, he added. He further called the demonetisation policy a hasty decision taken without understanding the implications.
