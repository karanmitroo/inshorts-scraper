Ten legislators of the opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) were suspended on Monday from the Telangana Assembly for the entire budget session for interrupting the proceedings. Speaker S Madhusudana Chary announced the suspension of the MLAs after they refused to tender an apology for protesting during the Governorâ€™s address to the joint session of TS Legislature on March 7.
