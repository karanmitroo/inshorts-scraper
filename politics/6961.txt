Amid the ongoing West Bengal Assembly polls, BJP leader and veteran actor Rupa Ganguly was on Monday caught on camera manhandling a TMC worker outside a polling booth in West Bengal's Howrah district. An FIR was registered against her soon after the video surfaced online. Ganguly has complained of booth jams to the constituency observer.
