Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena has hinted that it would prefer to sit in the Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly than join the Devendra Fadnavis government, sources said. Earlier, Thackeray had demanded that his party be inducted into Fadnavis government before it faces the trust vote on the floor of the Assembly, but BJP did not entertain his demand.
