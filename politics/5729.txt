Sacked AAP Minister Sandeep Kumar surrendered before the Delhi Police on Saturday, hours after a rape case was registered against him. This comes after the woman, who was seen in a sex video with Kumar, filed a complaint alleging that Kumar drugged and sexually exploited her. She claimed that she had gone to the AAP leader for a ration card.
