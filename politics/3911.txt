BSP supremo Mayawati, who turned 61 on Sunday, appealed her party cadre to celebrate her birthday with simplicity and do something for the welfare of the underprivileged. In 2010, when Mayawati was the CM, she faced flak for a cash garland worth â‚¹25 crore given by BSP leaders to her on her birthday. Her birthday is celebrated as 'Jankalyankari Diwas'.
