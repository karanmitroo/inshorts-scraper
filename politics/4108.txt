UP CM Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said one cannot even remove the picture of Mulayam Singh Yadav and him from the free laptops distributed by the SP government. Akhilesh further praised Mulayam saying it was due to him that he could do so much work. This comes amid an ongoing feud in SP between Akhilesh and his father Mulayam.
