Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday that the Congress-led Opposition's boycott of tonight's GST launch event will not stop it. "Karvan toh chalta rahega (Caravan will keep moving). Those who won't take part, would not stop it even if they take part," he said. He added that the Congress' "narrow attitude will not stop the nation".
