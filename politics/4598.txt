Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan has suggested that currency notes of ₹200 denomination should be introduced in the country. He further slammed the Centre for announcing to introduce ₹1,000 notes again in the future and said that there is no need to do so. "We should not encourage foreign-linked payment gateways," he added.
