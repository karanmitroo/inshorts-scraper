Addressing a rally in Assam, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that the state will be run from the RSS headquarters in Nagpur or the PMO if the BJP comes to power. "The truth is wherever BJP goes, it tries to make people fight with each other... in Assam too they are trying to spread violence," Gandhi added.
