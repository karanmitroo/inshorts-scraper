Taking a jibe at PM Narendra Modi, Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani tweeted a video of PM Modi captioned, "Nostradamus predicted that In 21st century world's best actor will be from India. #BhimaKoregaon #NarendraModiLies #FakeDalitPrem". The video shows PM Modi speaking about the rights of Dalits. Meanwhile, an FIR has been filed against Mevani for creating communal disharmony through his speech.
