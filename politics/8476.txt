BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj on Saturday sparked a controversy by saying if the leaders want to avoid get beaten up, they must change their mindset. He was referring to J&K MLA Engineer Rashid, who was assaulted inside the state assembly earlier this month, for organising a beef party. "His action... hurt the masses and he was beaten up", he added.
