AAP leader Somnath Bharti, who has been dropped out of the new Arvind Kejriwal-led cabinet, said Friday that he willingly opted out of taking the responsibility. Bharti, who was part of the previous cabinet, added that he has made the decision in order to focus on building his Malviya Nagar constituency as a model one.
