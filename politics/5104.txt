Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday accused the BJP of stabbing the soldiers in their backs by lying about the implementation of 'One Rank One Pension'. He further said the Centre is on the other hand "roaming around the country and boasting of the army's surgical strikes". "Had the BJP implemented OROP, Ram Kishan wouldn't have committed suicide," he added.
