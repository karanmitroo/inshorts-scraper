MoS for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Monday said that the Congress party's tweet on the Naga accord, which quoted him as saying, "Government of India has not signed it in recent years", was wrong. "The page that they have seen had some old draft, which is not our official version. I have got our official version checked," Rijiju said.
