According to sources, the JDU leadership has asked Jitan Ram Manjhi to step down as Bihar CM, to make way for Nitish Kumar. However, Manjhi has refused to resign, asking the party to sack him instead. Last week, Nitish Kumar had dismissed the news of Manjhi's removal. "There is no substance in media speculation over Manjhi's ouster...", Kumar had said.
