Irked over being held up in traffic by Army Chief's security, Union Minister Jairam Ramesh Wednesday criticised the VIP security system in India. He called the system as "state within a state within a state" where there is no accountability. Ramesh, who never uses a red beacon on his vehicle, said he would write to Defence Minister over the issue.
