Six CPI(M) workers were arrested on Saturday in Kerala's Kannur district over a BJP worker's murder, which had happened earlier this week. The police said the accused hailed from Andaloor, from where the victim also belonged. The incident was said to be in retaliation to an attack by alleged RSS workers on some students from the CPI(M)'s student wing.
