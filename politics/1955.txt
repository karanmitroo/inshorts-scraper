Taking references from Ramayana, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav said, "I will destroy Narendra Modi government's Lanka. He is the king of lies... I'm not afraid of anything." Claiming that no one can uproot him, Lalu added, "I'm standing like Angad (a character from Ramayana), whose foot could not be moved. Will not let the BJP be at peace."
