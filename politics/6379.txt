AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said a pluralisticâ€‹ and diverse country like India cannot have a uniform civil code. Uniform civil code calls for the replacement of personal laws based on religion by a common set of laws. Directive Principles in our Constitution also call for the total prohibition of liquor, why don't we talk about it, Owaisi asked.
