Terming Kiran Bedi's decision to join BJP and contest Delhi assembly polls as "opportunistic", lawyer and AAP leader Prashant Bhushan said on Saturday that Bedi's decision went 'sharply against' her earlier stand against electoral politics. Bhushan further added that BJP's bid to gain power by projecting Bedi as its chief ministerial candidate would fail.
