AAP leader HS Phoolka on Wednesday alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government of trying to save the accused, including Jagdish Tytler, in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. It is evident from the last two years that the government is "deliberately delaying" investigations, he alleged. Phoolka demanded that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal be given the right to open the cases.
