Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has cancelled the appointment of Krishna Saini as the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) Chairman, citing that it was made without his consent and therefore is "illegal". This comes after a Delhi High Court ruling called for a review of all the AAP government's actions made without the consent of the Lieutenant Governor.
