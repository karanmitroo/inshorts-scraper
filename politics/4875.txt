Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday slammed PM Narendra Modi over the demonetisation move and said that the decision would benefit the PM's friends while the poor would suffer. "Wherever I went, I saw that people were highly inconvenienced. They said they are standing in queue while the banks were giving cash to few persons from backdoor," Gandhi added.
