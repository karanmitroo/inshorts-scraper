Reacting to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s remarks urging Hindus to produce more children, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asked the former to produce 10 kids of his own first. Before inciting Hindus, he should himself produce and nurture his kids well, he tweeted. Bhagwat’s remark has drawn flak from other political parties as well.
