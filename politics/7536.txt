The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday dismissed the Railway Budget as a "document of illusion", and criticised the Centre for being "oblivious" to the common man’s needs, while catering to corporate interests. The AAP further attacked the government for setting project deadlines to 2020, beyond its term which ends in 2019. ”The net result is unaccountability," the party added.
