Actor Kamal Haasan, while speaking about the current political situation in Tamil Nadu, said that Sasikala's proximity to late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa does not make her qualified for the CM post. He added, "I don't know the qualifications of Sasikala, neither do the people of Tamil Nadu." Haasan further said that the interim CM O Panneerselvam is competent.
