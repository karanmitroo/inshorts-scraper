Prashant Bhushan's nameplate at this home was smeared with ink by protestors on Monday over his remark on Lord Krishna. Calling Krishna a 'legendary eve teaser', Bhushan had asked UP CM Yogi Adityanath if he had the guts to call his 'anti-Romeo squads' as 'anti-Krishna squads'. Later, a complaint was filed against him by the BJP.
