BJP MLA Ravinder Raina sparked a controversy Tuesday after he took the name of 'Mata Vaishno Devi' while taking oath as a member of the J&K Assembly. When Protem Speaker Mohmmad Shafi asked Raina to take oath in the name of 'God', he tried to convince him saying, "I'm a worshipper of Ma Vaishnodevi and consider her as my God."
