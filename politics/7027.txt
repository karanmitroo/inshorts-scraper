BJP MLA Ravinder Raina on Friday said that the Handwara incident, where clashes started over alleged molestation of a schoolgirl by a jawan, was an attempt by 'Pakistani agents' to defame the Army and J&K government. "The Indian Army has been saving the people of J&K... Even the girl has admitted that no Army man misbehaved with her," Raina added.
