Actor Rajinikanth has said that he doesn't know what's required to succeed in politics, while jokingly adding, "I think, Kamal (Haasan) knows what's required...But then, he won't tell me what that is." Rajinikanth further said that maybe Kamal would have told him this two months ago. He also said just fame and stardom aren't enough to be a successful politician.
