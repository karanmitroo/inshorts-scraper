Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti conducted raids in South Delhi's Khirki extension Wednesday night alleging drug trafficking and prostitution, and is reported to have had a brush with the local police. Bharti, who demanded the police to take action against the offenders, had a hot argument with an assistant commissioner of police, after police allegedly refused to raid the premises.
