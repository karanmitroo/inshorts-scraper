In order to stop the use of money and muscle power by other parties, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will use spy cameras ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls. "Spy cameras will be given to AAP volunteers so that they can video record the illegal means adopted by other political parties to lure voters," AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, Wednesday.
