Actor-politician Chiranjeevi was censured by voters on Wednesday, when he allegedly tried to jump the queue at a polling booth in AP. After reaching the booth, the politician went past a long queue to walk right up to the front. A voter, Raja Kartik, instantly objected, and others supported; finally Chiranjeevi was forced to walk back and stand in queue.
