Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday compared the Congress to death, claiming it is never subjected to criticism. He said, "Death is a blessing… no one criticises death. People say someone died of cancer, he died of old age." He added, "Sometimes I feel Congress is also blessed (like death)… whenever we criticise Congress, media says opposition is under attack".
