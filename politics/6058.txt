Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav on Monday said the UP government will file a review petition against the Supreme Court’s ruling which states that ex-CMs are not entitled to government accommodation. The Apex Court, earlier in the day, ordered six former Chief Ministers of UP, including Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, to vacate government bungalows within two months.
