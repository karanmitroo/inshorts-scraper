Slamming AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi for offering legal help to arrested ISIS suspects, BJP on Sunday accused him of "betraying" India and "standing with the extremists". Owaisi is "helping the ISIS", which recently came up with a video threatening to target India, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. The BJP also demanded that investigating agencies take legal action against Owaisi.
