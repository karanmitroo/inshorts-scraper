Congress leader P Chidambaram, while talking about the Indian economy after demonetisation and GST implementation, said that PM Narendra Modi has now stopped talking about 'acche din' as he knows people will laugh. The PM doesn't talk about it also because he knows those promises cannot be redeemed by his government, Chidambaram added.
