Addressing the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor quoted a “Bangladeshi friend” to remark that “it is safer to be a cow than a Muslim” in India. Attacking the Modi government for "intolerance" in the country, he further said that “you cannot promote ‘Make in India’ abroad while condoning ‘Hate in India’ at home”.
