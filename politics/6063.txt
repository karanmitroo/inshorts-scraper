BJP would get only 60-65 seats out of 182 in Gujarat, if polls are held today, an RSS survey reportedly concluded. The survey was done by ground-level RSS pracharaks after Dalits' agitation in the state. It is also reported that RSS top brass had convinced outgoing CM Anandiben Patel to resign after showing her the survey results.
