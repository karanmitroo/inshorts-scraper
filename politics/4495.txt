Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Thursday claimed for the first time in the history of independent India, a ruling party is not letting the Parliament function. Citing the hardships being faced by farmers post demonetisation, Azad said, "I have given notice so that the debt of the farmers is forgiven. The BJP is not in support of the farmers."
