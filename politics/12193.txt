Even before taking oath of the office, Chief Minister designate Arvind Kejriwal on Friday organised 'mohalla sabhas' in his New Delhi constituency to listen to problems of the common man and assured the people of immediate action. Meanwhile, AAP leader Manish Sisodia visited Mansarovar Park, where the Railways on Thursday brought down 200 jhuggis, and termed the action "inhumane".
