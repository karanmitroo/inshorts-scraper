Congress on Wednesday slammed Modi government's plans to observe the first International Yoga Day on June 21, and called it a "photo op". "The entire tantrum on yoga is just a photo op and event-management exercise by the government," Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said. The spending on Yoga Day alone is equivalent to the Central Plan Outlay spending, he added.
