A video has surfaced on social media in which AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal is seen breaking a 'Tijori' (vault) with PM Narendra Modi's picture on it to provide evidence of the latter's graft. The act was supposedly shot during his Rohtak rally. In the video, several other AAP leaders including Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia are also seen with him.
