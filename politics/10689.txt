BJPâ€™s star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, had to cancel a rally in Lucknow on Wednesday evening, after the state government refused him permission. Officials say they were worried about a clash between workers from the BJP and the ruling Samajwadi Party, which was scheduled to hold its own rally nearby at the same time.
