A person named Rakesh Singh has filed an FIR against AAP leader Alka Lamba for posting a picture of the Lucknow gang-rape-victim. "I hope the police arrests Lamba as soon as possible. Alka has committed a major blunder, even bigger that what the rapists did, by sharing this objectionable photo. This should be investigated as a cyber crime...", said Singh.
