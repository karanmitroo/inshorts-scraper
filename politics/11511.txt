As Mizoram voted Friday, a polygamist and sect leader Zionnghaka Chana, has become the voter every local politician wants to know. With 39 wives and 127 children and grandchildren, Chana can deliver a sizeable bloc of support. Since the winning margins of politicians in Mizoram are slim, so even 100-odd votes matter. The entire family votes for the same candidate.
