All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi has alleged that the BJP-Shiv Sena government in Maharashtra has ignored the woes of Muslims and the Dalit community. Owaisi alleged that BJP wanted to dilute the Constitutional framework and run the country on the principles of Manu (an ancient Hindu legal code) by scrapping the Atrocities Act, which protects the Dalits.
