AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday questioned if there was a communal angle in the "quick" trial of 2013 Dilsukhnagar blasts case, in which a Hyderabad court sentenced all five convicts to death. Adding that "terrorists should be punished", Owaisi questioned, "Why can't investigation agencies show the same urgency and convict alleged terrorists in cases like the Babri Masjid demolition."
