Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) ousted MLA Kapil Mishra has released a parody of Mumbai's RJ Malishka's viral 'Sonu' song, in a bid to troll Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. It starts with a chorus calling him a thief, with the lyrics which go "AK Tujhe Khudpe Bharosa Nai Kya?" Mishra termed it as a "birthday gift" for Kejriwal.
