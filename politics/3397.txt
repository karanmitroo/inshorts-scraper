Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked the Congress leader to "mind their language" as he had "a dossier on each one of them". He also termed Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat's government as the most corrupt. "His...regime has so badly sullied the name of the land of gods (Uttarakhand) that its sanctity needs to be restored," PM Modi asserted.
