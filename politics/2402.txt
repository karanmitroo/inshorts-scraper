Activist Anna Hazare has urged PM Narendra Modi not to amend the RTI Act, threatening to launch a public protest if it is amended. "Bringing changes in the RTI Act, which people have got after years of agitations, is like damaging their fundamental right," he said. Hazare also opposed the proposed limit of 500 words for an RTI application.
