AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, who reached Varanasi on Tuesday, received a hostile reception from apparent supporters of BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi. Eggs were thrown at Kejriwal's car outside the Kashi Vishwanath temple, with the protesters steadily raising anti-Kejriwal slogans. The supporters also threw black ink at the AAP chief during his roadshow in Varanasi.
