Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the Congress-led Himachal Pradesh government has turned the "dev bhoomi" (land of gods) into "apraadh bhoomi" (land of crime). Claiming that only crime and corruption have increased under Congress rule in the state, Adityanath urged the people of Himachal Pradesh to vote for the BJP.
