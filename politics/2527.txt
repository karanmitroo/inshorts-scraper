Asserting that Romeo loved just one lady, advocate Prashant Bhushan on Sunday called Lord Krishna a 'legendary eve teaser'. He asked Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath if he had the guts to call his 'anti-Romeo squads' as 'anti-Krishna squads'. "We have grown up with legends of young Krishna teasing Gopis. The logic of Romeo squad would criminalise this," he added.
