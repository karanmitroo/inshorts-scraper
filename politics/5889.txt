West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday accused the Modi government of ‘bulldozing’ the federal structure of the country, describing it as ‘most arrogant’ government. “I expect other states to hold similar protests against such authoritarian behaviour…this is against the Constitution,” she said. She also attacked the Centre over its Pakistan policy and cow vigilantism.
