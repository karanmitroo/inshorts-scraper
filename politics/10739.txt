Claiming that UP was not getting its allotted power quota, CM Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday blamed the Centre for the ongoing power crisis in the state. He appealed the BJP leaders to increase the power quota of the state. “The state was working with its own resources and power supply will increase in the next two-three days,” Akhilesh said.
