BJP leader and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala's remark terming Nirav Modi, accused in the $1.77 billion PNB scam, as "Chhota Modi" was "derogatory, scandalous and demeaning". Dismissing the Congress' allegations on PM Narendra Modi meeting Nirav in Davos, he said the BJP had pictures of Congress leaders with Nirav's business partner Mehul Choksi.
