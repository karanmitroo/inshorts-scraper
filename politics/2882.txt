Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday submitted his resignation to Governor Ram Naik following his party's loss in the state Assembly elections. The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies led in as many as 324 constituencies in the 403-member house while the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance was relegated to a distant second with lead in only 55 seats.
