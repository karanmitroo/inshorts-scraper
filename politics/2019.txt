BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi on Wednesday said that CM Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government reminds her of 'andher nagri, chaupat raja' (chaotic state, confused ruler). Further reacting to Shahi Imam of Kolkata Masjid flaunting red-beacon on car saying Banerjee has allowed it, Lekhi said, "If Mamata cannot use the red beacon, how can she let Imam Barkati use the same."
