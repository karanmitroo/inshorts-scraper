In an unprecedented mandate, Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Tuesday won the Delhi assembly elections with a majority of 67 seats. On the other hand, the BJP could manage just 3 seats, leaving Congress with zero seats in the 70-member House. With this mandate, AAP became first party in 16 years to breach 50-seat mark in Delhi.
