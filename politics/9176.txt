To escape registration woes at the Election Commission, former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha has added the suffix ‘Secular’ to its name. The party will now be known as Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) or HAM(S). The move came after the Election commission discovered that a political organisation had already been registered in the same name.
