Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Friday expelled Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and son Akhilesh Yadav from the party for 6 years. He also suspended Akhilesh's loyalist Ram Gopal Yadav from the party for the same duration. This comes after Akhilesh released a separate list of SP candidates for the upcoming state elections after Mulayam had released his list.
