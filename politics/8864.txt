Parliamentary affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday dismissed Congress' demand for resignation of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and said that Swaraj was "a great asset to the nation". Naidu further alleged that the Congress had blocked proceedings in Parliament as it was "really rattled" by the success of the Modi government and wanted to stop the nation's progress.
