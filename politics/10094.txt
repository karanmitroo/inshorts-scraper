The VHP had planned a 'ghar wapsi' event for re-converting 200 Christians to Hinduism in Bhatinda on Jan 1. After failing on Jan 1, the VHP suspended its programme for a day but even after a change of venue, the campaign flopped. â€œThe administration and the police threatened the Christian families...and pressurised them into skipping the function", the VHP said.
