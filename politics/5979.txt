Congress-led Opposition in the Rajya Sabha on Monday demanded an initiation of a political process to break the continuous curfew in Kashmir. Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the 30-day curfew has paralysed the administration, shut down educational institutions, and led to near-zero attendance in government offices. He also demanded stopping the use of pellet guns on protesters.
