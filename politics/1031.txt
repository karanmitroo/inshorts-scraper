A Gujarat court on Wednesday issued a non-bailable warrant for Patidar leader Hardik Patel after he did not appear in hearings for a case of ransacking a BJP MLA's office during the 2015 Patidar agitation. This comes hours after the Election Commission announced that the state Assembly elections will be conducted on December 9 and 14.
