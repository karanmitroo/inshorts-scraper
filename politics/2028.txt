Expelled BSP leader Naseemudin Siddiqui on Wednesday said that he did not visit his ailing daughter who died due to lack of treatment as BSP chief Mayawati wanted his services during elections. Moreover, Siddiqui said that Mayawati did not permit him to leave for her self-interest. Siddiqui and his son were removed on Wednesday from the BSP over “anti-party” activities.
