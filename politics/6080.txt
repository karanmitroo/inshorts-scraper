Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday backed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s remark allegedly made in reference to actor Aamir Khan. “Why so much hu ha about Parrikar's statement on Amir? If Amir is ignorant that to love janma bhoomi is unconditional then he needs a teacher,” Swamy tweeted. His tweet came after opposition parties criticised Parrikar for his comments.
