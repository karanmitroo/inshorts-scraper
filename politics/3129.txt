A day after a fractured verdict in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls, BJP leader Nitin Gadkari on Friday said there is no option for the BJP and Shiv Sena than coming together. "The final decision has to be taken by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray. I'm sure they will take the right decision," Gadkari added.
