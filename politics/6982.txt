Trinamool Congress leader Abdur Razzak Molla, who made derogatory statements against actor-politician Roopa Ganguly on Wednesday, has apologised for his remarks. A show-cause notice has already been issued against him. Molla had remarked he "knew the length of the cigarettes she smokes" and that "she really is Draupadi". Ganguly had played the role of Draupadi in BR Chopra's Mahabharat.
