Posters put up by Gorakhpur Congress committee in UP have projected the party’s chief ministerial candidate, Sheila Dikshit, as the 'Goddess of Development’. The posters also carry caricatures of leaders of other parties with a caption ‘save us from Congress’ tsunami’. Meanwhile, UP Congress on Sunday organised training camp for state Sewadal workers where Dikshit was also present.
