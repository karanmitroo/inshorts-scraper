PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said that it is unfortunate that some people are calling the demonetisation drive as "anti-people". They are "rajnaitik poojaris" (political worshippers) of black money and they adversely affect the economy, polity and society, PM Modi added. Addressing the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Bengaluru, PM Modi said the 21st century belongs to India.
