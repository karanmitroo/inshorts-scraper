Shiv Sena came out in support of Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad over his remark in which he drew a comparison between the Uri terror attack casualties and the deaths after demonetisation. “The difference is in the attackers. Pakistan attacked us in Uri, where in the case of demonetisation (deaths) it was our own rulers,” Sena stated.
