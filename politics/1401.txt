Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's close aide Ashish Kulkarni, who is also a member of Congress coordination centre, said, "Congress remains to be nepotistic and a feudal party, which is a tragedy for Congress." "Only the privileged or those with money power are getting preferences... party has moved towards left, sympathizing with ultra left, Kashmiri separatists," Kulkarni added.
