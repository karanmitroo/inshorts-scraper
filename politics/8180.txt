All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday termed actor Aamir Khan's statement of considering to leave India because of intolerance as 'nonsense'. "I would've never said what Aamir said. We've seen numerous riots but still we continue to live here as it's our country... We'll struggle and strive to live here to improve the country", Owaisi added.
