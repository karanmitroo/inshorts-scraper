The Aam Aadmi Party recently dropped five candidates after negative internal reports. They are, candidates for Robertsganj, Fatehpur Sikri and Ambedkar Nagar in UP, a candidate from Karakat (Bihar) and one from Kandamal (Odisha). While the UP candidates will be replaced, the constituencies of Bihar and Odisha will remain vacant as the last date of nomination has passed.
