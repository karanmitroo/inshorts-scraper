Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday spoke to PM Manmohan Singh on the long-pending demand of Jain community to get minority status at the national level. If the demand is met then Jains, who currently enjoy minority status in 14 states, would join the league of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis - who are recognized as national minorities.
