The police on Tuesday recovered two swords, four iron rods, and one knife from a public spot next to the BJP's district office in Kerala's Kannur. The police received information regarding the weapons from municipal corporation staff who were cleaning the area. The BJP alleged that the weapons had been planted by the CPI(M) to malign the party's image.
