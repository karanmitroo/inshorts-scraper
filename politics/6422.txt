In its probe report on the exodus of Hindu families from Uttar Pradesh's Kairana, the district administration has said three families of the claimed 346 migrated over "extortion-related incidents". The report added that other families left for reasons like 'business, health, and educational'. Earlier, BJP MP Hukum Singh had highlighted the exodus of 346 families from the Muslim-majority city.
