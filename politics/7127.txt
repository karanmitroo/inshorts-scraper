Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday remarked that Congress President Rahul Gandhi's "speech writers are weak in selecting appropriate words". He further said Gandhi "goes anywhere he is invited". Prasad was referring to Gandhi's speech earlier in the day calling the 1% excise duty on non-silver jewellery items an "assassination attempt" on the traders.
