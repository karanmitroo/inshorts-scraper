Threatening to resign, Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh has reportedly said those close to Mulayam Singh Yadav are being “insulted” in the party. I never called myself a Samajwadi as I am a Mulayamwadi, but it has become some kind of a crime to be a Mulayamwadi, he added. Singh had earlier quit the party but later rejoined it.
