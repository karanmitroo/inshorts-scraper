Reacting to BJP's comments on his appointment, ex-Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's successor, Jitan Ram Manjhi, Tuesday insisted that he was "not a rubber stamp." "By saying I will be a rubber stamp the BJP has only highlighted their anti-Dalit mindset," Manjhi added. Earlier, BJP's Sushil Modi had said "Nitish has foisted a dummy CM and picked a good escape route."
