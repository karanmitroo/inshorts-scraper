BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday announced that the party will build 'Ram Mandir' by constitutional norms if elected in Uttar Pradesh while releasing the manifesto for the upcoming Assembly elections. BJP will win with a two-thirds majority in UP, Shah claimed. Notably, the Supreme Court had ruled recently that political parties cannot use religion and caste to seek votes.
