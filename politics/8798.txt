Senior Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and former Union minister, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, said on Sunday that the seat-sharing deal among the alliance partners (JDU, RJD, and Congress) was made in hurry. "The leaders of the alliance decided the seat sharing but the party workers and supporters are disappointed with the equal sharing,” he added.
