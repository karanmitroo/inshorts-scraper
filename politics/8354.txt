Kerala CM Oommen Chandy on Wednesday said legal action will be taken regarding the raid at the Kerala House, if the Centre does not admit its "mistake". Chandy said, â€œThe raid... crossed all limits of propriety... and also affected the Centre-State relations." Legal action would be taken if the Centre collaborated "with the stand taken by Delhi police", he added.
