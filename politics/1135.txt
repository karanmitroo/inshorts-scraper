During a two-day visit to poll-bound Gujarat, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday said, "Diwali has come early for our citizens due to the decisions taken in the GST Council." "We had said we will study all aspects relating to GST for three months, including the shortcomings. And thus, the decisions were taken with consensus at the GST council," Modi added.
