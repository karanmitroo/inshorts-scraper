Criticising West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for opposing demonetisation, BJP on Wednesday alleged that she has become a champion for the corrupt. "People voted for her so that she can make the state free of black money holders, but now she herself is advocating for them," BJP's Shrikant Sharma said. Banerjee had recently accused the government of playing vendetta politics.
