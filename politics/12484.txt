RJD chief Lalu Prasad and JD(U)'s Jagdish Sharma  were on Monday evening disqualified from Lok Sabha, following their conviction in the 17-year-old Bihar fodder scam case by a Ranchi court. Earlier in the day, Congress's Rajya Sabha MP Rasheed Masood became the first MP to be disqualified after the Supreme Court ruled for immediate disqualification of convicted legislators.
