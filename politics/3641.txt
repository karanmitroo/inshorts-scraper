Union Minister Kalraj Mishra on Sunday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's praise for BSP supremo Mayawati shows that BSP is a hidden partner in the Congress-SP alliance for the UP polls. Earlier, during a joint press conference with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi said he personally respects Mayawati. Mayawati's ideology is not harmful to the country, Rahul added.
