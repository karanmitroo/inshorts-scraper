Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan, who launched his political party Makkal Needhi Maiam on Wednesday, said that the saffron colour should not spread to the entire Indian flag. In his column in a Tamil weekly, Haasan said he will be "the servant who does what's required for the people". Haasan has embarked on a political tour across Tamil Nadu.
