Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was detained at New Delhi's Mandir Marg on Wednesday for 'disruption of duty', police said. This comes after Gandhi went to RML Hospital to meet the family of an ex-serviceman, who committed suicide over One Rank One Pension scheme. "What new India is this?", Gandhi asked after he was barred from meeting the family members.
