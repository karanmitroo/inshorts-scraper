Criticising Gujarat's BJP government, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said BJP claims to be a party of Hindus, yet it used force against the Patel community. He was referring to the 2015 incident where at least 12 people were killed during the agitation. Referring to the Una incident, Kejriwal said that Dalits too were being targeted by the government.
