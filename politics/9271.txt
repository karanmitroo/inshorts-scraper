The Congress on Wednesday lashed out at PM Narendra Modi for "defaming" the country abroad by raising domestic issues. "In a democratic set up, there are differences but no PM has derided the country abroad," AICC general secretary Shakeel Ahmad said. Further, he added, "The PM after misleading people within the country, has now started misleading Indians living abroad."
