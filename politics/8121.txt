At a debate on 'intolerance' in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said "some amount of intolerance" exists in society but it cannot be generalised. Stressing that incidents like the Dadri lynching and rationalists being murdered have not happened overnight after PM Narendra Modi took over, Naidu said people indulging in such acts should be condemned.
