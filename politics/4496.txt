Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday said the Congress should understand that it is writing the last chapter of a Congress-free India with an expired script. Reacting to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's claims of having proof of corruption against the PM, Naqvi added, "If they come out in public domain, they'll expose the DNA of their grand old party."
