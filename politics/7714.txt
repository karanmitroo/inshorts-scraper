Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi on Saturday attacked CM Nitish Kumar for extending an invite to RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav at a government function related to bridge construction over the Ganga river. Modi added that Lalu is neither an MP nor a minister and if Nitish is under pressure, then he should accord the "Super CM" status to Lalu.
