Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday accused PM Narendra Modi of "stopping" all developmental schemes launched by the Congress in Assam, affecting its growth. The Congress introduced special schemes to incentivise investments in the region as it is a geographically difficult location, he said. Azad accused the Centre of adopting "anti-Assam, anti-people and anti-Northeast policies".
