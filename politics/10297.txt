Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi Thursday said he does not agree with US President Barack Obama's views that PM Narendra Modi was the 'man of action' and that he was 'shaking up India's bureaucratic inertia'. Gandhi said, "Praises are a different thing... People should know the truth." He also criticised Modi's way of functioning.
