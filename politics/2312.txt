The Supreme Court, while restoring conspiracy charges against BJP leaders LK Advani, Uma Bharti and others, excluded party leader Kalyan Singh from the trial. "Since Kalyan Singh enjoys Constitutional immunity as Rajasthan Governor, he can be tried only after he ceases to hold office," the apex court stated. Meanwhile, Congress has demanded Kalyan Singh's resignation.
