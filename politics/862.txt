Congress on Sunday retracted the first list of its candidates for the Gujarat Assembly elections after it was shared online. Calling it a 'fake list', Gujarat Congress alleged the BJP had misused Congress President's signature and letterhead. "Upon investigation by our IT cell, it was found the phone used for BJP's website was used to circulate the list," Congress said.
