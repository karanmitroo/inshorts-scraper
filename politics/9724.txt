Expressing his unhappiness over the hoardings put up across the city congratulating AAP for its landslide victory, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Monday said his party is against this kind of politics. Kejriwal added, "If volunteers want to celebrate the victory, they should serve the people." He also asked people to report to authorities if they came across any such hoarding.
