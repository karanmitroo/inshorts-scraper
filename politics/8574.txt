Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah has said, “Arrogant and over-ambitious Nitish Kumar, who harboured a dream to become PM, does not have any right to reject the special package of ₹1.25 lakh crore announced for the people of the state." Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called the Bihar Chief Minister “arrogant” for the same reason.
