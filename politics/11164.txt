The dismal performance of the UPA is best reflected in the performance of the outgoing Union cabinet. Of the 16 cabinet ministers who contested, only three could manage to win. The remaining 12 cabinet ministers are either Rajya Sabha members or chose not to contest the elections. The notable losers include, Salman Khurshid, Ajit Singh and Kapil Sibal.
