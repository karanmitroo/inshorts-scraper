Continuing to slam Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the demonetisation move, BSP chief Mayawati on Wednesday said that the decision would backfire on the BJP in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Claiming that "there is tremendous anger in rural UP because of the hardships caused by demonetisation", Mayawati alleged that the BJP may try to postpone the Assembly elections.
