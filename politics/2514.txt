Congress on Tuesday criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for his bid to have his legal bills paid by the government's exchequer. "Mr Kejriwal has made some objectionable statements about Mr Arun Jaitley and the latter filed a defamation case...How Delhi taxpayers' money comes into this?" it questioned. Kejriwal doesn't see any difference between public and private funds, Congress added.
