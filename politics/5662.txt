Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today visited Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, becoming the first member of the Nehru-Gandhi family to visit the area since Babri Mosque demolition in 1992. Gandhi also visited Ayodhya's Hanuman Garhi Temple, nearly 1 km away from the disputed Ramjanmbhoomi-Babri Masjid site. Notably, Congress President Sonia Gandhi was the last from the family to visit Ayodhya.
