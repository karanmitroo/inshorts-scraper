BJP's Shatrughan Sinha has said no one has the right to brand any citizen as anti-national. "If someone is not satisfied with our views, we must allow them to do so till the time they are moving on the path of development," Sinha added. This comes after Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said anyone attempting to "break" the country was anti-national.
