BJP leader Ram Madhav on Saturday said there exists documental evidence of separatist leaders in the Kashmir Valley getting funds from Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI. "They are taking money from Pakistan to create unrest in Valley and make innocent ordinary people of Kashmir scapegoats in their anti-national designs," the party's national general secretary added.
