Slamming President Pranab Mukherjee's address to the joint session of Parliament, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said on Monday that many MPs were having a nap during the President's speech. "The government writes it. It was very disappointing, many people were sleeping," Pawar said. In his speech, Mukherjee had said that inclusive growth was a top priority for the government.
