Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Monday asked party workers not to raise 'Murdabad' (death to) slogans against PM Modi. "Using the word 'Murdabad' is not our culture. You can hear such words from hardliners like the RSS," Gandhi said. "Such slogans should not be used in Congress meetings as Modi is our PM. We will defeat him politically," he added.
