Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who had gone to take the stock of the situation in flood-affected areas on Sunday, was lifted and carried by his security personnel to wade through ankle-deep water. At another place, Chouhan was caught on camera while walking barefoot through mud and his aide was seen carrying his white sneakers.
