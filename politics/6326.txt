Rajya Sabha MP Navjot Singh Sidhu has been inducted into the core committee of the Punjab unit of the BJP. Earlier, the three-time MP was a part of the group before he refused to contest the 2014 elections after the Amristar party ticket was given to Arun Jaitley. Further, Punjab Local Bodies Minister Anil Joshi was dropped from the committee.
