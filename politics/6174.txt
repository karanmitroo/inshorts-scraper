The Supreme Court on Tuesday told Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, "You can't make wholesale denunciation of an organisation," after he had blamed RSS for Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. "If you [don't] apologise, you will have to face trial," the court added. The SC ruled this while hearing a 2015 defamation suit against Gandhi, asking him to respond by July 27.
