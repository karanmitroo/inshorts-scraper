Separatist Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik was on Friday taken into preventive custody along with 10 of his supporters for starting the 'jail bharo agitation' against "lack of political space" in J&K. "The government is not giving us any space (for political activities). But we will not sit silent and will fight against the curbs," Malik said.
