Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that the quality of primary public education is deteriorating and added that people are forgetting that scientists, entrepreneurs, and politicians today have all attended local schools. "100% Right To Education is a must. One major fallacy of the RTE was that whoever entered the school just wanted to 'finish' it," he added.
