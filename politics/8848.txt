Home Minister Rajnath Singh, while attending a conference on cow conservation on Saturday, said that even the Mughals, who ruled India between the 16th and 18th centuries, did not openly support cow slaughter. "Even Babur, in his will, has written, we can't do two things at one time. Either rule the hearts of people or eat cow's meat", Rajnath said.
