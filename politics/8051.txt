Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi said on Friday that "Not a single rupee can be taken out" of the National Herald, which is a "not for profit" company. He alleged the case was being driven by the Prime Minister's Office, and would be dealt with legally. Gandhi had earlier alleged a "political vendetta" by the government in the National Herald case.
