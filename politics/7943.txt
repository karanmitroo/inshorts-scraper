Phone recordings obtained by the Indian Express suggest that BJP leaders bribed Congress leader Manturam Pawar to withdraw from the 2014 Chhattisgarh bypolls at the last minute. Congress leaders Ajit and Amit Jogi, and Chhattisgarh's CM Raman Singh, recorded in the tapes, denied any involvement. Pawar had joined the BJP after being expelled shortly after his withdrawal from the bypolls.
