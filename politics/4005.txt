AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has said that if Supreme Court can identify Hindutva as a way of life, then Islam and Christianity are also a way of life for many.  "Largely Hindus are secular but they got carried away by a man who speaks very well. And, this is because Congress couldn't stop BJP from coming to power," he added.
