In a blow to Bengal's ruling TMC, party minister Manjul Krishna Thakur joined BJP on Thursday. Thakur, who was TMC minister of state for refugee relief, said, "I failed to work for the refugees though I was the minister, but Trinamool didn't allow me to work." TMC is already under pressure as its transport minister Madan Mitra is in jail.
