Ahead of the first phase of polling in UP to be held on February 11, Jama Masjid Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari has urged the Muslim community to support Mayawati-led BSP. "I met Mulayam several times on the issue of reservation to Muslims and Netaji brought the same to the notice of Akhilesh Yadav but he did nothing," he said.
