Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday expanded his cabinet by adding five ministers, marking the seventh such reshuffle since his government was formed in 2012. The newly inducted ministers include Balram Yadav, who was sacked days earlier from the cabinet for his role in the merger of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari-led Quami Ekta Dal and the Samajwadi Party.
