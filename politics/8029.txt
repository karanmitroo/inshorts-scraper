BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Thursday was allotted a government bungalow by the Cabinet Committee on Accommodation for five years as he "faces a security threat". Under the new allotment norms, 'private persons' already covered under Special Protection Group are entitled to the accommodation. In 2014, Swamy's security cover was upgraded to Z-category considering his "political activities".
