AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee President Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday engaged in a war of words on Twitter. Kejriwal had asked Amarinder why the Badal government has closed corruption cases against him before polls. In reply, Singh tweeted, “You and your shoot and scoot politics…country is increasingly sick of your theatrics just to grab headlines.”
