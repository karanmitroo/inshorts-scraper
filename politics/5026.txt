Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday alleged that BJP and its "friends" were informed about the invalidation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes "a week before" it was announced, especially keeping the upcoming UP polls in mind. Questioning the introduction of ₹2,000 notes, Kejriwal said it would increase corruption and boost the black money economy instead of containing it.
