Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said media should avoid sensationalism to maintain credibility. "Information with confirmation is more than ammunition. Any content that offends the sensibilities of the people is a matter of concern and self-regulation is the best way to address such a problem," he stated. Naidu added what wouldn't have been considered important in past is becoming "Breaking News".
