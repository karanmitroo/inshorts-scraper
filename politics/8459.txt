BJP ally Shiv Sena on Wednesday sparked a controversy after it displayed a huge poster showing PM Narendra Modi bowing before former Sena chief late Bal Thackeray. After the BJP alleged that the poster was mocking the PM, Sena removed it saying, "We only put up posters to remember our old days, it's not to disrespect any political leader."
