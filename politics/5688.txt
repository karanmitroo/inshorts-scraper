Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who is leading an all-party delegation in Kashmir, on Monday said that there is no doubt about the fact that Kashmir was, is and will remain an integral part of India. He further criticised the separatists, stating if they don’t hold talks on peace process, then they don’t believe in Kashmiriyat, Insaniyat (humanity) and Jamhuriat (democracy).
