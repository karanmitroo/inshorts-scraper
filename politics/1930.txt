BJP National President Amit Shah on Friday said, "It is impossible to provide employment through jobs in a country with 125 crore people." However, debunking reports about increasing unemployment, Shah claimed that the NDA government tried to give a new outlook to employment. "We have tried to create self- employment opportunities for about 8 crore people," he added.
