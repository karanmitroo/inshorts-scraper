The Delhi Congress on Wednesday released a 'chargesheet' against the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on completion of its three years in the national capital on Wednesday. Created in the form of a booklet, the chargesheet includes an evaluation of different departments of Delhi. It also carries a comparison of AAP's performance with the previous Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government.
