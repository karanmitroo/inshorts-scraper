The Congress party has submitted a memorandum to Punjab Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki saying there is an "atmosphere of fear and insecurity" in the state. "The Director General of Police himself admitted that there are 57 organised criminal gangs in the state," said a party leader. The police are not doing anything due to "political interference and pressure", he added.
