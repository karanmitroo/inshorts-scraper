Welcoming the Supreme Court's proposal to mediate on the Ram Janmabhumi-Babri Masjid issue, BJP's Vinay Katiyar alleged that the construction of a mosque at the site was a matter of ego for Muslims. "The Muslims are not going to agree. They are not concerned about the construction of masjid as there are a number of masjids in Ayodhya," he added.
