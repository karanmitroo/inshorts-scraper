All political parties - BJP, Congress and AAP â€“ sought fresh polls in Delhi and refused to form a govt during their meeting with lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung on Monday. Jung will now send a report on Delhi govt formation to President Pranab Mukherjee. "LG has conveyed to us that all political parties want fresh elections," AAP leader Manish Sisodia said.
