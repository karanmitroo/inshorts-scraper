The Delhi University on Friday suspended five officials for allegedly leaking documents related to the educational qualifications of HRD minister Smriti Irani. The university took the action after a newspaper published the leaked documents. The daily had written that Irani had taken admission in DU's School of Open Learning last year, but had not appeared for her examination.
