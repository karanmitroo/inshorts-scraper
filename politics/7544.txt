Leaders of Swaraj Abhiyan and expelled AAP leaders, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant  Bhushan, on Saturday said that the group plans to "reignite" the anti-corruption campaign and hopes to get activist Anna Hazare's support. Alleging that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal betrayed the anti-corruption movement with a 'weak' Jan Lokayukta Bill, the duo also accused PM Modi of weakening anti-corruption laws.
