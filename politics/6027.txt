RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Sunday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had understood that "cows give milk, not votes". “And why shouldn’t he understand. Instead of helping make a government, cow is shaking their existing governments," he added. This follows Modi's statement against cow vigilantes that they were goons, who set up shops in the name of cow protection.
