Reacting to Pakistan's assertion that the bilateral peace process with India stands "suspended", Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said it was a "slap on India's face, thanks to our PM". BJP President Amit Shah had "lauded" Pakistan's efforts and gave it a "clean chit" just a few days back, Kejriwal said, adding that "every Indian is feeling anguished today".
