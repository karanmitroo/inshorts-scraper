The NOTA or 'None of the Above' option will now have a logo, characterised by a black cross displayed across a ballot paper. Created by Ahmedabadâ€™s National Institute of Design, the logo will be introduced at the Bihar elections. NOTA was introduced in 2013 to enable voters to practise their right to reject candidates.
