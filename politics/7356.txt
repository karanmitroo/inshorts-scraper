Uttarakhand BJP MLA Ganesh Joshi, who allegedly attacked a police horse and broke its leg, on Wednesday said, "Chop off my leg if am proven guilty." "If you closely watch the CCTV footage, you will see that it wasn't me who attacked the horse," Ganesh said. "The entire incident is a political conspiracy against me," he added.
