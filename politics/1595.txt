Gujarat Assembly speaker Ramanlal Vohra on Sunday slammed Congress legislators who have been staying at a Bengaluru resort amid the ongoing Gujarat floods. "I don't know what MLAs are doing there in Karnataka. In such situations we should pay more attention to improve situation and not to play politics," he said. Over 120 people have been killed in Gujarat floods.
