The Kolkata police has filed a chargesheet against Union Minister Babul Supriyo at a city court on the basis of a complaint filed by TMC MLA Mahua Moitra. The MLA had on January 4 lodged a complaint against Supriyo alleging that the BJP lawmaker had used words intended to "insult her modesty" during a live show on a TV channel.
