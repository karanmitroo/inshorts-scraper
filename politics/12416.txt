Hitting out at the Congress, Narendra Modi said on Sunday that the Congress was responsible for the partition of the country. He also blamed PM Manmohan Singh for losing land to China and changing India's "geography". Also, Modi reminded the Congress that it had never given much importance to India's first Home Minister Sardar Patel, who had united the country.
