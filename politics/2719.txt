Samajwadi Party leader and former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Ram Gopal Yadav has asked the people to give at least six months to newly-elected CM Yogi Adityanath to prove himself. "There is no need to start attacking him from the first day," he said. "There's nothing objectionable in Yogi Adityanath holding a puja at CM's residence," he added.
