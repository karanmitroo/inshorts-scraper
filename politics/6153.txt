AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that results of Gujarat election, slated to be held in 2017, can surprise everyone. Alleging that Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel is framing Dalits and Patidars in false cases, the Delhi CM said the state is annoyed with both Anandiben and the BJP. He, further, criticised PM Modi over his silence on Dalit attacks.
