BJP’s West Bengal Chief Dilip Ghosh has said that madrasas operating along the India-Bangladesh border are "breeding ground(s)" of terrorism and anti-national activities. The madrasas are funded by other countries and are "making the Indo-Bangla border vulnerable to anti-national activities, illegal cattle trade, and smuggling," he added. He also demanded that the border be sealed immediately.​
