BJP MP Subramanian Swamy commented on the AIADMK merger talks saying O Pannerselvam "just wants to get into the government". He added that it won't be a merger as Panneerselvam "is just a man. He can't even produce 5 MLAs". According to reports, the AIADMK is in talks to join the ruling NDA after their merger.
