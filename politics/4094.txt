The Madras High Court on Friday rejected a petition seeking Bharat Ratna for late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, saying that it cannot give such directions to the Central government. Tamil Nadu cabinet in December had recommended late AIADMK Chief Jayalalithaa for the Bharat Ratna and had also suggested the Centre to install her life-size bronze statue in the Parliament Complex.
