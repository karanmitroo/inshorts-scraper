The Maharashtra government has decided to allow alcohol shops to remain open from late night till the early hours on Eid-e-Milad which falls on the same day as Christmas eve. The Congress and AIMIM alleged that the move disrespected the sentiments of Muslims as legislators of the community had earlier met CM Devendra Fadnavis demanding liquor ban on that day.
