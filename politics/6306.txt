Calling the Uttar Pradesh government a party of “goons”, BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday blamed it of not allowing the benefits of the central government's welfare schemes to reach the common people. Referring to the alleged migration of Hindus from Kairana, Shah also blamed the Samajwadi Party-led government for not being able to maintain law and order in the state.
