BJP MP Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that Ram temple "will definitely come up soon" at Ayodhya as it is a "heartfelt desire" of the society. Adityanath said “sages” have been fighting for the temple's construction for long and “there is nothing wrong in it". Further, he added, “Hindutva is neither aggressive nor soft, it is [a] part of...life.”
