Reacting to the recent Ramjas episode, Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi has said expression of views must be done only in national interest and should be restricted if it goes against the national interest. "It not about expressing one's views, it must be viewed on various aspects. It's not about freedom of speech, it's about going against the nation," Dwivedi added.
