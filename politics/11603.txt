Video showing Jammu and Kashmir social welfare minister Sakina Itoo, the only woman minister in Omar Abdullah government, forcing an old man to swear in the name of Allah to vote for her has gone viral. The man, seemingly disgruntled with the minister in the video, was later garlanded by party workers.
