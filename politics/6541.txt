The BJP will have "no pre-poll, no post-poll alliance of any sort" in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, party leader and Union Minister Mahesh Sharma said on Sunday. Asserting that the BJP would not make Ram Temple a political issue, Sharma said the party's focus during the campaign will be on development, good governance, and rooting out corruption.
