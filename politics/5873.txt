Senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma has said that Jan Sangh and RSS were “collaborators” of the British during the freedom struggle. The remark comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that the BJP had faced more adversities in independent India as compared to what Congress did during the British rule. Sharma also demanded an apology from Modi for saying so.
