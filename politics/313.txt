Asking Trinamool Congress leaders to stop "throwing mud" at his office, West Bengal Governor KN Tripathi has said they should instead "go to the washroom" and wash the dirt off their faces. This comes after the TMC accused Tripathi of bypassing the state government when he sent a letter to a senior officer, asking him to call an administrative meeting.
