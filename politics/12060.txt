A day after senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar made controversial ‘tea vendor’ remarks against BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi, the former Union Minister’s office in his home town in Tamil Nadu was attacked by miscreants while the BJP staged protests against him. Unidentified miscreants pelted stones at Aiyar’s office in Mayiladuthurai, damaging some window panes, police said.
