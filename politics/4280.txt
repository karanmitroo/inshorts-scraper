The BJP has alleged that Uttarakhand's ruling Congress government has wrongly awarded a flight service contract to Congress' Naveen Jindal-linked India Fly Safe Aviation. BJP claimed the government deleted crucial conditions such as a security audit to favour the company. Under the new contract, 'Fly Safe' will have the sole right to operate the service to Kedarnath from next season.
