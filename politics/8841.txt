Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Parivartan Rally in Gaya on Sunday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar attacked Modi for referring to Bihar as a BIMARU state. 
“By first running down the Bihari DNA and now calling Bihar a BIMARU State and Biharis as unfortunate, he is betraying his prejudices against Bihar and Biharis," Nitish said.
