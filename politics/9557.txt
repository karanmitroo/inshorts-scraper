Aam Aadmi Party leader Yogendra Yadav has defended Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal against allegations of horse-trading. "One incident is being used to discredit the entire movement. Now innocuous conversations are also being presented as stings. Big accusations are flying sans any evidence," the leader wrote in a Facebook post. Notably, former party MLA Rajesh Garg had accused Kejriwal of horse-trading.
