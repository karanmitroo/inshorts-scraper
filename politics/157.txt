Satirist Cyrus Broacha said he will not crack jokes on BJP President Amit Shah out of fear, adding that he didn't make fun of late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray either. Talking about the NDA government, he said it is almost like living under the erstwhile Soviet government. Broacha was addressing students at a film and television institute in Kolkata.
