Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Wednesday that he will request the Supreme Court for a CBI probe into Vyapam scam. Earlier in the day, the Madhya Pradesh high court had refused to hear the state government's plea for a CBI inquiry, saying that a similar plea was pending for hearing in the Supreme Court on Thursday.
