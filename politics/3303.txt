Appearing at O Panneerselvam's residence on Monday, AIADMK legislator SS Saravanan claimed to have scaled a wall to escape from the resort where party MLAs are allegedly held captive by party General Secretary VK Sasikala. "I disguised myself, changed my get-up," Saravanan added. Earlier, Sasikala had asserted that all legislators at the resort were living there like a family.
