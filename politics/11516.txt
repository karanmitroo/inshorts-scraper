Mizoram recorded a peaceful turnout of 60% in the elections to the lone Lok Sabha seat in the state. However, the turnout figures might increase after getting the final report from all the eight districts, Mizoram's Chief Electoral Officer said. Elections for the lone Lok Sabha seat was earlier scheduled on Apr-9 but were postponed due to a three-day shutdown.
