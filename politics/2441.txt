Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday accused the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal of running a 'dictatorship', alleging it was using state power to 'torture' political opponents. He asserted that the government filed "fake cases" against BJP leaders for carrying arms. This comes after several BJP leaders were booked for carrying out a rally with swords on Ram Navami.
