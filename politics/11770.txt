In a major embarrassment for the Congress, retired IAS officer Dr Bhagirath Prasad - who was given a Congress ticket for the Lok Sabha yesterday - joined the BJP today. Prasad was declared the Congress candidate from Bhind constituency in MP. He had unsuccessfully contested the last Lok Sabha elections in 2009 from the same seat on a Congress ticket.
