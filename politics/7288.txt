The Congress on Monday targeted the BJP, asking how Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu's statement on Prime Minister Narendra Modi was different from Dev Kant Baruah's compliment to Indira Gandhi. Baruah, Congress President during the emergency, had been castigated for his remark "India is Indira and Indira is India". Notably, Naidu had recently hailed Narendra Modi as "God's gift to India".
