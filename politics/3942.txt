Calcutta High Court has overturned the city police's decision and allowed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat to hold his rally in the city on Saturday. However, the court has reportedly imposed conditions that only those ‘invited’ for the rally can attend it. The court has also put a cap of 4,000 on the number of attendees.
