All India Congress Committee's minority cell chairman Khurshid Ahmed Saiyed has said that Indian Mujahideen is only a "sectarian outfit" and not a terrorist organisation. Saiyed added that Muslim terrorists might exist in other countries, but Indian Muslims were never involved in terrorism. Notably, Indian Mujahideen is officially recognised as a terrorist organisation in India and the US.
