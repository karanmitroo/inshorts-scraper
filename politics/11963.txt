Addressing a public meet on Sunday in Odisha, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said that the Centre had been sending adequate funds to Odisha, but they were not reaching the people. "The money we send is being stolen. It's getting lost in between," Rahul added. He further criticized the state government for complaining about the lack of central fund.
