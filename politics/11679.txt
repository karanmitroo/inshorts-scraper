Former JD(U) MP NK Singh (73) joined the BJP on Saturday, after quitting the party on Friday. Singh, who had joined JD(U) in 2008, was officially welcomed into the party by BJP president Rajnath Singh. Two months ago, the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar did not renominate Singh for another term to the Rajya Sabha.
