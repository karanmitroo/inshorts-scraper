The Election Commission on Sunday slammed the AAP and said it was unfair to attribute its unsatisfactory poll performance to the alleged tampering of electronic voting machines (EVMs). It is for AAP to introspect why it could not perform as per its expectations, the EC said. Earlier, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had said that EVMs were "fudged repeatedly" in elections.
