Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit Saturday refused backing up BJP to form Delhi Government. "I never said BJP should form Delhi government. All I said was that if they have numbers they should form the government," she said. On Thursday, Dikshit had said "If BJP has reached such a situation that it can form government, it is good for Delhi."
