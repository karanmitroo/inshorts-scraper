Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi sat in the Kashi Vishwanath temple like he was offering namaz. The priest had to remind Rahul that he wasn't at a mosque, Adityanath added. "I am equally amused and saddened when he visits temples," he further said.
