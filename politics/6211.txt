After Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki sought time of at least 10 days to prove his majority in the Assembly, acting Governor Tathagata Roy on Friday denied him the same. Maintaining Thursday's order, Roy asked the CM to take a floor test on Saturday, July 16, 2016. Tuki had earlier termed the floor test's date as a "hasty" decision.
