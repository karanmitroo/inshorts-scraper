Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Friday slammed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for being “irresponsible”. “Rahul Gandhi wants to do anything to get publicity…”, Parrikar said. Replying to Gandhi’s allegations that the BJP scrapped the food park in Amethi, Parrikar said, “No company has come forward for food park in Amethi. If he can bring a company, we will support it”.
