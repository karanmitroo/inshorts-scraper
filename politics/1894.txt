Hoardings projecting PM Narendra Modi as 'modern day Dhritarashtra' have been put up in Kanpur, wherein Congress has targeted the BJP government on its third anniversary. The Opposition party has asked several questions to the Centre in the hoarding. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath was also seen in the hoarding where he is carrying a staff with a lotus flower.
