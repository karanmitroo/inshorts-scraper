Two people were killed and over a dozen injured when a stampede broke out at the venue of BSP supremo Mayawati's rally in Lucknow on Sunday. All the injured were immediately rushed to the nearby Lokbandhu Hospital. BSP's Uttar Pradesh chief Ram Achal Rajbhar, however, said a woman died due to humidity, and not because of any stampede.
