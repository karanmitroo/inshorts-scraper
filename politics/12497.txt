With Delhi-Assembly elections approaching, Arvind Kejriwal has decided to write to Sheila Dixit next week, for officially inviting her to participate in a public debate. Referring to her past debate with Sushma Swaraj, Dixit says that she is not shy of a political-debate and will look into the matter once Kejrival writes to her officially.
