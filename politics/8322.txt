The Election Commission on Wednesday said that no political advertisements will be published by parties or candidates from November 5 without being “pre-certified” by Media Certification and Monitoring Committee. Bihar will witness the final phase of its polls on the day. The directive comes in the wake of Grand Alliance petitioning against a BJP advertisement targeting Nitish Kumar over beef.
