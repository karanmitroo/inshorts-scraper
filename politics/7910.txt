The Delhi government went ahead with the odd-even scheme, disregarding its effect on AAP's vote bank, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday. He said, "apprehensions were raised that... Delhi's public will be so disappointed with us that we will lose the 2017 MCD election". However, "there was an urgent need to address the traffic and pollution problems," he said.
