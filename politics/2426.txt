Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has claimed that there is not a single liquor shop in 94% of villages in the state and that his government is taking strict action against illegal liquor vendors. The CM further said that women cannot be empowered through sloganeering, citing example of Ambikapur women who earned lakhs from the by-products of the collected garbage.
