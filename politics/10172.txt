Senior BJP leader Jagdish Mukhi has served a legal notice to AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for "misusing" his photo and projecting him as BJP's CM candidate on its posters. Mukhi also said in the notice that he will drag Kejriwal to court over this "serious issue", if he fails to answer within specific time.
