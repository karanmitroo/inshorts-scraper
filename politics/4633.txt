The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday reportedly asked carriers Air India, SpiceJet and IndiGo to suspend the pilots involved in West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's flight delay. Notably, her IndiGo flight was made to hover over Kolkata even after the plane was reportedly low on fuel. IndiGo, however, clarified that a fuel emergency was never declared.
