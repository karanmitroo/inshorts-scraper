Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Thursday alleged that the Centre was misusing the CBI to tamper with the floor test in the Uttarakhand Assembly. "If the CBI is being used to tamper the floor test, the people will notice what you are doing," he said. Rawat was earlier summoned by the CBI in connection with a sting CD.
