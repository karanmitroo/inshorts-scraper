Hitting back at Sonia Gandhi over her patriotism jibe, Narendra Modi Monday attacked her over the Italian marines issue, questioning at whose behest they were given a chance to leave India. He added that had SC not taken a strong stand on the matter, the marines wouldnâ€™t have come back. They were accused of shooting Indian fishermen off Kerala coast.
