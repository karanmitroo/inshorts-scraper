Hitting out at the Congress in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, PM Narendra Modi said, "You (Congress) said we are 'name changer' and not 'game changer'. I say if you look at us honestly...we are 'aim chaser'." "We work hard and have ushered in a paradigm shift in the working of the government," PM Modi added.
