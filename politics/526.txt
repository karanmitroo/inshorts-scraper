Four MLAs, including one from the ruling Congress, resigned as members of the Meghalaya Assembly and joined the BJP on Tuesday. The strength of Congress in the 60-member Assembly has now come down to 23. Last month, eight MLAs, including five from Congress, had quit from the Assembly to reportedly join a BJP ally.
