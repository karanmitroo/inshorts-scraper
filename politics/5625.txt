The Congress on Tuesday said that the use of drones for security purposes in Kashmir is the central government’s “biggest failure”. “Drones are usually associated with Afghanistan, South and North Waziristan in Pakistan," Congress leader Manish Tewari said. Notably, the government has deployed drones for security and surveillance purposes in the Valley on the occasion of Eid.
