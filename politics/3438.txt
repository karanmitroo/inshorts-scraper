Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, said that only former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh knows the art of bathing wearing a raincoat in bathroom. Modi said this while referring to several scams during the UPA reign, despite which there were no 'stains' on Singh. Following this, Congress MPs staged a walkout from the Rajya Sabha.
