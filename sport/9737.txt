South Africa's Dean Elgar took a diving catch in the slip cordon to dismiss Australia's Matt Renshaw in the Adelaide Test on Friday. Renshaw edged Kyle Abbott's delivery towards second slip, when Elgar, on third slip, dived to his right to catch it. On-field umpires gave the 'out' soft signal, which was upheld by the third umpire.
