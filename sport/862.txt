Mumbai-born speed skater Anice Das, who will represent Netherlands in the upcoming Winter Olympics, will visit India in search of her biological parents after the tournament. The 32-year-old has never visited India ever since she was adopted by a Dutch couple as an eight-month-old. Das had earlier unsuccessfully tried to find her biological mother through a Dutch TV program.
