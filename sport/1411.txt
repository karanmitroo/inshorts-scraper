Following the unveiling of the official logo of the 2018 World Chess Championship, which resembles a pose from the Kamasutra, 5-time world champion Viswanathan Anand said, "I'm hoping this doesn't end up pushing us into late night TV." Meanwhile, former chess champion, Susan Polgar tweeted, "Is it appropriate to promote to kids?...I strongly urge @theworldchess @FIDE_chess to scrap these logos."
