Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney scored the winner against Manchester City at Old Trafford with a bicycle kick on February 12, 2011. With his back facing the goal, Rooney leapt five feet in the air and measured the flight of the ball precisely from Nani's curling cross, before successfully sending it into the top right-hand corner of the goal.
