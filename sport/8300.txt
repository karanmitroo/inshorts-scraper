Australian Dean Jones asked West Indian pacer Curtly Ambrose to take off his wristband during an ODI on January 16, 1993. Jones had made the request to upset Ambrose so that he bowled loose. Ambrose reluctantly accepted the request and went on to take five wickets in the match. Jones, later, admitted that it was a mistake getting to Ambrose.
