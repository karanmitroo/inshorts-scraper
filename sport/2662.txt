Ex-England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has revealed he was once taken off a plane after mistaking the cockpit for a toilet. Flintoff revealed that he was drunk and "desperate for a wee", when he opened the cockpit door and whipped his "pants down". "There was this German pilot in front of me shouting 'Get him off my plane'," Flintoff further added.
