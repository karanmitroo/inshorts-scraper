Talking about the India U-19 team ahead of the IPL auctions and World Cup quarter-final, coach Rahul Dravid revealed that he has told the team to keep the auction out of their minds. "There is an auction every year, but not every year will they have an opportunity to play for India in possibly a World Cup semi-final," he said.
