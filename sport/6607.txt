Indian skipper Virat Kohli has been ruled out of the final Test against Australia at Dharamsala, beginning today. In Kohli's absence, Ajinkya Rahane will lead India, becoming the 33rd Test captain for the country. Kohli had suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the Ranchi Test's first innings, though he batted and came out to field in the second innings.
