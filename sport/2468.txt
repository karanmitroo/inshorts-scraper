The FIFA U-17 World Cup semi-final between England and Brazil, scheduled to take place on October 25, has been shifted to Kolkata from Guwahati. The decision has been taken after an assessment of the pitch conditions at Guwahati, which has been affected by rainfall over the past few days. The England-Brazil semi will be followed by Mali-Spain semi in Mumbai.
