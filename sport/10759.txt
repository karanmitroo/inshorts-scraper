American tennis star Serena Williams has withdrawn from the year-end WTA Finals tournament in Singapore, as she is recovering from a shoulder injury. The former world number one, who has won the year-end tournament five times in the past, is aiming to make a return at next year's ASB Classic tournament in Auckland.
