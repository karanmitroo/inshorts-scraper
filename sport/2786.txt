England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is reportedly looking to deploy "giant tents" over stadiums to prevent rain delays. A US-based company has approached ECB and research is being carried out into placing mesh netting over grounds. The netting would be held up by wires from floodlights with a hot air balloon in the centre to lift it up.
