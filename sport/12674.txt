Former SA wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, who suffered vision loss after being hit by bails, has suggested bails be fixed to stumps to prevent accidents. “Helmets are designed for balls, not bails. My recommendation would be to attach the bails to the stumps, by a light string,” said Boucher. Recently, MS Dhoni was also hit by bails in the eye.
