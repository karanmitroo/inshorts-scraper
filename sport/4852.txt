Indian wrestler Jinder Mahal defeated 14-time WWE champion Randy Orton to retain his WWE Championship at Smackdown's Money in the Bank event on Sunday. "I'm not even entering my prime and that's a scary scary thought. I'm only getting better every week," the 30-year-old wrestler said, and claimed that he is the hardest working man in the entire WWE.
