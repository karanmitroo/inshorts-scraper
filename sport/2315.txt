UFC champion Conor McGregor has said that he will eclipse Real Madrid's Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo in the highest-paid athletes list. "Ronaldo was number one last year, I was number 24... with $34 million in revenue", McGregor said. "Next year, if it stands as is, Floyd will be number one, I'll be two, and Ronaldo will be three", McGregor added.
