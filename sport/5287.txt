Veteran Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh has claimed that former captain MS Dhoni gets the 'privilege' for having a say in team selection while others on the same level are ignored. "We too have played for 19 years and won and lost India matches. I have won two World Cups too," Harbhajan said about him being ignored for ICC Champions Trophy.
