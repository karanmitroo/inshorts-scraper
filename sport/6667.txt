Puerto Rico is facing a shortage of hair dye as fans are dying their hair blonde to support the national baseball team, which reached the final of the World Baseball Classic. The blonde trend started after all players of the team dyed their hair as a bonding activity. The team is now being called 'Team Rubio' (Team Blond in Spanish).
