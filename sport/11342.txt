Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin has said Anil Kumble's 10-wicket haul in Delhi in 1999 is Indian cricket's best moment according to him. The player was listing his top five moments from Indian cricket ahead of the team's 500th Test in Kanpur starting Thursday. Ashwin also listed the Dravid-Laxman partnership in the Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001, among his favourites.
