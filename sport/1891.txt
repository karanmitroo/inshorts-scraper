Nagaland has sought support for its cricketers after its women's U-19 team was dismissed for two runs against Kerala in a One-day League and Knockout Tournament match at Guntur on Friday. The vice-president of Nagaland Cricket Association (NCA) attributed the team's performance to the lack of facilities, the absence of coaching and a dearth of funds.
