Former Pakistani captain Imran Khan has said that Pakistan cricket cannot be fixed if the PCB chairman is not appointed on merit, following Pakistan cricket team's defeat to India in the Champions League. Imran added that unless Pakistan cricket's structure is totally revamped the gap between the Pakistani cricket team and the Indian cricket team will keep increasing.
