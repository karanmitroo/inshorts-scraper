Condemning the recent reports of 49 children deaths in a Farrukhabad hospital due to lack of oxygen, Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir tweeted, "While Gorakhpur was still gasping for breath, someone suffocated Farrukhabad...& humanity too." The reports of 49 children deaths in one month came weeks after the Gorakhpur tragedy that witnessed the loss of 62 children.
