Luke Robinson, a 13-year-old kid from England, clean bowled six batsmen in six consecutive balls to produce a perfect over while playing for the Philadelphia Cricket Club at Langley Park. The kid, who initially bowled two overs without claiming a wicket and then ended with figures of 6/1, helped reduce his team's opponents from 10/1 to 18 all out.
