Self-taught sculptor Emanuel Santos has defended his recently-unveiled bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, saying Ronaldo has praised his efforts and asked him to make it more jovial. Santos, a former airport cleaner, said, "It's impossible to please the Greeks and the Trojans, and even Jesus couldn't please everyone... It's a matter of taste and not as simple as it seems."
