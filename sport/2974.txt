Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag, while commentating in the second India-Australia ODI at Kolkata, took a dig at Aussie pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile. "Nathan Coulter Nile ke teen naam hain just like Neil Nitin Mukesh," said Sehwag. Reacting to it, a user tweeted,  "Three names three wickets good sense for nathan coulter nile."
