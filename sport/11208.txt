Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal halted a match midway on Monday, when he realised a child had gone missing in the stands. Nadal, playing an exhibition match against Carlos Moya and John McEnroe, in Majorca, Spain, stopped his serve when he realised the commotion and resumed only when the child was reunited with her mother.
