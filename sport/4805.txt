Jaipur Traffic Police tweeted a photograph of pacer Jasprit Bumrah's no-ball against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final as an advice for drivers to forbid crossing the zebra crossing line at signals. The tweet, which also featured an image of two cars stopping behind the designated crossing line, was captioned, "Don't cross the line. You know it can be costly."
