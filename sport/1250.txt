Windies captain Carlos Brathwaite took a one-handed leaping catch to dismiss New Zealand's Tom Bruce in the first T20I of 2018 on Monday. While fielding at mid-wicket, Brathwaite reacted in no time and leapt to his right to pluck the catch in the ninth over of New Zealand's innings. Only nine overs of play were possible as rain forced abandonment.
