The Aquatic Centre at the Rio Olympics, which had been constructed for around $38 million, has been left in ruins almost half a year after the completion of the event. The centre had been made based on the model of "nomadic architecture" techniques, in which the centre could be broken down and be used as multiple aquatic centres.
