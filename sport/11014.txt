Ryland Willis, an Australian wakeboarder, boarded across a flooded vineyard in the Southern Australian town of Langhorne Creek. South Australia had been hit by storms, which caused flooding in areas throughout the state. Willis' friends brought a tractor to pull him along the flooded vineyards, and captured the feat using a drone camera.
