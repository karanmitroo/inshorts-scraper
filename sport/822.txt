While giving a jail sentence of up to 175 years to ex-USA gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar for sexual assault of over 160 women, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told him, "I've just signed your death warrant." Judge Aquilina said it was her "honour and privilege" to sentence him. "You do not deserve to walk outside a prison ever again," she added.
