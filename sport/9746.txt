Former cricketer Kapil Dev, while replying to fellow commentator Aakash Chopra, jokingly said, "Sonam Gupta cannot be 'bewafa'." Australian commentator Dean Jones, on being asked if Sonam Gupta is unfaithful, said he has "allegedly" heard about it but does not think about what happens elsewhere as he is a "cricket analyst". The video was posted on Twitter by Aakash Chopra.
