South African substitute Dane Vilas misfielded, and then produced a direct hit to run-out Australia's Callum Ferguson in the Hobart Test on Saturday. Vilas, positioned at point, misfielded in the 13th over, ran backwards to collect the ball and attempted a direct hit from the outfield which hit the stumps. Ferguson attempted a dive but fell short of the crease.
