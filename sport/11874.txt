Indian shooter Abhinav Bindra will chair a five-member review committee to probe Indian shooters' medal-less Rio Olympics performance. Constituted by the National Rifle Association of India, the panel will examine India's Rio performance in a "cold and ruthless manner". Bindra, who finished fourth in 10-metre air rifle event at Rio, may get reviewed for his performance at his own request.
