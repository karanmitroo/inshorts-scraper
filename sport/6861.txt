Pakistani batsman Salman Butt is being considered for selection for the upcoming Test series against West Indies following the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) giving formal clearance to the national selection committee. The 32-year-old, mastermind of the spot-fixing scandal that took place during Pakistan's tour to England in 2010, was banned from cricket for five years and served jail time too.
