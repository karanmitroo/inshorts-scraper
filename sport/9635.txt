The field restrictions were introduced in ODIs after England employed a controversial strategy against West Indies in a match played on November 28, 1979. With West Indies needing three to win off the last ball, England captain positioned all his fielders, including the wicketkeeper, on the boundary. The rules of the game were changed to prevent similar tactics in future.
