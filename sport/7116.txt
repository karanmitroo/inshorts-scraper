New Zealand's Jeetan Patel and Mitchell Santner became the world's first spin duo to bowl the first two overs of an ODI, starting off proceedings in the fourth ODI against South Africa at Hamilton on Wednesday. Spinners have previously opened the bowling in the second innings on eight occasions, but never in the first innings of the 50-over format.
