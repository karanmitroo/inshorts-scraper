Actor Amitabh Bachchan took a dig at former Australian cricketer Brad Hodge for his comments on Virat Kohli. Hodge had said Kohli missed the Dharamsala Test against Australia since the IPL was to start next week. Bachchan slammed Hodge saying Kohli sat out of the Test to show that the team was capable of winning even without him.
