Former cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have commented that some recommendations of the Lodha committee are "too harsh". The cricketers particularly questioned the one vote for one state rule and the cooling off period of three years for administrators. Kapil also suggested the selectors should have a minimum of a five-year term, considering that India is a vast country.
