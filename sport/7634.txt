Speaking about the prank played on him in the show MTV Bakra, former Indian cricketer Rahul Dravid said, "To be actually made a 'bakra' of was a bit embarrassing, but it was all in good humour. You got to be able to laugh at yourself sometimes." The prank involved the cricketer being proposed by a girl for marriage.
