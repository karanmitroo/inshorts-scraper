Supreme Court-appointed BCCI's Committee of Administrators has said Zaheer Khan and Rahul Dravid's appointment as overseas consultants for Team India has not been ratified and they are only the Cricket Advisory Committee's "recommendations". This comes after BCCI confirmed them as overseas consultants on "tour-to-tour" basis and Sourav Ganguly said Zaheer would be contracted for 150 days a year
