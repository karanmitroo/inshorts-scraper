Togo footballer Francis Kouassi Kone saved the opponent goalkeeper Martin Berkovec's life on the pitch following a collision in the Czech First League. The goalkeeper had collapsed on the ground when Kouassi opened his mouth and pulled his tongue out of his throat before he suffocated. Berkovec is expected to make a full recovery and thanked Kone on Facebook.
