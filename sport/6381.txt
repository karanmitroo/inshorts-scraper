Ravi Shastri has said the ICC Champions Trophy dilutes the World Cup's importance. "What do you need Champions Trophy for? Five years down the line, there will be very little 50-over cricket. There are too many ICC tournaments...If you ask me about the last 10-12 World Cups, I will tell you...ask me last three Champions Trophies...I don't know," said Shastri.
