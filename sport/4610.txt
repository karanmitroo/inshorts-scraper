Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis has suggested reducing women's ODIs to 30 overs a side instead of the regular 50 overs. Waqar compared the game to women's tennis, saying just like the sport features three sets for ladies instead of five, women's cricket should also have reduced overs. He said he thought 50 overs were "too many".
