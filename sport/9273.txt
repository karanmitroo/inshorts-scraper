Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed England's Jake Ball on the last delivery of Day 4 of the Mumbai Test. Ashwin bowled a top-spinner with a straight seam, making the ball go straight and bounce more to take the outside edge of the bat. The off-spinner is known for several other variations, including the carrom-ball and the slider.
