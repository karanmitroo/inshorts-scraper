The police in Santa Clara, USA have threatened to boycott San Francisco 49ers NFL games, if the team did not act against their quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was protesting police brutality against African-Americans and minorities. Kaepernick has refused to stand for the American national anthem in recent games and alleged that police officers were given 'paid leave for murdering minorities'.
