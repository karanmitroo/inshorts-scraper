Delhi's Rishabh Pant scored the fastest century in first-class cricket by an Indian, reaching 100 in 48 balls against Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy on Tuesday. The 19-year old's knock surpassed Naman Ojha's 100(69) scored in January 2015. Australia's David Hookes holds the record for the fastest first-class century, scoring 102(34) in a Sheffield Shield match in 1982.
