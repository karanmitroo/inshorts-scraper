A Saudi cleric has called on FIFA to prohibit players from making the sign of the cross while celebrating on the field. "I've seen video clips of athletes, football players running, shooting and when they win they make the symbol of the cross on their chests and my question is do FIFA's rules not forbid this," the cleric had tweeted.
