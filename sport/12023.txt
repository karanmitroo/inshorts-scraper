A late goal by Diego Costa helped Chelsea win 2-1 in their Premier League season opener against West Ham on Monday. Chelsea's Eden Hazard opened the scoring with a successful spot kick, which was later cancelled out by James Collins. Costa then scored from outside the penalty box to give Antonio Conte his first win as the Blue's manager.
