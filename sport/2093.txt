Ahead of Myanmar's Asian Cup Qualifier match against India, Myanmar coach Gerd Zeise said that he would like to give Indian captain Sunil Chhetri a Myanmar passport. "The Indian captain is a cool customer and he's the most dangerous player," Zeise added. Chhetri's goal had helped India secure a 1-0 win in the first leg match in March.
