Briton F1 driver Lewis Hamilton won his first Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday, to close the gap in the F1 title race with his Mercedes' teammate Nico Rosberg. Rosberg, who leads second-placed Hamilton by 12 points in the 2016 standings, needs at least a third-place finish at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on 27th November to win the championship.
