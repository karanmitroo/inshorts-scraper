Ex-Pakistani cricketers have ridiculed BCCI chief Anurag Thakur's comments about India not playing cricket against Pakistan. "I just feel that Anurag Thakur should not give political statements in his capacity as BCCI President," Mohsin Khan said. "For the last eight years India has avoided playing us in a proper bilateral series even when relations were better," Mohammad Yousuf said.
