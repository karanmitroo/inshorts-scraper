Pakistan and Comilla Victorians pacer Hasan Ali became the second bowler in T20 history to take an all-bowled five-wicket haul on Monday. Ali achieved the feat against Dhaka Dynamites in this year's Bangladesh Premier League, ending with figures of 3.3-0-20-5. The first bowler to take an all-bowled five-wicket haul was Bangladesh's Rubel Hossain, who did so in 2010.
