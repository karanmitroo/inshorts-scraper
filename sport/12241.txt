Indian boxer Vijender Singh broke into the World Boxing Organisation's top-10 rankings for the first time, after being ranked 10th following his Asia Pacific super middleweight title win last month over Australian Kerry Hope in New Delhi. Vijender has remained unbeaten since he turned professional in October last year, winning all his seven bouts, including six knockout victories.
