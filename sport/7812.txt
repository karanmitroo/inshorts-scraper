As per ICC's Big Three Model, BCCI is presently the most-funded Board, getting ₹3,400 crore ($507 million) from ICC's revenue for the 2015-2023 period. The Big Three, comprising India, England and Australia, are ICC's highest revenue-generating Boards getting a major chunk of ICC's revenue. If ICC scraps the model, India will lose ₹1,000 crore but will remain the highest-funded Board.
