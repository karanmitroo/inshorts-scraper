India's Ravindra Jadeja surpassed the likes of Anil Kumble and Kapil Dev to become the second fastest Indian to reach 150 wickets in Test cricket. Jadeja, who achieved the feat in his 32nd Test match, became the fastest left-arm spinner in the world to achieve the feat, ahead of Sri Lanka's Rangana Herath and former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.
