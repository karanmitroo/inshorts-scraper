Indian team's stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane took a reflex catch falling backwards to dismiss Australian middle order batsman Peter Handscomb off Ravichandran Ashwin's bowling. The ball flew off Handscomb's edge and went straight towards the first slip, where Rahane took the reflex catch to the right of his right shoulder.
