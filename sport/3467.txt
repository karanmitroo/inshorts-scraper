Defending bronze medalist and fifth seed, Indian boxer Shiva Thapa, has been forced to exit the 19th World Boxing Championships after suffering from food poisoning and high fever. The 23-year-old three-time Asian Championships medalist threw up multiple times the night before his second round fight against Georgia's Otar Eranosyan. Thapa failed to show up at the venue.
