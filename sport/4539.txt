Arsenal midfielder Mesut Özil has claimed his Instagram account was hacked after a picture with his ex-girlfriend Mandy Capristo was posted on the account. The picture showed Özil holding Capristo with the caption, "I know I messed up Mandy but will always love you @gracecapristo." Özil later posted a clarification on Twitter alongside a picture with his current girlfriend.
