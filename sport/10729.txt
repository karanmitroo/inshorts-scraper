Tennis-governing body ATP has asked Australia's Nick Kyrgios to see a psychologist, if he wants his eight-week ban to be reduced to three weeks. Kyrgios has agreed to "enter a plan of care under the direction of a sports psychologist," as directed by the federation. The ban was enforced after he was found guilty of misconduct at the Shanghai Masters.
