Brazilian police have rescued F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone's mother-in-law Aparecida Schunck on Monday after she was kidnapped ten days ago. "She was unharmed. Two men were arrested at the hideout...", the police said. After getting freed, Schunck said they should be jailed "so they can't abduct anyone...". Notably, the kidnappers had demanded $36.5 million in ransom, a record in Brazil.
