The ICC trolled a Pakistani fan who accused it of being biased towards India. The ICC had tweeted a photo of Indian fans cheering during the India-Sri Lanka match to which a Pakistani fan replied, "I dare you to stop kissing India's a** for 5 minutes...Just 5 minutes." The ICC responded with a reference to Pakistan's win a day earlier.
