South Africa defeated India by 135 runs in the Centurion Test on Wednesday, taking an unassailable 2-0 series lead and ending India's record streak of nine consecutive series wins. The last time India lost a Test series was when Australia defeated them 2-0 in a four-match series in 2014-15. The last Test will start from January 24 in Johannesburg.
