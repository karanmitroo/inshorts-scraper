English cricketer Kevin Pietersen has advised the Australian team, who will tour India later this month for a four-Test series, to "learn to play spin or stay at home". "You've got to learn to play spin quick...You don't need to be on a spinning wicket to play spin properly or practice spin...It's about picking length and picking lines," said Pietersen.
