Celtic Football Club's fans have raised nearly $120,000 for Palestinian charities after disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the club. Celtic fans had displayed Palestinian flags at a match against an Israeli team last week. The money is being raised to match the anticipated fine. The return leg of the match is scheduled to be played in Israel on Tuesday.
