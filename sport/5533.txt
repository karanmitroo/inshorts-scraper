Criticising skipper Glenn Maxwell after the team failed to qualify for IPL playoffs, KXIP's director of cricket operations Virender Sehwag said, "He didn't take the responsibility as a captain and didn't perform for Kings XI Punjab." "I can say that none of the foreign players took responsibility and at least play 12 to 15 overs," Sehwag added.
