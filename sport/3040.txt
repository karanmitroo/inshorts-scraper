Indian captain Virat Kohli was denied a four off Australian spinner Ashton Agar's delivery after the latter dropped his towel in his bowling stride during the second ODI on Thursday. Umpire  Anil Chaudhary had signalled a dead ball after noticing the bowler had dropped his towel, but Kohli did not notice the signal and went on with his shot.
