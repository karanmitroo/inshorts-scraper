Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade was adjudged not out by the on-field umpire despite getting caught behind after edging a Umesh Yadav delivery. India could not appeal for DRS as they had exhausted their reviews. The Australian, however, was dismissed four balls later by Yadav when he leaned forward to drive the ball but nicked it for Saha to catch it.
