India captain Virat Kohli presented an autographed jersey to sports journalist R Kaushik, who was covering the 100th Test match of his career. At the pre-match conference on Wednesday ahead of the second India-Sri Lanka Test, Kohli called Kaushik and told him that he always enjoyed answering his questions, since he was never looking for "masala".
