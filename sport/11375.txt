BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke has written a letter to the members of the Lodha panel, alleging Secretary of the Committee Gopal Sankaranarayanan of holding 'informal briefings' with the media, which have led to a number of source-based press reports. According to Shirke, the media reports have been showing the board and its members in 'poor light' and are 'creating confusion'.
