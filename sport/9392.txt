Liverpool, needing a victory by a two-goal margin to enter 2004 Champions League knockouts on December 8, were leading 2-1 against Olympiakos when former skipper Steven Gerrard scored an 86th-minute 20-yard screamer. The Reds eventually went on to win the Champions League final that season in Istanbul, which is considered as one of the biggest comebacks in football history.
