Sri Lanka on Thursday chased down the target of 194 against Bangladesh in the first T20I to register their highest-ever successful chase in T20I cricket. The win also ended Sri Lanka's eight-T20I losing streak, which had started on April 6, 2017 against Bangladesh itself. The last T20I of the two-match series will take place on Sunday.
