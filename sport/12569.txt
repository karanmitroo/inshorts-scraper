A group of South Korean architects have developed a foldable sports facility called the ‘Undefined Playground’. The facility can be folded out to support different sports, with its faces bearing basketball hoops, football goals, discus targets or a blank space. Reportedly, there is a waiting period of two months for using a basketball court in South Korea.
