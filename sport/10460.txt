Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale has signed a contract extension which will keep him at the club until 2022. Under the new six-year-deal, the 27-year-old will reportedly earn over £250,000 (₹2 crore) per week to become the club's second-highest earner after Cristiano Ronaldo. Bale joined Real Madrid in September 2013 for a then record fee of £85 million (₹692 crore).
