Australia missed being the top-ranked T20I team by 0.19 points, despite their victory in the Trans-Tasman tri-series on Wednesday. Pakistan retained the top ranking in the T20I standings after the ICC clarified a 'clerical error'. An ICC spokesperson had reportedly earlier stated that if Australia went through the tri-series undefeated, they would be crowned number one.
