Indian captain Virat Kohli has said he craves 'important' games like Sunday's virtual knockout encounter against South Africa in the Champions Trophy. "You want to be a part of those matches that are as important as this one and then if you perform in that and your team gets across the line, it's a different feeling", Kohli added.
