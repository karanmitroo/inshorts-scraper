An Islamic State magazine has encouraged attacks on two of Australia's iconic cricket stadiums, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). An excerpt from the magazine reportedly reads, "Kill them at the MCG, the SCG, the Opera House, and even in their backyards. Stab them, shoot them, poison them, and run them down with your vehicles."
