England all-rounder Moeen Ali has opted out of Pakistan Super League, the country's domestic T20 tournament, and instead opted to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca with his family. Moeen was named as a replacement for West Indies' Carlos Brathwaite on Monday for the Quetta Gladiators franchise, but he immediately opted out. He will be replaced by Australia's Brad Hodge.
