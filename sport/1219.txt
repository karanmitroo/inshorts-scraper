Former Indian cricketer Vinod Kambli has said that he has taken up coaching on the advice of his friend Sachin Tendulkar. "I would say he has had a big hand in bringing me back on to the field. And I will not let Sachin down," said 45-year-old Kambli, who will train members' children at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Recreation Centre.
