BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said India is open to using the Decision Review System (DRS), depending upon the latest technology's trials. Thakur said he will attend an ICC meet in Cape Town this month, where they will revaluate the system and take a decision after consulting the coach and captain. India is the only Test-playing nation to oppose DRS.
