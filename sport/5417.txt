Cricketer Mohammad Kaif took a dig at a fan on Twitter who asked him to remove "Mohammad" from his name. Kaif had hailed the International Court of Justice's verdict on Kulbhushan Jadhav on which the follower had made the comment. Kaif retorted saying that Aamir, which was the fan's name, meant "full of life", and he needed to get one.
