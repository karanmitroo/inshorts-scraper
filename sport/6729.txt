The Pakistan government has barred five cricketers from leaving the country, after they were accused of spot-fixing in the Pakistan Super League. Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif, Mohammad Irfan, Shahzaib Hasan and Nasir Jamshed are already barred by the Pakistan Cricket Board from playing cricket. Pakistan's investigation agency has taken up the case, while the PCB is conducting its own inquiry.
