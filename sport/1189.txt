23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams, who was pregnant with her first child while on her way to winning the Australian Open 2017, has withdrawn from the 2018 edition of the tournament. The 36-year-old withdrew claiming that her preparations had fallen short of what she personally wanted them to be, adding that she doesn't "want to just compete."
