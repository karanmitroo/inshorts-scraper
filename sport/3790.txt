A Sri Lankan cricket fan was trolled by Indian supporters after he tweeted that India "struggled" to score 326 runs on the first day of the final Test. A user wrote, "U call this a struggle! I must appreciate...ur halfhearted knowledge in cricket." "Only positive SL has taken is that India will not score 600 this time," read another tweet.
