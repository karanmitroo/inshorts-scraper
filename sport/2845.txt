Spanish club Barcelona will play its La Liga match against Las Palmas behind closed doors, after Professional Football League (LFP) refused its request to postpone it. The club had asked for postponement amid violence in the Catalan capital due to the Catalonia referendum. LFP had told Barcelona that it could face the prospect of a three-point deduction for postponement.
