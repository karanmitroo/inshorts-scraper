Fifteen Taoist priests performed an exorcism ritual on a football pitch after being invited by Chinese club Henan Jianye's fans to pray for a good result before the match. Jianye then went on to register their first home win in over three months. A picture of the ritual shows three flags bearing mantras, including, "God's will is Jianye must win."
