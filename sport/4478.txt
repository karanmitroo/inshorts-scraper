Aimed at safety of wicketkeepers, tethered bails were successfully tried in a match for the first time in England. The move to tie bails to the stumps has been made to prevent them from flying and hurting a wicketkeeper. Notably, South African wicketkeeper Mark Boucher was forced to retire after a bail hit him in the eye in 2012.
