Amaiya Zafar, a 16-year-old boxer from Minnesota, USA, became the first American to wear a hijab during a competitive USA Boxing sanctioned fight last week. Amaiya campaigned for rules to be changed after she was told that she could not wear her hijab. She was also allowed to compete in attire that fully covered her arms and legs.
