Ex-FIFA President, Sepp Blatter has reportedly lost his appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against a six-year ban by FIFA. Blatter has accepted the decision and has said that "the way the case progressed, no other verdict could be expected." Blatter was banned in 2015 for unethically paying $2 million to the then UEFA President Michel Platini.
