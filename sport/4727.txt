Cricketer Yuvraj Singh wore the Indian team's Champions Trophy jersey in the second ODI against Windies on Sunday. Yuvraj came to bat after Hardik Pandya lost his wicket to Alzarri Joseph on the last ball of the 35th over, before getting caught behind, scoring 14 runs from 10 balls. Yuvraj has not revealed the reason behind wearing the old jersey.
