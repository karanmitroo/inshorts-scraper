Australian captain Steve Smith has said that Ajinkya Rahane will do a good job as captain in the probable absence of Virat Kohli, terming him a "more chilled out guy". "I think he understands the game really well. So if Virat was to miss this Test...I'm sure Indian side will still be in very good hands," Smith added.
