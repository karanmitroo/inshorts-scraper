Australian opener David Warner became the fifth batsman and first in 40 years to score a century before the lunch break of a Test's opening day. He achieved the feat off 78 balls in the third Pakistan Test on Tuesday. The only other batsmen to achieve this feat are Australia's Don Bradman, Victor Trumper, Charlie Macartney and Pakistan's Majid Khan.
