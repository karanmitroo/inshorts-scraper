Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin trolled the Indian cricket board BCCI after the board tweeted, "Meanwhile in Kanpur. Team India hit the ground for a little warm-up session #INDvNZ." Ashwin replied to the tweet with, "@BCCI @imVkohli @SDhawan25 @BhuviOfficial @MdShami11 @ajinkyarahane88 hello, that wasn't a warm up session." India will face New Zealand in the first Test from September 22.
