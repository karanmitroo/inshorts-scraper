Amaiya Zafar, a US Muslim teen boxer, has won the right to fight in boxing matches wearing a hijab. The 16-year-old boxer, whose first sanctioned bout is scheduled on April 29, will be allowed to compete wearing a hijab only in the United States. Amaiya was earlier turned away after her weighing-in as her hijab breached competition rules.
