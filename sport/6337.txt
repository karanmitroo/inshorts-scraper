Jeel Shah, a 21-year-old Indian chess player, was suspended from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament on Wednesday for alleged cheating. Jeel was playing another Indian in a match when he was taken aside for "suspicious behaviour" and frisked by the arbiter. A mobile phone was reportedly found with the player, which the organisers alleged he used to cheat.
