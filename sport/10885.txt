Iraq missed a four-on-one chance during their World Cup qualifier against Thailand in Tehran on Tuesday. Leading 2-0 at that point, four Iraqi players scrambled towards the goal, with a mistimed pass and a stumble leading to the missed scoring opportunity. Iraq eventually won the game 4-0, with striker Mohannad Abdul-Raheem scoring all the four goals.
