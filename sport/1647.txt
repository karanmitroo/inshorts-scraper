Afghanistan wicketkeeper Mohammad Shahzad has been handed a 12-month retrospective ban after inadvertently ingesting a prohibited substance, the ICC said on Thursday. Shahzad underwent a test in Dubai in January and his sample was found to contain clenbuterol, classified under the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) Prohibited List. Notably, Shahzad will be able to return to action in January 2018.
