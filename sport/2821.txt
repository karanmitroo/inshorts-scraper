A Bosnian professional footballer had to undergo a surgery to get his testicle removed after an opposing defender kicked him in the groin during a Bosnia and Herzegovina Cup match. Marin Galic, aged 22, had been running with the ball when the defender mistimed his tackle and hit him in the groin. Galic then went down injured on the touchline.
