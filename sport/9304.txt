The International Olympic Committee has officially recognised cheerleading as a sport, granting $25,000 as annual funding to the International Cheer Union (ICU). Cheerleading involves yelling or intense physical activity for sports team motivation and audience entertainment. The ICU, which has 105 national federations, will have a three-year period after which it can push for Olympics inclusion.
