American baseball side Houston Astros' players held a fake funeral for veteran designated hitter Carlos Beltran's gloves. Wearing black t-shirts, the players gathered in the centre of the field at the Minute Maid Park and knelt in a semicircle around catcher Brian McCann, who delivered a eulogy while dressed in a black robe.
