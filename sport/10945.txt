Maria Sharapova returned to the Tennis court for the first time since her drug ban, playing two exhibition matches at the World Team Tennis "Smash Hits" event. The former world number one, whose two-year doping ban was cut to 15 months, can return to professional tennis in April 2017, one month before the French Open.
