British world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua trained at the world's highest ring created at a height of 689 feet, atop the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. The makeshift ring was installed on the building's helipad, where Joshua trained with the son of British boxing legend Chris Eubank Sr. Earlier, Roger Federer had also showcased his skills on the helipad.
