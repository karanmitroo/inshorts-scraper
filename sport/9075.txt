India's Karun Nair went past former cricketer Vinod Kambli's 224 to register the highest maiden Test century score for India during the ongoing Test against England on Monday. While Kambli scored his maiden Test century in the fourth innings, Nair achieved the feat in the third innings. His century is also the highest maiden century in the last 20 years.
