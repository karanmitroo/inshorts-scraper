As per reports, Virat Kohli has described Anil Kumble's approach as "intimidating" while giving feedback about his coaching skills. A BCCI official also reportedly said that Kumble conducts himself like a "school headmaster" in the dressing room, which has made the players unhappy. BCCI has invited applications for the post of India's head coach, with Kumble's tenure ending in June.
