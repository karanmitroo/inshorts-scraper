Ex-Indian cricketer Kirti Azad has said that former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju is either being “coaxed” by BCCI or has gone "senile", after Katju termed the Lodha Panel recommendations as “unconstitutional” and the committee "bogus". “I think it’s a fantastic judgement for the sportsmen, for the sports, and for the sports loving people of our country,” Azad added.
