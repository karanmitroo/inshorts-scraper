Justice RM Lodha has clarified the committee hasn't asked banks to block BCCI's bank accounts but asked to stop the disbursement of funds to state associations. Further, the committee clarified the BCCI is free to carry out its routine affairs, which includes conducting matches. Earlier, BCCI had threatened to cancel the ongoing India-New Zealand series, citing blocked bank accounts.
