MS Dhoni, who resigned as India's limited-overs captain, said that he will continue captaining his Indian Premier League side and may even lead the Jharkhand cricket side in the future. Dhoni said that India A's match against England on Tuesday will be a special game as it will be his final match as the skipper of a national side.
