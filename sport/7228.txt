Speaking about India's 333-run defeat in the Pune Test, Virat Kohli said, "I have got no excuses, I take the loss on the chin." Kohli added that this was their worst batting performance in the last two years. "Australia were much better on all three days. There's very little we can take away from this game," the captain further said.
