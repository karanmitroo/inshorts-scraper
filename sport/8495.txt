The Pakistan Cricket Board has slammed the Federation of International Cricketers' Association report, which has warned players from travelling to Pakistan for the Pakistan Super League final in March. "FICA sits thousands of miles away from Pakistan and cannot name even one credible security expert, yet makes a sweeping negative statement about the security situation in Lahore," said PCB.
