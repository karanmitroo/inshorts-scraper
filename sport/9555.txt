The plane that crashed in Colombia killing 71 people including Chapecoense football club players was out of fuel, had no electrical power and was preparing for an emergency landing when it crashed, according to a leaked audio recording. As per reports, investigators are probing another plane, whose unscheduled landing in Medell√≠n allegedly kept the Colombian plane from its own landing.
