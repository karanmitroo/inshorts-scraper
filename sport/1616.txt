Anna Dempster, an amateur MMA fighter from Oregon, USA, is set to fight an internet troll Kristopher Zylinski who posted comments that he believed that women, whether trained or not, cannot beat men in a fight. The sparring match was set up after a Facebook page offered $1,000 to any female fighter in the 160-pound weight-category to fight Zylinski.
