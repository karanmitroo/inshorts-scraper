MMA fighter Joe Harding tried to make fun of his opponent John Segas by dancing like late boxing legend Muhammad Ali, before getting knocked out the next second in the British MMA 18 featherweight title fight. Harding had won the first two rounds, following which he began showing the dance moves before Segas high kicked Harding's face for a knockout.
