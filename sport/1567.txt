Sachin Tendulkar wrote to PM Narendra Modi, requesting him to include all international medalists in the central government health scheme (CGHS). Sachin cited the example of former hockey Olympic gold medalist Mohammed Shahid, who didn't receive any financial aid from government initially and died aged 56 in a Gurugram hospital last year. CGHS is availed by all central government employees.
