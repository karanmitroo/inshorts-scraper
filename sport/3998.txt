Undefeated pro boxer Floyd Mayweather has announced he will break the rule of wearing 10-ounce gloves for his upcoming bout with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, to give the latter an advantage. Mayweather announced he will wear lighter 8-ounce gloves instead, which are used in lower weight divisions. The two will compete in the junior middleweight division limit of 154 pounds.
