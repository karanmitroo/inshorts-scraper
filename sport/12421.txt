Russian adventurer Fedor Konyukhov (64) set the record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the Earth in a hot-air balloon, when he landed in Australia on Saturday after an 11-day ride. Konyukhov took off from Northam in Western Australia and covered a distance of 34,000 km. The Russian balloonist broke late American adventurer Steve Fossett's 2002 record of 13 days.
