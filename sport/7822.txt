Speaking about his hundred in the 1992 Perth Test, Sachin Tendulkar revealed he practiced with a rubber ball to prepare for the Australian tour. "The rubber ball obviously bounces quite a bit.. I would ask the guys to bowl from 17 yards," said Tendulkar. Tendulkar added that the knock was one of the most important innings of his life.
