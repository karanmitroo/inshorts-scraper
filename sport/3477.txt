Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova won her first Grand Slam match since the doping suspension which sidelined her for 15 months. The five-time Grand Slam winner defeated world number 2 Simona Halep, maintaining a perfect 7-0 head-to-head record against the Romanian. Sharapova's last Grand Slam appearance came in Australian Open in January 2016, where she went to the quarterfinals.
