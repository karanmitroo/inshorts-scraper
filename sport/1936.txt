Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh slammed a Twitter user who asked him to retire from international cricket, saying that the cricketer's "best days were over". The user cited the saying, "You can't teach an old dog new tricks," and asked Harbhajan to stop making a "fool of himself". Harbhajan called the user an "old dog" and said he can only "bark".
