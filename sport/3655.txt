Umpires in the American baseball league, Major League Baseball, wore white wristbands during matches to protest against 'abusive player behaviour'. The move has come after Detroit's second baseman Ian Kinsler was fined but not suspended for his recent verbal outburst against umpire Angel Hernandez in a match on last Monday. Kinsler had called Hernandez a 'bad umpire'.
