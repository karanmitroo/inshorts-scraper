Sornnarin Tippoch, Thailand women cricket team's captain, pulled off a one-handed diving catch during Thailand's ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier Group A match against Zimbabwe on Friday. Tippoch was fielding at mid-off when Zimbabwe's Josephine Nkomo hit a shot towards her. Tippoch dived towards her right and stretched her right arm completely to successfully catch the ball.
