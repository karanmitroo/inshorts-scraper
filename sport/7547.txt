Ajinkya Rahane reacted in exactly 0.478 seconds to take a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Bangladeshi opener Soumya Sarkar on day four of the Hyderabad Test on Sunday. Ravindra Jadeja bowled outside off which was edged by Sarkar, who came forward to play it. Rahane, at slip, leapt to his right to dismiss Sarkar for 42 (66).
