Former Australia skipper Steve Waugh has hailed Virat Kohli's captaincy, saying he sees elements of himself and Ricky Ponting in Kohli's leadership. "He's a very aggressive captain, he encourages a lot of talk amongst his troops and he's got positive body language," added Waugh. Notably, Waugh is the most successful captain in Test history with a winning percentage of 71.92.
