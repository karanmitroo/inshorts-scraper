Following his 150-run knock in the second ODI against England, Yuvraj Singh said that Sachin Tendulkar calling him a "superstar" is a little embarrassing. "What an amazing partnership between a superstar and a rockstar!! We enjoyed the show :) @YUVSTRONG12 @msdhoni #INDvENG", tweeted Sachin Tendulkar. The 35-year-old scored his 14th ODI hundred, coming after a gap of almost six years.
