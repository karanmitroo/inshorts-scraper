On Australian pacer Brett Lee's 40th birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Happy Birthday @BrettLee_58. Why is there 58 in your handle? Wish your speed was only 58 mph. Binga is very Changa." Lee bowled a 161.8 km/h (100.5 mph) delivery in a charity Test against West Indies in 2002, which is unofficially the fastest delivery bowled at the international level.
