The PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games faced protests over the unified women's ice hockey team that featured athletes both from North Korea and South Korea. Few of the fans attending Korea's practice match against Sweden chanted "Peace Olympics", while protesters across the street shouted "Pyongyang Olympics". A 600-year-old Korean folk song was played instead of the two Koreas' national anthems.
