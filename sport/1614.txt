The BCCI on Saturday shared a video showing former Indian captain MS Dhoni bowling swing to all-rounder Axar Patel in the nets ahead of the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Dharamshala. "Is there anything that @msdhoni cannot do? You have seen him bowl leg spin now it is time for seam up. #INDvSL," the BCCI captioned the video.
