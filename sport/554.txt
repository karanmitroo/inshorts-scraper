Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag, who had taken a dig at PSU banks in his tweet regarding lunch break during India-South Africa ODI, responded to offended bankers on Twitter. Two bankers told Sehwag that they were not like what he had claimed. Sehwag called them "exceptions" and said that most government departments "do not care for the common man".
