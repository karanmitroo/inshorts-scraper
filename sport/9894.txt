Off-spinner Jayant Yadav picked his first Test wicket with the dismissal of Moeen Ali to an LBW decision that was overturned after a review. Ali, who was advancing down the wicket when the ball hit his pads, was adjudged not out by the on-field umpire. On review, the ball was seen to be hitting leg-stump, thus overturning the original decision.
