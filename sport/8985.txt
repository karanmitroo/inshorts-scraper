India's batting coach Sanjay Bangar has resigned from the post of head coach of IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab. "The decision was taken in the last week of November. I offered my resignation to the board and they recently accepted my resignation," said Bangar. He was reportedly involved in an argument with franchise co-owner Preity Zinta in the last season.
