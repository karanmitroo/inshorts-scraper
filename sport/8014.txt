Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath has said that Indian captain Virat Kohli will not be able to challenge Sachin Tendulkar's record in Tests. "Kohli's exceptional... I don't think anybody can beat Sachin's record or get close. To play 100 or 120 Tests these days is going to be a feat in itself," added McGrath.
