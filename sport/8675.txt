The third day of the New Year Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground is designated as the Jane McGrath Day, named after former cricketer Glenn McGrath's wife, who died of cancer. The crowd at the stadium is dressed in pink to spread awareness about breast cancer and to support and raise funds for the McGrath Foundation.
