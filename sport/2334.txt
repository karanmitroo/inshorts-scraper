Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson, known for playing the role of 'The Mountain' in 'Game of Thrones', has said he could have crushed Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor during a sparring session between the pair two years ago. "I had to hold myself back because I have too much power for a man of his size," Bjornsson added.
