A police official has said that the firefighter, from whom former Indian captain MS Dhoni's mobile phones were recovered, had taken them inadvertently and was unaware that they belonged to Dhoni. The phones went missing after Dhoni, staying at the WelcomHotel with the Jharkhand team, had to evacuate the hotel after a fire broke out in the hotel's vicinity.
