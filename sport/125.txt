France's 800-metre world champion Pierre-Ambroise Bosse has been charged for violence for his role in a brawl last August in which he was wounded. The person who lodged the complaint against Bosse said that the athlete had began the brawl after throwing a beer can at him. Bosse had claimed that he suffered multiple facial fractures.
