Commenting on Sri Lankan cricket team's recent away performances, former captain Sanath Jayasuriya said that SL do not produce champion cricketers as much as they did in the past. "We should be able to play under any conditions, not just at home," he added. Notably, SL were whitewashed 0-3 by South Africa in the recently concluded Test series.
