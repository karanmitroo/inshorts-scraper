Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has suggested that India's limited-overs captain MS Dhoni should be left alone on the matter of his retirement. "Fitness is all that matters...Brad Hogg is (still) playing at 44...[Dhoni] knows his mind and body better than anyone else. He's the best judge. Leave the matters to him," said the 43-year-old.
