Twenty-three-year-old Aiden Markram, who has played just two ODIs for South Africa, has been named as the country's captain for the remaining ODIs against India. This comes after Faf du Plessis was ruled out of the series owing to a finger injury. Markram led South Africa to 2014 Under-19 World Cup triumph and made his senior debut in September 2017.
