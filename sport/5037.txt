Mahatma Gandhi's youngest son Devdas was in England when Australian legend Don Bradman toured the country for the last time. Devdas convinced the warden of a local jail to let him spend the night there on June 10, 1948 after failing to find accommodation in Nottingham. He finally managed to see Bradman bat at Trent Bridge.
