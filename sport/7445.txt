Former West Indies' fast bowler Michael Holding was nicknamed 'Whispering Death' by umpire Dickie Bird for "his smooth and silent" run-up. Bird gave the name after he could not hear Holding approach the crease before delivering a ball during a match. Holding, known for his bowling speed, took 391 wickets in his 12-year international career.
