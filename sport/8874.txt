Pakistani pacer Mohammad Asif has described Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman as technically the best batsmen he has bowled to. "Dravid and Laxman were technically very good and could whip the ball from the off-stump to the onside flawlessly. It was a challenge bowling to them," said Asif. He added bowling an inswinger to Virender Sehwag set his career going.
