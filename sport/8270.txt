Former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin filed a case in the Hyderabad High Court against the Hyderabad Cricket Association on Tuesday, for rejecting his nomination for the President's post. Azharuddin had filed his nomination for the post last week, but he was deemed ineligible because of the life ban imposed on him by BCCI for match fixing.
