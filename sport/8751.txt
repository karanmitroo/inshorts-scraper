Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, in a recent interview, said there are people who tell his son that there is a better player than your father. "I often tell him, be yourself and be polite. There are jealous people out there," the Real Madrid forward added. Ronaldo recently won his fourth Ballon d'Or and is often compared to Barcelona's Lionel Messi.
