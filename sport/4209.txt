Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who played for the Chennai Super Kings, has said the side's two-year IPL suspension is similar to the Munich air disaster in which eight Manchester United players lost their lives. "I think the two-year hiatus for CSK probably increases its value much like what it did for Manchester United", Ashwin was quoted as saying.
