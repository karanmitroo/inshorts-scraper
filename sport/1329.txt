Israeli players have been denied visas by Saudi Arabia to participate in an international speed chess championship, World Chess Federation (FIDE) said. FIDE had said in November it was undertaking a "huge effort" to ensure all players were granted visas. "The event's not a world championship if they prevent...players from several countries from taking part," Israel Chess Federation said.
