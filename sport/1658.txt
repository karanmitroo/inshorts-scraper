MS Dhoni, who represented Pune in the last two IPLs, has been cleared to play for Chennai Super Kings next year, following the franchise's return. This comes after franchises were allowed to retain maximum five players each. CSK and RR can choose from players who played respectively for them in 2015 and were part of RPS and GL this year.
