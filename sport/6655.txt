Formula One has decided to scrap a regulation that banned the practice of sudden braking, known as "moving under braking", which was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. The new rules state that if a driver moves erratically or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated.
