India's sole Olympic individual gold medalist Abhinav Bindra has revealed he was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2014, and battled it during the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2016 Rio Olympics. Abhinav added, "I didn't end up fourth (at Rio Olympics) because my hands were shaking or because of the condition. I ended up fourth because I wasn't good enough."
