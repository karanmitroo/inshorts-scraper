Richard Stokes, an English cricket fan, was 10 years old in 1956 when he witnessed England's Jim Laker take the first 10 wicket haul in an innings in Test cricket history. Incidentally, 43 years later, Stokes was in India and was present at Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi when Anil Kumble took all 10 wickets against Pakistan in 1999.
