ICC has proposed using data extraction technology to tap mobile phones of players to check corruption in cricket. The move was proposed at a recent ICC meeting in Dubai and is currently awaiting approval from the international body's legal team. Currently, players are not allowed to use mobile phones or internet in restricted areas during international and domestic matches.
