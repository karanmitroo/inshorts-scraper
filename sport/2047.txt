Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez has been suspended from bowling in international cricket for the third time in three years after the ICC found his action to be illegal. However, the ICC said Hafeez can still bowl in domestic cricket events played under the Pakistan Cricket Board. Hafeez was previously banned from bowling in November 2014 and June 2015.
