Zlatan Ibrahimovic has claimed he had only one individual target after joining Manchester United and it was to conquer English football which he did in just three months. When asked if he was chasing Chelsea's Diego Costa to become PL's top scorer, he replied, "No, I'm not chasing anybody. I'm chasing...the Premier League. That is my aim."
