According to reports, most Indian team batsmen, including Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma failed coach Kumble’s ‘one-hour challenge’. Kumble organised a practice match on Sunday in which batsmen were supposed to bat for an hour, first against three seamers, then against three spinners, with two lives for each batsman. Only Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane managed to complete the challenge.
