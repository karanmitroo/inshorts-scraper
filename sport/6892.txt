NASCAR driver Kyle Busch got involved in a fistfight with fellow driver Joey Logano after Busch's car spun out on the final lap of Sunday's NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Kobalt 400 in Las Vegas. Busch landed a punch on Logano, whose car was seen to have made contact with Busch's, before the crew members wrestled Busch to the ground.
