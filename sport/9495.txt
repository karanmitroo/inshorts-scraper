Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, while batting on 30, inside-edged a yorker by Matt Henry in the first ODI at Sydney. The fielder at short fine leg misaimed the throw which triggered Wade to take a double but Cummins hesitated. Wade dived to return to his crease after the cover fielder missed a direct-hit and was able to complete a double.
