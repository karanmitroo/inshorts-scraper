Pakistani leg-spinner Yasir Shah became the first-ever spinner to take a five-wicket haul in five consecutive Tests, during the second Test against Sri Lanka on Saturday. Shah achieved the feat after taking the wicket of Lahiru Gamage in the first innings. Overall, Shah is the fourth bowler to achieve the feat, joining ex-pacers Sydney Barnes, Charlie Turner and Alec Bedser.
