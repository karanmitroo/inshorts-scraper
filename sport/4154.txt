 Former Australian pacer Brett Lee has said his 10-year-old son's favourite cricketer is Indian skipper Virat Kohli. "Once, when Kohli walked past me and we shook hands, I told him that you are my son's favourite batsman. Kohli showed a great gesture when he gave my son one of his Test shirts signed - with best wishes Kohli," said Lee.
