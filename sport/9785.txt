Former cricketers Shane Warne and Michael Slater, alongside England's Kevin Pietersen were fined $300 for not wearing seat-belts by Australian police, who spotted the offence in a video on Warne's Facebook page. The video showed former cricketers, who are commentators for Channel Nine, traveling in a van after the third day's play between Australia and South Africa in Hobart.
