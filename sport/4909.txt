Indian all-rounder Stuart Binny picked up six wickets while giving away only four runs against Bangladesh on June 17, 2014, to register India's best ever and overall the ninth best ODI bowling figures. Binny, who became the seventh Indian bowler to pick six wickets in an innings, surpassed former leg-spinner Anil Kumble's record of 6-12 from 1993.
