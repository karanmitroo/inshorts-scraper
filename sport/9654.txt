Former sprinter Milkha Singh has criticised the use of banned substances by Indian athletes. He said there was no use of banned substances earlier, but nowadays "doping is spreading like cancer". Singh added that the introduction of foreign coaches has brought banned substances to India and in order to "curb the menace", coaches and doctors should also be punished.
