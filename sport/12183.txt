Indian hockey coach Roelant Oltmans shopped for hockey sticks and shoes at an Adidas store in Rio, following the team's 3-2 victory over Ireland in their opening Group B match on Saturday. Oltmans had ordered the equipment in advance but since Adidas was unable to deliver it to the village, he took public transport to collect it himself.
