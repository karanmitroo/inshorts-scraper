Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar has credited South African batsman Hashim Amla for his decision to grow a beard. The ICC official said the Proteas opener had suggested him to grow his beard as per the religious beliefs in Islam. Dar has won the ICC Umpire of the Year award on three successive occasions, in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
