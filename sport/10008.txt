Adam Gilchrist scored 149 off 104 balls in the 2007 World Cup final, which is the highest individual score in a World Cup final. The left-hander, who turned 45 on Monday, had placed a squash ball inside his left glove to improve his grip on the bat. Sri Lanka later blamed him for breaking the game's "spirit and tradition."
