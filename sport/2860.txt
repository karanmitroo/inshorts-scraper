In a tweet, BCCI incorrectly referred to the 4th India-Australia ODI in Bengaluru on Thursday as the "1st T20I". Reacting to the error, a user tweeted, "4th ODI kanrappa, BCCI already excited for T20s." Another user reacted to BCCI's tweet with, "Did you inform the players that this is T20.. otherwise they may play for 50 over match."
