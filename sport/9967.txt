As many as 25 swimmers completed the first-ever swim across the Dead Sea on Tuesday. The swimmers, who left the Jordanian shore before sunrise, took about seven hours to reach Israel. Their aim was to raise awareness about the environmental degradation of the Dead Sea, as its radius has been shrinking at the rate of over three feet per year.
