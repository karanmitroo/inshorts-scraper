Boxer Vijender Singh was inspired to turn professional after the Floyd Mayweather Jr-Manny Pacquiao ‘Fight of the Century’, held in May 2015. On Saturday, Vijender defeated Australian Kerry Hope to become the WBO Asia-Pacific Middleweight Champion, his first pro title. "Everyone was watching Mayweather vs Pacquiao. I then decided to go to England and see how it worked," said Vijender.
