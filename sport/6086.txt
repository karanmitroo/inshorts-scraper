Wishing Sri Lankan spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan on his 45th birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Happy Birthday to the great man, who not only surprised batsman but himself looked surprised & batsman used to think 'Maut Aaya Muralitharan'". Muralitharan is international cricket's highest wicket-taker with 1,347 international scalps to his name for Sri Lanka across Tests, ODIs and T20Is.
