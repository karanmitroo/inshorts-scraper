Mercedes' Formula One driver Nico Rosberg won his maiden Formula One drivers' championship to become the 33rd Formula One World Champion in F1 history. Rosberg, who needed only a podium finish in Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, finished second to deny Hamilton his fourth straight world title. Notably, Rosberg's father had also won the F1 championship 34 years ago.
