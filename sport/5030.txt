Force India Co-owner Vijay Mallya has dismissed speculation of a possible sale of his team to Australian David Brabham or Formula One's former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone. Mallya said he remained in for the long haul despite his legal problems with the government. "There have been no conversations with Brabham, I haven't even met them," he said.
