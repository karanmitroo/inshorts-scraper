German tennis player Mischa Zverev has been handed a Grand Slam-record $45,000 (nearly â‚¹29 lakh) fine for "poor performance", after he retired 48 minutes into his first round match at the Australian Open. The world number 35 is now the first player to be fined under new rules, which discourage players with pre-existing injuries from participating in Grand Slams.
