Former Pakistan batsman Javed Miandad hit a six off Chetan Sharma on the match's final ball to help Pakistan win their first major international trophy in the form of the Austral-Asia Cup against India on April 18, 1986. Chasing 246, Pakistan required four runs off the final ball, which turned out to be a full-toss instead of the intended yorker.
