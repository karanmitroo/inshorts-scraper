Australia's Pakistan-born cricketer Fawad Ahmed, who had once forgotten to carry his bat while going out to bat, came out wearing gloves of the same hand, in a domestic match on Friday. The official Facebook page of Cricket Australia shared a compilation video of both his gaffes and captioned it, "Surely not?! Well, at least Fawad Ahmed is improving."
