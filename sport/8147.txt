A spectator took a one-handed catch during Rafael Nadal's third round match against Germany's Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open on Saturday. In the fifth set of the match, Zverev returned a shot during a rally, which went straight towards the spectator sitting in the first row. The commentators and crowd then applauded the fan for the catch.
