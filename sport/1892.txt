English women's team cricketer Danielle Wyatt, who asked Virat Kohli to marry her on Twitter in 2014, tweeted about being featured on the team of the week list alongside the Indian captain. Kohli had gifted Wyatt a bat after meeting her during India's tour of England in 2014. Wyatt scored a 56-ball century in the Women's Ashes recently.
