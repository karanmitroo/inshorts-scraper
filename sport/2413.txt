Pakistani pacer Hasan Ali trolled Sri Lankan batsman Sachith Pathirana by pretending to take a catch while the ball was on the ground during a T20I on Thursday. Pathirana had edged a delivery and didn't know where the ball was, before Ali went near him and mimicked a catch. On the next delivery, Ali caught and bowled Pathirana, dismissing him.
