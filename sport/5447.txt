IPL Chairman Rajeev Shukla has said he will consider Kolkata Knight Riders' owner Shah Rukh Khan's suggestion of a reserve day for IPL playoffs. After KKR's rain-hit win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator on Wednesday, Shah Rukh tweeted playoffs needed an alternative day in case of an abandoned match. KKR got only six overs to play in the eliminator.
