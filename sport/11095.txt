World heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury reversed his retirement, three hours after announcing it on Twitter. Fury had earlier written, "Boxing is the saddest thing I ever took part in..." but later tweeted, "Hahahaha u think you will get rid of the GYPSYKING that easy!!!" Fury pulled out of a match last month and is yet to defend his title.
