Politician and former BCCI chief Sharad Pawar said that the Supreme Court-appointed Lodha Committee, which recommended a number of structural reforms in the Indian cricket board, has "definitely destroyed" cricket. Supreme Court approved the Lodha panel's recommendations, such as 'one state, one vote', 'one member, one post', and fixing an age-cap of 70 years on those occupying BCCI posts.
