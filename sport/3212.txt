Canadian chess grandmaster Anton Kovalyov claims that he was "bullied" by the European Chess Union President Zurab Azmaiparashvili for having worn shorts at the FIDE World Cup in Georgia. Kovalyov, who forfeited the tournament due to the treatment, later wrote on Facebook, "[Azmaiparashvili] was very aggressive, yelling at me and using the racial slur 'gypsy' to insult me."
