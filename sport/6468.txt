Writing about Indian skipper Virat Kohli's performance in an article, Sourav Ganguly stated, "Against Australia, probably he (Kohli) was so consumed by wanting to win as captain that he let his emotions affect his batting." This will also serve as a lesson for Virat... I hope he cools down and gets back to scoring big again," Ganguly added.
