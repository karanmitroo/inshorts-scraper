Thirty-nine-year-old Anindita Chakraborty helped West Bengal women win the Senior National Table Tennis Championship after a gap of 19 years. "Once you are at the table, you forget numbers like age. You play to win, and that’s exactly what I concentrate on,” said Anindita, who is also a state selector. Notably, the title was Anindita's seventh national title.
