Aaron Dunn, an ice hockey fan from Canada, won a car after scoring the puck from the half-line through a small cut-out placed in front of the goal. Dunn's first two attempts at landing the shot failed before he converted the final shot. The car was given in a contest held during the match's second intermission.
