Former Brazilian footballer Rivaldo dressed up in a disguise to surprise Barcelona fans during an 11-a-side match between fans at the club's training ground. The 1999 Ballon d'Or winner donned a mask, a wig and a goatee to become unrecognisable, and was addressed as 'Roberto'. Fans were left in disbelief when the 44-year-old revealed his identity after the match.
