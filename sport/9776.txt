Spinner Ravichandran Ashwin visited the Indian Navy ship INS Jalashwa after India's win over England in the Vizag Test on Monday. He was invited onboard by the Indian Navy after he expressed his wish to share a cup of coffee with soldiers in his 'Sandesh2Soldiers' video on Diwali. Ashwin later presented an autographed bat to the Eastern Naval Command.
