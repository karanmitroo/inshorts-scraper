English all-rounder Ben Stokes scored 12 runs in 22 balls and registered figures of 2/43 on his return to international cricket in England's first ODI loss against New Zealand on Sunday. Stokes was unavailable for his country for the past five months as he was involved in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub last September which led to a lawsuit.
