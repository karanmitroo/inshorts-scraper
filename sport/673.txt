A 23-year-old man interrupted the fifth Australia-England ODI in Perth by running onto the ground naked in front of almost 54,000 people on Sunday. The man, identified as Ben Jenkins, evaded security for nearly a minute before showing them a 'handcuff me' gesture and being wrestled to the ground. He was subsequently banned for three years from Cricket Australia-sanctioned matches.
