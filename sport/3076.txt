Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's foundation arranged a box ticket for the first India-Australia ODI for 43-year-old P Venkatesan, a fan who is suffering from a kidney-related ailment. Ashwin has not been included in the Indian squad for the first three ODIs of the five-match series. Notably, the spinner is currently in the UK, playing county cricket for Worcestershire.
