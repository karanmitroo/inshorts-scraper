Australian spinner Steve O'Keefe has been fined Australian $20,000 and banned from a domestic tournament next year for making drunken comments at an official function last week. O'Keefe, who will now undergo counselling, accepted the sanction and offered an "unconditional apology" for his behaviour. In August 2016, the bowler was fined AUD $10,000 for offensive behaviour also related to drinking.
