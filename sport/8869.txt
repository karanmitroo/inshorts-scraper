Bangladeshi batsmen Sabbir Rahman and Imrul Kayes were involved in a run-out, during the second ODI against NZ, in which both ended up at the non-striker's end. Kayes had set off for a single, before a cover fielder threw the ball to the keeper. Rahman initially ran but later tried to go back but Kayes had grounded his bat first.
