Cricketer Irfan Pathan was slammed for posting a picture of himself celebrating Rakshabandhan, with a couple of his followers calling it 'un-Islamic'. Users called the move "disgraceful", accusing Irfan of "tossing Islamic principles." Pathan replied, "Using foul language. Talking each other rudely on basis of religion. It shows ur own learning...stop this nonsense of putting each other down."
