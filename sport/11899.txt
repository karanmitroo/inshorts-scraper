India's latest number one Test rank, which lasted five days, was the shortest stint for any team at the top of the table. India became the top-ranked Test team last week before being displaced by Pakistan on Monday, following India's draw against West Indies. Notably, India had a 21-month Test number one streak in 2009-10, the joint second longest stint.
