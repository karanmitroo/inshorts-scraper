Sachin Tendulkar responded to a hand-written letter from Karan Gandhi, a fan residing in the USA. "I grew up seeing you play cricket, I missed countless tuition classes to watch you play day and night ODIs", Karan wrote in his letter. "I'm sure your childhood tuition teacher mustn't have been too happy when ODI matches were on", Sachin replied.
