England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has named former Pakistani pacer Mohammad Asif as the best bowler he has ever faced. The 36-year-old claimed that Asif's ability to create movement off the pitch made the batsmen feel like the ball was "accelerating off the wicket in different directions". Pietersen named Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis as the best batsmen he played against.
