The fifth Ashes Test to be held in Sydney from January 4 will be the 10th Pink Test. Ahead of it, the Australian Test team donned pink caps at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday alongside Glenn McGrath, whose foundation raises funds for breast cancer awareness through the Pink Test. The first-ever Pink Test took place from January 3, 2009.
