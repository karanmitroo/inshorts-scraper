Sports Minister Vijay Goel mistakenly used the word "breast" instead of "best" while addressing the crowd during a FIFA U-17 World Cup event in Delhi on Monday. "Indian players will give their breast," Goel mistakenly said during his speech. Former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol, who was present at the event, was seen smirking at the faux pas.
