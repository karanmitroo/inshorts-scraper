Former Chelsea, Manchester City, PSG and AC Milan striker George Weah will be the next president of the West African nation of Liberia. The 51-year-old became the first non-European player to win the Ballon d'Or in 1995 and ended his 18-year professional career in 2003. Weah will succeed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was Africa's first elected female president.
