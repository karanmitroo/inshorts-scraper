Former cricketer Virender Sehwag and British TV presenter Piers Morgan got into a Twitter argument after the Indian women's team nine-run loss to England in the World Cup final. Morgan, who had taken a dig at Sehwag after the India-England kabaddi World Cup match last year, asked Sehwag if he was okay following India's loss in the final on Sunday.
