The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has condemned Russia for detaining Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion and political activist, ahead of an opposition rally in 2007. Kasparov was detained at a Moscow airport in May 2007, preventing him from boarding a flight to Samara, Russia to attend a rally at an EU-Russian summit.
