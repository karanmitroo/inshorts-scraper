Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan did an impromptu 'bhangra' dance on the streets of Cape Town, South Africa, on the New Year's Eve. They danced on the music being played by local musicians. Notably, Dhawan was recently spotted limping his way into the team hotel with strapped ankle, prompting reports that he has been dropped for the first Test.
