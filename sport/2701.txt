BCCI has made it compulsory for cricketers to pass the Yo-Yo fitness test to make it into the Indian team. The grade needed to be achieved on the Yo-Yo scale is 16.1, the minimum standard set for an elite international sportsman, BCCI said. The current level is a basic one and gradually the fitness bar will be raised, BCCI added.
