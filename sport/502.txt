Virender Sehwag's 62(31) went in vain as Shahid Afridi-led Royals defeated Palace Diamonds by six wickets in the first T20 match of the St Moritz Ice Cricket tournament on Thursday. Sehwag's knock and Andrew Symonds' 40 helped Diamonds score 164/9. Royals chased down the target in 15.2 overs helped by Owais Shah's 74*, while Afridi got out for a duck.
