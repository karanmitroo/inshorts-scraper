US tennis player Serena Williams spoke about how she is perceived to be meaner compared to Russian Maria Sharapova, since she is dark-skinned. "People think I'm mean...But Maria Sharapova, who might not talk to anybody, might be perceived by the public as being nicer...Because I'm black and so I look mean? That's the society we live in," said Serena.
