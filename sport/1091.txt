The Indian cricket team will tour Ireland for two T20Is in June this year, their first visit to the country since 2007. The two T20Is will be held in Dublin on June 27 and June 29, and will be followed by India's two-month tour of England. India beat Ireland by eight wickets in the lone T20I between the two teams.
