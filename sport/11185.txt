Renault's Formula One driver Kevin Magnussen was forced to abandon his car after it burst into flames in the pit lane, during the first practice session for the Malaysian Grand Prix on Friday. The session was halted because of the fire, which took 20 minutes to be doused. Reportedly, a leaking fuel breather is believed to have caused the blaze.
