Local police used tear gas on over 300 Sri Lankan cricket fans, who tried to force their way into the Dambulla stadium, which was hosting the fourth ODI match between Sri Lanka and Australia. Fans tried to force their way into the stadium after the authorities announced that all tickets had been sold and asked anyone without tickets to leave.
