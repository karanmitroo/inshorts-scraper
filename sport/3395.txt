Sri Lanka were unable to directly qualify for the 2019 World Cup, after failing to win at least two ODIs in the ongoing series against India. The 1996 World champions' direct qualification is now dependent on the result of Windies' upcoming ODIs. The top seven ODI teams, apart from hosts England, as on September 30, directly qualify for the tournament.
