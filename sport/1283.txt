Adelaide Strikers' batsman Jonathan Wells slammed a 104-metre six which landed on the roof of the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. The six came off the bowling of Sydney Sixers' pacer Ben Dwarshuis in the last over of the innings. "I've only seen that once before, when Hansie Cronje hit Shane Warne...many, many years ago." said Ricky Ponting while commentating.
