The Test in which Sachin Tendulkar made his international debut on November 15, 1989, was not telecast live in India, neither covered on radio. Doordarshan did not broadcast the first two India-Pakistan Tests, as the ninth Lok Sabha elections were being held around the same time. Sachin was dismissed for 15 by Waqar Younis, who was also making his debut.
