Brazilian footballer Kaka, who retired from football on Monday, was the last footballer to win the Ballon d'Or before Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Since then, Ronaldo and Messi have won the trophy all-time record five times each. Kaka, who lifted the World Cup in 2002, won the Ballon d'Or in 2007 following his Champions League triumph with AC Milan.
