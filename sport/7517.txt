Rajkumar Sharma, Virat Kohli's coach since childhood, has attributed Kohli's evolution as a cricketer to reading a lot of books and listening to music. "Kohli doesn't go out too often these days...He has taken to books like a fish to water and is an avid reader. He likes reading autobiographies," said Rajkumar.
