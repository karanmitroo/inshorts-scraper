Chhattisgarh cricket team captain Mohammad Kaif has claimed that Jharkhand captain MS Dhoni is still good enough to play for India in all the three formats. "[I] always felt you cannot become a 'Dhoni' just by practice. He has natural abilities which you saw today," Kaif said after Dhoni's 107-ball 129 helped Jharkhand beat Chhattisgarh in the Vijay Hazare trophy.
