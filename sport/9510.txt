Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag has said that the Indian cricket team under Virat Kohli can "definitely emulate" the performances of the team that played under Sourav Ganguly. Sehwag added that the current team has the quality and capability of winning Test matches in England and Australia. Notably, India has never won a Test series in Australia.
