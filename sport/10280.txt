Sachin Tendulkar, then 14, was a ball boy at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium during the 1987 World Cup semifinal between India and England. "I was fortunate to be among the volunteers...As I stood there watching the Indian greats, I kept telling myself that I need to be a part of the action in the middle," Tendulkar later wrote about his experience.
