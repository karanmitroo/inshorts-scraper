Rio Olympics silver medalist PV Sindhu has said the Games taught her how important it is "to let go". "I played against seeded players and I realised that they will also feel bad losing against a lower ranked player like me...When you lose, you keep thinking I could have done things differently...it is important to let go," said the shuttler.
