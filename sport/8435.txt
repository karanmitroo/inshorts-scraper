Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho has penned a letter to his eight-year-old self, chronicling his journey from the day his father passed away to winning the World Cup for Brazil and beyond. The footballer remembered his father's advice to play with joy and to value creativity over calculation. He later imparted the same advice to a young Lionel Messi at Barcelona.
