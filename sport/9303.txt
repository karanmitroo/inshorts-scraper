India's Harmanpreet Kaur lofted a long six during her Women's Big Bash League debut for Sydney Thunder on Saturday, which the former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist called "as good a cricket shot as you will ever see". The bowler, Gemma Triscari, was also left amused by the shot and started laughing afterwards.
