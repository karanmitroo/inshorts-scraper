A man won the Venice marathon on Sunday after six leading runners took a wrong turn due to the incorrect path of the motorcycle guiding them. The runners, who covered several hundred metres before realising they were on the wrong path, lost about two minutes. Meanwhile, 25-year-old Eyob Faniel, became the first Italian to win the marathon in 22 years.
