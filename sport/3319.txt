A TV reporter took a one-handed catch while doing a live spot near the stands during a baseball game in Houston, USA. Steve Gelbs was reporting on relief efforts going on in response to Hurricane Harvey's effects in Houston when the ball came towards him. Gelbs tweeted he was "happier" to report on relief efforts than he was about catching.
