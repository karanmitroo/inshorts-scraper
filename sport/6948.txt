Former Argentina captain Diego Maradona will become the ambassador of the Chinese Super League, the former footballer announced on Instagram on Thursday. The 16-club league reportedly saw over ₹2,591 crore (£320 million) being spent on transfers, but matches failed to draw spectators. Ex-Chelsea players Oscar and Ramires, and ex-Manchester City player Carlos Tevez are playing in the tournament.
