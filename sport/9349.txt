Ravichandran Ashwin registered his career's 23rd five-wicket haul during the Mumbai Test against England on Friday. He is now tied at third place with Kapil Dev for most five-wicket hauls in Tests by an Indian bowler, with only Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh placed ahead. This is Ashwin's seventh five-for this year, the most by any Indian bowler in 2016.
