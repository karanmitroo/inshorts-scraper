Australian bowlers did the 'Bowling Bar challenge' to practise their yorker bowling skills ahead of their do-or-die Champions Trophy fixture against England. A metal bar was placed near the batting crease, almost 25 centimetres above the pitch to indicate the perfect area to bowl a yorker. The Australian bowlers were twice able to rattle the bar.
