Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane was stumped out on the bowling of Australian spinner Nathan Lyon on the first day of the Bengaluru Test. Rahane advanced down the wicket but failed to connect the ball. Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade fumbled and failed to collect the ball in his first attempt but quickly gathered it to uproot the stumps to dismiss the batsman.
