A new law allowing umpires to send off players for violent conduct during matches has been proposed by the Marylebone Cricket Club's World Cricket committee. Violent behaviour includes threatening an umpire, physical assault or any act of on-field violence. The law, subject to approval by the main MCC Committee, is expected to come into force from October 1, 2017.
