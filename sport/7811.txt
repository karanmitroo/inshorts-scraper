Vinod Rai, head of the Supreme Court-appointed panel overseeing BCCI's administration, said that India will not withdraw from the ICC Champions Trophy which is set to be held in England later this year. The statement comes after rumours claiming that India will withdraw from the tournament as ICC wants to control the dominance of the 'Big Three' cricket boards.
