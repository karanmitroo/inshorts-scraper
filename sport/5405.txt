Around two lakh litres of water was pumped out from Bengaluru's Chinnaswamy stadium during the rain-hit IPL eliminator between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad on Wednesday. The stadium is the world's first with a subsurface aeration drainage system which pumps out water at 10,000 litres a minute. KKR played six overs, with the match ending at 1:27 am.
