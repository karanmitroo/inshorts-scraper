Australian batsman Adam Voges, who has the second-highest average in Test cricket, announced his retirement from international cricket on Tuesday. His last game against an international side will be for Prime Minister's XI against Sri Lanka in Canberra on Wednesday. "I've had an amazing couple of years with Australian Test team and I've loved every minute of it," Voges said.
