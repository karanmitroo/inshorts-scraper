India coach Anil Kumble bowled left-arm spin to batsmen in the nets before the Ranchi Test to help them counter Australian left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe. In a video, Kumble, a right-arm spinner, is seen bowling to Cheteshwar Pujara. "Anil bhai was coming from corner of the crease and angling into the right hander and spinning it from there," said Pujara.
