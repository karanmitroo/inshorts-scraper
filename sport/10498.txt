Former Sri Lankan captain, Kumar Sangakkara, who is celebrating his 39th birthday today, was part of Test cricket's highest ever partnership. Sangakkara and his teammate since Under-19 days Mahela Jayawardene recorded a 624-run stand against South Africa in Colombo in 2006. Sangakkara went on to score 287 in the innings, one of his 11 double centuries in Test cricket.
