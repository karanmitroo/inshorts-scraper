A security guard at the Paris Masters tournament failed to recognise world's number one tennis player Rafael Nadal and initially stopped him from entering the court. Nadal was not carrying the tournament pass with him while going to practice when the incident happened. The Spaniard was then immediately allowed through to the training court after he told guard his name.
