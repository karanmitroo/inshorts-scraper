Premier League champions Leicester City’s players have been gifted a BMW I8 each by club owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, following their title win earlier this year. A fleet of 19 BMW I8s, each costing £105,000 ($137,000), were spotted parked outside the King Power Stadium on Friday. Leicester are set to play Manchester United in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.
