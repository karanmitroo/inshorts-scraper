Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium's curator Pandurang Salgaonkar has said he was asked by BCCI curators to prepare a rank turner for the recently-concluded Pune Test, which India lost. "I am really sad that I had to prepare that kind of a wicket...I was asked to change the pitch after a meeting between the team management and BCCI curators," said Salgaonkar.
