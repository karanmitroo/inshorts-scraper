French rider Gregory Morat helped Russia’s Anastasia Nifontova when her motorcycle toppled over in the middle of high plains and dunes during the Dakar 2017 rally. Russia’s Nifontova asked the cameraman nearby for help, but he refused as the rally regulations forbid such actions, before Morat helped her and wished her luck for the race.
