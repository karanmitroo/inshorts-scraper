Indian skipper Virat Kohli has said he might not be able to match up to Sachin Tendulkar's 24-year-long career. "I might not play for that long because it's very difficult with the amount of cricket nowadays...I'll give my very best and make sure Indian cricket stays on top till the last day I play this game," said Kohli.
