Former Pakistan coach Javed Miandad has urged Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to get rid of players who are proving to be a "burden on the team". "The selectors lack vision, they should notice these below par performances," he added. Miandad's comments were directed at opener Azhar Ali and Mohammad Hafeez, who scored 9(22) and 26(53) respectively against South Africa.
