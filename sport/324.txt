Following his match-winning ton in the sixth South Africa ODI, Virat Kohli said his wife Anushka Sharma deserves "a lot of credit". "She's been a huge factor. She has been criticised a lot, but she is one person who kept pushing me," he further said. "I've got 8-9 years left in my career...want to make most of it," he added.
