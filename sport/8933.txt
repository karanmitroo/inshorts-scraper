Manchester United midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored through a scorpion kick in the 86th minute of the Manchester United's Boxing Day Premier League match against Sunderland. Mkhitaryan ran inside the box and acrobatically flicked the cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic through a backheel which went inside the far post of the goal.
