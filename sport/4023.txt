Russian BASE jumper and climber Valery Rozov became the first person to jump from over 22,060 feet off the 22,200-foot-high Huascar√°n, the highest mountain in Peru. It took the 52-year-old and his team five days to climb the south summit of the mountain, from where he took the plunge. Rozov spent nearly 1.5 minutes without a parachute in his wingsuit.
