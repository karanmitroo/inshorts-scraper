Sourav Ganguly has said India shouldn't expect spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to consistently take five-wicket hauls. "If Anil Kumble gets Shami, Yadav and Ishant to pick three wickets on the first day, India will become a better side...Ashwin, Jadeja might take five wickets once or twice, but it is impossible for them to do it consistently," said Ganguly.
