Football teams from USA and Mexico will play a football tournament to protest US President Donald Trump's proposed US-Mexico border wall. No dates have yet been announced for the tournament, which has been named 'The Bridge Tournament'. The event would pit three teams from each nation, with one of the participating clubs recently calling for "football above walls" on Twitter.
