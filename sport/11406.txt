Pakistan Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq has opened up about his last-over dismissal in the 2007 World T20 final, saying “there was regret”. Talking about the scoop shot he played off Joginder Sharma’s bowling, caught by Sreesanth which won India the T20 World Cup, Misbah said, “I don’t know how many boundaries I scored with that execution…sometimes your execution can go wrong.”
