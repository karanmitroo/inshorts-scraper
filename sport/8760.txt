German footballer Toni Kroos trolled Brazil with his New Year wish on Twitter. The midfielder replaced the '1' and '7' in 2017 with the flags of Brazil and Germany respectively, referring to Brazil's 7-1 loss in the 2014 WC semifinal. Brazil's Ronaldo hit back at Kroos with a similar post referring to Germany's 2-0 loss in the 2002 WC final.
