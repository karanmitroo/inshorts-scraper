Indian captain Virat Kohli applauded and cheered after he was impressed by Ashish Nehra using his foot to field a ball in his final international match on Wednesday. The 38-year-old pacer stopped the ball using his right foot, making it bounce and then plucked it using his right hand before throwing it towards the keeper.
