Hotstar's video of the top six goals in PL's game week 26, which ended on Sunday, was topped by Paul Pogba's long-ranged volley against Swansea City. The video also included PL's 25,000th goal, scored by Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Chelsea's Eden Hazard's solo effort against Everton was rated the week's second-best goal, ahead of Connor Wickham and Victor Anichebe's strikes.
