The reinstated cheerleaders for a seventh-tier English football team were dubbed 'lucky charms' after the team won 3-1 against Premier League side West Ham. The cheerleaders were making a return to the team after being fired. The team owner had fired them as he thought they would distract his side after one of them sent her number to a player.
