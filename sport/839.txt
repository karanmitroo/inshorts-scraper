Former cricketer Mohammad Yousuf has said Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed should seek MS Dhoni's advice to get back his fitness and form. "Dhoni led India admirably in all formats for a long time...Nothing wrong in giving Dhoni a call and chatting with him," he said. This comes after Ahmed scored just 79 runs in five ODIs against New Zealand.
