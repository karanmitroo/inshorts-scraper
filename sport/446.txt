With the derby match against Manchester City poised at 1-1 and 12 minutes remaining, the then Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney scored the winner with a bicycle kick on February 12, 2011. Rooney's back was facing the goal when he leapt five feet in the air and sent Nani's curling cross into the top right-hand corner of the goal.
