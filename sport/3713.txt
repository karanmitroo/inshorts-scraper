English cricketer Ben Duckett trolled spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after the Professional Cricketers' Association tweeted a welcome note for the latter who will represent Worcestershire in county cricket. Northamptonshire's Duckett referred to the missed chance to score heavily against Ashwin, as Northamptonshire have already played their two matches against the Indian spinner's team.
