Marylebone Cricket Club, cricket's rule-making body, approved new rules including giving umpires the power to eject misbehaving players, alongside using bails tethered to the stumps to protect wicketkeepers from eye injuries. The tethered bails will restrict the distance that they can fly off the stumps but will not affect their ability to be dislodged.
