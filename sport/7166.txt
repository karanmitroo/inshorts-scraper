Olympic bronze-winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt trolled student Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of a Kargil war martyr, for her comments on the ABVP issue at Delhi University. After Gurmehar posted a picture of herself with the caption, "Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him," Dutt posted a meme with different pictures, including those of Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden.
