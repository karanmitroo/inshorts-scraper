Ex-Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne has said both Virat Kohli and Steve Smith are the number one Test batsmen for him. "It's hard to split Kohli and Smith for title of No.1 Test batsmen...and the best players like the battle and are super competitive," Warne said. Smith is currently the top-ranked Test batsman, while Kohli tops the T20I and ODI charts.
