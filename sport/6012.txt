Fiji's government has released two million new $7 legal tender notes featuring the country's rugby sevens team, which won the gold medal at last year's Rio Olympics. The government also released one million 50-cent coins with the image of Ben Ryan, the team's England-born coach, on one side, and Fiji players hoisting the Olympic trophy on the other.
