India's lone individual Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra tweeted on Tuesday that he "hated" his coach but stuck with him for 20 years since he was his biggest teacher. Bindra's tweet came after Anil Kumble stepped down as head coach of the Indian cricket team. In a statement, Kumble had blamed his exit on differences with captain Virat Kohli.
