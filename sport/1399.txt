Former cricketer and Rajya Sabha MP Sachin Tendulkar's first speech in Parliament was disrupted by Opposition members sloganeering over PM Modi's remarks on former PM Manmohan Singh. Tendulkar, who was nominated to the House in 2012, was to speak on the dismal condition of sports education and facilities available in India. The House was adjourned until 11 AM on Friday.
