Former World number four Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro won the ATP Stockholm Open after defeating American Jack Sock 7-5, 6-1 in the final. This was the Argentine's first title after 34 months, his last title being at Sydney in 2014. Del Potro returned to action in February 2016 after almost a year's layoff due to recurring wrist injuries.
