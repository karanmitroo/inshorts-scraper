Sachin Tendulkar became the first player in cricket to be given out by a third umpire when he was adjudged run-out by TV umpire Karl Liebenberg on November 14, 1992. South African fielder Jonty Rhodes, fielding at point, threw the ball towards the stumps as Sachin attempted a risky single but was sent back by the non-striker, Ravi Shastri.
