Cricket was one of the sports in the 1900 Olympic Games held in France. Four teams were scheduled to compete in the tournament, but Belgium and Netherlands pulled out, and Great Britain beat France in the only match played to win the gold medal. Notably, Cricket has never featured in Olympics again since then.
