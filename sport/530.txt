Englishman Richard Stokes was just 10 years old when he accompanied his father to the 1956 Ashes Test at Old Trafford, where Jim Laker took Test cricket's first-ever 10-wicket haul. On February 7, 1999, Stokes, who was working in India, was also present at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi when Anil Kumble took all 10 wickets against Pakistan.
