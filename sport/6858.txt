Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, who was removed from commentary duties by the BCCI before IPL 2016, will reportedly make a return to the broadcast team as an expert panelist for this year's IPL. Bhogle's fall-out with the BCCI and senior players is believed to be the reason behind his sacking last year. However, he was not given any formal reason.
