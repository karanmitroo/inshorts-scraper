Saudi Arabia has invited women to a sports stadium for the first time to attend the kingdom's 87th National Day celebrations with their families. This marks a shift from previous celebrations in the kingdom where women are effectively barred from sports arenas. Saudi Arabia has strict restrictions for women, including barring them from driving.
