In a letter to BCCI members, President Anurag Thakur has objected to the Lodha Panel calling the IPL an 'extravaganza'. "The IPL seems to be a lesser priority event ("extravaganza") compared to other national and international events," wrote Thakur. He also mentioned the IPL is the most-watched cricket league globally and the sixth most popular sports league in the world.
