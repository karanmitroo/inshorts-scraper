Following the Court of Arbitration for Sport's order reducing Maria Sharapova's doping ban, the tennis player posted a message on Facebook. "I've gone from one of the toughest days of my career last March... to now, one of my happiest days... I'm coming back soon and I can't wait," wrote Sharapova, who is now eligible to play from April 2017.
