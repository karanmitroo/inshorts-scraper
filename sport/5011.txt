Responding to Virender Sehwag's 'Baap Baap Hota Hai' jibe at Pakistan after their loss to India, former Pakistani player Rashid Latif has responded with a 15-minute video on Facebook. "I respect Indian players like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Ravi Shastri, Ajay Jadeja but I do not know where you've come from," Rashid said about Sehwag.
