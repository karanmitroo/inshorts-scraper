Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra and former Australian cricketer Dean Jones were involved in a banter on Twitter over India's upcoming series against Australia. "I'm expecting Bangladesh to be more competitive than Australia in these conditions," part of Chopra's tweet read, to which Jones responded with a tweet that read, "Be afraid Aakash... be very afraid."
