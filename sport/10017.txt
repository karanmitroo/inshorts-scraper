The BCCI has decided to scrap the practice of the captain's report following the end of each domestic match. The match referees will now be the only ones giving the post-match reports according to the BCCI. "It has been done to eliminate any emotion in the reports. A captain can have bias or grudge against the umpire", an official said.
