Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade on Friday scored his maiden ODI century against Pakistan in Brisbane, becoming the first Australian wicketkeeper to score a century in 7 years. The previous hundred by an Aussie wicketkeeper was scored in March 2010 by Brad Haddin. Wade also became only the fourth Australian wicketkeeper to score a ton in 46-year history of ODI cricket.
