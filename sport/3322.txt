As many as 12 people were injured after a race car fired burning fuel into the crowd during a burnout at a racing event in Alice Springs in Australia. The car was skidding in circles when fuel was ignited and flames were thrown over the fans. The incident at the Red Centre Nats motoring festival is being investigated by police.
