Vogue Brasil has photoshopped able-bodied models to look like Paralympians Bruna Alexandre and Renato Leite in a campaign to promote the upcoming Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. While an arm of model Cleo Pires was removed using photoshop to make her look like Bruna, Paulo Vilhena's leg was photoshopped to look like Renato's prosthetic leg.
