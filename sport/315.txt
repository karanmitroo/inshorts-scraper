New Zealand and Chennai Super Kings spinner Mitchell Santner said he is glad that he will be bowling to Indian cricketer MS Dhoni in the nets instead of bowling at him in a match. Santner, who will be playing in his maiden IPL season, was bought by the Chennai-based franchise last month at his base price of â‚¹50 lakh.
