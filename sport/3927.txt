Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who is aiming to win his 12th world championship in London before retiring from the sport, wore shoes that had "FOREVER FASTEST" written on them. Users reacted to the inscription on the shoes with tweets like, "If found, please return to..." and "If you can read this, I'm probably not running very fast".
