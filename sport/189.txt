After a fan club shared a tweet detailing Sachin Tendulkar's achievements on the 24th date, the former cricketer said, "Didn't realise it until now but the 24th is a lucky date for me. Those memories will forever be etched in my heart." Interestingly, Tendulkar, who scored ODIs' first double hundred on February 24, 2010, played international cricket for 24 years.
