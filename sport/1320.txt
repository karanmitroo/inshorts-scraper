England and Tottenham striker Harry Kane on Tuesday netted his 39th Premier League goal this year to break retired forward Alan Shearer's 22-year-old record of 36 goals in the English top flight in a calendar year. Kane, who scored back to back hat-tricks, now has 56 goals for club and country in 2017, taking him ahead of Lionel Messi's 54.
