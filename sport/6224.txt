French Davis Cup doubles player, Nicolas Mahut played a shot from the stands during France's World Group Quarterfinals doubles match against Great Britain on Sunday. Chasing a shot, Mahut jumped past the court-side ad boards and into the stands, from where he played another shot to continue the rally. Britain returned Mahut's shot into the court left empty by him.
