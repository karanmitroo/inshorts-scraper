Footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic announced his return to Manchester United by tweeting a picture of himself as an angel arm-wrestling Satan, captioned, "I UNITED it". Ibrahimovic has signed a one-year contract and will be wearing the number 10 jersey. The 35-year-old was released by United after rupturing knee ligaments in the team's Europa League quarter-final match earlier this year.
