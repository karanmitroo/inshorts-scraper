Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who took four wickets against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, has become the highest T20I wicket-taker in 2017. Chahal took 19 T20I wickets this year, surpassing Afghanistan's Rashid Khan and Windies' Kesrick Williams, who have 17 wickets each. Chahal's 6/25 against England in February are T20Is' best bowling figures this year and the best-ever by an Indian.
