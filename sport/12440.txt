Indian Test captain Virat Kohli scored the maiden double century of his career in the first Test against West Indies on Friday. Interestingly, Kohli had never scored a double century in his first-class career either, with his first-class best being 197. Moreover, this is the first instance of an Indian captain scoring a double century on foreign soil.
