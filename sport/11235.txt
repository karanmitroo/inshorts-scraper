South Africa's captain AB de Villiers has been ruled out of the five-match-long home ODI series against Australia and the three-match-long Test tour to Australia due to an elbow injury. The 32-year-old will undergo surgery next week and will need eight to ten weeks to recover. South Africa's management is hopeful that he will be back to face Sri Lanka.
