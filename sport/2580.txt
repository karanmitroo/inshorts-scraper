Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli, who led All Heart FC in a celebrity football match against Bollywood stars, performed Bhangra after scoring his side's sixth goal. Kohli chipped the ball over the goalkeeper's head to help his side regain the three-goal advantage and started doing bhangra when a Punjabi song was played.
