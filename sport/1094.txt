Yusuf Pathan has been handed a five-month back-dated suspension by the BCCI for testing positive for a banned substance during a domestic T20 competition in March last year. The suspension will run retrospectively from August 15 last year, and will expire on January 14. Yusuf inadvertently ingested a prohibited substance Terbutaline, which can be commonly found in cough syrups.
