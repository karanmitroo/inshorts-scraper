Visakhapatnam pitch curator Kasturi Sriram has claimed that the wicket in the second Test match will not have any grass and will start turning from the second day of the match. This comes after the Indian spinners struggled to make an impact in the drawn first test match. Notably, Visakhapatnam will debut as a Test cricket venue on November 17.
