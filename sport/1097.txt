Australia reclaimed the Ashes with a 4-0 series win after England were beaten by an innings and 123 runs on Monday. This was the Aussies' 33rd Ashes series win, eclipsing England's 32 wins in 70 series played so far. Notably, Australia became the first team in the history of Test cricket to have only four wicket-takers in a 5-match series.
