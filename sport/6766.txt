Australian captain Steve Smith was wrongly accused of mocking Virat Kohli's shoulder injury after his dismissal in the 3rd Test by VVS Laxman and the match commentators. A photograph which surfaced on social media showed that it was Peter Handscomb's hand on Smith's left shoulder while embracing him during the celebrations that was mistakenly assumed to be Smith's mocking gesture.
