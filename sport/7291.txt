Sachin Tendulkar and Chris Gayle scored their respective ODI double hundreds on 24 February, five years apart. While Sachin's 200* against South Africa in 2010 was the first double hundred in men's ODI cricket, Gayle's 215 against Zimbabwe in 2015 was the first 200-plus score in a World Cup match. Gayle's double hundred is also the fastest for any batsman.
