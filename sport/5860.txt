Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova won her first match following her 15-month-long doping ban, defeating Italy's Roberta Vinci 7-5, 6-3 in the Stuttgart Open on Wednesday. "It's the best feeling... those seconds before you enter the arena... I spent a long time without hitting any balls," the 30-year-old said. Sharapova was suspended in March 2016 for testing positive for meldonium.
