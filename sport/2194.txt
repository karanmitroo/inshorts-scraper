Australian pacer Mitchell Starc became the first bowler in 39 years to take two hat-tricks in the same match, registering his second hat-trick for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield on Tuesday. Starc is now the eighth first-class player to achieve the feat. The 27-year-old returned after a foot injury, taking 10 wickets in his other game after returning.
