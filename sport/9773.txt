England captain Alastair Cook has said Virat Kohli's knocks proved to be the difference in the Vizag Test, which the visitors lost by 246 runs. "If you took Virat's runs out of the game...I know you can't do that...but we've put their batters under...pressure...We could have played more aggressively and lost by 150 runs or so," said Cook.
