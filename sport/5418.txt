A blackmailer threatened to kill former F1 racer Michael Schumacher's son Mick, who races in Formula Three, in a crash if a ransom of $1 million (â‚¹6.5 crore) was not paid. The man, who emailed the threats to Schumacher's wife Corinna, also named Schumacher's 20-year-old daughter. The man was caught through the bank details he mentioned in the email.
