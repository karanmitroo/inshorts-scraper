Sunderland player Duncan Watmore recently saved the lives of three people after being involved in a boat crash in Barbados. The 23-year-old English player and his girlfriend were riding a speedboat when it was rammed into by another boat, sending them overboard. Watmore managed to help three other passengers climb out of the water, giving coastguards time to rescue them.
