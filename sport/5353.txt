Indian coach Anil Kumble has reportedly proposed a 150% salary hike for players who have been given Grade A contracts by BCCI. The suggested hike will take their salary to ₹5 crore per annum, after BCCI doubled the pay from ₹1 crore to ₹2 crore earlier. Seven players, including Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni and Ravichandran Ashwin, have Grade A contracts.
