Sri Lanka registered their first win of the South Africa tour after beating the hosts by three wickets in the second T20I. Chasing 114, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews twisted his ankle with seven balls left and another eight runs needed. Mathews sealed his team's win with two sixes in the final over as he refused to take singles.
