Chip-installed bats are being used for the first time in Champions Trophy, which will collect data about stroke-play to assist players in improving their game. The chips, developed by Intel, measure the bat speed, angles, back lift and path to know whether they are playing straight or across the line. The technology is already being used in golf and baseball.
