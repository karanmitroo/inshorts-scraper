A six-year-old F1 fan, who cried in the stands after Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen crashed out during the Spanish Grand Prix, met the driver after the race on Sunday. Television cameras had shown the boy crying as Räikkönen retired in the first lap. Ferrari officials then took him to the paddock, where Räikkönen gifted the boy a pair of racing shoes.
