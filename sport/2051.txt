Sri Lankan pacer Suranga Lakmal became the first bowler in 16 years to bowl seven straight maidens before conceding a run in a Test match. Lakmal conceded his first run after bowling 46 straight dot balls. The Sri Lankan record for most consecutive maiden overs is by Chaminda Vaas, who bowled 11 consecutive maidens against India at Chepauk in 2005.
