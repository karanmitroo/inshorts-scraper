World football-governing body FIFA has banned Ghanian referee Joseph Odartei Lamptey after he was found guilty of influencing the result of a World Cup qualifier between South Africa and Senegal in November last year. South Africa won 2-1, with their first goal coming through a penalty which was awarded for a handball despite the ball hitting a defender's leg.
