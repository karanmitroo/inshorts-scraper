Ousted BCCI President Anurag Thakur on Saturday was unanimously elected head of the Himachal Pradesh Olympic Association (HPOA) for a four-year term. Thakur had to step down as BCCI President owing to the Supreme Court ruling on Lodha Committee reforms. "The newly-elected members deliberated on how to improve the quality of sports in the state," said HPOA in a statement.
