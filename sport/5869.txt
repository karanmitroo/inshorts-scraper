Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard has called for a life ban on Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova who had tested positive for meldonium and has returned to tennis after serving her 15-month suspension. "I just think the WTA sends the wrong message to young kids, you know, cheat and we'll welcome you back with open arms", Bouchard said.
