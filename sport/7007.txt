Virat Kohli complained to on-field umpire Nigel Llong after Australian captain Steve Smith consulted the dressing room on whether he should review his dismissal or not. Smith was given leg before on an Umesh Yadav delivery when he turned towards the dressing room, before Llong stopped him. According to rules, a review can only be discussed with the non-striker.
