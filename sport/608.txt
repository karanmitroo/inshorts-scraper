Big Bash League side Melbourne Renegades' wicketkeeper Tim Ludeman pulled off a one-handed leaping catch to dismiss Adelaide Strikers' Colin Ingram for one run in the second semi-final on Friday. Ingram tried to hook the ball and got a top edge before Ludeman leapt high and plucked the ball with his right hand. Ingram got out for 1(2).
