Former Australian rugby player Beau Ryan travelled about 120 kilometres to Sydney to meet a fan battling cancer.The cancer patient had "roughly four hours to live", according to a Facebook post by her friend, who made the request to the rugby player to come and "boost" her up. Ryan responded to the request within half an hour of the post.
