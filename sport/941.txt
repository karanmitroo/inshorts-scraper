Virat Kohli got into a spat with a journalist who questioned his "lack of consistency" in selecting the team, noting that India fielded a different playing XI in each Test under him. Kohli asked him how many Tests had India won to which the reporter said, "How many in India?" Kohli then replied, "Doesn't matter...I'm here to answer...not to fight."
