West Indies opener Chris Gayle is the only batsman to smash a six off the first ball of a test match. Gayle achieved the feat against Bangladesh in Mirpur in November 2012, when he smashed 18 in the first over, which was bowled by debutant off-spinner Sohag Gazi. Notably, Gayle is the third highest six-hitter in Tests with 98 sixes.
