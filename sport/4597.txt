The Japanese government is working on a plan to use large cruise ships as "hotel ships" to ensure sufficient lodging options for guests during the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. A ship, which could accommodate 4,000 people, was used as a place for visitors to stay during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
