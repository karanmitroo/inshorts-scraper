American Airlines has apologized to two professional African-American basketball players who were kicked off a domestic flight after being falsely accused of theft. Marquis Teague and Trahson Burrell were forced off the plane after a flight attendant accused them of taking blankets from first-class. The two athletes who play in NBA's minor league were later flown first-class to their destination.
