Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has claimed that RCB captain Virat Kohli has done "next to nothing this season", and that he is one of the major reasons for RCB's poor performance in IPL 2017. Ponting further added that the absence of Indian top-order batsman KL Rahul has also been a major factor for RCB's poor IPL season.
