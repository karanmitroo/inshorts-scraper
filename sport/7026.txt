Indian wicket keeper Wriddhiman Saha took a diving catch at short leg to dismiss Matthew Wade off Ravichandran Ashwin's bowling in the final over before the fourth day's lunch. Wade, trying to play along the ball's turn, inside edged the ball which looped towards the vacant short leg position before Saha jumped and took the catch full stretch.
