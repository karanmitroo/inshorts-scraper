A Sri Lankan cricket fan managed to get past security and disrupted India's practice session to take a selfie with MS Dhoni. The fan reportedly first went to Rohit Sharma, mistaking him for Dhoni and was pointed towards the area where Dhoni was practicing. The fan took a selfie, and was escorted out of the area by Indian support staff.
