Union Minister Ramdas Athawale has demanded reservations for the SC-ST community in the Indian cricket team. "There is no harm in giving a 25% reservation to these two categories," Athawale said. The minister also reckoned that the reservation for these categories could have ensured a better performance from the Indian team against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy 2017 final.
