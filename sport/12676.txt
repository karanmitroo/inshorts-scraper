British Airways (BA) apologised to India coach Anil Kumble, after misplacing his luggage at London's Gatwick Airport. BA tweeted, “We're sorry your bags are 'not out' to St Kitts! They have been 'caught behind' your flight from Gatwick. We are looking to 'bowl' you over with our service recovery.” A user tweeted in reply, “They should be in 'perfect-10' condition."
