Mateen Sharif, the spectator who took a single-handed catch during Pakistan's 5th ODI against England on Monday, has been awarded a free trip to Australia by one of the series' sponsors. Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed hit Chris Woakes for a six over deep midwicket, which was caught by Sharif by leaning over the advertising hoardings near the boundary.
