Sourav Ganguly and Shane Warne placed a bet on the upcoming England-Australia Champions Trophy clash on June 10. While Ganguly said England are the better team, Warne rooted for Australia. Warne then said that Ganguly would have to wear the Australia jersey and buy him dinner if Australia won, while he would do the same for Ganguly if England won.
