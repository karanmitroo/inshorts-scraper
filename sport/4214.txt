After replacing Anil Kumble as the Indian cricket team's head coach, Ravi Shastri said "Shastris and Kumbles will come and go", but fabric of the team remains. "I've matured a lot in the last two weeks...I don't come with any baggage. The team has done exceedingly well in the last three years, they're the people who deserve credit," said Shastri.
