The pre-tournament odds of a pair of Australian Open finals between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in men's category and the Williams sisters in women's category were 1-in-5000. The last time the four players featured in the finals of the same Grand Slam happened in the 2008 Wimbledon tournament. Moreover, Federer was the 17th seeded player in the tournament.
