Former Indian Premier League side Chennai Super Kings will remain banned after the Supreme  Court quashed BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's petition asking for dismissal of the ban imposed on the side. CSK, alongside Rajasthan Royals, had been banned for a period of two years following their involvement in the 2013 spot-fixing scandal and not featured in the tournament since.
