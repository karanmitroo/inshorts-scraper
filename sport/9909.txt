Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland has said that the media should direct the blame towards the Australian cricketers for the latest series loss to South Africa. "It’s not the board’s failure, it’s the players themselves who should shoulder the blame,” said Sutherland. Steve Smith has admitted that it was the players who let everybody down.
