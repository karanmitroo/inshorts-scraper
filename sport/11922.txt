The recently-concluded fourth Test between India and West Indies at Port of Spain was the fifth-shortest Test ever in terms of balls bowled. There were 132 balls bowled in the entire Test, with not a single ball being bowled after the first session on Day 1. Notably, three of the five shortest Tests ever have been played in West Indies.
