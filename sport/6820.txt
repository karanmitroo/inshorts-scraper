Australian captain Steve Smith visited a sports equipment-manufacturing factory in Jalandhar recently and took bats and cricketing gear for the remainder of the team's India tour. Smith reportedly spent six hours at the factory seeing the manufacturing process, before taking three bats, gloves and leg guards. The factory has reportedly been making Smith's bats for the past three years.
