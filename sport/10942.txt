Real Madrid is set to begin a $440 million revamp of their home ground Santiago Bernab√©u after the plans for the same were approved. The plans, which were initially submitted in 2014, include a retractable roof and a light show display on the arena's exterior surface. The stadium was last renovated in 1982 for the World Cup.
