Swiss tennis ace Roger Federer thanked his rival Rafael Nadal after winning the Laureus Sportsman of the Year award on Tuesday. "(Nadal) had an unbelievable year himself. We had a great battle and it's because of a guy like him, I think I am a better player," Federer said. Federer and Nadal won two Grand Slams each last year.
