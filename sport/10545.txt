Australian bowler Mitchell Johnson has revealed in his autobiography that he "felt sick" after a bouncer hit Virat Kohli's helmet in the 2014 Adelaide Test, which was held shortly after Australian cricketer Phil Hughes' death. "It was my job...to make batsmen play from the fear of being hit...I questioned all of that. I couldn't drop short with conviction," wrote Johnson.
