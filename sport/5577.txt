Kings XI Punjab's Kiwi player Martin Guptill took a single-handed catch at the boundary to dismiss Mumbai Indians' Lendl Simmons on Thursday. Simmons hit a lofted shot off Glenn Maxwell's bowling towards the long-on boundary where Guptill jumped and took the catch with his outstretched right hand. Notably, Maxwell's delivery was just short of being a no-ball.
