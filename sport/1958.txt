Cheteshwar Pujara has become the third Indian and ninth overall batsman in history to bat on all five days of a Test, achieving the feat in the first Test against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens. Before Pujara, former Indian cricketers ML Jaisimha and Ravi Shastri had achieved the feat, both of whom did so at the Eden Gardens.
