Dutchman Frank de Boer has been sacked as Premier League side Crystal Palace's manager after just four matches and 77 days in charge, becoming the shortest serving Premier League manager in history. Boer's dismissal comes after Crystal Palace became the first team in 93 years to lose their first four Premier League games without scoring a goal.
