Curling, also known as chess on ice, is a strategic sport which is played on "pebbled ice" surface. Teams take turns sliding 19-kg granite rocks towards a marked target area on the surface. The rocks are accompanied by two sweepers who use brooms to alter the state of the ice to determine the direction of the stone.
