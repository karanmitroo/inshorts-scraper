Neymar, Barcelona FC, and Santos FC will stand trial on fraud and corruption charges after their appeals were turned down by Spain's high court. The case stems from a complaint by a Brazilian investment group which owned part of Neymar's transfer rights and alleges that it received less money than it was entitled to when Neymar joined Barcelona from Santos.
