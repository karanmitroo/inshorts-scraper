Indian Super League side Delhi Dynamos' coach Miguel Angel Portugal revealed that the team had to practice with masks on due to the smog plaguing the National Capital Region. "It's a problem. We trained wearing masks. That is a problem not only for players but for the people as well," Miguel said about the conditions.
