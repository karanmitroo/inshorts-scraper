India did not lose a review despite Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell's leg-before DRS appeal being unsuccessful during the Ranchi Test on Thursday. Bowler Ishant Sharma had overstepped with the on-field umpire not giving the no-ball, and also turning down a subsequent LBW appeal. India sought a review with the third umpire calling the delivery illegal and saving the review.
