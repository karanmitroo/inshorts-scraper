The Rio Paralympic Games medals have been fitted with a sound device, which will help blind athletes identify the colour of their medal. A device containing steel balls has been put in the medals which will disseminate sounds of different intensity based on the colour. Moreover, the words 'Rio 2016 Paralympic Gamesâ€™ have been engraved in Braille on the medals.
