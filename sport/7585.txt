Former India captain Sourav Ganguly predicts that the visiting Australian side could face a 0-4 humiliation in the four-match Test series against India, scheduled to start from February 23. "It's hard to beat India in India. There couldn't have been a much stronger team which came to India than the 2001 Australian side. And they couldn't win it," Ganguly said.
