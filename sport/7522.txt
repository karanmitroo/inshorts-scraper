Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Shaharyar Khan has said the PCB incurred losses amounting to $200 million (â‚¹1339 crore) because of India's refusal to tour the country. Khan said PCB was waiting for ICC to adopt its new constitution in April, after which they would take up the matter with a disputes resolution committee. BCCI blamed the refusal on government's non-clearance.
