BCCI has approached the Supreme Court asking for permission to release funds so that the India-England Test starting tomorrow can be held as per schedule. BCCI counsel Kapil Sibal said the match risked being cancelled if the disbursal of funds was disallowed. Due to restrictions imposed by the Lodha Committee, BCCI is unable to enter into any contracts with vendors.
