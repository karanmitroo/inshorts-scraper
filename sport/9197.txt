England pacer James Anderson has been ruled out of the final Test against India at Chennai, following "body soreness". Captain Alastair Cook said even though Anderson "could get through" the Test, they didn't want to "take any chances". Anderson, who has missed five Tests for England this year, could be replaced by Stuart Broad or spinner Liam Dawson.
