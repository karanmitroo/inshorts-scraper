Speaking after his match-winning performance against India, Australian spinner Steve O'Keefe said the two important things that he did in order to be successful were not playing the Big Bash League and totally laying off alcohol. O'Keefe gave up alcohol after he was involved in a drunken incident in a night club last year when he was fined AUD 10,000.
