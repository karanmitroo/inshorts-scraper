Virat Kohli equalled the record for the most double centuries by a captain in Tests, after smashing his fifth double ton against Sri Lanka on Sunday. Kohli joined former Windies' captain Brian Lara at the top, overtaking Don Bradman, Graeme Smith and Michael Clarke, who had scored four each. Kohli's last double ton came against Bangladesh in February at Hyderabad.
