Kolkata Knight Riders player Sunil Narine scored the joint-fastest fifty in IPL history, reaching the milestone off 15 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bengaluru on Sunday. Narine equalled teammate Yusuf Pathan's record, scored against Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014. Narine, primarily an off-spinner who was opening for KKR, hit four sixes to bring up his first-ever fifty in any format.
