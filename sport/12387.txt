USA's 555-member strong contingent for the Rio Olympics includes 292 females, making it the largest-ever women's contingent in Olympic history. The previous largest women's contingent at an Olympic event was China's 289-member strong female squad at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Notably, this is the second time where an American Olympic contingent has featured more females than males.
