MS Dhoni practiced pace bowling in the nets ahead of the ODI against England in Pune on Sunday. Dhoni bowled a few deliveries to Manish Pandey and even celebrated when the batsman missed a shot. As a bowler, Dhoni has claimed one wicket in his international career, bowling out West Indies' Travis Dowlin in the Champions Trophy in 2009.
