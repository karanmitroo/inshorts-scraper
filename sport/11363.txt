Rio Olympics bronze medalist Sakshi Malik has said India’s Paralympians aren't neglected and are being given equal importance as the Olympians. “The government is also doing a lot for them. I have heard (Paralympics silver medalist) Deepa Malik is being honoured more than me,” Sakshi added. India won two medals at Rio Olympics and four at Paralympics, including two golds.
