Windies batsman Evin Lewis on Wednesday broke international cricket's oldest standing record across formats, set in the first-ever Test in 1877, registering the highest score by a batsman retired hurt. The 25-year-old smashed his own foot after scoring 176* against England in the fourth ODI, surpassing Australian Charles Bannerman's record of 165 runs from the first-ever Test 140 years ago.
