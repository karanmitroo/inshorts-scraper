The ICC's Chief Executives' Committee has approved the recommendations made by the council's cricket committee, following which teams will not lose their DRS reviews on an 'umpire's call' verdict in LBWs. Additionally, the 80-over top-up of reviews in Test cricket has been removed, while DRS will now also be available in T20Is. The new regulations will be effective October 1.
