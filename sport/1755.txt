Hardik Pandya has revealed that Windies' Kieron Pollard tried to get him arrested as a prank during India's tour of Windies earlier this year. Pandya said Pollard called his policeman friend, who tried to arrest him and "things got a little serious". Pandya added he realised it was a prank when the policeman called someone using the phone upside down.
