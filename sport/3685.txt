MS Dhoni spoke about the captain-coach relationship during a session organised at the National Cricket Academy on Wednesday. The session was attended by a number of Indian coaches and six mentors from Australia, including former Australian pacer Jason Gillespie. "It was excellent listening to both MSD and Kedar. They spoke about the importance of confidence and simplicity," wrote Gillespie.
