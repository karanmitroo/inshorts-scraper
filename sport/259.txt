Australia's Chris Lynn dislocated his right shoulder while trying to protect his injury-prone left shoulder during the Trans Tasman tri-series final on Wednesday. The incident occurred in New Zealand innings' ninth over when Lynn dived and reached for the ball with his right arm. Lynn had undergone a surgery to have his left shoulder reconstructed last year.
