Kerala all-rounder Jalaj Saxena became only the third cricketer and the first in over three decades to smash a hundred and pick up an 8-wicket innings haul in a same Indian first-class match. Saxena achieved the feat in Kerala's Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan on Thursday by notching a second-innings ton after having taken 8/85 in the first innings.
