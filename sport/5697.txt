Kings XI Punjab co-owner Preity Zinta has said she quit Bollywood to devote time to the IPL franchise she bought in 2008. "This is my first venture that I believed in and it's like my baby...After winning my first Filmfare award, people asked me what would I do after ten years and I said, 'I'll be doing business'," said Preity.
