A Premier League playoff would be held if Liverpool, Arsenal or Manchester City finish with identical results. City and Liverpool would play for third if City draw 3-3 while Liverpool win 3-0. If Arsenal draw 1-1 and Liverpool lose 2-0, the two will play for fourth, while a City-Arsenal playoff is likely if City lose 0-4 and Arsenal win 1-0.
