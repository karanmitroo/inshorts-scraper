Chess grandmaster Dorsa Derakhshani was banned by Iran for not wearing a hijab at the Gibraltar Chess Festival 2017. Dorsa's 15-year-old brother was also banned for playing a chess match against Israel. "The first step in dealing with them would be to deprive them of every game played in Iran and in the name of Iran," said an Iranian official.
