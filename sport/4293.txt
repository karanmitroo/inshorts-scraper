At least eight people were killed and over 45 injured in a stampede and a subsequent wall collapse during a local football league final in Senegal's capital Dakar. Police used tear gas which created panic and led to the stampede, after a fight had broken out between rival fans at the final whistle. Fans were reportedly throwing projectiles at others.
