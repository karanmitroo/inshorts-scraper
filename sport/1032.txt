Barcelona used "Swamiye Ayyappo, Ayyappo Swamiye", a South Indian Hindu devotional song, in the introduction video for their record signing, Philippe Coutinho, on Twitter. Reacting to the video, which features a remix version of the devotional song, a user tweeted, "@FCBarcelona did you give this clip to any Indian freelancer to edit it."
