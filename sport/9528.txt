The first wicket in ODI cricket was taken by Australian pacer Alan Thomson, who dismissed Geoff Boycott in the first-ever one-day match in 1971. The match was Thomson's only one-day appearance and the pacer finished his ODI career with a single wicket to his name. Known for bowling off the wrong foot, Thomson was born on December 2, 1945.
