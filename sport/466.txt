A structure dubbed as the darkest building on Earth has been unveiled at the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea.  It has been sprayed with Vantablack Vbx2, a super-black material that absorbs more than 99% of the light that hits its surface. The building is a pavilion for car giant Hyundai and has been designed by British architect Asif Khan.
