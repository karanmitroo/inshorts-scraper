Former Brazil football player Pel√© has started using a metal-framed walker to get around these days, which his agent compares to having a new piece of "sporting equipment". His agent Jose Fornos said, "He is calling this his new soccer shoes with wheels." Notably, the three-time FIFA World Cup-winner had undergone a hip replacement surgery almost a year ago.
