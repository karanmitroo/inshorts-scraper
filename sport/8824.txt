Russia's Sergey Karjakin pipped Norway's Magnus Carlsen on the basis of a better tiebreak record to win the World Blitz Chess Championship title in Doha, Qatar, on Friday. Karjakin, who lost his Classical Chess World Championship match to Carlsen last month, ended at par with Carlsen, but was awarded the title for having better individual results between the two.
