Cricket Association of Bengal President Sourav Ganguly has been accused of showing bias in ticket distribution for the India-England ODI at Eden Gardens on January 22. Former CAB treasurer Biswarup Dey alleged Ganguly had denied him his quota of complimentary tickets and demanded a reply. Ganguly refuted the allegations, saying, "He always takes about 200 to 300 tickets from me."
