Former cricketer Virender Sehwag has revealed he paused his second triple century, scored against South Africa in 2008, to remember the lyrics of a song. "I was batting in Chennai on 300...I called Ishant Sharma, the 12th man, and told him to get the lyrics of the song "Tu Jaane Na" from my iPod, and he did that," said Sehwag.
