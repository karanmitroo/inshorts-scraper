Former Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho and ex-Argentine midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme have offered to come out of their retirements to play for Chapecoense, whose players were killed in a plane crash last week. Ronaldinho's brother said no talks have yet taken place, but confirmed the two-time FIFA World Player of the Year would do "all he can to help the club".
