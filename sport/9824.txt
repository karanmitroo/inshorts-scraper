Ravichandran Ashwin had bowled just five deliveries in the 47th over of the England innings when the umpires called it 'over'. The fourth ball of the over included an unsuccessful DRS appeal, the second in consecutive overs, by India against Alastair Cook. The England captain was later dismissed on the last ball of the day's play, which also involved DRS.
