A 60-meter dash was organised between a 99-year-old and a 92-year-old at the USATF Masters Indoor Track & Field Championships in the US. The 92-year-old retired businessman took a lead in the beginning of the race but was chased by his older competitor, who eventually won the race in a photo finish, by 500ths of a second.
