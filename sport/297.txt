On February 19, 1999, Sachin Tendulkar got run-out after a collision with Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar on a Test's fourth day at Eden Gardens. The umpires took an early tea after crowd pelted Akhtar with bottles and chanted "cheat, cheat". Tendulkar pacified the crowd and play resumed, but as India were losing on the fifth day, the crowd turned violent again.
