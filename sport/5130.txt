Indian opener Ajinkya Rahane, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Tuesday, holds a black belt in karate. Rahane, who hit six fours in an over while playing against RCB in IPL 2012, is the only batsman to achieve the feat in T20s. Rahane's eight catches against Sri Lanka in 2015 is a record for most catches taken in a Test.
