Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has said that stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane's confidence has gone down and it was evident from his batting. Rahane has scored 160 runs with an average of 26.66 in the ongoing India-Australia series so far. "It's not the Rahane we have seen...he is just a bit out of the place at the moment," Ganguly added.
