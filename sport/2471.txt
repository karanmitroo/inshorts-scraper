The Delhi High Court has allowed pacer Ashish Nehra's request for a corporate box for his family and friends to watch his farewell match on November 1 at the Ferozshah Kotla Ground in Delhi. The court said the request was being granted as a "one-time measure" as Nehra would be playing his career's last international match that day.
