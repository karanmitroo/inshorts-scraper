In Wednesday's IPL match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Rising Pune Supergiant at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, the umpires were greeted by a woman who offered them apples. The woman had a basket full of apples from which she offered a couple to umpire KN Ananthapadmanabhan, who declined each time before smilingly accepting the match ball.
