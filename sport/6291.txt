Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga on Thursday claimed his fourth hat-trick in international cricket, achieving the feat in the second T20I against Bangladesh in Colombo. With this, Malinga has equalled the record of former Pakistani pacer Wasim Akram for most hat-tricks in international cricket. It was Malinga's first hat-trick in T20Is while the other three were in ODIs.
