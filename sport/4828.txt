Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has said Indian cricketers who would have refused to play against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy would have been hailed. "The entire nation wants zero relations with Pakistan irrespective of the platform. I don't want to question their patriotism...I don't want to criticise, but the Indian cricket team should have opposed the match," said Raut.
