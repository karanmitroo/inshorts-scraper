Indian Under-19 coach Rahul Dravid has said he was worried for the India Under-19 players during the IPL auction ahead of the World Cup semi-final against Pakistan. "That week during the IPL auction was a bit stressful but credit to the boys, once that was done they came back to practice and switched on," he added.
