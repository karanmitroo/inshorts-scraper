National Human Rights Commission has rejected athlete Santhi Soundarajan's human rights violation complaint against the Athletics Federation of India and Indian Olympic Association, for being late. She underwent a 'gender test' in 2006 and was stripped of her silver Asian Games medal because of hyperandrogenism. The commission said the complaint needed to be filed within a year of the violation.
