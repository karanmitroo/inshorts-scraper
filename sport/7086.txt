Australian spinner Nathan Lyon registered the best figures by an overseas bowler in India across all formats, taking 8/50 in India's first innings on Saturday. Lyon bettered former South African bowler Lance Klusener's 8/64, taken at Kolkata in 1996. Lyon, who is now Australia's leading wicket-taker against India, is also the first bowler to take three seven-wicket hauls against India.
