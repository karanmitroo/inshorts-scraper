Asafa Powell, former world record holder in 100-metre sprint, has said it's easier to break Usain Bolt's 100-metre sprint record than 200-metre. "I feel breaking the 9.58 seconds (in 100-metre) could be more likely, if at all it happens. 19.19 seconds in 200-metre is ridiculous," said Powell. Bolt broke Powell's record of 9.72 seconds at the 2009 World Athletics Championships.
