Sri Lanka's Asela Gunaratne grabbed a stump in celebration before the team actually won, during a T20I against South Africa on Wednesday. Sri Lanka needed five runs to win when Gunaratne hit a four in the last over and grabbed a stump to celebrate. He later realised the team had not won, and took a single on the next ball.
