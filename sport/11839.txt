According to a report by the Nigerian Television Authority, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, disappointed at the country's medalless Rio Olympics campaign, said, "we have wasted the country's money on these rats we call athletes." "This situation is like an impotent man who is married to five women, what is the essence?" Mugabe added.
