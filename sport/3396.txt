A county match between Surrey and Middlesex at the Oval was abandoned on Thursday after a crossbow arrow landed on the pitch while the match was underway. The bolt, which was around 18 inches long, is understood to have been fired from outside the ground. The stadium was evacuated after the incident and no injuries were reported.
