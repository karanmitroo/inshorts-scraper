The International Cricket Council (ICC) has hired a security company for a three-year period in a bid to resume international cricket in Pakistan. The security team would visit Pakistan each year, with the ICC paying them $400,000 on every visit. Notably, Sri Lanka, subject to security clearance, are expected to play at least one T20I in Lahore in September.
