The Supreme Court has barred BCCI from releasing funds to state cricket associations until all the recommendations suggested by the Lodha Panel have been implemented. In cases where money has already been distributed, the state affiliates cannot use it until an affidavit to implement the Lodha reforms is filed. The SC has postponed the next hearing till October 17.
