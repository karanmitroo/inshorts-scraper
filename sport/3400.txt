Two-time Olympic rowing champion United Kingdom's Alex Gregory tweeted a picture of his blistered hands following the premature finish of his team's expedition in the Arctic. "My hands after spending so long in wet gloves. The blisters were never bad on this Polar row, but the wet & damp seeped into the skin," Gregory wrote alongside the picture.
