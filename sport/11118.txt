Chess-boxing, a hybrid sport that combines chess and boxing, is played in many countries including India. It is fought in 11 alternating rounds of chess and boxing of three minutes each. The contest can be decided by either a checkmate or exceeding the time limit in the chess rounds, or by a knock-out or referee decision in the boxing rounds.
