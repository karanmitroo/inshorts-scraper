South African captain AB de Villiers played a left-handed hook shot off fast bowler Trent Boult during the fourth match of the recently concluded NZ-SA ODI series. De Villiers, expecting a fast ball, had flipped his bat to play a reverse sweep. Boult, however, bowled a slower delivery, which De Villiers hooked while still being in a right-handed batting stance.
