England's Chris Jordan pulled off a one-handed catch inches away from boundary rope to dismiss New Zealand's Colin de Grandhomme during the teams' T20I match on Tuesday. Colin tried to clear the long-on boundary off Adil Rashid before Jordan leapt and plucked the catch with right hand. Jordan lost his balance upon landing but managed to stay inside the rope.
