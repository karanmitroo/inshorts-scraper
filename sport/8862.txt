Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly was once held at gunpoint while travelling on the London Underground. Travelling alongside Navjot Singh Sidhu, Ganguly got involved in a scuffle with some drunk youngsters. One of the youngsters pointed a gun at Ganguly after getting pushed to the ground by him, only to be dissuaded by a girl in the group.
