A three-minute video explains the working of Super Sopper, an invention "that can dry anything from cricket pitches to tennis courts in minutes." The machine has a hollow perforated cylinder with its exterior covered with spongy material to absorb water and a tank to collect water. Indian cricket associations import super soppers from Australia at approximately â‚¹45 lakhs a unit.
