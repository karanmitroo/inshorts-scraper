Cricketer Kedar Jadhav has said playing tennis ball cricket helped his technique. "As a kid, I played more tennis-ball cricket...There used to be a tournament where you could hit fours and sixes only straight down the ground...So that's how I got into this habit," said Jadhav, who hit 120(76) in India's ODI win over England at Pune on Sunday.
