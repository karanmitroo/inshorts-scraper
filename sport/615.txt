Sourav Ganguly has revealed in his book that he once attended Durga Puja festivities disguised as a "Sardarji" during his India captaincy days to avoid getting mobbed. Ganguly wrote that he was embarrassed after a policeman recognised him when he was going for 'Durga Bisharjon' but told him to keep this secret. "The escapade was worth it," Ganguly added.
