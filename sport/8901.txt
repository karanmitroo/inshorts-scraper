England fast bowler Stuart Broad has said that he would pick teammate Joe Root over Indian Test captain Virat Kohli and Australian captain Steve Smith as the best batsman in world cricket at the moment. Broad said that he is picking Root primarily because he has played a lot of cricket with him and has seen him from close quarters.
