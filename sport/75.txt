Pakistani batsman Javed Miandad mocked Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More by jumping up and down during the teams' World Cup encounter on March 4, 1992. Miandad mimicked More's style after getting frustrated by his unnecessary appeals against him. More later revealed that he intentionally needled Miandad to get under his skin and it worked for the Indian team.
