The Barmy Army, the group of travelling England fans, said it will not travel to Bangladesh, citing security concerns. The group's withdrawal follows England ODI captain Eoin Morgan and opening batsman Alex Hales' withdrawal from the Bangladesh tour over similar concerns. The Barmy Army is a semi-organised group of English cricket fans which arranges touring parties for Englandâ€™s overseas tours.
