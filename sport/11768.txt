Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who was banned from tennis over doping charges, interned at the National Basketball Association (NBA), working alongside commissioner Adam Silver. The 29-year-old had earlier worked for two weeks at the London-based advertising agency, VCCP. The Court of Arbitration for Sport is expected to reveal its decision regarding Sharapova's doping case in September.
