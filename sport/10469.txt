Olympian Michael Phelps has admitted through a Facebook Live video that he secretly got married to fiancee Nicole Johnson before the Rio Olympics. "I've been married for a while. A couple months. I had to keep it a secret from y'all...just because," said Phelps. There were rumours of Phelps' wedding after a newspaper leaked a copy of their marriage record.
