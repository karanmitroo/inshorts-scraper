Former Pakistan cricketer Waqar Younis had proposed getting run-out to his teammate Wasim Akram in the 1999 Delhi Test to deny Anil Kumble his 10th wicket. Virender Sehwag praised Akram for not letting Waqar obstruct Kumble's record, tweeting, "Kismat ke aage, all saazish fail. Well done Wasim bhai. What a day it was at the Kotla by Anil bhai."
