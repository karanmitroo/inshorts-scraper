Indian women's cricket team pacer Jhulan Goswami has become the first woman in the world to take 200 wickets in ODI cricket. Goswami achieved the feat playing in her 166th ODI against South Africa on Wednesday. Goswami had become the leading wicket-taker in women's ODIs in May last year, overtaking former Australian pacer Cathryn Fitzpatrick's record of 180 wickets.
