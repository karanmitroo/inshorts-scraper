Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor has become the first Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter to hold two titles simultaneously, after knocking out America's Eddie Alvarez on Sunday to become the UFC Lightweight Champion. In December 2015, McGregor was named the Featherweight Champion, winning by knockout against Brazilian Jos√© Aldo in 13 seconds, which was the fastest victory in UFC history.
