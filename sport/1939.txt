Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly mistook Harbhajan Singh's daughter for a boy, while commenting on a family picture posted by the spinner on Twitter on Monday. "Beta bahut sundar hai bhajj..bahut pyar dena," Ganguly commented on the picture. A few minutes later, Ganguly corrected himself and apologised, writing, "Maf karna beti bahut sundoor hai..getting old bhajj."
