Former BCCI President Anurag Thakur, who was removed from his post in January 2017 by the Supreme Court, has said that he will always be available for the board if Indian cricket requires him. Thakur, who was removed on perjury and contempt of court charges, recently tendered an unconditional apology, after which the Supreme Court dropped charges against him.
