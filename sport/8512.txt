Some vandals cut Lionel Messi's statue in Argentina's capital city, Buenos Aires in half on the same day when his Portuguese rival Cristiano Ronaldo was named FIFA's best player of the year. Notably, Argentinian authorities have begun repair work on the statue, which was installed after Messi announced his retirement from the Argentinian national team.
