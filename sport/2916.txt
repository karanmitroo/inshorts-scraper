American baseball team Chicago Cubs' Addison Russell knocked down a fan's plate of nachos after attempting to catch a foul ball during their match against St Louis Cardinals. The fan was sitting in the front row when Russell dived into the crowd and knocked down the plate with his leg. Russell, later, delivered a new plate of nachos to him.
