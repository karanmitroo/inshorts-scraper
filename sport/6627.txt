Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon became the most capped European footballer of all time after making his 168th international appearance and his 1,000th career appearance against Albania on Saturday. The match was marred by fan disruption and was held up for eight minutes after the visiting Albanian fans repeatedly threw flares and smoke bombs onto the pitch.
