The celebration parade following Chicago Cubs' World Series win after a gap of 108 years was reportedly the seventh largest gathering in human history. Officials estimate that five million people showed up to the parade, which beat the count of 3.5 million people who went to Rod Stewart's 1994 concert in Rio de Janeiro.
