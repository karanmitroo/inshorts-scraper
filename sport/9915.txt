World number two Novak Djokovic on Thursday blasted the chair umpire Fergus Murphy after being given a "time violation" for breaking the 25-second rule during his ATP Tour Finals match against David Goffin in London. Djokovic argued that he should have been given a warning first and slammed Murphy saying, "You have no clue about the game."
