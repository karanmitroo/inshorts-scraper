Commonwealth Games gold medalists Heena Sidhu and Jitu Rai have called India's pistol coach Pavel Smirnov "incompetent". "It was not just me and Jitu, most of the shooters find him technically weak...I did work with him for few a days because my Federation asked me to...But it was sort of miserable, I don't want to work with him," said Sidhu.
