Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar was trolled on Twitter for posting a wrong photograph of Pakistan's Hindu minister Darshan Lal. Users reacted with tweets like, "So that's how you define secularism? Shoaib let's focus on cricket only" and "Dimagh set hai? He's mamnoon hussain - President of Pakistan".  "I do not see Darshan lal in pic...", tweeted another user.
