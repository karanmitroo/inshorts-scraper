Australia's James Faulkner took the first ODI hat-trick of 2016, and third across all formats, in the second ODI against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. He becomes the sixth Australian to take an ODI hat-trick, with pacer Clint McKay taking the last one in 2013. Faulkner achieved the feat across two overs, claiming Kusal Perera, Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera's wickets.
