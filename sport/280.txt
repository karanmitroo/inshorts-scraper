Wellington's Bert Vance conceded 77 runs in an over in a first-class match against Canterbury on February 20, 1990. Canterbury needed 95 to win in two overs and to encourage them to go after the target and lose wickets, Vance bowled a 22-ball over, including 17 no-balls. Interestingly, only five legitimate deliveries were bowled as umpires lost track of proceedings.
