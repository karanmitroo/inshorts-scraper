Kerala's Trivandrum International Stadium will be installed with the world's third "drop-in" cricket pitch. A drop-in cricket pitch is a pitch that is prepared on some other location and is dropped in place before a match begins, allowing the stadium to be used for hosting other events. The pitch, costing over â‚¹8 crore, is expected to be ready in 2017.
