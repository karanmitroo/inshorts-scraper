WWE has barred two-time Intercontinental champion Cody Rhodes from using his surname since they own intellectual property rights to the pro-wrestling character of Cody Rhodes. The wrestler uses only his first name for work outside WWE, including his appearances in Impact Wrestling, Ring Of Honor, among others. "I don't mind that WWE took away my last name," said Cody.
