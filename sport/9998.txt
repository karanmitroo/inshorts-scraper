American football player Mike Evans sat through the pregame national anthem to protest against the election of Donald Trump as the US President. "I'm not a political person that much, but I've got common sense. And I know when something's not right," Evans said. The player, however, also faced backlash, including a Republican Senator accusing him of 'disrespecting the country'.
