Former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju called the Lodha Panel a ‘bogus committee’ while submitting his report to the BCCI, and asked the Board to not interact with it. Katju was earlier appointed as the head of a legal panel to be BCCI's ‘single-point interface’ while interacting with the Lodha committee, and guiding the Board in understanding the suggested reforms.
