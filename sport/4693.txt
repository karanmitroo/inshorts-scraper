Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga has been handed a suspended one-year ban after he spoke to the media without permission and compared Sri Lanka's sports minister to a monkey occupying a parrot's nest. The ban will be imposed on Malinga on repeating the infraction within a six-month period. He has also been fined 50% match fee of his next ODI.
