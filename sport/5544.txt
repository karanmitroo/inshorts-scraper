A grizzly bear recently disrupted the practice session of a high school rugby team in Canada, called the Banff Bears. As per reports, the bear caused no harm to the players and moved around the field smelling the equipment and kit bags. The same bear, identified as Bear 148, was sighted chasing hikers and their dog two days earlier.
