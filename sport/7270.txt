Indian captain Virat Kohli was clean bowled by Australian spinner Steve O'Keefe on Day 3 of the first Test in Pune. Expecting the delivery to spin away from him, Kohli offered no shot to the ball. The ball came back in with the arm to hit Kohli's off stump, dismissing him for 13 and handing the spinner his second wicket.
