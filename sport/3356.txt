Eighteen-year-old football referee Ryan Hampson, who has been head-butted, spat on and kicked while officiating matches, is helping set up a helpline for referees who endured similar assaults. Hampson suggested the introduction of body cameras for referees to help identify the miscreants. Notably, Hampson led a nationwide strike of referees earlier this year after being attacked during a game.
