Mumbai Indians players Hardik Pandya and Nicholas Pooran smeared cake on teammate Kieron Pollard's face to celebrate his birthday. The Caribbean all-rounder then held Pooran, also from West Indies, by the hand and smashed cake on his face. Sharing the video of the celebrations, the franchise tweeted, "The big man got his revenge."
