Deepa Malik, the first Indian woman to win a medal at Paralympics, has said that she was shocked that her name was not in the list of recipients for this year's Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award. "I think my application for the Khel Ratna must be reconsidered. I have written a mail to the Sports Minister," the 46-year-old athlete added.
