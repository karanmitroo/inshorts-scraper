News presenters on Pakistani news channel, Geo TV, called Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo a Barcelona player, saying he scored two goals to help Barcelona beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in the Champions League. The presenters, speaking while the channel played clippings from Real Madrid's 2-1 win against Bayern, failed to spot the mistake the entire time.
