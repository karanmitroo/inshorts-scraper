The record for the highest individual score on Test debut of 287 runs was set on December 14, 1903, by Englishman Tip Foster against Australia and has remained unbeaten since. It was also the then-highest Test score, which remained unbeaten till Andy Sandham's 325 against West Indies in 1930. The innings remained Foster's only century in his eight-Test long career.
