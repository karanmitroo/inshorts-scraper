Spanish swimmer Fernando Alvarez sacrificed his race in the 200m breaststroke final at Budapest's World Masters Championships by observing a minute's silence alone for the Barcelona attack victims. Alvarez had asked officials if a minute's silence could be held before the race but his request was refused, after which he remained on starting blocks while other swimmers took to water.
