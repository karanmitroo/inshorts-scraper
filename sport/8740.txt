Pakistani Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq was involved in a comical fielding effort during the third Test between Pakistan and Australia on Wednesday. Following a straight drive, Misbah tried to stop the ball using his feet, only to deflect it further away. He later slid to stop the ball but slipped while trying to get up and throw the ball back.
