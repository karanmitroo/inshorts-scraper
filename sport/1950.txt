The first India-Sri Lanka Test ended in a draw as bad light stopped play early on the last day, with SL reeling on 75/7, requiring 231 to win. Earlier in the day, Kohli slammed his 50th international ton, becoming only the second Indian to achieve the feat. Bhuvneshwar Kumar's 4/8 is India's best 4-for figures in a Test's second innings.
