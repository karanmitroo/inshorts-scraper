Ahead of their bout on Saturday, UFC champion Conor McGregor has accused his opponent, former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, of being in the worst shape of his career. "He looks blown out...full of water. I'm going to breeze through him, trust me," added McGregor during the Las Vegas weigh-in. McGregor also screamed in the face of Mayweather during the face-off.
