On February 7, 1999, former Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble became only the second bowler in the Test history to take a 10-wicket haul in a single innings after dismissing the entire Pakistan lineup in Delhi. The only other bowler to achieve the feat was English off-spinner Jim Laker, who claimed his 10-wicket haul against Australia in 1956 at Old Trafford.
