Australian umpire Paul Reiffel, who suffered a concussion after being hit on the head by a Bhuvneshwar Kumar throw in the Wankhede Test, has dismissed suggestions of wearing helmets while umpiring. Reiffel said that doing so would complicate the umpiring process. "It would be too heavy and too hot, five days with a helmet on," he added.
