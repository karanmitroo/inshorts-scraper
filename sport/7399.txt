India A batsman Shreyas Iyer has said he was sledged by Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade and David Warner on the second day of the ongoing practice match. "They started to sledge and said 'this guy does not have defence, he can play only attacking shots'," said Iyer. "I am used to this type of sledging," the batsman added.
