Australia reviewed two consecutive LBW decisions off Ravindra Jadeja's bowling with both being turned down on day three of the Bengaluru Test on Monday. The first dismissal was of Aussie keeper Matthew Wade, which beat him and hit in front of off stump. The second dismissal was of Nathan Lyon, with the batsman attempting a sweep off a straight ball.
