Sixth tier English side Salford City's goalkeeper Max Crocombe was red-carded in a game against Bradford Park Avenue for urinating beside his goalpost during the 87th minute. The 24-year-old New Zealander, who did not request for the game to be stopped, later took to Twitter to apologise to both the clubs and their fans.
