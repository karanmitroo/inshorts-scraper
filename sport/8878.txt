Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq asked for a DRS referral after a caught-behind appeal against David Warner was turned down in the ongoing Boxing day Test. The ball had seamed away from around off and gone past the bat of Warner. The replays showed there was clear daylight between the bat and ball, and the on-decision was upheld.
