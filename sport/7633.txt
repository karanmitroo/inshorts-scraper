Virat Kohli was given out LBW on 180 before he scored a double century during the Hyderabad Test against Bangladesh on Friday. The third umpire overturned the decision when Kohli took a review on the Mehedi Hasan delivery, since the ball was missing the stumps. Kohli was later dismissed LBW on 204, with replays again showing impact outside off stump.
