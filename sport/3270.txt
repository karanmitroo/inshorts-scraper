USA's Sloane Stephens fell off a chair while trying to swat a fly at a US Open press conference, following her victory in the quarter-final. After her fall Stephens said, "Oh my God, that looked like a dragon...I don't like bugs. That's so disgusting." The insect kept attacking the player, who then grabbed her sneaker to battle with it.
