Ravichandran Ashwin got Ben Stokes dismissed LBW in the Mohali Test after the on-field not out decision got overturned by India's DRS appeal. The English batsman was hit on the back leg and the ball was found to be striking the off-stump by the ball tracking technology. Notably, Ashwin had got several DRS appeals wrong earlier in the series.
