The Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida, which will host two T20Is between India and West Indies on August 27 and 28, is USA's only purpose-built cricket stadium. The 20,000-capacity stadium is also the country's lone ICC-certified venue for limited-overs cricket. Opened in November 2007, it has hosted two international T20 series since then, in 2010 and 2012.
