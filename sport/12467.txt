Recalling how he took Brian Lara's wicket in Antigua in 2002 after a jaw fracture, Indian team coach Anil Kumble said, "He [Lara] looked at my bandaged face and didnâ€™t really focus on watching the ball I bowled. Maybe, I scared him that way." Kumble had suffered a broken jaw from a Merv Dillon delivery, but later bowled 14 overs.
