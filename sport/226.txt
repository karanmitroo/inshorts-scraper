Spanish side Villarreal's Portuguese 23-year-old defender Ruben Semedo was on Thursday charged with attempted murder and kidnapping. He was arrested at his home after a man alleged that he had been tied up, beaten and held by Semedo and two other men at the player's villa. Semedo was also arrested in November following an alleged altercation at a nightclub.
