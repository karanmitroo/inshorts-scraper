Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has said Australian spinner Shane Warne sledged him continuously for 10 years. "We were playing for different counties and he would sledge me. Even when it was Rajasthan Royals vs Kolkata Knight Riders, he would start sledging me from the toss itself," said Ganguly. Warne replied saying, "Sourav never said a word back."
