Premier League leaders Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw by Burnley at Turf Moor on Sunday. Burnley midfielder Robbie Brady became the first player to score a direct free-kick against Chelsea in the PL since 2013, when he curled in the free-kick from 25 yards in the 24th minute, cancelling out Pedro's 7th-minute strike.
