Peshawar Zalmi captain Darren Sammy has said if his team wins the Pakistan Super League (PSL) title, he and his entire team will shave their heads. Sammy added that he will bring the clipper to the final and make sure even the owner of the team, Javed Afridi, gets bald. Zalmi play Quetta Gladiators in the PSL final on Sunday.
