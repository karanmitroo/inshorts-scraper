Brussels has lost the right to stage matches at Euro 2020 following delays in the development of a new stadium, UEFA said on Thursday. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said that the four matches due to be staged in Brussels would be played at London's Wembley instead, in addition to the two semi-finals and final already scheduled to be played there.
