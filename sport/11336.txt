ICC has introduced a new ‘Demerit Points’ system for players, relating to breach of the ICC Code of Conduct. Players who breach the Code will accumulate Demerit Points, which can see repeating offenders suspended. Demerit Points will remain with a player for two years. The rule comes into effect from September 22, with all players starting with a zero balance.
