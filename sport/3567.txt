Irish bookmaker Paddy Power has been accused of racism for promoting the Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor fight with an online advertisement saying it "always bets on black". The advertisement, which was accompanied by Mayweather's photograph, read, "Always bet on black. We've paid out early on a Mayweather victory. Because we checked, and only one of them is a boxer."
