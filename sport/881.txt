The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has suspended the hyperandrogenism regulations of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for six months. The suspension will help Indian sprinter Dutee Chand participate in the Asian Indoor Athletics Championships and the Commonwealth Games. The policy caused Dutee to be suspended in 2014, following which she took her case to CAS.
