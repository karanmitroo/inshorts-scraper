West Indian legend Brian Lara spent almost 13 hours at the crease and faced 97 overs in his world record Test score of 400*, against England on April 12, 2004. The then 34-year-old broke Matthew Hayden's record of 380 and went past his personal best 375, which itself was a world record for nine years before Hayden's 380 in 2003.
