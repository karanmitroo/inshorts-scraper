Sri Lanka's 19-year-old spinner Wanidu Hasaranga became only the third cricketer in ODI history to take a hat-trick on debut, bundling up Zimbabwe's innings in the second ODI on Sunday. Bangladesh's Taijul Islam and South Africa's Kagiso Rabada are the other players to have achieved the feat. Hasaranga is the third youngest and youngest debutant to claim an ODI hat-trick.
