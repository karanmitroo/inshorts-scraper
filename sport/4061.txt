India captain Virat Kohli has said he is not affected by people's opinions on his lack of form. "I think people start counting the number of innings when a batsman doesn't score well...I wasn't looking at how many innings I haven't scored...when you are playing all formats you are not thinking which format you have not scored runs," said Kohli.
