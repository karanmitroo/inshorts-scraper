Former England captain Alastair Cook, who started his innings in the Melbourne Ashes Test as the ninth highest Test run-scorer, became the sixth highest run-scorer during his unbeaten 244-run knock. Cook, who has now scored 11,956 Test runs, overtook Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene (11,814), Windies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul (11,867) and Brian Lara (11,953). This was Cook's fifth double ton in Tests.
