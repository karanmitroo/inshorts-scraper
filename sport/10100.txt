Indian pacer Mohit Sharma, who last featured for India in an ODI on October 25, 2015, has claimed that his loss in form occurred because of his receding hairline. "I realised I was losing hair, and it really affected my confidence big time, which in turn affected my bowling," the Haryana pacer said.
