Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos now holds the joint-record for most red cards received in La Liga history after being handed his 18th red in his side's 3-0 victory over Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday. The 31-year-old Spanish defender shares the record with former Barcelona and Sevilla defender Pablo Alfaro and former Real Zaragoza defender Xavi Aguado.
