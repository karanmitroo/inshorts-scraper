Australian women became the first ever Olympic champions in the women's rugby sevens after they defeated New Zealand 24-17 in the gold medal match on Monday. Canada finished with the bronze medal after defeating Britain. Rugby was last included at the Olympics in 1924 in Paris when the United States' men came out as the champions in the 15-a-side tournament.
