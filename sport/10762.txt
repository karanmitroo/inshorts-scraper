Trinity Gay, the 15-year-old daughter of former American Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay, was fatally shot at a Kentucky restaurant in the US early on Sunday. Trinity, a track athlete herself, was shot in the neck when gunfire was exchanged between two vehicles near the eatery. Trinity was not in either of the vehicles and was reportedly a bystander.
