Sunderland manager David Moyes in a recent interview told a female BBC reporter she might "get a slap" after she asked him a question regarding him being under pressure after his relegation-threatened side's draw. The former Manchester United manager later said that he had phoned the reporter and apologised for his remark and that she had accepted his apology.
