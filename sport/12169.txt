French midfielder Paul Pogba has been granted permission to have a medical in order to finalise his transfer from Juventus to Manchester United. The 23-year-old midfielder, who left United for $2 million in 2012, is set to return for a fee that is expected to surpass Gareth Bale's $111 million switch to Real Madrid in 2013.
