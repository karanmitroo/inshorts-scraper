Real Madrid defeated Celta Vigo 4-1 on Wednesday to move within one point of winning their 33rd La Liga title. Madrid will only need to draw against Málaga on Sunday to finish as winners for the first time since 2012. Second-placed Barcelona need a win from their last game against Eibar and Madrid's loss to Málaga to retain the title.
