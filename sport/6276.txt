Reacting to Rising Pune Supergiant's owner, Sanjeev Goenka's brother Harsh Goenka's tweet which said that Steve Smith overshadowed MS Dhoni, a user tweeted, "Don't you dare insult Dhoni. Your team has got supporters coz of the main man." "According to your logic if Dhoni overshadows Smith in next match will you make him the captain again," tweeted another user.
