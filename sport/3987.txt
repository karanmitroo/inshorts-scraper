Former Australian PM Tony Abbott has sent a signed cricket bat for PM Narendra Modi, reportedly through an Indian residing in Australia. The man, Manpreet Singh, who is carrying the bat along with pictures of Abbott signing it, has been visiting the PMO but has not met Modi yet. Abbott has reportedly addressed Modi as "Narendra" on the bat.
