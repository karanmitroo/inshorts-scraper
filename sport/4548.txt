Ahead of the 3rd ODI between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Hambantota, Sri Lanka's cricket board has taken extra precaution against the threat of wild elephants straying onto the pitch. "There had been a few instances when elephants broke through the fence and invaded the pitch at night," an official said. Notably, the stadium is next to an elephant sanctuary.
