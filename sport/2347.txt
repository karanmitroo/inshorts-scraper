Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid has said he sometimes cringes on reading current Indian captain Virat Kohli's pre-match statements about his oppositions. "But if he can bring the best out of himself by needling the opposition, so be it," Dravid added. Under Kohli, India won their seventh straight ODI series by defeating New Zealand in the third ODI on Sunday.
