When the former Governor of Bombay Raja Maharaj Singh took the field on November 27, 1950, he became the oldest first-class cricket debutant. Captaining Bombay Governor's XI, Maharaj scored four runs, did not bowl, took no catches, and was listed as "absent ill" in the second innings. He was dismissed by Jim Laker, who was 44 years younger than Maharaj.
