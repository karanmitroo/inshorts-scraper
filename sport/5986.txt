Mumbai Indians' all-rounder Hardik Pandya got out for the first time in IPL 2017 on Saturday against Delhi Daredevils. Pandya had remained unbeaten in six innings before his dismissal, scoring 96 runs in this year's edition. Interestingly, the right-hander is yet to be dismissed by a bowler in the tournament as he was run out in his 7th innings.
