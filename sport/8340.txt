England bowler David Willey clean bowled Indian opener KL Rahul in the first ODI in Pune. Bowling around the wicket, the left-arm pacer got the ball to swing late into the batsman and managed to produce a gap between the bat and the ball. The ball dislodged the middle stump, dismissing Rahul for 8 from 18 balls.
