Former world number one Boris Becker has said Indian tennis player Sania Mirza brings him good luck. "Every time we are having lunch and she is with her doubles partner, she is winning the tournament. So Sania insisted on all the important tournaments that we have lunch together because I bring her luck and she brings me luck," said Becker.
