Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard went on a date with her 20-year-old Twitter follower John Goehrke after losing a Super Bowl bet. Goehrke had asked Bouchard if she would go on a date with him if the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, which they did. The duo attended an NBA game in New York, with Bouchard sharing photographs.
