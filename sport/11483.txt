Around 120 elderly men and women from 12 retirement homes in Switzerland participated in the 'elderly Olympics' organised by the JURAncien association. The sports included brick building, giant darts and hammering nails into blocks of wood. Seventy-seven-year-old Eric Hanni, a silver medallist at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, handed out the medals.
