Ex-Indian batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid's last ducks in their pro careers came against pacer Jason Behrendorff, who made his international debut for Australia in the first India-Australia T20I. Sachin, playing for Mumbai Indians, was caught out off Perth Scorchers' Behrendorff's bowling in 2013 Champions League, while Rajasthan Royals' Dravid was bowled out by him in the same edition.
