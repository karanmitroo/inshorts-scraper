Ahead of the German football team's World Cup qualifiers, German defender Mats Hummels has been warned by the national team management after he posted a video of him jumping in a pool from a balcony. Hummels, who was in Croatia on a break, captioned the video, "looks more spectacular than it actually is. #donottrythisathome".
