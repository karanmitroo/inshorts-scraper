Reacting to India's MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh's centuries during the 2nd ODI against England on Thursday, former Indian cricketer Sehwag tweeted, "Only old notes are out of circulation. Great knocks from @YUVSTRONG12 and @msdhoni." Dhoni scored his first ever ODI century against England, while Yuvraj's was his first ton in around six years.
