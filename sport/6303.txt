Rising Pune Supergiant wicketkeeper MS Dhoni signalled for a review to mock the umpire's wrong LBW decision during the IPL match against Mumbai Indians on Thursday. Pune bowler Imran Tahir trapped MI's Kieron Pollard LBW, but the umpire ruled not out. Replays showed the batsman was out, with Dhoni making the DRS signal to protest the decision.
