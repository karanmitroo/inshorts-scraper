India's Rohit Sharma hit a 103-metre six off a Kane Richardson delivery which went out of the Holkar Stadium during the third ODI on Sunday. Rohit raced down the track and played a pull shot to smash the six after Richardson bowled a short ball. Sharma went on to score his fastest ODI fifty off 42 balls in the match.
