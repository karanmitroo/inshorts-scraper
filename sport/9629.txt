Pakistan will miss the junior hockey World Cup in India, scheduled from December 8 to 18 in Lucknow, after the International Hockey Federation (FIH) withdrew its invite for the nation. FIH said the Pakistan Hockey Federation was late to apply for visas and had not completed the formalities for finalising accommodation. FIH had earlier confirmed Pakistan's participation in the event.
