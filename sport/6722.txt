Swiss tennis player Stanislas Wawrinka jovially called his compatriot and friend Roger Federer 'an a**hole' after losing the Indian Wells Masters' final to Federer on Sunday. Wawrinka added that when Federer was playing in the final of Australian Open 2017, he was still his biggest fan despite having lost some 'tough ones' against Federer throughout his career.
