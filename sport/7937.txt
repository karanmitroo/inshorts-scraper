Virat Kohli has revealed his advice to pacer Jasprit Bumrah in the T20I against England on Sunday. England needed six runs off the last ball when Virat told Bumrah, "I just told him to back his skills. Even if it goes for a six, you still wake up tomorrow. It's not the end of the world," said Virat.
