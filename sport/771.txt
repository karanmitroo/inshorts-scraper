The USA gymnastics board is set to resign after USA's Olympic Committee had given them six days to quit over the sexual abuse scandal surrounding gymnastic team's doctor Larry Nassar, sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. The committee had stated that the board would face decertification if the board members failed to resign.
