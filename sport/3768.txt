Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 3-1 in the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday in the first El Cl√°sico of the season. Cristiano Ronaldo found the net for the visitors before he was booked for taking his shirt off during his goal celebration. He was later sent off with a second yellow for a controversial dive, before Marco Asensio made it 3-1.
