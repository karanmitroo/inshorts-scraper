After resuming the play on Day 2 of the Mohali Test on Sunday from 268/8, England's first innings was wrapped up inside the first 20 minutes, courtesy two wickets by India's Mohammed Shami. Shami dismissed Adil Rashid on his very first ball of the day, and caught Gareth Batty LBW on the last ball of his second over.
