American racer Justin Gatlin, who defeated Jamaican eight-time Olympic gold winner Usain Bolt in his career's final 100m race, said that he believes Bolt will come back out of retirement in a year or two. Bolt pulled up in his career's final race with an apparent hamstring injury and failed to finish the final leg of the 4x100m relay race.
