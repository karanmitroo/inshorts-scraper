Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar compared MS Dhoni's intent in the last ODI to that of the 2011 World Cup final, saying, "The intent was there, just like in the finals." Gavaskar also praised Virat Kohli's innings, and added, "His mind is like a computer. He knows exactly where he can hit the ball away from the fielder."
