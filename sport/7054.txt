American baseball side New York Mets' player Luis Guillorme caught a baseball bat with one hand when it came flying towards his team's dugout during a pre-season MLB game in Miami recently. Miami Marlins' batter Adeiny Hechavarria's bat went flying towards the dugout when he attempted a swing, with Guillorme casually catching it and throwing it back to the batter.
