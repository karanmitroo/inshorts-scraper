Playing against Australia in Sharjah on April 22, 1998, Sachin Tendulkar scored 143 runs to ensure India's spot in the final of the tri-series. The match was interrupted by a sandstorm and the innings came to be popularly known as 'the desert storm'. Tendulkar went on to score another century two days later to help India win the tournament.
