Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur has claimed that the 22-year-old batsman Babar Azam is "as good as Virat Kohli at the same age". "I know that's high praise but he's right up there...He will be an exceptional player," said Arthur. Azam has played three Tests with a career-best score of 90* and featured in 18 ODIs, scoring three consecutive centuries.
