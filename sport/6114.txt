Commentator Sanjay Manjrekar has clarified that he did not use terms like 'no brains' and 'brainless' to describe Mumbai Indians' Kieron Pollard. Manjrekar tweeted, "Said "Does he have the range?" Using terms like 'no brains' or 'brainless' not my style. I can be critical but never insulting." Pollard termed Manjrekar's commentary as 'verbal diarrhea' after the alleged incident.
