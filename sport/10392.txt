British double Olympic silver-winning gymnast Louis Smith has been suspended for two months by British Gymnastics over a leaked video in which he and fellow gymnast Luke Carson appeared to mock Islam. Carson, who retired from gymnastics last year due to injury, was issued with a reprimand. The two were pretending to pray while shouting "Allahu Akbar" in a hotel.
