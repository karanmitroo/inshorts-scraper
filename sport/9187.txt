Former England captain Michael Vaughan has questioned the ICC for not taking action against Ravichandran Ashwin for his on-field spat with England pacer James Anderson on the last day of the Wankhede Test. "I don't understand @ICC why @benstokes38 was done for dissent in Mohali but @ashwinravi99 gets away with it in Mumbai? Please explain," Vaughan tweeted.
