David and Victoria Beckham have reportedly listed their 200-acre mansion in the Bargemon village of the South of France for £2.4 million (about $3.1 million). The couple bought the 'Domaine Saint-Vincent' six-bedroom mansion with an infinity pool for £1.5 million in 2003 and spent £5 million on renovations. They reportedly did not visit it much.
