MS Dhoni's last innings as the captain of the Rising Pune Supergiants included a last-ball six which helped Pune defeat Kings XI Punjab in the 2016 edition of the tournament. Pune required six off the final ball, which Dhoni hit to end the match with an unbeaten score of 64(32). Dhoni will still remain a part of the Pune squad.
