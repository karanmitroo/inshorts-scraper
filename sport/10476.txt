Applauding BCCI's 'Nayi Soch' initiative, a user tweeted, "Proud moment for every mother as Indian Team is wearing Jersey with their Mother's name on it #NayiSoch @StarPlus". "This #NayiSoch is a great idea. Really. But, India better beat New Zealand, or their mothers are going to be pissed !", read another user's tweet.
