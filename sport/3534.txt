Afghanistan's 18-year-old spinner Rashid Khan received a marriage proposal from a fan during a Caribbean Premier League T20 match on Tuesday. The girl was holding up a placard which read, "Rashid Khan, you're young, I'm young. My roti is round, let's settle down." The Instagram account of the West Indies' T20 league shared a picture of the fan.
