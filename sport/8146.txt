Indian cricketer Mohammed Shami was criticised by social media users after he posted an image with a dog on Facebook. Terming the picture as 'un-Islamic', the users rebuked Shami for betraying his religion and even accused him of forgetting his roots after having achieved fame. The cricketer was earlier slammed after he had posted a picture with his wife.
