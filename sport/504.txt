At the 1928 Winter Olympics, horses were part of the Skijoring event, wherein participants raced each other while being towed by riderless horses. No medals were awarded as Skijoring was a demonstration sport, which never returned to Winter Olympics after 1928. Dogs were seen at the 1932 Winter Olympics, taking part in the demonstration sport of sled dog racing.
