Pakistan's wicketkeeper-batsman Sarfraz Ahmed has said he did not speak about problems in 2015 with then-coach Waqar Younis as he could have been dropped. "I fear being dropped from the team because I have seen what happened to some other players," said Sarfraz. Pakistan's then-coach Waqar Younis had not played Sarfraz in four matches despite him performing.
