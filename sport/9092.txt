Karun Nair, during his innings of 303*, played a shot similar to what Sachin Tendulkar used to play. Nair was batting on 219 when he improvised an upper-cut off the bowling of Stuart Broad, hitting the ball over the slips for a six. Tendulkar was known to play the shot, mostly on bouncy pitches, including Australia.
