London-based Bedlam Production have roped in Adrian Butchart, creator of the 2006 film 'Goal! The Dream Begins', for a movie on Leicester City's victory in the Premier League last season. Additionally, Oscar-nominated scriptwriters, Briton Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson, have also been brought on board for the film. Leicester defied odds of 5000/1 to win the 2015-16 Premier League title.
