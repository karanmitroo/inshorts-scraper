India played its first-ever T20I exactly ten years ago on December 1, 2006, against South Africa at Johannesburg. The Indian team was captained by Virender Sehwag and included MS Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar, who was playing his career's lone T20I. The Proteas set India a target of 127, which India achieved with six wickets remaining and one ball to spare.
