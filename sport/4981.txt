Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed took a DRS review after dropping a catch in the Champions Trophy match against Sri Lanka on Monday. Sri Lankan player Asela Gunaratne nicked a Mohammad Amir delivery, with Sarfraz attempting the catch. Replays showed he had clearly grassed it, but still went for the review after seeing Amir celebrating the wicket.
