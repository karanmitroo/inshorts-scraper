Former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond has called bowlers "second-class citizens" in modern limited-overs cricket. "In an era gone by, the pattern was to tee-off in the first 15 overs, build through the middle and then launch a final onslaught. That philosophy has now gone out the window...slow bowlers are resorting to a more negative line of bowling," said Bond.
