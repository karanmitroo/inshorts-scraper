Gujarat's Samit Gohel recorded the highest-ever score by an opener carrying his bat in first-class cricket, scoring 359* in the Gujarat-Odisha Ranji Trophy quarter-final on Tuesday. Gohel is the fourth triple centurion in first-class cricket to carry his bat through the innings and the first since 1935. He surpassed the previous best of 357* by Surrey's Bobby Abel in 1899.
