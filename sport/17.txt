Responding to footage of the David Warner-Quinton de Kock scuffle, AB de Villiers said the South Africa-Australia series would be "one to remember". The footage showed an exchange between the duo on the staircase leading to dressing rooms, with Warner being restrained by teammates. Warner also gave a send-off to de Villiers after he got out in the first Test.
