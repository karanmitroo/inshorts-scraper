Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan, was trolled on Twitter after he called the country's cricket team 'green shits' instead of 'shirts'. Ahmad had posted a congratulatory tweet for the team following an ODI win against Australia, in which he made the error. He later deleted the tweet and reposted with the correct spelling.
