French umpire Arnaud Gabas underwent a surgery to repair a fractured eye socket after being unintentionally hit by a ball from Canada's Denis Shapovalov during a Davis Cup tie with Great Britain. Shapovalov was defaulted from his match with Kyle Edmund after unintentionally hitting the umpire, for which he later apologised but was fined $7,000.
