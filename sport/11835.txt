Wicketkeeper-batsman KL Rahul has become the fastest player to score centuries in all three formats in international cricket, taking 20 innings cumulatively. Rahul, who was the first Indian to score hundred on ODI debut, scored his maiden T20I century against West Indies on Saturday. He is also the only batsman to reach 100 with a six in all formats.
