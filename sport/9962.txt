Sachin Tendulkar wanted to be a fast bowler as a youngster but was turned down by the then-MRF Pace Foundation director Dennis Lillee. Tendulkar later recalled the Australian pacer telling him, "My friend this is a better option, why don't you stick to batting." The academy was set up under Lillee in 1987 to train budding fast bowlers in Chennai.
