Bangladesh's Tamim Iqbal got run-out after he started running down the pitch despite Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella having the ball. Dickwella was appealing for caught behind as Tamim failed to flick the ball towards the leg side. Tamim started to run as he did not know where the ball was before Dickwella knocked the bails off.
