English middle-order batsman escaped his dismissal as many as six times during his 128-run long innings on the second day of the first Test against India at Rajkot on Thursday. The batsman escaped a caught-behind dismissal twice, getting dropped by Indian wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha off Umesh Yadav's bowling both the times. The reprieves also included a couple of run-out chances.
