As per reports, India may boycott the 2017 men's Champions Trophy in England, after the women's cricket team was on Wednesday penalised for forfeiting its matches against Pakistan in the ICC Women's Championship. "This is a move with ulterior motive...If ICC does not backtrack, the men's team won't play in Champions Trophy," a BCCI official was quoted as saying.
