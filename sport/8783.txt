Nine-time Olympic gold medal winner Usain Bolt surprised an MUTV (Manchester United TV) presenter by calling in to discuss the win over Middlesbrough. In the post-match show, the presenter Mandy Henry introduced the caller as, “Usain from Jamaica” before asking, “It’s not Usain Bolt, is it?”. Bolt confirmed that it was indeed him and later tweeted about his call.
