Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia never had a state-controlled system for the support of performance enhancing drug abuse in sports. Admitting that Russia does have some problems with sports doping, Putin said it should not be politicised. Notably, Russia was suspended from international athletics in 2015 after an alleged state-sponsored doping scandal was uncovered.
