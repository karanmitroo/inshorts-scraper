Pakistan pacer Junaid Khan has expressed confidence in his ability to restrict India's Virat Kohli in the upcoming Champions Trophy. "I have dismissed him in three out of the four matches we have faced each other. He is a brilliant batsman but he has failed against me," Khan said. India will begin their title defence against Pakistan on June 4.
