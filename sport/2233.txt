Indian captain Virat Kohli has said he has such a great understanding with former captain MS Dhoni that if they're running between wickets and Dhoni says two, he simply closes his eyes and runs. "I am so sure of his judgment," Kohli added. "I don't think I've come across a better cricketing brain," Kohli further said about MS Dhoni.
