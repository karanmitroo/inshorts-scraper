England pacer Chris Woakes dismissed Australia debutant Alex Carey by running him out using his foot during the second ODI on Friday. Cameron White attempted a quick single following a mistimed shot off Woakes, before the pacer kicked the ball into the stumps. Carey fell short of the crease in the 48th over and got out for 27(24).
