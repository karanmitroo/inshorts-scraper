The Indian flag was mistakenly hoisted upside down at the Newlands stadium in Cape Town when the Indian cricket team was practicing in the nets on Wednesday. The Indian team management brought the incident to the notice of the groundsmen, who then hoisted the flag the right way. India will face South Africa in the first Test on January 5.
