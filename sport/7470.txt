Eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt, who is retiring this year, says he has "no reason to stay in athletics". "I asked Michael Johnson 'why did you retire when you were on top?' He said the same...he had done everything he had wanted to...Now I understand what he means," said Bolt, who will retire after the IAAF World Championships in June.
