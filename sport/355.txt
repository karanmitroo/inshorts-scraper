The father and stepmother of Swiss freeskier Mischa Gasser travelled 17,000 km on a bike to see their son perform at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Gasser's parents started their journey in February last year and crossed 20 countries before reaching Pyeongchang. "It was our dream and it's not finished yet...We want to cycle the world," they said.
