Through a Twitter campaign, former cricketer Virender Sehwag has raised funds for a prosthetic limb for a farmer's son from Uttar Pradesh. Sehwag started the #RunSatishRun campaign on October 31, seeking donations for the victim through his foundation. A Bangalore-based healthcare group offered a limb at a discounted price, while cricketers Virat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir and Chris Gayle also donated.
