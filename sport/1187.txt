England captain Mike Denness left himself out of the team for an Ashes Test that started on January 4, 1975, after scoring 65 runs in previous six innings. John Edrich replaced Denness as captain and broke his ribs after getting hit by the first ball he faced in the second innings. Australia went on to win by 171 runs.
