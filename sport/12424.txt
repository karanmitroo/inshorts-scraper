The Indian menâ€™s junior cycling team has topped the Union Cycliste Internationale world rankings, which is a first for India in the sport across any age category. The team, which was ranked 149th in 2013, jumped 10 places from the ratings released three months ago. However, the team failed to qualify for the Rio Olympics, which begins from August 5.
