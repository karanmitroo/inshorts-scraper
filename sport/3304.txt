Usain Bolt, who holds the world records for 100-metre and 200-metre sprints, has said he expects his records to remain unbroken for at least 15-20 years. "I think our era with Yohan Blake, Justin Gatlin and Asafa Powell...was the best era of athletes. If it was going to be broken, it would have been broken in this era," said Bolt.
