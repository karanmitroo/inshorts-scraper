Australia's Olympics contingent evacuated their building at the Olympic Village in Rio de Janeiro, when a fire erupted in the building's basement on Friday. There were no casualties reported in the incident. Earlier, the Australian contingent had refused to move into the village due to exposed wiring and blocked toilets in the building, but the issue was later resolved.
