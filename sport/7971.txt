Reacting to Australian Open finalists Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal wearing similar Nike gear including shoes, shorts and headbands, a user tweeted, "As if charisma of these two was not enough. Those shoes! #AusOpen". "I say that #FedererNadal had a convo before the match to wear identical items just their opposites, except the shoes, of course #AusOpen", tweeted another user.
