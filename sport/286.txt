Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum scored Test cricket history's fastest-ever century off 54 balls in his career's last match before retirement, against Australia on February 20, 2016. McCullum broke Viv Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq's joint record, who scored a century each off 56 balls. Further, McCullum is the only player to make 101 consecutive Test appearances from his debut.
