Krasava, the official match ball for 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, was launched on Thursday. The structure of Krasava, a term used by Russian fans to describe a striking performance, incorporates the same panel shape as the balls used in the UEFA Euro 2016. The Under-17 World Cup will be the first official FIFA tournament to be held in India.
