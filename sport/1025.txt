Reacting to opener Shikhar Dhawan getting dropped from Team India for second South Africa Test, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said the batsman's "head is always on the chopping board". "I think Shikhar Dhawan is the 'Bali ka Bakra' (scapegoat)...He just needs one bad innings and he is out of the team," Gavaskar added. Dhawan has been replaced by Lokesh Rahul.
