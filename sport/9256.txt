NBA player LeBron James is co-producing a documentary on late boxer Muhammad Ali, who died in June this year, for television network HBO. The documentary will feature archived footage, with Ali's family also participating in the project. The yet-to-be-titled project will be directed by Antoine Fuqua, who has also directed the boxing-themed film 'Southpaw' and crime thriller 'Training Day'.
