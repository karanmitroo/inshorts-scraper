Australian cricketer David Warner's wife Candice Warner has said sportsmanship means nothing to the Indian cricket team as they did not applaud Australian captain Steve Smith's century in the Ranchi Test. "Absolutely!! Obviously sportsmanship isn't high on their values and means nothing to them," responded Candice after a user asked her if Indians were wrong not to applaud Smith's century.
