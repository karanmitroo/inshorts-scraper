South African batsman Marco Marais smashed first-class cricket's fastest triple ton off 191 balls on Thursday, becoming the first cricketer to hit a triple ton in less than 200 deliveries. Border's Marais, who achieved the feat in a three-day match, beat the 96-year-old record set by Australia's Charles Macartney in 1921. Marais' 300*(191) included 13 sixes and 35 fours.
