Dutch speed skater Elma de Vries was leading the 190-kilometre-long Alternative Eleven Cities tour race when she hit a hole in the track and fell just before the finish line. She slid through the remainder of the track hoping to finish the race and win it but fell almost ten metres short, with other racers speeding past her.
