The HotSpot technology will not be a part of the Decision Review System during the upcoming India-England Tests. Reportedly, the HotSpot proprietors in Australia told the BCCI that they wouldn't be able to provide the hardware until mid-November or February. HotSpot, which determines the contact of ball with the bat or pad, will be replaced by UltraEdge, a similar technology.
