Mitchell Starc has parted ways with Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2017. Starc will not be part of the IPL Player Auction which is scheduled for February 20 in Bengaluru either. "[I]t is in my best interests...for me to have a break...and take the opportunity to work on getting back to full fitness," Starc said.
