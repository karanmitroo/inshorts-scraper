Indian captain Virat Kohli is willing to put Steve Smith's DRS controversy behind him. "A lot has been given into the DRS incident I feel and it's time we focus on the remainder of the series," Kohli said. "One side will say one thing and other will say another and that just takes the focus away from cricket," Kohli added.
