Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja celebrated his half-century against New Zealand in the first Test at Kanpur on Sunday with a "warrior celebration". Jadeja swung his bat around his body, akin to a sword or a warrior's weapon. Captain Virat Kohli, who had declared the innings after Jadeja's half-century, was applauding and gestured with a similar celebration.
