Courtney Novak, a fan of NBA franchise Dallas Mavericks, got a chance to score a basket from the half line, which she did successfully during Mavericks' match against San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. Novak, who converted the shot on her first attempt and won a new 65-inch 4K television, also got to celebrate her shot with Mavericks player Dirk Nowitzki.
