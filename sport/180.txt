Afghanistan's 19-year-old spinner Rashid Khan has become the number one bowler in both ODI and T20I cricket. Last week, Khan had become the youngest bowler to occupy the top spot in the ODI bowler rankings, sharing it with Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah. Khan claimed the T20I top spot after taking five wickets in two matches against Zimbabwe in Sharjah.
