Bradley Lowery, a five-year-old cancer-stricken boy, was made Sunderland's mascot, leading the team out of the tunnel for their Premier League encounter against Chelsea on Wednesday. Lowery interacted with players, including Diego Costa and Cesc Fàbregas, before converting a penalty against Chelsea keeper Asmir Begović. He was later given a minute's applause during the fifth minute of the game.
