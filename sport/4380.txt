Following Angelo Mathews' resignation as Sri Lanka's captain from all three formats, the country's cricket board has named Dinesh Chandimal as the side's Test captain, while Upul Tharanga was made limited-overs captain. Chandimal, who is Sri Lanka's 15th Test skipper, will begin his stint as the captain against Zimbabwe, while Tharanga will lead the SL side against India in August.
