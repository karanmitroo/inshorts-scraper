Former Indian cricket team director Ravi Shastri said that a few nations' cricket boards are making a big mistake by trying to take advantage of the current mess that the BCCI is in. "My warning to such people is, beware...This state of flux will not last for long. BCCI will be back where they belong very very soon," Shastri said.
