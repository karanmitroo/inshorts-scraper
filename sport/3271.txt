Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar on Friday shared a handwritten letter sent to him by a six-year-old fan named Taara. The girl wrote to Sachin after watching his biopic 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams' and said she laughed when she saw how naughty he was as a child. "Hi, Taara!...I'm really glad that you enjoyed the movie. Keep smiling," read Sachin's caption.
