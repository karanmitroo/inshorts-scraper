After bowling the second over against Bangladesh on Monday, Nathan Lyon became the first Australian spinner to open the bowling on the first day of a Test in 79 years. The last time an Australian spinner opened the bowling on the first morning of a Test was Bill O'Reilly in 1938. Lyon picked up five wickets on Day one.
