American sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has served two doping bans, was booed by the crowd while receiving his 100m World Championships gold, for which he defeated Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. The International Association of Athletics Federations' President said Gatlin's victory was "not the perfect script". Gatlin was handed a one-year ban in 2001 and a four-year ban in 2006.
