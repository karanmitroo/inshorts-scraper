Three people were seriously injured and 120 others detained after a riot broke out between fans following Belgian side Club Brugge' 1-0 win over Royal Antwerp in Bruges. Fans of two Dutch clubs were also involved in the brawl, that left a policeman with a broken jaw. The local police chief said such hooliganism "hadn't been seen for years".
