New Zealand captain Kane Williamson survived a dismissal, after his helmet flap fell hitting the stumps, but failed to dislodge the bails. An Ashwin delivery hit Williamson's helmet, breaking the flaps which hit the stumps but didn't move the bails. As per rules, if the bails are dislodged by the player's clothing or equipment, the player is given out.
