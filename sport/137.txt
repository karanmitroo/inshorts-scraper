South African pacer Morne Morkel announced on Monday that he will retire from international cricket after the end of the Test series against Australia. The 33-year-old has played in 83 Tests and has picked up 294 wickets so far. "I have a young family and a foreign wife so I believe this is best time to do this," Morkel said.
