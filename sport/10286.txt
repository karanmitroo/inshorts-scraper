Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has claimed that the most difficult player to handle as a captain was former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath. Ponting said that McGrath used to get agitated whenever he was taken off from a spell in Test cricket. "He'd stand at fine leg and he'd abuse all the crowd just because he wasn't bowling," Ponting added.
