Tennis player Marcus Willis wore a shirt with the initials ‘RF’, during his Wimbledon match against Roger Federer on Wednesday. Willis complemented the jersey, from Federer's personal clothing line, with a Nike headband and Adidas shoes, similar to the Swiss. After the match, 772-ranked Willis said, "There is life after Wimbledon...I want more such experiences. I've earned myself a beer."
