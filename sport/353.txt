New Zealand's Mark Chapman was dismissed hit-wicket after a short ball struck him on the helmet, which fell off his head and bounced off the pitch to hit the stumps. In the 18th over, Chapman missed a pull shot off the bouncer, while the ball went on to hit his head. Chapman's helmet then came off to dislodge the bails.
