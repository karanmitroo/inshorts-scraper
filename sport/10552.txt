Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath will become the oldest player to captain a side for the first time since 1983, after being named skipper for the country's tour to Zimbabwe. The 38-year-old was named captain after Angelo Mathews was injured. Herath, making his captaincy debut in his 74th Test, played 71 ODIs and 17 T20Is before retiring from limited-overs cricket.
