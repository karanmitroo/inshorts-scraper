Tennis player Martina Navratilova was granted political asylum during the 1975 US Open as the Czech Tennis Federation wanted her to return to Czechoslovakia to finish school. The then 18-year-old had claimed that the federation thought she was becoming "too Americanized" and didn't want her to play US Open. Navratilova won a total of 56 Grand Slams in her career.
