Following their 4-0 series defeat against India, it was for the first time in 28 years and second time in their entire Test history that England lost a Test series, other than Ashes, by a margin of four Tests. The last time they were defeated by a four-Test margin was in 1988 when West Indies defeated them 4-0 in England.
