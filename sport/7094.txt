On being asked why he always took the strike while opening the batting with Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly said, "He (Sachin) would never listen to me." Ganguly added that when he would tell Sachin to take the strike, he would come up with an excuse and say he finds it hard to focus with so much heat in the ground.
