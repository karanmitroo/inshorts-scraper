South African cricketer AB de Villiers claims that the sledging he witnessed during SA's three-match Test series against Australia in 2014 was "personal and over the top". The series, won 2-1 by Australia, also witnessed a verbal altercation between Michael Clarke and Dale Steyn. He added the sledging by the Australians was the worst he has ever faced.
