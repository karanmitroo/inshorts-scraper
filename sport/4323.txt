Ajinkya Rahane, who did not play a single Champions Trophy match, has said he had no ego issues carrying drinks for the team. "If I'm the vice-captain in Tests, it doesn't mean I will not be performing my duties as a 12th man in ODIs. When you're representing your country, you are supposed to do whatever you're assigned," said Rahane.
