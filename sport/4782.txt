Bowler Jasprit Bumrah slammed the Jaipur Traffic Police on Twitter, after they used his no-ball image on a billboard for a road safety message. "I won't make fun of the mistakes which you guys make at your work, because I believe humans can make mistakes," wrote Bumrah. Jaipur Traffic Police then apologised to the bowler in a series of tweets.
