Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency is reportedly sending its agents to display banners on the Kashmir issue at the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy match in Birmingham on Sunday. Slogans like "Kashmir Seeks Attention", "Kashmir is bleeding", "We stand with Kashmir" and "Free the state of Jammu and Kashmir now" will be displayed in order to grab international attention.
