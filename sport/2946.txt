England's Moeen Ali smashed 61 runs off 14 balls, including 8 sixes and 2 fours, to record the fastest ODI hundred on English soil against Windies on Sunday. He took only 12 balls to score the second half of his century, joint fastest in international cricket. Further, this was the second-fastest ODI century for England after Jos Buttler's 46-ball hundred.
