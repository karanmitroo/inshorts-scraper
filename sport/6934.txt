Former Australian captain Steve Waugh visited Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to scatter the ashes of his friend. "It was a lifetime opportunity for me and I really wanted to visit that city. It has a very spiritual feeling," Waugh said. The Australian added that it was his friend's last wish to have his ashes scattered in the Ganga.
