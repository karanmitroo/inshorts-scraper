Vidarbha Cricket Association has refused to give Presidential box tickets to BCCI for the India-England T20I at Nagpur on January 29. VCA President Anand Jaiswal said the tickets have been denied since there is nobody holding the post of BCCI President currently, after Anurag Thakur was sacked by the Supreme Court. BCCI President has a quota of 50 box seats.
