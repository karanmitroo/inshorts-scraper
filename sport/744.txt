Australian pacer Jason Behrendorff, who dismissed former Indian batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for their last professional ducks, was bought by Mumbai Indians for â‚¹1.5 crore in the IPL auction on Sunday. Incidentally, India captain Virat Kohli's first-ever T20I duck also came on the bowling of Behrendorff. The left-arm fast bowler has taken 57 wickets in 40 T20s.
