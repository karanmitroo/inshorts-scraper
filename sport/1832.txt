England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson threw the ball towards the stumps in his follow through, hitting Australian debutant Cameron Bancroft near his groin during the first Ashes Test on Sunday. Bancroft did not flinch and stared down Anderson, who then raised his hand in apology. Bancroft went on to hit an unbeaten 82, helping Australia win by 10 wickets.
