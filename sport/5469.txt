Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has said the 20-over format is the most difficult to captain. "It's all about your gut instinct. You don't have time to go and talk to your vice-captain or your other senior players...you feel it and you have to make a decision straightaway," said Clarke, who led Australia in 18 T20Is, winning 12 of them.
