The International Cricket Council (ICC) trolled former Indian cricketer Ajit Agarkar by tweeting a picture of him in a swimming pool, with the caption, "Is @imAagarkar the next @MichaelPhelps? #swimming #Rio2016". The photo showed Agarkar swimming at the team hotel in Port of Spain on March 26, 2007, after being eliminated from the 2007 World Cup.
