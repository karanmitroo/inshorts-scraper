England's Moeen Ali, after surviving five LBW appeals off reviews in the first innings, survived another decision referred to the third umpire in the second innings. Caught by the backward short leg fielder, Ali was declared not-out as the ball had touched the fielder's helmet. A batsman cannot be given out if the ball touches a fielder's protective equipment.
