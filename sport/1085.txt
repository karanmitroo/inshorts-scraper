India's first-choice goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has revealed he earns more playing for Bengaluru FC in the Indian Super League than what he used to get at Norwegian club Stabaek. Sandhu, however, said he would consider playing for a European club again if it meets his terms and conditions. "We would love to get paid as top cricketers," Sandhu added.
