World number 50 Kazakh tennis player Yulia Putintseva ranted at her coach Roman Kisliansky  during her first-round defeat at the Connecticut Open. "You never applauded me when I won the ball...You are too busy watching your videos about the flat Earth," she said. Putintseva further called her coach "crazy", and told him to wipe the idiotic grin off his face.
