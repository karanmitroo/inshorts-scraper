Indian opener Rohit Sharma, who got out for a golden duck against South Africa on Wednesday, now has four ducks in T20Is, the most by an Indian batsman. Rohit surpassed veteran all-rounder Yusuf Pathan and former fast bowler Ashish Nehra, who had been dismissed for zero three times each. Overall, it was Rohit's 20th international duck and fifth golden duck.
