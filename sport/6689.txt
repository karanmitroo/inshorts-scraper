Boxer Vijender Singh's next bout, originally scheduled on April 1, has been postponed since organisers are unable to find an opponent for him. "Because of his unbeaten record...boxers in the region seem to be wary of facing him," Vijender's promoter Neerav Tomar said. Vijender was supposed to fight China's WBO Oriental champion Zulpikar Maimaitiali, who pulled out of the event.
