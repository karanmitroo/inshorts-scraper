Sports Authority of India (SAI) has decided to install CCTV cameras in its nine regional centres across the country, following wrestler Narsingh Yadav's doping controversy. SAI has also released an order banning athletes from cooking in their rooms or entering the mess kitchen. Narsingh had accused a junior wrestler of spiking his food, which resulted in his four-year doping ban.
