Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios played a between-the-legs passing shot to win a point against 18-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer in Miami Open semifinals on Saturday. Approaching the net after Federer's drop shot, Kyrgios hit the ball from between his legs into the open court to Federer's right. The 21-year-old, however, lost the match to Federer in three sets.
