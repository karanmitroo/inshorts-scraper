BCCI has hiked the pay of Grade A+ cricketers from ₹2 crore to ₹7 crore in the new contract system announced today. The newly incorporated A+ bracket includes Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah. This comes after Kohli and former coach Anil Kumble appealed for a pay hike for players to match international standards.
