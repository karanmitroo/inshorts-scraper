Kuwaiti shooter Fehaid al-Deehani has refused to carry the Olympic neutral team flag at the Rio Olympics’ opening ceremony, saying, “I am a military man and I will only carry the Kuwait flag”. Kuwait has been suspended three times since 2007 by the International Olympic Committee over alleged government interference, forcing Kuwaiti athletes to compete under the neutral flag.
