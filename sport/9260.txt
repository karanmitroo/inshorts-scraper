James Anderson, speaking at the end of day press conference, said Indian pitches take Virat Kohli's technical deficiencies out of the equation. "There's not that pace in the wicket to get the nicks, like we did against him in England, with a bit more movement," the pacer added. Kohli had averaged 13.40 in five Tests on the last England tour.
