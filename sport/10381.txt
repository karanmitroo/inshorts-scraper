Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane's son Luca Zidane, committed an error which led to an own goal during Real Madrid's UEFA Youth League away match against Legia Warsaw. The 18-year old, who plays as a goalkeeper, came out of the penalty area to push out a poorly hit cross but the ball looped over him and went inside the goal.
