Chelsea captain John Terry was presented with a custom-made WWE Championship belt after the London-based club won the Premier League title this season. The belt presented to Terry is an exact replica of the one held by current WWE champion Randy Orton. The former England team captain was also congratulated by 14-time World Champion Triple H on Twitter.
