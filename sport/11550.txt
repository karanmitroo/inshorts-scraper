England's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan and opening batsman Alex Hales have withdrawn from October's tour of Bangladesh because of security concerns. In the absence of Morgan, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler will lead England in the series, which includes three ODIs and two Tests. No international team has toured Bangladesh after 20 people were killed in a siege in Dhaka in July.
