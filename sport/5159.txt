Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan became the first pair to share three century partnerships in Champions Trophy history, following their 136-run stand against Pakistan on Sunday. Their previous two century stands came in Champions Trophy 2013, against South Africa and West Indies. This is also the third time Dhawan and Rohit have had century partnerships in back-to-back matches.
