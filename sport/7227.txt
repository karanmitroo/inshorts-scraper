Australian spinner Steve O'Keefe credited former Indian spinner Sridharan Sriram for his spell in Pune. O'Keefe called Sriram his biggest influence and an excellent spin bowling coach. "I've worked with him a couple of times now and he's really impressive. He gets it, he understands how to bowl in these conditions, he understands what batsmen are thinking", said O'Keefe.
