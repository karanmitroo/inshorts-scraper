England all-rounder Moeen Ali was slammed by a few Twitter users after he posted a tweet asking people to bid for a sketch of Viv Richards, which was painted by him. People criticised Ali saying the painting was against Islamic traditions and he would be punished for his "sins". "Ur intentions are clean but avoid haraam ways," wrote a user.
