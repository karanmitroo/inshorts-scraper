The Australian duo of Morgan Ruig and Evan Shay, who posed as the Australian golf team participating in a golf event in North Korea, have refused to apologise for their prank. The state reportedly demanded an official apology from the duo after their prank. "Years of hard labour in a North Korean prison doesn't exactly appeal", said Ruig.
