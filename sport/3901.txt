All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who received one Test match suspension after the second India-Sri Lanka Test, tweeted a dialogue from Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol starrer Dilwale in an apparent response to the ban. The dialogue meant, "The entire world has gone notorious when I decided to turn good." Jadeja was named Man of the Match in the second Test.
