Hungarian Karoly Takacs (1910-1976) won two Olympic gold medals while shooting with his left hand, after he lost his right hand while serving in the Army during World War II. Takacs, who lost his shooting hand to a grenade explosion, also set a world record in pistol shooting during the 1948 Summer Olympics.
