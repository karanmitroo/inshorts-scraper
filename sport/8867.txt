The tradition of biting medals possibly stems from the age-old practice of testing whether something was really gold or not by biting it. Since gold is softer than tooth enamel, biting it would leave teeth marks on it. Even though Olympic gold medals today are not made of solid gold, the tradition has lived on as photographers find it interesting.
