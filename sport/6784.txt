Nuclear hit-Fukushima in Japan will host baseball and softball matches at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, organisers have announced. Fukushima was affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which caused a nuclear disaster at a power plant, reportedly the worst since the 1986 Chernobyl accident. The Azuma Baseball Stadium, 70 kilometres from the plant, will host the matches.
