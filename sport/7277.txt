Former Australian captain Allan Border on Thursday slammed opener Matt Renshaw for retiring ill midway through his innings due to a "stomach bug" on Day 1 of the Pune Test. When Renshaw left the field, Border said, "I hope he's lying on the table in there half dead... Otherwise, as captain, I would not be happy."
