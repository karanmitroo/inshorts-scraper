Former India opener Virender Sehwag, currently hosting the "Viru Ke Funde" web series, said Bollywood and cricket have no connection and are not dependent on each other. "In context of Indian Premier League, there is nothing that Bollywood is doing except buying teams because they have a lot of money. Cricket is separate and Bollywood is different," Sehwag added.
