Frederick L'Ecuyer, a referee in America's professional ice hockey league National Hockey League, yelled "F*ck you* at a player while officiating a match on Thursday. The referee had switched on his mic to announce a penalty but ended up abusing an unidentified player. On realising the faux pas, L'Ecuyer made his penalty announcement and continued with the match.
