Bayern Munich's supporters threw fake money on to the pitch during their Champions League match against Anderlecht in protest of high ticket prices. Bayern supporters, who were charged €100 (₹7,600) for their allocated tickets at the stadium, also displayed a banner that read, "Is your greed now finally satisfied?" Play was briefly delayed as the officials cleared the fake money.
