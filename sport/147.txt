A match between Juventus and Atalanta in Italy's top-tier football league Serie A was postponed after snow covered the pitch during blizzard-like conditions. Reportedly, up to five centimetres of snow fell in 55 minutes, an hour ahead of the match's scheduled starting time. Juventus will play Atalanta in the Italian Cup semi-final second leg next Wednesday in the same stadium.
