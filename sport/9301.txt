Former English cricketer Geoff Boycott praised Virat Kohli's batting style, calling it "smooth, like milk chocolate". "It is all done because of the smoothness, the ease of the footwork and seeing the length so quickly. Kohli is a class player. For people who like Test cricket, you've got to watch him. It's a pleasure," said Boycott, following Kohli's century.
