Former Indian cricket team director Ravi Shastri has excluded former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly from his list of best Indian captains. The duo has been involved in a feud, since the time Shastri felt 'disrespected' by Ganguly for not being present during his interview for India's new coach. Ganguly, later said he was 'very saddened' by Shastri's personal attack.
