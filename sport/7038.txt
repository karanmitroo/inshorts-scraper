Spinner Parvez Rasool, who is the first cricketer from Jammu and Kashmir to represent India, has threatened to leave the state alleging lack of facilities. "We just have two wickets in entire Jammu and Kashmir, one in Jammu and another in Kashmir 300 kilometres apart," said Rasool. He added that he previously got offers from other states but ignored them.
