Qantas airline allegedly left out the luggage of onboard passengers and instead loaded the cricketing gear of the English cricketers who were not even on the flight travelling from Sydney to Wellington on Sunday. A passenger said even the Qantas staff in Wellington "seemed completely shocked" that no one's luggage had turned up. However, a Qantas spokeswoman denied the allegations.
