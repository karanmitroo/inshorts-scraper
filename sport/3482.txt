A kid asked Switzerland's Roger Federer, "I wanted to ask you, Switzerland is really cool, right? There isn't too much livestock, so why do they call you The GOAT?" Federer, who is known as the 'Greatest of All Time', said, "Some fans they call me that. I don't call myself that... Goats are also a part of the livestock there."
