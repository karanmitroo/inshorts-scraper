Netherlands' Germaine de Randamie became the first winner of the UFC women's featherweight championship after a second-round victory over Holly Holm at the UFC 208 in Brooklyn, New York. "She didn't want to fight me. I hoped she was going to fight me. Holly was a tremendous champion, but I love to brawl," said De Randamie after her win.
