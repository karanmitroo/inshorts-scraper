Lifeguards used a drone to help rescue two young swimmers from rough seas off the northern coast of New South Wales in Australia on Thursday. The two teenagers were trapped amid 10-foot waves, when the drone dropped a flotation pod which helped them make it back to the shore. The entire process took just 70 seconds, an official said.
