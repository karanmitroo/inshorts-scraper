BCCI chief Anurag Thakur announced that the test match fees of Indian players will be doubled to make the format financially attractive. The cricketers were receiving ₹7 lakh for a Test, but will now earn ₹15 lakh. "If we need to keep the players' interest in Tests alive, we'll have to ensure that Test players are better paid," mentioned Thakur.
