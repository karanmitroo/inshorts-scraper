US-based production house Universal Pictures will make a documentary on Arsenal's 1989 Premier League (then First Division) title win. Arsenal, who won their final match 2-0 against Liverpool at Anfield, clinched the trophy by virtue of scoring more goals than Liverpool. Arsenal's then-manager George Graham and match's goalscorers, Michael Thomas and Alan Smith, will be a part of the film.
