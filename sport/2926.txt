Speaking at an event, former Pakistani captain Shahid Afridi addressed the audience with, "Assalamualaikum, just like my batting I won't take up much of your time." Afridi once held the fastest ton record in ODIs with his 37-ball ton against Sri Lanka in 1996. Conversely, he also holds the record for the second-most number of duck dismissals in ODI cricket.
