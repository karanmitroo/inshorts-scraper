David Warner has said that he remains good friends with Virat Kohli despite a bitterly fought Test series which ended with Kohli saying he was no more friends with some of the Australian cricketers. "I had a chat with Virat. We are still friends, thankfully. I had a text conversation with him which is very nice of him," said Warner.
