An American news website mistakenly used World Cup-winning German footballer Lukas Podolski's picture in an article on smuggling of migrants, titled 'Spanish Police Crack Gang Moving Migrants on Jet-Skis'. In the picture, Podolski can be seen sitting behind a jet ski making a peace sign. The site was slammed on Twitter, but is yet to issue a clarification.
