Argentine football legend Diego Maradona ran a football clinic for students at a school in Barasat near Kolkata on Tuesday. Over 60 children were trained by Maradona for over 90 minutes while close to 7,000 people cheered on from the stands. The 57-year-old also entertained the crowd by singing a Spanish song, with Kochi-based singer Charles Anthony playing the guitar.
