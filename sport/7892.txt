The toss in the Harare Test between Pakistan and Zimbabwe on January 31, 1995, had to be done twice after Pakistan captain Saleem Malik called 'bird' instead of heads or tails. The coin had an eagle, Zimbabwe's national bird, inscribed on one side. Malik opted to bat as the 'bird' turned up but match referee refused to acknowledge the call.
