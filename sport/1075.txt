A footballer from Saudi Arabia is facing jail for dabbing during a match, as the act is illegal in the country. The footballer was seen dabbing near the technical area while rejecting a high-five from another player on the substitutes' bench. Dabbing is strictly forbidden in Saudi Arabia by authorities because of its perceived link to drug use.
