Eighty-three-year-old Argentine Ana Obarrio de Pereyra Iraola revived her dream of playing competitive tennis after taking part in and winning the Argentina Senior Masters tennis tournament. Iraola, who has 10 children and 37 grandchildren, was barred from playing tennis in the late 1940s by her husband who did not like her playing mixed doubles with men.
