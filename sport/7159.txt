Indian opening batsman Murali Vijay has said that the Indian cricket team won't be 'butterfingers' in the second Test against Australia at Bengaluru. India had dropped Australian captain Steve Smith  four times during his 109-run knock in Australia's second innings in the Pune Test. "We are looking forward to this game and start fresh," Vijay said about the upcoming Test.
