Former Australian captain Steve Waugh has claimed that Ravichandran Ashwin is the 'Don Bradman of bowling' and said that he is the player Australia would need to overcome during its upcoming tour of India. "India are playing very well at the moment and are a very settled side. Everyone is very comfortable in their roles," Waugh said about the tour.
