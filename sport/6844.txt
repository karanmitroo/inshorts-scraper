ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar has resigned from his post with immediate effect. In his resignation sent to ICC CEO Dave Richardson, Manohar said it was not possible for him to hold the office due to personal reasons. Former President of the BCCI, Manohar became ICC's first independent chairman in May 2016 for a two-year term, succeeding N Srinivasan.
