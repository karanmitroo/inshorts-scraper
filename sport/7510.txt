Tennis commentator Doug Adler, who was fired by sports broadcaster ESPN for allegedly calling Venus Williams a "gorilla", sued the channel in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Adler alleged he used the term "guerilla", which was confused with the racist comment, to describe the American's aggressive play. The commentator's lawyer has said his client was "wrongly terminated" by the company.
