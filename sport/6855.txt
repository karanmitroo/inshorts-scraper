Shane Warne has said Sachin Tendulkar looked like a 10-year-old when he first saw him. "When I first saw Sachin in 1991 he seemed like a 10-year-old, and he then went on to make an unbelievable hundred. It was only after eight years that I got to play against him in India," said Warne, who first played Sachin in 1992.
