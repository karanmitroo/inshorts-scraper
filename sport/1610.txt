Ahead of the year-end Dubai Superseries Finals, Indian shuttler Kidambi Srikanth said, "It is more important for me to win the Superseries Finals rather than becoming world number one." Srikanth, who is ranked world number four and missed last two tournaments due to a thigh muscle strain, said, "If I can...win the tournament, I can definitely be world number one."
