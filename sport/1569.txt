Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was slammed by several fans on social media after he shared a picture of himself smoking hookah at his farmhouse. A supporter wrote, "Kids idolise you. Very wrong picture and caption." "Jaddu you're a role model to youngsters. Plz don't promote such things on the name of swag and style," commented another user.
