Former Manchester United footballer David Beckham took seven days to build a Lego Disney castle for his daughter Harper Beckham. A week earlier, Beckham had posted a photo of himself trying to build the castle, captioned, "Page 1 of the Disney castle, 4000 pieces 490 pages of instructions I look confused but I'm so excited."
