Ex-world number one shot-putter Manpreet Kaur has reportedly tested positive for a banned substance at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar and the Inter-State meet in Guntur. Earlier, Kaur had failed a test for the same substance at the Asian Grand Prix and Federation Cup. All four cases will be treated as one, as per a National Anti-Doping Agency official.
