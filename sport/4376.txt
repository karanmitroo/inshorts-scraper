Indian women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj has said it is a privilege for her to have become the all-time highest run-scorer in women's ODI cricket, following her 69-run innings on Wednesday. The 34-year-old, who set the record while playing against Australia in the Women's World Cup, also became the first-ever female cricketer to score 6,000 runs in women's ODIs.
