The Chelsea football players including goalscorers Diego Costa and Eden Hazard paid tribute to teammate Willian's mother, who passed away this week, by making a 'W' during their goal celebrations against Leicester City. Willian did not feature in the Chelsea lineup against the Premier League defending champions on Saturday as a result of the personal tragedy.
