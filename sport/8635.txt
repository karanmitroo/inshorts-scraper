Australian-born ultra-marathon runner Dion Leonard has been able to reunite with the stray dog who had accompanied him for several days during an ultra-marathon through China's Gobi desert. The 42-year old runner launched a crowdfunding campaign in order to cover the costs of bringing back the dog, whom he named 'Gobi', after it had disappeared earlier.
