Gymnast Dipa Karmakar's coach Bisheshwar Nandi has said they'll be using the money they get instead of the BMW, to attend international events. "We will buy a relatively cheaper car, and use rest of the funds for Dipa's travel expenses for events, and other expenses like physiotherapy," said Nandi. Dipa had returned the Tendulkar-presented car and asked for cash instead.
