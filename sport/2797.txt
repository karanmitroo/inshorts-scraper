Former cricketer Virender Sehwag has said he was not surprised at pacer Ashish Nehra's inclusion in the Indian T20I squad as he feels Nehra is almost as fit as captain Virat Kohli. Sehwag added 38-year-old Nehra spends around eight hours in the gym every day and passed the "yo-yo" endurance test with a score almost at par with Kohli's score.
