Spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who missed the Indian Premier League 2017 due to injury, said, "I might be able to throw something new in this tournament (Champions Trophy), hopefully. I am equipped enough to do so." The 30-year-old also claimed that IPL has proved to be beneficial for not only Indian players but also cricketers from overseas.
