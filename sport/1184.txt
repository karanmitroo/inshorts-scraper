Cricket legend Don Bradman reversed the Australian batting order to protect batsmen from 'wet' wicket in the second innings of the third Ashes Test in 1937. The innings was opened by Australia's tail-enders while Bradman came to bat at number seven on January 4, and scored 270(375). Bradman's knock was later named by Wisden as the greatest in Test cricket.
