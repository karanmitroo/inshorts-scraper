Playing for the England Under-20 side, Chelsea youth team defender Fikayo Tomori scored an own goal from almost 50 yards out in the Under-20 fixture against Guinea on Monday. Leading 1-0 in the 58th minute, Tomori decided to pass the ball back to the goalkeeper, who missed it while trying to clear it away from the defensive area.
