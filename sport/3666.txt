England captain Joe Root scored his 11th 50-plus score in 11 consecutive matches, against Windies on Thursday, becoming the sixth batsman to record 50-plus scores in 11 or more consecutive Tests. Root equalled the record of Indian batsmen Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, and is just one behind South Africa's ODI skipper AB de Villiers' record of 12.
