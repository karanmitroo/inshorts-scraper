Former Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson has slammed Virat Kohli claiming that Kohli's actions were those of the worst behaved player. "He's one of the best players...but you've got to behave as a captain better than that," Lawson added. He also expressed surprise that Kohli was not penalised for his on-field conduct in the ongoing India-Australia Test series.
