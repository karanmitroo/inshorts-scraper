Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq took a diving catch to dismiss Australia's Usman Khawaja during the ongoing Brisbane Test on Saturday. During the 37th over of Australia's second innings, Khawaja pulled a delivery by pacer Rahat Ali towards mid-wicket, while the 42-year-old Pakistani skipper, stationed at mid-on, ran to his left to take a diving catch. Khawaja was dismissed for 74 (109).
