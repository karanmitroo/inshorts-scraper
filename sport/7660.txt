Former Pakistani captain Javed Miandad has claimed that Pakistan cricket's decline has been due to the foreign coaches who have been employed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Miandad, who coached Pakistan thrice in 1999, 2000 and 2003/04, had given the PCB a comprehensive restructuring plan to solve Pakistan cricket's problems during his time as PCB's cricket director.
