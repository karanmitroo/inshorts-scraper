Wishing New Zealand cricketer Ross Taylor on his 33rd birthday, Virender Sehwag posted his message on twitter along with a collage of men wearing torn clothes, asking Taylor to stitch their clothes. Sehwag wrote, "Happy B'day @RossLTaylor. You have stitched some of the best partnership's for NZ Taylor ji, but these are the guys who need your help the most."
