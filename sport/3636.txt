Qatar will build a stadium shaped like an Arabian cap for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, according to the organisers. "This symbolic design embodies everything that unites us as Arabs and Muslims, and is a fitting tribute to the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East," they added. Qatar is building at least eight air-conditioned stadiums for the tournament.
