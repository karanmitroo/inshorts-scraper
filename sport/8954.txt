Players of Mumbai's 2015-16 Ranji Trophy-winning team have been asked by the Mumbai Cricket Association to take a bonus cut to accommodate coach Chandrakant Pandit's incentive. The coach was earlier awarded ₹5 lakh, which was later raised to the players' level. To raise the additional ₹25 lakh, MCA circulated a letter stating the amount will be recovered from the players.
