Former heavyweight champion and WWE wrestler Brock Lesnar has been flagged for doping by the US Anti-Doping Agency, just a week after his return to the Ultimate Fighting Championship after a five-year gap. Lesnar could face suspension from UFC and WWE if the violation is confirmed, besides being asked to forfeit the $2.5 million he won at UFC 200.
