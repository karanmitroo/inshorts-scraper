Fans of Polish club Legia Warsaw, which was playing its first UEFA Champions League match in 20 years, used pepper spray on security guards during its 0-6 home defeat handed by Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. Reportedly, a group of balaclava-clad Legia fans attacked guards when the latter restricted them from entering the enclosure meant for away fans.
