Mohammad Ali, a right-arm fast bowler from Karachi, took a 10-wicket haul in a three-day U-19 tournament, comprising nine bowled dismissals and one LBW. Ali's ten-wicket haul in the innings came within nine overs, in which he conceded only 12 runs. However, since the tournament does not have first-class status, no official record would be credited to Ali.
