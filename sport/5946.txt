The Cricket Club of India changed its rules to allow Sachin Tendulkar, who was then 14 years old, to use its dressing room. CCI was urged to induct Tendulkar as a playing member of the club's team by Indian players who had seen him bat. They then changed their rule, which allowed only those above 18 to use the facilities.
