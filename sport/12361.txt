Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain became the third most expensive football player after completing a $98.9 million (nearly ₹665 crore) switch to Juventus. The amount paid by Juventus is reportedly $6 million shy of the world’s second-highest transfer fee paid by Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo. Notably, Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, with a $110 million transfer fee, is the world's most expensive player.
