Following Pakistan's ODI series loss against Australia, ex-cricketer Abdul Razzaq said that it is very painful to see the current situation of Pakistan cricket. "For Pakistan to reach...a stage of being not sure of qualifying for the World Cup is bad," he added. Razzaq further said the players are mentally weak and it is no longer the "real Pakistan team".
