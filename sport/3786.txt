Ryan Atkin became England's first openly gay professional football referee after he revealed his sexual orientation earlier this week. The Football Association welcomed the Atkin's revelation. Atkin said football still has a problem with homophobia but insists it is taking steps forward to tackle it. Earlier, Spanish referee Jesus Tomillero had received death threats after revealing his sexuality.
