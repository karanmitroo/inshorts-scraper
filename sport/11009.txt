Toftesund, manager of Norwegian football club Nordstranda, has posted a video on Facebook asking Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to donate their sperms so he can create the 'world's best team'. Tofte said in the video that he was tired of his "bad players" and would "make the team's girlfriends pregnant" if somebody could help him reach Zlatan and Ronaldo.
