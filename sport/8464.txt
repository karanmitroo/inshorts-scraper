Spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has said he will need to "adjust" his style of playing under new captain Virat Kohli. "It will be different in terms of interactions...Virat, on occasions, can be a little aggressive and that's one thing I need to try and adjust to...Giving those extra runs to get a wicket is not such a bad thing," he said.
