Indian batsman Virat Kohli became the first Indian captain to score a century and a duck in the same Test match. Kohli's nine centuries and five duck dismissals in international cricket this year are the most international centuries and ducks for him in any year. Kohli also became the joint-fastest alongside Hashim Amla to reach 50 international centuries.
