Three-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has said there need to be "more ladies in the paddock" when asked what he would want in the Championship. "A Miami race and more ladies in the paddock...there's too many dudes," said Hamilton. Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo wished for "no more electric engines", while Fernando Alonso suggested that teams have equal engines.
