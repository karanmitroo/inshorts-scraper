Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal's coach Vimal Kumar has blamed "poor" scheduling of the matches for Saina's World Championships semi-final loss. Vimal said Saina did not get enough time to recover for the semi-final match as she had a late quarter-final, and had to play the next match in the morning. "Scheduling should not be dictated by TV," Vimal added.
