Praising MS Dhoni's contributions, former captain Sourav Ganguly said, "Such players who have contributed to their country so immensely just can't be asked to go one fine day because they will keep proving people wrong". "Dhoni's real challenge will be when he starts playing better sides and, hopefully, he will raise the bar then too," added Ganguly.
