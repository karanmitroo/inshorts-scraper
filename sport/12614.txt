Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova will not participate in the Rio Olympics, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport delayed its decision on her doping ban. Sharapova had filed an appeal in the CAS after the International Tennis Federation handed her a two-year ban for failing a dope test in January. The verdict is now expected in September.
