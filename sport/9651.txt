Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has backed Ajinkya Rahane, saying that he is "as good as Virat Kohli in Tests". Ganguly mentioned that Rahane is an integral part of the Indian team and he should not think much about his poor form. Rahane has managed to score 63 runs in the five innings in the ongoing Test series against England.
