Canada was ousted from Davis Cup 2017 after Canada's Denis Shapovalov was defaulted for unsportsmanlike conduct after smashing the ball into umpire Arnaud Gabas' eye in the decisive fifth rubber against Great Britain. After losing a point against Kyle Edmund on his own serve, Shapovalov hit the spare ball towards the crowd, striking the chair umpire in the eye.
