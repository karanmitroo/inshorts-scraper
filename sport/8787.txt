Melbourne Stars' Kevin Pietersen used a bat covered with Rhino stickers in the Big Bash League match on Sunday against Melbourne Renegades. Pietersen used the special bat to raise awareness against the poaching of rhinos, one of the most endangered animals in the world. "Poaching our beautiful animals disgusts me & I'm all for helping them," tweeted Pietersen.
