English striker Andre Gray left Burnley for a fee of £18.5 million (₹154 crore) after his girlfriend Leigh-Anne Pinnock was reportedly blocked from sitting in Burnley's director box. According to reports, Gray was unhappy after Burnley boss blocked Pinnock, who is a part of girl band Little Mix, from sitting in the box as she was "too famous".
