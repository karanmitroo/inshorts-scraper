Short-track speed skater Semen Elistratov, who became the first athlete from Russia to win a medal at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, dedicated his bronze to his "unfairly" banned compatriots. Russia was banned from the Winter Olympics over state-sponsored doping at the Sochi Games in 2014. Elistratov is among Russian athletes cleared to compete in the Games as independents.
