Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, former batsman Sachin Tendulkar named the former South African captain, Hansie Cronje as the most difficult bowler he faced. Cronje, who had dismissed Sachin several times in his career, was banned from cricket for life due to his role in a match-fixing scandal and later died in a plane crash in 2002.
