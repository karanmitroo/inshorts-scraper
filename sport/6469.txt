Rio Olympics silver medallist PV Sindhu said her India Open contest against compatriot Saina Nehwal was "just another match". "She (Saina) is not special that I have to win against her. She is like another player whom I have to play," Sindhu added. Sindhu had beaten Saina in straight sets in the tournament quarterfinal on Friday.
