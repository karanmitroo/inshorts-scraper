Delhi HC has quashed DDCA's decision to remove the three selectors chosen at the instructions of court-appointed observer Justice Mukul Mudgal, saying it amounted to contempt and the association had "crossed its limit". Maninder Singh, Atul Wassan, and Nikhil Chopra had been appointed by the selection panel keeping in mind the recommendations of the Lodha Committee.
