Chinaman bowling was coined after an incident relating to former Caribbean spinner Ellis Achong, the first Chinese-origin Test player. After Achong got English batsman Walter Robins stumped, the batsman left the crease cursing, "Fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman," to which West Indies' Learie Constantine replied, "You mean the bowler or the ball," thus, coining the term.
