Spain's public prosecutor has demanded footballer Neymar to be sent to prison for two years for his part in a corruption case. The case is regarding Neymar's transfer from Brazilian club Santos to FC Barcelona in 2013, in which the Spanish club concealed the real transfer fees. Lionel Messi was sentenced to 21 months in prison for tax fraud earlier.
