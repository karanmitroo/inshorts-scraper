Twenty-year-old American gymnast Simone Biles, who won four gold medals at Rio Olympics, took to Twitter on Monday to reveal that she was sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team physician Larry Nassar. Nassar, who has been accused of sexual assault by multiple American female athletes, was sentenced last month to 60 years in prison on federal child pornography charges.
