Ajinkya Rahane has revealed that he takes 100 catches in every practice session to improve his fielding. Rahane said that he decided to do so when India toured Sri Lanka in 2015. "I used to get shifted from one position to another which hurt me a lot. I wanted to be one of the best in slip quadrant," he added.
