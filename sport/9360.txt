Australian opener David Warner scored his seventh ODI century of the year against New Zealand on Friday, to be joint-second with Sourav Ganguly for most centuries in a calendar year. This is Warner's fourth century in his last six innings, and 11th overall in 86 ODI innings. Warner is now the first Australian to score centuries in consecutive ODIs twice.
