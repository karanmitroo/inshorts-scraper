Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal has denied allegations of illegal doping, after hacking of World Anti-Doping Agency records revealed he was given Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) for consuming otherwise prohibited substances. “The two times the leak mentions in 2009 and 2012, I was taking medication for my knees and it was with authorisation,” he said.
