The International Pole Sports Federation (IPSF) is aiming to get the sport recognized by the International Olympic Committee. The IPSF's Olympic Sub-Committee had earlier been officially confirmed as a signatory of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code. The federation had established the World Pole Sports Championships in 2012 in order to increase the sport's awareness across the globe.
