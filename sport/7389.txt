Swiss tennis star Roger Federer took his Australian Open 2017 trophy to the snow-covered Swiss Alps. The 35-year-old posted his picture alongside the trophy on Facebook and captioned it, "Always wanted to take the trophy to the top of a Swiss mountain". Notably, Federer became the second oldest man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title.
