A non-profit organisation, Colour Blind Awareness, has urged the English board to reconsider use of pink ball, which it said was difficult to spot for colour blind people. The group stated there were over three million colour blind people in England and the use of pink ball was unreasonable. Notably, England became the third country to host a day-night Test.
