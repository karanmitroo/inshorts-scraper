Wishing the Indian women's team ahead of the World Cup final, former men's team captain MS Dhoni advised the team to embrace the occasion and not focus on the result. "Enjoy the moment because that's what cricket is all about. It's a sport...it's meant to be enjoyed," Dhoni added. India Women played their second World Cup final on Sunday.
