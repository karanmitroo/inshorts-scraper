Peruvian-American middle-distance runner David Torrence, who represented Peru at the Rio Games in 2016, has been found dead at the bottom of a swimming pool in Arizona. The 31-year-old, who won silver for the USA at the World Relay Championships in 2014, held the American national record for the 1000-metre indoor, and several Peruvian national records.
