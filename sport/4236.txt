A group of men were arrested after allegedly threatening and trying to barge into cricketer Mohammed Shami's Kolkata residence on Saturday. The incident happened after Shami's car, being driven by his driver, almost collided with a motorbike parked near the pacer's house, leading to an argument. The men later manhandled Shami's gatekeeper, after which the player's wife filed an FIR.
