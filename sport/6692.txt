Russian football fans have warned Englishmen of violence if they visit the country next year for the FIFA World Cup. Russian and English fans were involved in violent clashes in Marseille during the Euro Cup last year. "You think it was bad in France...wait until Russia...If the circumstances are right someone could get killed," a Russian mob leader said.
