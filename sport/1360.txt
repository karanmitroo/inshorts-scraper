India's stand-in captain Rohit Sharma made a wicket-keeping gesture after being dismissed in the second T20I against Sri Lanka to signal to the dressing room to send keeper MS Dhoni to bat at number three. Earlier, Indian coach Ravi Shastri was seen gesturing to Rohit from the dressing room asking who to send out to bat next.
