Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin revealed that his mother did not like his handwriting and his poor handwriting skills led to her not allowing him to sign on cheques. Ashwin, who uses different signatures for autographs and cheques, also revealed that he once had to correct his own signature after a fan said that his autograph was not legible.
