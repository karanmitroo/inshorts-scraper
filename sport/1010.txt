New Zealand captain Kane Williamson successfully held onto the ball one-handedly to dismiss Pakistan's Hasan Ali for 1(3) in the third ODI on Saturday. Ali mistimed the pull-shot off Colin Munro's bowling, with the ball going towards mid-wicket before Williamson dived and stretched his right hand to take the catch. With Ali's dismissal, Pakistan were reduced to 32/8.
