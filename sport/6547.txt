Delhi will not host any FIFA U-17 World Cup matches after Diwali, since the city is too polluted after the festival, FIFA's head of events, Jaime Yarza, has said. Delhi's last match will be on October 16, three days before Diwali, with eight matches being held in the city. The schedule was finalised following a seven-day visit by FIFA officials.
