Sania Mirza failed to win her seventh Grand Slam title as she and her Croatian partner Ivan Dodig lost the Australian Open mixed doubles final to the unseeded American-Colombian duo of Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal in straight sets. This is the second time Sania and Dodig finished second in a Grand Slam, after losing the 2016 French Open.
