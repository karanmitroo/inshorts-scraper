Mack Beggs, a 17-year-old transgender wrestler is being forced to compete against girls because of a policy in Texas in the US that requires students to compete against the gender listed on their birth certificates. Beggs was born female but is transitioning to male with the aid of testosterone therapy. Beggs said he would compete against boys if allowed to.
