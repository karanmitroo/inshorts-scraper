Former Australia captain George Bailey pulled off a one-handed leaping catch to dismiss Sydney Thunder opener Kurtis Patterson in the Big Bash League on Saturday. The 35-year-old Hobart Hurricanes captain, while fielding at the covers, moved to his right before diving and successfully completing the catch mid-air with his right-hand. Patterson was dismissed for 15 runs off 10 balls.
