Sri Lanka's chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya said the incident of fans hurling bottles at players in the third ODI was "the last straw" which caused his committee to resign. In the resignation letter, Jayasuriya further confessed that it was "particularly painful" to see the fans attack "our own players". "We go with our eyes full of tears," he added.
