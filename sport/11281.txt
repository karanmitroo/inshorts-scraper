Pakistan Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq has said politics should be kept out of sport, in reference to India-Pakistan cricket ties. "I would want to captain our side against India. But unless politics is kept away from cricket, there can't be a resumption of bilateral ties," added Misbah. India last played a home ODI series against Pakistan in 2012.
