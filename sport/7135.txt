In a BCCI video, opener KL Rahul has given a tour of Team India's practice session. Rahul explained how the team uses three nets to practice: one for pacers, one for spinners and the third for special skills, in which the support staff bowls to players using a stick. He added how players try to replicate match situations during nets.
