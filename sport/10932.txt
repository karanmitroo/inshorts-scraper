Tennis player Novak Djokovic has said he's no longer concerned about Grand Slam records or his number one rank, since the "must-win mindset is not working for me any more". "I play partly because I enjoy being successful and seeing the results of my work. But...that comes second," said Djokovic, who admitted to having "private issues" earlier this year.
