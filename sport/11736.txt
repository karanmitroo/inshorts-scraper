The Islamic State (IS) has banned football referees in one of its Syrian strongholds for upholding the rules of FIFA instead of the Sharia law. IS commanders reportedly said the referees "do not judge according to what Allah has revealed". They have also written new rules, which allow injured players to claim compensation or exact revenge on their opponents.
