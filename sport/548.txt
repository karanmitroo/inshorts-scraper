On February 6, 1958, a plane carrying 1956 and 1957 English champions Manchester United's players alongside staff and journalists, crashed while taking off from Munich, leaving eight players dead. The team, nicknamed 'Busby Babes', was returning after winning the European Cup quarterfinals. In their memory, a clock with '6 Feb 1958' written, was installed at Manchester United's home Old Trafford.
