Twenty-three-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams lost in her first match after giving birth to her first child in September. Williams was beaten by French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi. "I don't know if I'm totally ready yet or not. When I come back, I definitely want to be competing for championships," Serena said.
