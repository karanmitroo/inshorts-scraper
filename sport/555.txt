Following India's Under-19 World Cup triumph, coach Rahul Dravid said he has no regrets over not lifting the World Cup as a player. "Not lifting the World Cup (as a player) is not a pain for me anymore. I don't even think about it," he added. Dravid was part of India's squad for three World Cups (1999, 2003 and 2007).
