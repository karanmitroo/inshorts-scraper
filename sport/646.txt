During an ODI against Australia on January 31, 2010, Pakistan's stand-in captain Shahid Afridi was caught by cameras biting the ball which led to umpires changing the ball. Afridi, after the match, claimed that he was just trying to smell the ball. However, Afridi later pleaded guilty to ball tampering and was banned for two T20Is.
