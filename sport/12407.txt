The Old Trafford stadium in England has witnessed the least number of individual double centuries, among all major Test grounds in England. It witnessed its 6th double century after England's Joe Root crossed the 200-run mark against Pakistan on Saturday. Notably, Root became the first Englishman in 52 years to score a double century against Pakistan while playing at home.
