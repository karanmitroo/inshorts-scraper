Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova has been denied a wildcard for the French Open after failing to qualify on the basis of ranking points. "There cannot be a wildcard for return from doping," French Tennis Federation President Bernard Giudicelli said. Sharapova made a comeback from her 15-month dope ban last month, with other players protesting her return to competitive tennis.
