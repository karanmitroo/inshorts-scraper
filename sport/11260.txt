Motorcyclist Dougie Lampkin became the first man to wheelie around the Isle of Man's 60.725 kilometre-long course. Lampkin, a 12-time world champion trials rider, navigated over 200 corners and ascended 422 metres on the hind wheel of his specially modified motorbike. The 40-year-old, who finished the course in an hour and 35 minutes, spent seven months training for the attempt.
