Indian boxer Shiva Thapa ended his campaign at the Rio Olympics after losing 0-3 to Cuba's Robeisy Ramirez in the opening game of the men's bantamweight 56 kg event on Thursday. This was Thapa's second Olympic appearance after London 2012, in which he became the youngest Indian boxer to qualify for the Olympics, at an age of 18 years.
