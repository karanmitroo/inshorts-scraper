On being asked if he could beat the Kentucky Derby horses, eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt said he could defeat a derby horse in a race. "Me for sure hands down I put my money on me," Bolt said. "Without a head start, if we're going to 40-metres sure, maybe for London it's a different case," Bolt added.
