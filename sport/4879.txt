Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah had dismissed Pakistani opener Fakhar Zaman only for the decision to be cancelled as replays showed that the 23-year-old pacer had overstepped. Fakhar had poked the delivery outside the off stump and edged it to MS Dhoni, who alongside the other Indian fielders had begun celebrating Pakistan's first dismissal.
