Wishing ex-Australian pacer Brett Lee on his 41st birthday, ex-Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar shared a picture of himself with the former on a racing track. Tendulkar claimed he was better at car racing than Lee, tweeting, "Happy birthday, Binga...You were faster on the speed gun while bowling, but here I could give you a run for your money...see you soon."
