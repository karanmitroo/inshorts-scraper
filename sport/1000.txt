Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya got run-out in the second Test against South Africa after he failed to drag his bat across while returning to the striker's end. Pandya had reached the pitch's half-way length after having called Indian captain Virat Kohli for a run, before getting run-out off a direct hit from Vernon Philander.
