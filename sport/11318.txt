BCCI made over ₹111 crore surplus of income over expenditure in the last fiscal year. According to BCCI's Treasurer, the surplus dipped by around ₹55 crore as compared to the previous one. The drop has been attributed to the distribution of additional amount due to associations, additional payments to players and absence of income from the scrapped Champions League T20.
