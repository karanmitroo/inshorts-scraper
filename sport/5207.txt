Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis has said Virat Kohli is replaceable, but a player like Sachin Tendulkar can never be replaced. "There is always someone around the corner...to fill the gap...When Wasim Akram and I left, Shoaib Akhtar was around...But having said that, for some players like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara, there are no replacements," said Waqar.
