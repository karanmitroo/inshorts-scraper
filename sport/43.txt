Australian spinner Nathan Lyon will be sanctioned by the ICC for dropping the ball at South Africa's AB de Villiers after running him out in the first Test. Lyon, charged with a level one offence, reportedly contacted the SA batsman overnight to apologise for the incident. Meanwhile, Warner was also involved in an off-the-field verbal altercation with Quinton de Kock.
