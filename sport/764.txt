After CSK bought Harbhajan Singh for â‚¹2 crore in the IPL auction, the spinner took to Twitter to express gratitude and also used lyrics of a Tamil song. "I am happy that I will be playing for you. Let your soil make me a lion," a part of his tweet read. Harbhajan represented Mumbai Indians in IPL's first 10 seasons.
