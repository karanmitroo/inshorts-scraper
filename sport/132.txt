A woman wrestler and a boxer were attacked with acid by three persons on their way to a stadium in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut. The attack was led by a woman who had an argument with one of the victims when both of them were visiting their relatives in jail. The Supreme Court had banned open sale of acid in 2013.
