Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar did not play a single cover drive and mostly played shots on the on-side to score 241(436) against Australia on January 4, 2004. Having scored only 82 runs in the previous five innings and being dismissed to off-pitched deliveries, Sachin batted with restraint and a plan to neutralize the threat posed by off-pitched bowling.
