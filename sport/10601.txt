Ex-New Zealand player Scott Styris, who was commentating during the India-New Zealand ODI at Mohali on Sunday, walked out of the commentary box after India's Kedar Jadhav took a wicket. Styris had said he'd "walk out of the commentary box and take the first flight to New Zealand" if Jadhav took a wicket. Jadhav picked three wickets in the match.
