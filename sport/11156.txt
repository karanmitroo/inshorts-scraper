The Tripura and Vidarbha Cricket Associations became the first full members of the BCCI to adopt the Lodha Committee's recommendations. While the Tripura Cricket Association "unanimously" decided to amend its constitution in a special meeting on September 29, 727 of Vidarbha's 730 members voted in favour of the Lodha recommendations at an SGM on September 30.
