After Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest bowler to take 300 wickets in Test cricket, commentator Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Congratulations @ashwinravi99 , Doori badi jaldi tay Kar li. Wish you the very best always." Ashwin achieved the feat on Monday against Sri Lanka, reaching the 300-wicket mark in his 54th Test, surpassing former Australian pacer Dennis Lillee's record of 56 Tests.
