Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for ex-international footballer Hakan Sukur, for "membership in an armed terror organisation." Sukur, who has played for Inter Milan and Galatasaray, is being linked to a US-based Muslim cleric, who the establishment blames for last month's failed coup in the country. Sukur is a former member of parliament for the ruling AK party.Â
