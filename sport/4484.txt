Former Australian spinner Shane Warne is reportedly in talks to coach IPL team Rajasthan Royals, who will return to the tournament in 2018. Before being suspended in 2015 following the spot fixing scandal, Royals used to be coached by Rahul Dravid, who had joined Delhi Daredevils post the suspension. Warne had led RR to their maiden IPL title in 2008.
