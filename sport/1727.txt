Kashmiri footballer Majid Khan, who surrendered to the authorities one week after joining militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), has been released from police custody. He was sent outside J&K for education by his family. His father said that Khan has decided not to pursue football as a career for now and would be focussing entirely on his studies.
