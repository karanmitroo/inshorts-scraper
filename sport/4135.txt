Djibouti Football Federation has dissolved the country's senior national team in order to 'stop poor results'. The decision comes after Djibouti lost 5-1 against Ethiopia in their 2018 African Nations Championship qualifier match on Saturday. According to the officials, the federation will now focus on youth football and will participate in Under-15, Under-17 or Under-20 tournaments.
