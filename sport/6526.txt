Former footballer David Beckham has been criticised for calling Hong Kong China. Beckham spent two days in Shanghai and Hong Kong, following which he posted a Facebook video captioned, "Great 48 hours in China." Although the caption was later changed, a user posted, "We have our own government, currency, even Football Team!"
