A man from Austria has set a Guinness World Record by restraining four motorcycles with his hands and feet. The motorcycles, facing four different directions, were tied to Franz "Austrian Rock" Muellner's hands and feet during the successful record attempt. Restraining the motorcycles for 24 seconds, Muellner managed to set the world record for the longest duration restraining four motorcycles.
