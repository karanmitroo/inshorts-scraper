Brazilian police have arrested 10 alleged ISIS sympathisers, suspected of planning a terrorist attack during the Olympic games. Brazilian Justice Minister, Alexandre Moraes, described the suspects as “absolutely amateur and unprepared”. The minister added that the suspects had sworn allegiance to Islamic State, celebrated recent attacks in Orlando and Nice and had attempted to buy AK-47s online.
