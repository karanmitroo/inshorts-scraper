French footballer Antoine Griezmann has apologised on facing criticism on Twitter after he posted a picture of himself dressed as an African American basketball player. Griezmann, who deleted his tweet later, had painted himself black as part of a fancy-dress outfit. "I recognise it is clumsy on my part. If I have hurt anyone, I apologise," the Frenchman later tweeted.
