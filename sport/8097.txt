Switzerland's world number four Stanislas Wawrinka corrected a fan of his compatriot Roger Federer, during his pre-quarterfinal 2017 Australian Open match against Italy's Andreas Seppi on Sunday. The fan shouted, "Go Roger", to which Stan replied, "He's not here, he's on [the] Rod Laver Arena". Wawrinka has progressed to semifinals in the tournament.
