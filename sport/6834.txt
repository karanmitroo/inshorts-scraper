World champion cyclist Peter Sagan avoided crashing into a dog-walker during his time-trial race at the Tirreno-Adriatico in Italy. The 27-year-old cyclist had to stray onto the pavement as a woman was walking across a designated crossing point with her dog. Sagan has won the sprinters' category five straight times at the Tour de France.
