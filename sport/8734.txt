Former Indian pacer Chetan Sharma bowled out three New Zealand batsmen in three successive deliveries on 31 October 1987 in Nagpur, becoming the first bowler to take a hat-trick in a World Cup match. It was the first hat-trick taken by an Indian in international cricket. Sharma, who turned 51 on Tuesday, played 23 Tests and 65 ODIs for India.
