Dubbed the "world's blackest black", Vantablack absorbs 99% of the light that hits it, creating the illusion of a void. It is composed of carbon nanotubes which are spaced keeping 99.95% of the volume empty to allow light particles to enter, where light is repeatedly reflected until absorbed. A pavilion at 2018 Winter Olympics has been sprayed with Vantablack VBx2.
