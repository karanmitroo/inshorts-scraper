Mumbai Indians' all-rounder Kieron Pollard on Friday became the fifth batsman to score 7,000-plus T20 runs, achieving the feat during his knock of 70(47) against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Interestingly, Pollard is the first batsman to reach the 7,000-run mark without having a century to his name. Pollard's counterpart Chris Gayle, with 9,997 runs, is the leading run-scorer in T20 cricket.
