Samsung has released a new ad for the Rio Olympics, which combines the national anthems of 15 countries into a single anthem. The minute-and-a-half ad, created by Leo Burnett, begins with a young Australian girl singing Botswana's national anthem into a smartphone, which is followed by various people singing anthems from various countries around the world.
