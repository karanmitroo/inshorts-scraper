The Rising Pune Supergiant players wore black armbands as a gesture of respect for the passing away of the father of middle-order batsman Manoj Tiwary during their IPL fixture against Delhi Daredevils on Tuesday. The 31-year-old did not feature in the playing eleven because of the bereavement and was replaced by Rahul Tripathi, who made his debut for the side.
