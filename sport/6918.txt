The Supreme Court-appointed BCCI Committee of Administrators (CoA) has decided to revive radio commentary for India's matches. There has been no radio commentary for India's matches since India's series against Australia in 2012-2013, owing to a standoff between BCCI and AIR over revenue sharing. One of the suggestions states forming a panel of radio commentators, including former cricketers.
