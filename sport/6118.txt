New York City FC forward David Villa scored the longest goal in Major League Soccer since 2012, after netting a 53-yard volley from halfway up the field in the 90th minute against Philadelphia Union on Friday. The 35-year-old former Barcelona player revealed that he went for the goal from such a distance as he was "a little tired from running".
