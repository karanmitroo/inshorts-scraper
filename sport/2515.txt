Hasan Ali has become the first Pakistani pacer in 21 years to top the ICC ODI bowlers rankings. Before Ali, the only other Pakistani fast bowler to be top-ranked in ODIs was Wasim Akram, who last held the spot during the 1996 World Cup. The second spot in the rankings is currently held by Pakistan-born South African spinner Imran Tahir.
