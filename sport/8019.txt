Speaking about Australia's upcoming tour to India, former Aussie captain Ricky Ponting said, "It's become harder and harder for visiting teams. They (India) are probably making wickets to suit them more than ever before." The former cricketer gave his national team little chance of upsetting India, adding, "I think they'll struggle. Every team that goes there struggles."
