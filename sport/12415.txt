Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov reacted to Donald Trump's speech on Twitter, stating, "I’ve heard this sort of speech a lot in the last 15 years and trust me, it doesn’t sound any better in Russian." Kasparov, who was world's number one chess player from 1986 until his retirement in 2005, is currently Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation.
