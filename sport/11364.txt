Former Indian long-jumper, Anju Bobby George has said her rejection in procuring a TUE (Therapeutic Use Exemption) for her asthma condition cost her an Olympic medal. At the 2004 Athens Olympics' women's long jump final, Anju had an allergic reaction due to the dust in the practice area, which led to dizziness and stiffened muscles because of reduced oxygen flow.
