Bulgaria's 27-year-old Rio-bound wrestler Lyuben Iliev, who went missing earlier in July, will be replaced by Bulgaria's junior freestyle wrestling team coach, Valentin Raychev. Iliev, who was set to compete in the 125-kg category, went missing on July 4 after returning to Bulgaria following a training camp. Iliev was described by Raychev as being 'emotionally unstable'.
