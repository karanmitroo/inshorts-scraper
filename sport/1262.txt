Sri Lanka cricket coach Chandika Hathurusingha has banned his players from listening to music during training. Adding that the team wasn't doing "quite a few things right", Hathurusingha said, "If someone wants to listen to music during training, he can...go home." Sri Lanka lost 40 international matches in 2017, most by a team in a calendar year.
