Australian legend Sir Donald Bradman, who passed away at the age of 92 on February 25, 2001, developed his reflexes and hand-eye coordination by batting with a stump and a golf ball. Bradman used to hit the golf ball against a water tank with a cricket stump and practised fielding skills by throwing the ball against a wooden fence.
