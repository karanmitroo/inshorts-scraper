An Indian Navy team is set to scale Mount Everest as a part of its 'Sagar Tal se Sagar Matha (Seabed to Summit)' expedition. The 24-member team, with personnel from INS Chakra and INS Chennai, will plant an ice-axe on the 8,848-metre high peak. Earlier, the team took the ice-axe 40 metres below sea-level off Karwar in the Indian Ocean.
