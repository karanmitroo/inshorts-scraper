The Italian team, which failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 60 years, had already booked their accommodation in Russia for the 2018 tournament. Italy missed a berth after losing 0-1 to Sweden in the play-off. Denmark's football team is reportedly considering using Italy's accommodation, with most major teams having already locked their choices.
