Former South African captain Graeme Smith has said he is "not sure" if Virat Kohli is a "long-term captaincy option" for Team India. Smith added that Kohli's reaction to situations can sometimes have a negative impact on the team. "I think he needs someone in his environment who can constructively challenge him with different ideas...help him grow," Smith said.
