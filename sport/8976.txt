Expressing his disappointment at the exclusion of India's Test captain Virat Kohli from the ICC Test Team of the Year, BCCI President Anurag Thakur has asked the ICC to consider changing the award period. "It could be from January to January every year...If the No.1 Test team's captain is not considered, ICC must look into that," said Thakur.
