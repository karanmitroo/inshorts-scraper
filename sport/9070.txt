Indian batsman Karun Nair became the first cricketer to hit a triple ton in his maiden Test series, after going past the landmark in the fifth Test against England on Monday. Nair became only the third Test player after West Indies legend Garry Sobers (365*) and Aussie Bob Simpson (311) to convert their maiden Test century into a triple century.
