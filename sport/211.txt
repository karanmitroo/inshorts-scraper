The Pakistan Cricket Board has taken strict security measures in order to avoid a repeat of 2017's spot-fixing scandal that took place in the Pakistan Super League (PSL). The board has reportedly tied up with a website that will monitor any unusual betting trends in PSL's third edition. It has also imposed restrictions on players as part of the measures.
