Australian vice-captain David Warner trolled English TV presenter Piers Morgan by sending him a picture of himself and captain Steve Smith smiling following Australia's victory over England in the Adelaide Test. This comes in response to Morgan's tweets criticising the Australian team. In one of the tweets, Morgan had claimed that Smith had "blown" the match by not enforcing follow-on.
