Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag, who was accused of bullying Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur, has clarified that his recent tweet was not intended for her. "It was plain fun but people construed the other way," said Sehwag. Sehwag had tweeted a picture holding a placard which was similar to Gurmehar's placard holding video, which she had posted last year.
