Sachin Tendulkar recently suggested Ranji matches be played on two different pitches to prepare a better Test team. The first innings would be played on a green-top with Kookaburra ball to prepare for overseas conditions. The second innings would be played on a spinning track with SG ball to resemble Indian conditions. Such a setup would also nullify toss factor.
