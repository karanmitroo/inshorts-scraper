Tour de France defending champion Chris Froome was forced to run during the race after he crashed his bicycle into a motorbike. "I told myself, 'I don't have a bike and my car is five minutes behind with another bike, it's too far away, I'm going to run’,” said Froome, who retained the overall lead despite the crash.
