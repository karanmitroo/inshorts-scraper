Former cricketer Virender Sehwag played cricket with Belgium's King Philippe and Queen Mathilde and several school kids at the Oval Maidan in Mumbai, as part of an event organised by UNICEF. Sehwag also presented King Philippe with an autographed bat at the event. This was the King and Queen's first visit to India after Philippe ascended the throne in 2013.
