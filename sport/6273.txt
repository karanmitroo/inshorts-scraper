Former Rising Pune Supergiant captain MS Dhoni has been reprimanded by the match referee for breaching the IPL Code of Conduct's Article 2.1.1 during their match against Mumbai Indians on Thursday. The reprimand is speculated to be caused by Dhoni's mock DRS gesture after an LBW appeal during the game. Article 2.1.1 ensures professional standards of appearance on the field.
