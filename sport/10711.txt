Trenton Golden Hawks, a junior ice hockey team in Canada, will wear special jerseys in their game on Wednesday, to honour Harambe, the gorilla who was killed at Cincinnati Zoo in May. The commemorative #HockeyForHarambe jerseys will also be up for auction during the game. Harambe was shot dead by officials after a three-year-old kid fell inside his enclosure.
