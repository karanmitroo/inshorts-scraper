Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin congratulated Pakistan's Yasir Shah on Twitter when the latter overtook him as the fastest Asian to capture 100 Test wickets. "Just a little late I guess, but very well done @Shah64Y. Double it up now," wrote Ashwin. Shah reached the landmark figure in 17 Tests, making him the joint second-fastest bowler to take 100 wickets.
