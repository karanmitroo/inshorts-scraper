A 67th-minute free kick by Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford gave the Red Devils a 1-0 away win over Spanish club Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday. Rashford, who was denied a chance in the first half, produced a curler that struck just inside the far post, beating Celta keeper Sergio Alvarez.
