Former BCCI President Anurag Thakur on Thursday issued an "unconditional" and "unequivocal" apology in the Supreme Court to get relief from contempt proceedings initiated against him. Thakur was removed from his post by SC in January on charges of perjury and contempt of court, for filing a false affidavit regarding writing to the ICC about the implementation of Lodha reforms.
