English batsman Kevin Pietersen has been fined over â‚¹2.5 lakh (Australian $5,000) for calling an umpiring error an "absolute shocker" during the Big Bash League. Perth's Sam Whiteman was given not out following an appeal for a caught behind. Pietersen had then told the umpire, "He's got big gloves and pads to reach that," when the umpire denied the appeal.
