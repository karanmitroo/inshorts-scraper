The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has firmly opposed ICC's proposed World Test Championship, which was tentatively scheduled to begin in 2019. Earlier, in September, the ICC was forced to abandon plans for a two-division Test Championship after the idea was resisted by boards including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and India.
