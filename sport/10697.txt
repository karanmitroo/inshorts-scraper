British broadcaster Piers Morgan was trolled by Twitter users after the former tried to correct the spelling on Sehwag's tweet about India and England's Kabaddi World Cup match. "Piers Morgan when you can't win an argument, start correcting your opponent's grammar! #TwitterRules @virendersehwag", tweeted a user reacting to Morgan's tweet.
