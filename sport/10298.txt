Former Indian skipper Ravi Shastri stated that the BCCI should implement 85% of Lodha recommendations as problems could arise due to "practicalities" in the remaining 15%. Shastri also said that appointing only three national selectors would be wrong. "If you think BCCI was that bad, how come we won three World Cups," Shastri added on being asked about BCCI's administration.
