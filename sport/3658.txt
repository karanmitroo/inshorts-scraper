The Malaysian organisers of the Southeast Asian Games mistakenly printed the Indonesian flag upside-down in a souvenir guidebook. Following the gaffe, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said that the incident concerned "national pride", and called for an apology. Malaysia's foreign ministry and the organisers issued an apology and said that the guidebook will be reprinted.
