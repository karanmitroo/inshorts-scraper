Harbhajan Singh slammed former IPS officer from Gujarat Sanjiv Bhatt after he alleged there are communal differences in Indian cricket and asked if there are Muslims in the team. "Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians are all brothers. Every player in the team is an Indian and there's no place for discussions on basis of their caste or colour", tweeted Harbhajan.
