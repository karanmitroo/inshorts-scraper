Former Australian all-rounder Greg Chappell took his career-best Test and ODI figures on the same day and the same ground, eight years apart, on January 8. In 1973, Chappell took 5/61 in the first innings of the Sydney Test against Pakistan. In 1981, Chappell's figures read 9.5-5-15-5 as India were bowled out for 63, their then-record lowest total.
