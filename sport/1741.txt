Sourav Ganguly has revealed he risked his place in Team India to make sure Anil Kumble traveled for the Australian tour in 2003. Ganguly said he told selectors he will not sign the team sheet without Kumble in it. The selectors eventually agreed but told the then captain he would be the first to go if Kumble didn't play well.
