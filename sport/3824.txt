Pieces of a hockey artificial turf, known as Astroturf, are being used as doormats and carpets in a village in Rajasthan's Dausa. The turf had been lying for a year in a cleared ground, with a German hockey player intending to lay it to train children. However, the turf was cut up after the player left, following protests from locals.
