A group of students of the Ivy League University, Yale stripped off and stood naked atop a wall in the Harvard Stadium during a rugby match. This is reportedly a 40-year tradition called the 'Saybrook Strip', in which students strip off during the annual rugby game at the end of the third quarter. The game ended with Yale defeating Harvard.
