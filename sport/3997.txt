Virat Kohli kissed 81-year-old Sri Lanka team fan 'Uncle Percy' a day before the latter's birthday, after India defeated Sri Lanka in the first Test on Saturday. "Before the presentation, Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan came to me and wished me happy birthday. Then Kohli kissed me on my left cheek. I kissed him on both his cheeks," said Percy.
