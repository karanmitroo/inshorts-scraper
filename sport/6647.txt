The Supreme Court has directed the BCCI to release ₹2.5 crore for the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, which is hosting the fourth India-Australia Test at Dharamsala. BCCI's Committee of Administrators had earlier said HPCA was demanding funds despite having ₹65 crore in the bank. BCCI has also been asked to pay Maharashtra, Karnataka and Jharkhand for the recently-held India-Australia Tests.
