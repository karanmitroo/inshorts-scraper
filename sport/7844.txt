Indian batsman KL Rahul was clean bowled by England's Ben Stokes while attempting a slog in the Bengaluru T20I on Wednesday. The replays, however, showed the delivery was a no-ball as the bowler had overstepped the popping crease which the umpires failed to notice. Notably, the third-umpire Chettithody Shamshuddin was criticised after the last match as well after several errors.
