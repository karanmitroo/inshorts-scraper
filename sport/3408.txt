MS Dhoni took DRS to convert a wide into a wicket, during the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka on Thursday. In Sri Lanka's innings, debutant pacer Shardul Thakur bowled on the leg-stump which Niroshan Dickwella attempted to flick, with Dhoni appealing for a caught behind while the umpire called a wide. Dhoni reviewed, after which the umpire reversed his decision.
