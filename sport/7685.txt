Refuting his teammate Wasim Akram's claim that he had attempted to deny Anil Kumble the 10-wicket haul in 1999, former Pakistan pacer Waqar Younis tweeted, "@wasimakramlive This never happened!! I think age is catching up with Wasim Bhai #NotTrue." Wasim had earlier said that Waqar proposed getting run out to stop Kumble from taking the 10th wicket.
