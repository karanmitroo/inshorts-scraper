Somerset's Steven Davies scored seven runs off one ball during a match against English side Kent in a domestic T20 tournament on Thursday. Davies had taken three runs after hitting the ball to the covers before the wicketkeeper threw the ball back to the bowler. The bowler missed the ball, which went to the boundary, resulting in seven runs.
