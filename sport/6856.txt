Scott Marsden, a 14-year-old kickboxer from England, collapsed during an unsanctioned national title bout last week. Marsden was rushed to the hospital for urgent medical attention, where he later passed away. The British Kickboxing Council (BKC) had not sanctioned the event as it was an under-16 bout where fighters were allowed to kick and punch each other in the head.
