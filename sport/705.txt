Sri Lankan fast bowler Shehan Madushanka on Saturday became the fourth bowler in ODI history to take a hat-trick on debut. The 22-year-old picked up Bangladesh's last three wickets in three consecutive deliveries to help Sri Lanka win the tri-series final in Dhaka. Interestingly, three of the four hat-tricks taken by bowlers on ODI debut have come in Dhaka.
