Australian women's team spinner Amanda-Jade Wellington produced a dismissal during the Women's Ashes' Test which is being compared to Shane Warne's 'Ball of the Century'. Wellington's delivery dipped towards the leg stump before turning and taking the top of Englishwoman Tammy Beaumont's off stump, similar to how Warne dismissed Mike Gatting in the 1993 Ashes.
