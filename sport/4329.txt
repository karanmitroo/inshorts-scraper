Boxer Floyd Mayweather called Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor a "fa***t" and accused him of racism on the last leg of their three-country tour in London on Friday. "He totally disrespected black women. He called black people monkeys. Then he spoke disrespectfully to my mother and my daughter. There are certain levels you don't stoop to," said Mayweather.
