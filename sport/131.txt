After the official Twitter handle of Lord's Cricket Ground shared a picture of the stadium covered with snow, a user reacted, "Potential host for the next Winter Olympics." Other users tweeted, "They are so organised that even the snow settles gracefully," and, "Looks beautiful! They should have played cricket on ice at Lord's rather than Switzerland."
