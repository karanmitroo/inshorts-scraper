Football's first ever official green card was awarded to Vicenza attacker Cristian Galano in Italy's Serie B on Tuesday. The card, awarded for fair play, was given after Galano admitted that no opponent had touched the ball when the referee had incorrectly given a corner kick. The player with most green cards will be rewarded at end of the season.
