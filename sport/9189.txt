English cricketer Ben Stokes has accused the ICC of siding with Indian players regarding disciplinary issues. Stokes, who got a demerit point after his spat with Virat Kohli during the Mohali Test, said, "If it's going to be one rule, it's got to be the same for everyone...You can't be letting certain people get away with things and not others."
