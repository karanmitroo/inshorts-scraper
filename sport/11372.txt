Indian cricket team coach Anil Kumble has said the team has not demanded a turning pitch for the first Test against New Zealand, and added, "[w]hatever wicket we get, we will adapt and play". "The challenge is to adapt to the conditions as quickly as possible. Equally the same for the home team as well", added Kumble.
