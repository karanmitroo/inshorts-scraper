Ireland's 17-year-old left-arm bowler, Josh Little has withdrawn from the upcoming T20 international series against Afghanistan owing to his school commitments. "There were concerns about the time missed in what is a crucial period for Josh's education," said Ireland coach John Bracewell. Little, however, had taken a break from his schooling for an Under-19 tournament in Bangladesh last year.
