Hockey India President Narinder Batra has said sports are ignored by politicians as it does not fetch them enough votes. "State governments, except for a few, do not provide enough support and that results in a lack of funds... Federations need to take responsibility for their condition... Blaming the Sports Authority of India will not get us anywhere," added Batra.
