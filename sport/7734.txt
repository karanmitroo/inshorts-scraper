On February 6, 1958, a plane carrying Manchester United players, staff and journalists, crashed while taking off from Munich, leaving 23 people, including eight players, dead. The team, nicknamed the 'Busby Babes', was returning after playing a European Cup tie. In memory, a two-faced clock with '6 Feb 1958' written, was installed at United's home stadium, Old Trafford, in 1960.
