The wax statue of India's first World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev was unveiled at the soon-to-be-launched Madame Tussauds museum in Delhi on Thursday. The statue, crafted from over 300 measurements and photographs, has been sculpted in Kapil Dev's bowling pose. It will be placed in an exclusive sports zone, alongside statues of Sachin Tendulkar, Lionel Messi and David Beckham.
