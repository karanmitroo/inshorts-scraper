Norwegian Olympic team, which arrived in Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, received 15,000 eggs instead of 1,500 it had ordered due to a translation error. Team Norway's caterers used 'Google Translate' to place the order and were surprisedÂ to see the hosts delivering half a truck load of eggs. "There was no end to the delivery," Team Norway chef said.
