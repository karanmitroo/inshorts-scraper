South Africa's AB de Villiers scored his 9,000th ODI run in his 205th innings on Saturday, breaking an all-time record of least matches played to reach the milestone. He broke former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly's record of 228 innings, set in 2004. With the achievement, De Villiers became only the second Protea and 18th overall to cross the 9,000-ODI-run mark.
