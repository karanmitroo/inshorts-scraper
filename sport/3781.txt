Indian openers, KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan, put up 188 runs on Saturday, the highest ever opening partnership by a visiting team in Sri Lanka. The duo surpassed the 171-run stand between Manoj Prabhakar and Navjot Singh Sidhu from July 1993. Notably, Dhawan went on to score his career's sixth Test century, his 5th ton away from home.
