South African pacer Kagiso Rabada claimed Dawid Malan's wicket with an inswinging delivery during the third Test against England on Thursday, and later lost his wicket to Stuart Broad in a similar fashion. Rabada dismissed Malan for 1(17) with a yorker which knocked the middle stump. In England's innings, Broad bowled a length delivery which knocked the left-hander's off stump.
