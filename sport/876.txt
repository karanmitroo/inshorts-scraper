Tonga's Pita Taufatofua, who carried the Tongan flag shirtless at the Rio Olympics, has qualified for the Winter Olympics as a cross-country skier. Taufatofua, who had never skied before last year, fought in taekwondo at the Rio Olympics. He drove over two hours through a blizzard in the Arctic Circle to reach the final qualification race attempt in Isafjordur, Iceland.
