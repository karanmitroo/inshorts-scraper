Pakistan cricket team's current limited overs captain Sarfraz Ahmed claims that the Indian cricket team is afraid of playing Pakistan which is why India is reluctant to hold bilateral ties against them. "We will try to win against India in the Champions Trophy but the main thing is for the team to fight for success against all teams," Sarfraz added.
