South African captain Faf du Plessis believes that the Australian team has been mentally scarred following their ODI series whitewash by the Proteas. The player claims that the Australians will be scared heading into next month's three-Test long series against the South African team. The series loss against South Africa was Australia's first ever 5-0 ODI series whitewash.
