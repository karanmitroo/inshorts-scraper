Indian batsmen batted against Rajasthan left-arm pacer Aniket Choudhary in the nets before the start of the Test against Bangladesh, a move aimed at preparing for Australia pacer Mitchell Starc. With the Indian pacers being predominantly right-armers, Choudhary will help the batsmen counter the angles created by the left-arm pacers. India take on Australia in Pune from February 23.
