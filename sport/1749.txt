Ex-India captain Sourav Ganguly has revealed ex-Pakistan captain Imran Khan's advise helped him when he was dropped from Team India in 2006. "He said, 'When you fly high and see dark clouds, you find a way to fly higher.' I remembered those words during that period," Ganguly said. Ganguly added he did not know the reason for not getting picked.
