American football player Tom Brady has challenged the "Madden Curse", associated with bringing bad luck to a player who features on the cover of video game Madden NFL 18. A video shows Brady saying he does not believe in curses by breaking other myths. He shatters glass and walks under a ladder, saying there's no such thing as a curse.
