Australian openers David Warner and Travis Head put up a 284-run stand in the final ODI against Pakistan on Thursday, missing the first-wicket partnership world record by two runs. Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga hold the record for the highest first-wicket stand of 286, scored against England in 2006. Warner-Head's partnership is also the fifth-highest in ODIs.
