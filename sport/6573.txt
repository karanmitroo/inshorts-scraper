Cricket Australia has released a video which reveals that Steve Smith asks the team physio to tape his shoelaces to his shin as he prepares to bat so he doesn't have to see them. Smith said the preparation method began during IPL 2016 when he found the pants of his Rising Pune Supergiant kit too tight to contain his laces.
