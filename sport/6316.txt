Pakistani captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who announced his retirement recently, responded with a philosophical statement in Punjabi to a journalist's question about Pakistan going from the top-ranked Test team to registering five defeats in a row. "If a man who has lived for 70 years can suddenly die one day, what's a team falling in the rankings in three months", replied Misbah.
