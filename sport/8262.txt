FIFA Technical Director Marco van Basten has suggested scrapping the offside rule and doing away with traditional penalty shootouts in football. According to van Basten, removing offside and modifying shootouts to introduce a hockey-like system of the player running in from 25 metres, will make the game more "interesting". He also suggested "orange cards" instead of red and yellow.
