Russia's Mariya Savinova-Farnosova has been stripped of her 800-metre London 2012 Olympic gold after the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday imposed a four-year ban saying there was "clear evidence" she used performance-enhancing drugs. All of Savinova's results from July 26, 2010, to August 19, 2013, have been disqualified, stripping off her 2011 world championships gold among other medals.
