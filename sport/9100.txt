KL Rahul became only the second Indian after Mohammed Azharuddin to be dismissed at 199 in Tests, getting caught off an Adil Rashid delivery during the ongoing Chennai Test on Sunday. Rahul, who would have scored the maiden double century of his career, is also the ninth batsman in Test history to fall short of 200 by one run.
