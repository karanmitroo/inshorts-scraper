Two early goals from Valencia, on Wednesday, handed Real Madrid their second league loss of the season. Valencia opened the proceedings with Simone Zaza's 4th-minute left-footed strike into the top-left corner, before doubling the lead with Fabio Orellana's goal from under the legs of the on-rushing goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Cristiano Ronaldo scored Madrid's solitary goal in the 44th minute.
