Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi is the only player to have played cricket for both India and England. Pataudi scored a century on his debut for England during the 1932-33 tour of Australia. In 1936, he was named the captain of India, but his first appearance for the Indian side came after 10 years in 1946 against his former team England.
