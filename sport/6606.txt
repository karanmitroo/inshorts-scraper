Playing for West Ham United against Wimbledon on March 26, 2000, Italian striker Paolo Di Canio scored a flying right-footed volley from an acute angle, which is considered among the best strikes in Premier League history. Di Canio managed his jump perfectly to meet Trevor Sinclair's cross-field ball first-time to fire in the volley with the ball at hip height.
