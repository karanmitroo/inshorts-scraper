Norway's Karsten Warholm asked a photographer to pinch him after he became his nation's first world track champion in 30 years, following his 400m hurdle gold at the World Championships on Thursday. "What's going on, is this real?", the 21-year-old asked the photographer, before saying, "Yes, it's real" and departing for his lap of honour in a Viking helmet.
