Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has revealed in his autobiography that he still "half-expects a text" from late cricketer Phil Hughes, who died after being struck by a bouncer in November 2014. "I never gave myself time to grieve for my mate. I'm thinking about Hughesy 24x7. I'm still half-expecting a textâ€¦He"s still there in my mind," wrote Clarke.
