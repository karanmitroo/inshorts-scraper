According to MCC's new laws of cricket, a batsman can be dismissed in nine possible ways after "handling the ball" dismissal was clubbed into "obstructing the field". The other dismissals include hit wicket, hitting ball twice, and getting timed out, in which a new batsman is dismissed if he is not ready to play his first ball within 3 minutes.
