Brazilian footballing legend Ronaldinho has said he finds it difficult to understand why compatriot Neymar Jr moved to Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona. The 25-year-old Brazilian became the world's most expensive footballer ever with his Â£198 million transfer last week. Notably, Ronaldinho played for PSG early in his career before moving to Barcelona in 2003, where he spent five years.
