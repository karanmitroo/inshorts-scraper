Sagar Baheti, who has Stargardt's disease, will reportedly be the first visually-impaired runner to participate in the upcoming 121st Boston Marathon on April 17. He will be running to raise funds for the Massachusetts Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired. "It will be great if our society could be more inclusive...of those who live with disabilities," said Sagar.
