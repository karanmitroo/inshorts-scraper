Commentator Dean Jones trolled a user after he called Jones a "cry baby" over one of his tweets. Jones had tweeted, "Many cricketers refuse to bat on poor pitches at training. Watching this Test, Day 5 is the reason why you SHOULD!" After the user's reply, Jones reminded him that Australia currently holds the Border-Gavaskar Cup and Cricket World Cup.
