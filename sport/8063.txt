Criticising Kevin Pietersen for his performance in the Big Bash League, Australian coach Darren Lehmann tweeted, "@KP24 @tensporttv @BBL time for stars to move KP on, spent too much money on him and didn't win. Don't want to listen to his excuses anymore." The tweet comes after Pietersen scored a 10-ball 5 in the tournament's semifinal.
