George Sullivan, a welterweight fighter in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has tested positive for doping while already serving a doping ban. Sullivan, who was on a one-year suspension since January 31, 2016, after admitting taking a banned substance, tested positive in a sample from January 14. He however said the failed test is a "misunderstanding about a fertility pill".
