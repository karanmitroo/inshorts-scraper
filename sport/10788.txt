New Zealand opener Tom Latham became the 10th player in ODI history to 'carry his bat', during the first ODI against India at Dharamshala on Sunday. 'Carrying the bat' refers to an opener not losing his wicket when the other ten wickets have fallen. No Indian has achieved the feat, while Zimbabwe's Grant Flower was the first to do it.
