India became the top-ranked Test side in the world after Australia slipped to joint third following a 0-3 whitewash at the hands of Sri Lanka today. Pakistan have risen to number two, having drawn their four-Test series against England. India will, however, need to win their last Test against the West Indies to retain their top ranking.
