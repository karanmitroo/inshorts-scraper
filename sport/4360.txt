Former captain Sourav Ganguly took his shirt off and waved it in the Lord's balcony after India won the NatWest Series against England on July 13, 2002. The celebration was in response to Andrew Flintoff's similar celebration in Mumbai earlier that year, in which the all-rounder had run bare-chested at Wankhede Stadium after England levelled the ODI series against India.
