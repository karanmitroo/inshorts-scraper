Kings XI Punjab mentor Virender Sehwag welcomed Ishant Sharma to the team on Tuesday by calling him the "hairy & slightly distorted Burj Khalifa". Sehwag also tweeted a picture of Ishant's mocking face for Steve Smith, to which Ishant replied that Sehwag would have to copy the expression during practice. Sehwag said making that expression itself was a practice session.
