Following the end of the association between the Ballon d'Or award and FIFA earlier this year, the governing body has announced a new set of awards to replace the Ballon d'Or. The new set of awards, titled 'The Best FIFA Football Awards', will be decided after voting from captains and coaches of FIFA's member countries.
