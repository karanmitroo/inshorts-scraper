It was former Australian captain Ian Chappell who coined the nickname Very Very Special for India's VVS Laxman after watching his performances against Australia during India's 2003-2004 tour of Australia. Laxman, who celebrated his 42nd birthday on November 1, 2016, scored a total of 494 runs from the four Tests at an average of 82, in the series.
