The first ever drugs disqualification in the Olympic Games happened in 1968 Mexico City Olympics when the Swedish pentathlete Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall was tested positive for excessive alcohol. He had allegedly drunk some beer prior to the start of the race to calm his nerves, and was later stripped of the bronze medal he went on to win.
