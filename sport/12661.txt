On the 10th anniversary of Zinedine Zidane’s headbutt, former Italian player Marco Materazzi has revealed the cause of the incident. "What I said was in reference to his sister, not his mother, like I have read in some newspapers. In any neighbourhood in Rome, Naples, Turin, Milan or Paris, you hear far worse things,” Materazzi revealed in his autobiography.
