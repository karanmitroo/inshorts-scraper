Rio Olympic silver medalist PV Sindhu on Saturday accused an IndiGo airline staff of misbehaving with her during her flight to Mumbai from Hyderabad. Sindhu claimed that the staff member spoke rudely with her over her cabin baggage, which the airline claimed to be oversized. However, IndiGo refuted Sindhu's claim and said the member remained calm throughout.
