Former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist has said that if he was playing under Virat Kohli, he  would not be identical to him on the field. "You have got to do whatever comes naturally to you and what you believe in," he added. Earlier, Rahul Dravid had said Kohli is "outrageous" at times and he "cringes" on reading his pre-match statements.
