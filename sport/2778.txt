Retired boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has claimed that he has become a billionaire and it was "easy". According to Forbes, Mayweather had amassed $700 million in career earnings before the richest fight in history against UFC champion Conor McGregor in August, which he won. Mayweather is reportedly yet to cash the cheques he earned from the McGregor and Pacquiao bouts.
