Former Indian cricket team skipper Mohammad Azharuddin expressed his unhappiness with the BCCI for the way former Indian coach Anil Kumble was treated. Azharuddin, who is fighting to get his unpaid dues from the BCCI, said that the board should be the final authority in appointing the coach and the captain should not influence the decision.
