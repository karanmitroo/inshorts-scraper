Vijay Mallya-owned Formula One team Force India will feature pink-coloured cars for the 2017 Formula One season. The move comes after the team signed a sponsorship deal with Austrian water technology company BWT. Force India's Mexican driver Sergio Perez and French team mate Esteban Ocon will also sport pink colour on their helmets.
