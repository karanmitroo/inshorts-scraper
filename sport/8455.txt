Shuttler Carolina Marin, who defeated PV Sindhu in the Rio Olympics badminton final to win the gold, has said she received 10-15% prize money as compared to Sindhu. While Marin received about €94,000 (approximately ₹70 lakh), Sindhu's prize money totalled to almost ₹13 crore. "I heard she got millions...I, too, got some cash from the Spanish government," said Marin.
