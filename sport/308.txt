Roger Federer, during his match against Robin Haase at Rotterdam Open, hit an ace in the third set but called it out himself. When Federer was going to take the second serve, Haase told him the officials had not called it out but Federer insisted it was out. The umpire then called it 'fault' and Federer took his second serve.
