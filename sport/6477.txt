Ajinkya Rahane has claimed he is "great friends" with Australian skipper Steve Smith, despite turning down the latter's offer to have beer together after the Dharamsala Test. "I did not not go to have a beer...We had our own celebration plans in the dressing room," said Rahane. Smith also claimed he remained friends with Rahane, calling him "chilled out".
