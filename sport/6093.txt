Sunil Gavaskar has called for the term 'Mankading' to be scrapped from cricketing terminology claiming it puts Indian cricketing legend Vinoo Mankad in a bad light. The term was first used in 1947 when Mankad ran out Australia's Bill Brown at the non-striker's end during his bowling stride. Gavaskar suggested that media and fans should instead call it 'Browned'.
