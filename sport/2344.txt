Australia will conduct a trial of red and yellow cards for coaches and other football team officials, with the new measures set to be introduced in the domestic A-League and the women's W-League. Officials might get red-carded for offences including kicking bottles, abusive language, spitting at someone, holding up a game by holding on to the ball or obstructing players.
