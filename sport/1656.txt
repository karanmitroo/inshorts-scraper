The International Olympic Committee has banned Russia from competing at next year's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, over state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Sochi Games. Russian athletes who can prove they were not involved in doping will be allowed to compete under the name "Olympic Athlete from Russia". The decision follows 17 months of enquiry into the Russian government's involvement in doping.
