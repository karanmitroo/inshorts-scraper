New Zealand pacer Ben Wheeler was taken off the attack during the 17th over against Australia on Friday after bowling two consecutive full-toss no-balls. According to rules, if a bowler bowls two "dangerous" waist-high full-tosses, he can be taken off the attack. It is up to the umpire to decide whether the bowler should be allowed to bowl further.
