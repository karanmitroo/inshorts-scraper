Eight-year-old Kashmiri kickboxer Tajamul Islam, who won gold at the U-8 World Kickboxing Championship in November last year, has posted a video slamming the J&K government over lack of facilities. In the video, Tajamul alleges that no equipment was provided to her academy, which remains closed during the monsoon. She also requested the government for an indoor stadium.
