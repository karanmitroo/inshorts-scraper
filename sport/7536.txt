Australian domestic team Queensland's Mark Steketee was given out caught after his shot bounced off the helmet of a close-in fielder. As per the MCC's Laws of Cricket, a batsman cannot be given out caught if the ball rebounds off the protective helmet of a fielder. An amendment to the Sheffield Shield Playing Conditions for 2016-17, however, allowed the catch.
