Manchester City registered a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday to move to third place in the Premier League. David Silva opened the scoring within two minutes with City's quickest strike this season, before a prolific second half wherein the hosts added four more goals. The win was City's biggest at home since thrashing Bournemouth 4-0 in September.
