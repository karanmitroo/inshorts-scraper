World heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury has admitted he's done "lots of cocaine" and "doesn't want to live anymore". A Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency report recently revealed the boxer had tested positive for the drug, after he'd pulled out of his title defence match citing "mental health". He, however, said he's stopped taking the drug and is "getting right with God".
