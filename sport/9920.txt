A deer charged into cross-country runner Justin DeLuzio during a race at a regional championship in Pennsylvania on Saturday. DeLuzio, competing for Gwynedd Mercy University, was knocked by the deer, but was able to resume and finish the race. His coach later said that DeLuzio suffered from some soreness and bruising.
