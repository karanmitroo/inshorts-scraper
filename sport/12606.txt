Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi and his family have applied for citizenship in the Caribbean tax haven of Saint Lucia. The country, considered one of the best tax havens, maintains high banking secrecy and is selective at granting citizenship. Saint Lucia has asked for a background check of Modi through the Interpol before considering his application.
