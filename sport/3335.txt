The first Indian woman wrestler to appear in WWE, Kavita Devi, fought wearing a salwar kameez in the first round of Mae Young Classic, WWE's first all-woman competition. The former competitive powerlifter, however, lost to Dakota Kai in the encounter. Kavita made it to the tournament after her performance during WWE tryouts in Dubai earlier this year.
