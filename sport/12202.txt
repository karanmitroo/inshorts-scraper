Indian shooter Ayonika Paul has shifted out of the Rio Olympic Village, because “the Village is all out fun and excitement and she doesn't need that”, according to her father. Paul has shifted into an apartment, where she’ll be preparing for her event on Saturday. Paul is competing in the women’s 10-metre air rifle event, alongside compatriot Apurvi Chandela.
