Former Indian pacer S Sreesanth, who was banned for life by the BCCI, has announced he will return to professional cricket with the Scotland League next year. Sreesanth was banned for life by the BCCI after being accused of spot-fixing in the IPL in 2013. A trial court dropped charges against the cricketer last year, but the ban was upheld.
