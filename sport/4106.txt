Sania Mirza has called Indian women's team captain Mithali Raj an "incredible ambassador for the game of cricket". "Mithali has been performing amazingly for many years... I really hope this appreciation that all the girls are getting continues because they deserve it," said Sania. Mithali became the first Indian captain to lead the team in two ODI World Cup finals.
