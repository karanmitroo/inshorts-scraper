Rising Pune Supergiant player Daniel Christian could be handed a punishment by the IPL for coming out to bat wearing teammate Ben Stokes' jersey in their match against Kolkata Knight Riders. The all-rounder later himself admitted that he had made a mistake and revealed that his and Stokes' jerseys were drying outside when he accidentally picked up the wrong jersey.
