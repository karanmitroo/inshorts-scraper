At least 130 medals won by athletes at last year's Rio Olympics and Paralympics have been returned to organisers for being defective or rusted. The medals, mostly bronze, are being fixed by the Brazilian Mint, which originally manufactured them. As per organisers, the medals have turned black in places because of mishandling, while a few were affected by cold weather.
