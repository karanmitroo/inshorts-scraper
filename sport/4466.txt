Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi's 21-month prison sentence for tax fraud has been lifted in exchange for a fine of €250,000 (over ₹1.8 crore). Messi and his father were found guilty by a Catalan court last year of three counts of tax fraud amounting to €4.1 million (₹30 crore). However, Messi and his father were unlikely to go to jail.
