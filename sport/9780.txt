ICC has decided to exclude BCCI from its Working Group meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Adelaide this week. This is the second instance of BCCI being ignored, with the Board  not being invited for the previous Working Group meeting in Singapore this September. BCCI is blaming the exclusion on differences between ICC Chairman and top Board officials.
