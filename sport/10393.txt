Team India's limited-overs captain MS Dhoni and Rhiti Sports Management won a legal battle and have managed to secure the domain name 'www.msdhoni.com'. The complaint was filed at the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center in Geneva, against an individual from the United States who held the domain name, which amounted to trademark and personality rights infringement.
