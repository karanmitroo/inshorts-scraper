Thailand's Wanheng Menayothin, who is known as the 'dwarf giant', is just one win away from equalling American former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather's undefeated 50-0 win-loss record. The 32-year-old Thai boxer's 50th bout will take place in April or May this year. Wanheng, who measures 5 feet 2 inches in height and weighs 47.6 kg, has registered 17 knockout victories.
