Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed's uncle Mehboob Hasan, who is a resident of Etawah in Uttar Pradesh, will be supporting the Indian team instead of his nephew's side in Sunday's India-Pakistan Champions Trophy final. Mehboob said, "Pakistan cannot match our team. I always root for India... our team is superior." Hasan's sister, Sarfraz' mother, moved to Karachi after marrying Sarfraz' father.
