Sebastian Coe, president of the athletics' governing body IAAF, said they are considering introducing an IPL-style auction as one of the proposals to revive the sport. "What about cities, teams, franchises? You see the excitement of the pick with the IPL auction. We have to be radical," he added. Coe also added they are mulling having tracks inside football stadiums.
