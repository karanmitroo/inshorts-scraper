Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath became the most successful left-arm spinner in Test cricket history after taking his 363rd wicket against Bangladesh on Saturday, overtaking New Zealand's Daniel Vettori's record of 362 wickets. Among all left-arm bowlers, only former Pakistani pacer Wasim Akram (414) has taken more wickets than Herath. The 38-year-old achieved the feat in his 79th Test.
