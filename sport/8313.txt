Following the implementation of Lodha recommendations, cricketers will get more power in governance with the formation of a players' association. Players will have their say on key issues like scheduling of tours and remuneration, among others. BCCI's accounts will be monitored by a nominee of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which will help in tracking the flow of money.
