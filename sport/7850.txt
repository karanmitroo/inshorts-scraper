The medals for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be forged from recycled metal from old mobile phones and appliances donated by the general public to give them a sense of direct involvement in the Games, organisers said. The organising committee hopes to gather as much as eight tonnes of metal, including 40 kg of gold, from mobile phones and appliances.
