Kuwait shooter Fehaid al-Deehani won the first ever Olympic gold medal for 'Independent Olympic Athletes' after winning the men's double trap event on Wednesday. The shooter had to participate as an 'independent' as Kuwait is suspended by the International Olympic Committee over government interference in sports. Al-Deehani had earlier refused to carry the IOC flag in the Rio opening ceremony.
