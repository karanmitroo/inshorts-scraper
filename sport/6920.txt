Former Manchester United player Memphis Depay on Sunday scored from the halfway line, almost 50 metres from the goal, for French side Lyon against Toulouse in France's top-tier league. Lyon were leading 3-0 when Depay latched onto a clearance and swivelled near the centre circle to keep an opposing player at distance before hitting the lob over the goalkeeper.
