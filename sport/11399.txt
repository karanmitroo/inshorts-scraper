Michael Schumacher's lawyer, Felix Damm, denied the claims made by a German magazine that the seven-times Formula One world champion is able to walk again. Damm revealed that Schumacher was unable to stand even with the assistance of therapists. Schumacher spent six months in coma after injuring his head and has since been cared for at his house in Switzerland.
