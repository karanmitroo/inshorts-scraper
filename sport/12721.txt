India limited-overs captain MS Dhoni gave a motivational speech to the Virat Kohli-led Indian Test team, before their departure for the West Indies tour. “Stay together, all of you won't have a very good series. But, with 17 Test matches, all of you will be successful,” said Dhoni, who also participated in the team-bonding exercise organised by coach Anil Kumble.
