Juventus forward Gonzalo Higuain missed a goal from two yards out after his effort hit the crossbar and came back down into the hands of Lazio's goalkeeper. Higuain, who has scored 263 goals in his club career, closed down the keeper after the latter failed to control a back pass, deflecting the clearance resulting in the ball smashing the crossbar.
