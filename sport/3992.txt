Former English cricketer Geoff Boycott was pranked live on air during the England-South Africa Oval Test, being told that his 100th first-class hundred was being invalidated by the ICC. Co-commentator Jonathan Agnew read out a fake ICC release, telling Boycott the board had stripped the particular match of its first-class status, which the cricketer called "absolutely ridiculous".
