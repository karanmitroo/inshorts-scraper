During the 14th over of South Africa's innings in the final T20I, former India captain MS Dhoni  advised Suresh Raina to not fire the ball at the stumps. "Danda mai tez mat daalna," Dhoni said thrice before the fifth ball of the over. However, Raina bowled an 89-kmph delivery towards leg-stump and was hit for a four by Christiaan Jonker.
