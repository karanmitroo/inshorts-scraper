Former BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke, who was removed by the Supreme Court, said it is a proud moment for him that his association is hosting a great match. "I'm here to help them make the match as successful as possible. The Pune Stadium is my baby," added Shirke. Shirke also denied allegations of him trying to disrupt the match.
