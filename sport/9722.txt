Former England captain Michael Vaughan conducted "scientific research" to test the effect of mint saliva on a cricket ball's movement. Vaughan rubbed mint saliva on an orange, an apple, and a lemon and asked volunteers to bowl at a tree. The commentator concluded mint had no effect on swing, and the Australians need to "work a bit on their technique".
