Alastair Cook has resigned as England's Test captain after a record 59 matches in charge. The 32-year-old took the role in 2012 and led England to Ashes victories in 2013 and 2015. "Stepping down has been an incredibly hard decision but I know this is the correct decision for me and at the right time for the team," said Cook.
