Sri Lanka changed their wicketkeeper after the first day's play against South Africa in the Cape Town Test. Both the wicketkeepers, Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal, shared seven catches between them, equalling the record for the most catches held by a keeper in an innings. The same thing happened in 1977 when two Pakistan wicketkeepers took seven catches between them.
