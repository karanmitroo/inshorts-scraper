India U-19 coach and Delhi Daredevils mentor Rahul Dravid has asserted that he is not involved in conflict of interest, as claimed by former CoA member Ramachandra Guha. "If the rules have changed midway through the contract, then I think it is unfair to criticise me for breaking the rules or twisting the rules to suit my convenience," said Dravid.
