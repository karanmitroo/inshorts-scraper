Brazilian striker Neymar's €222 million move to PSG from Barcelona is the most expensive transfer in football history. Neymar's transfer fee is over twice that of Paul Pogba, who created a world record with his €105 million move to Manchester United last year. Since 2008, the transfer record has been broken four times, with Real Madrid breaking it twice.
