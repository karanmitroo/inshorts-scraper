Spinner Gareth Batty has been recalled to the England Test side, 11 years after he last played a match for the national team. The 38-year-old bowler has been named in the English squad for the Bangladesh tour in October. Batty made his debut for England against Bangladesh in 2003 and played his last Test against the same team in 2005.
