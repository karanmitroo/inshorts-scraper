During an El Cl√°sico match in 2002, Barcelona fans threw a severed pig's head at Real Madrid's Luis Figo while he was taking a corner at Camp Nou. Figo had left Barcelona for Real in 2000 for a then world record transfer. Recalling the incident, Figo said he was the only player who had 100,000 people together just against him.
