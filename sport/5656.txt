The International Cricket Council has welcomed BCCI's decision of clearing the Indian cricket team to participate in the upcoming Champions Trophy in England and Wales. BCCI had been delaying the announcement of the Indian squad for the tournament over a revenue sharing disagreement with ICC. India will begin their title defence against Pakistan on June 4.
