India have slipped to number two position in the ICC ODI team rankings, four days after having reclaimed the number one position. The slip comes after Australia ended India's joint-longest ODI winning streak of nine matches after winning the Bengaluru ODI on Thursday. India will reclaim the number one rank if they win the final ODI on October 1.
