A cyclist named Mike Allec was sent flying into the air over a bridge's edge as a result of a multi-bike accident that occurred during the final sprint of the Santa Barbara Road Race. Allec's bike fell around 30 feet to the ground while he survived the incident by holding on to the bridge's retaining wall.
