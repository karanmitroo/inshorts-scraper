FIFA has announced it suffered losses amounting to nearly £300 million (₹2,385 crore) in 2016, and is expected to lose a further £400 million (₹3,180 crore) in 2017. The losses arose from legal costs related to its corruption scandal, besides "ill-considered previous investments". However, FIFA expects to end 2018 with an £80 million profit for the period 2014-2018.
