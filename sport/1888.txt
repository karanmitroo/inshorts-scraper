Australian captain Steve Smith became the third fastest batsman to reach 21 Test tons, achieving the feat in his 105th innings against England on Saturday. Smith displaced ex-Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who had taken 110 innings to reach the landmark. Only former batsmen Don Bradman (56) and Sunil Gavaskar (98) took fewer innings than Smith to reach 21 Test hundreds.
