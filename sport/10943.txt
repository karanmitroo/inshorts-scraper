Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has attributed the improvement in Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's game during the last couple of years to former team director Ravi Shastri. Gavaskar pointed out the difference in Ashwin's approach since the 2014-15 Australian tour while giving his assessment and felt that Shastri's input from behind the scenes played a key role in Ashwin's transformation.
