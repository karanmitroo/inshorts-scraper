Australia's Matthew Wade successfully used DRS for the second time in two games after being given out caught behind against Pakistan. The replays showed the ball had missed the outside edge, following which the on-field decision was reversed. Wade was rescued by DRS in the last match as well when he was given out LBW despite an inside edge.
