Polish discus thrower Piotr Malachowski has auctioned his Rio Olympics’ silver medal, to raise funds for a three-year-old boy suffering from a rare eye cancer. Malachowski had put up his medal for auction a week ago after receiving a letter from the boy’s mother. Following the sale, Malachowski posted, "My darlings. We made it," but did not disclose the amount.
