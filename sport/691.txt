A Lucknow cleric issued a fatwa saying that Muslim women should not watch men play football. Senior Darul Uloom cleric Mufti Athar Kasmi claimed that watching men "playing with bare knees" violated the tenets of Islam. "Do you have no shame? Do you not fear God," he added, slamming men who allow their wives to watch football even on television.
