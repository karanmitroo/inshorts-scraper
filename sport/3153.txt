Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq attacked a spectator who called him "Mota, sada aalu" during an India-Pakistan ODI in Toronto on September 14, 1997. The fan taunted Inzamam using a megaphone, after which the latter climbed up through the crowd with a bat and started hitting the fan. Two spectators were arrested, with the match being halted for 40 minutes.
