Brianna Lyston, a 12-year-old Jamaican sprinter, completed a 200-metre sprint in 23.72 seconds, two seconds short of the world record set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Brianna set the record in the U-13 girls 200-metre sprint at the 2017 Boys and Girls Championships. It is the same event in which Usain Bolt won his first school championships medal in 2001.
