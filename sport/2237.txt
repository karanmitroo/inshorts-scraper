Backing former captain MS Dhoni's selection in the Indian team for T20Is, cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag said that the team still needs MS Dhoni in the shortest format of the game. Sehwag further advised Dhoni to get going from the first ball in big chases and also urged the management to brief the 36-year-old about his role in the T20I team.
