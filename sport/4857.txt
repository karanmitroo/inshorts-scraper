Commentator Harsha Bhogle has announced that he will be making a return to the English commentary box for India's tour of West Indies, beginning June 23. The last international event Bhogle commentated in was ICC World T20, which took place in 2016. "Welcome back, Harsha. Commentary box was poorer in your absence. Go well," tweeted fellow commentator Aakash Chopra.
