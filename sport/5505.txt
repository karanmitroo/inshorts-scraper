Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli attempted a shot for two runs during the match against Delhi Daredevils on Sunday, but unknowingly ended up hitting a six. Post the match, Kohli admitted that he was trying to drive the full-pitched Corey Anderson delivery for two, but it went for six. "I think Corey had bowled a cross-seam ball," said Kohli.
