Man Kaur, a 101-year-old Chandigarh-based sprinter, has been denied a visa by the Chinese Embassy to participate in the Asian Masters Athletics Championships. Kaur, who took up athletics aged 93, was looking to compete in the 100m, 200m, shot put and javelin categories at the Championships. "It's not the end of the road. I will continue training," Kaur said.
