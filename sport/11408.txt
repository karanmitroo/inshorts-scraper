Sports Minister Vijay Goel on Saturday said India’s Rio Paralympics medal-winning athletes will also get the Khel Ratna. The Khel Ratna was awarded to India’s Olympic medalists as per the policy, but Goel had earlier claimed there was no such model for Paralympians. India won four medals at the Rio Paralympics, including two golds by Devendra Jhajharia and Mariyappan Thangavelu.
