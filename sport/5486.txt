Fans of Italian club Inter Milan protested their team's loss by leaving the stadium 20 minutes into the match against Sassuolo to "go out and have lunch". "You do not deserve our support...we're going to go get something to eat," read a banner. Other fans hung a white sheet over the stands, to "hang a pitiful veil over the season".
