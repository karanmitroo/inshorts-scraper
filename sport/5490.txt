Former South African captain Hansie Cronje plugged-in an earpiece to receive instructions from coach Bob Woolmer during the team's 1999 World Cup fixture against India on May 15, 1999. India's Sourav Ganguly contacted the on-field umpires regarding the communication system, following which the match referee ordered Cronje to remove the earpiece. South Africa won the match by four wickets.
