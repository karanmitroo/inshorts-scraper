Hobart Hurricanes' George Bailey got run-out in an unusual fashion against Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League. Bailey was attempting a third run when his bat got stuck in the ground near the crease and slipped out of his hand. The replays showed no part of Bailey's body was grounded behind the crease, after which he was adjudged run-out.
