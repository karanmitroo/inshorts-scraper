Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has praised captain Virat Kohli's work ethic and called it the best in the Indian team and possibly in the world. Speaking about Kohli's consistency, Pujara said, "I think it's very difficult for any other player to be so consistent and still get up every single morning and do the same thing again and again."
