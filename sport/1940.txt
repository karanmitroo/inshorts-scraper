Chelsea loanee Fankaty Dabo scored an own goal after chipping his goalkeeper from 32 metres away in Netherlands' top tier league on Sunday. The 22-year-old defender decided to fire the ball back to his goalkeeper when he was being closed down by an opponent. Reacting to it, a user tweeted, "Don't see him coming back to Chelsea anytime soon."
