During India-New Zealand's ODI on Sunday, a Doug Bracewell delivery broke Ajinkya Rahane's bat, with a chip flying off. Rahane would've been out hit wicket had the chunk dislodged the bails. MCC laws state a batsman is out if he "puts his wicket down by his bat or his body, with 'body' including the clothes and equipment of the batsman."
