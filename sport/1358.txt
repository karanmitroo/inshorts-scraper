Australian pacer Andrew Tye became only the second bowler after Indian spinner Amit Mishra to pick up three T20 hat-tricks after picking up his third in the Big Bash League on Saturday. Tye, who had picked up a hat-trick in the Big Bash in the 2016-17 season, also picked up a hat-trick on his IPL debut for the Gujarat Lions.
