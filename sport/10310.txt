Japanese opener Makoto Taniyama was 'retired out' after he left the field to change his bat without consulting the umpires, in Japan on Thursday. Taniyama, playing against China in the four-nation East Asia Cup, left the field after scoring 7(12). Sri Lankans Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene were similarly given out during a Test against Bangladesh in 2001.
