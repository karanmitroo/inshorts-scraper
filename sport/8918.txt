West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell has been cleared by Cricket Australia to use his black bat in the Big Bash League after covering it with a clear laminate cover. Russell had used the bat during his side Sydney Thunder's opening match of the BBL last week, after which it was disallowed for leaving marks on the ball.
