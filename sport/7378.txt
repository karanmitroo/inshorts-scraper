The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) for BCCI has barred three top BCCI officials from attending the IPL auction which is set to be held on Monday. The CoA said only those officials, who conform to the reforms made mandatory by the Supreme Court, would be eligible to attend the auction. Over 350 players will be auctioned on Monday.
