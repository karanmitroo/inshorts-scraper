American athlete Ryan Crouser broke a 28-year old Olympic record to win the gold in men's shot put final at the Rio Olympics on Thursday. His 22.52-meter throw broke the previous record of 22.47-metre made at 1988 Olympics. With compatriot Joe Kovacs winning silver, it's the first time since 1996 that USA secured the top two spots in the event.
