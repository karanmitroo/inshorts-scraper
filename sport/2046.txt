India ended the rain-curtailed opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday at 17/3, as Virat Kohli and KL Rahul registered ducks. Lankan pacer Suranga Lakmal bowled six overs without conceding a run and took all the three wickets. The duck was Kohli's fifth in international cricket in 2017, most by him in a calendar year.
