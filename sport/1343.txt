India's only international-sized ice rink is facing meltdown due to its disuse since its inauguration six years ago. The Dehradun facility, which cost over â‚¹100 crore to construct, has been shut due to high maintenance costs which the Uttarakhand government is unable to bear. In 2015, the Union Sports Ministry had assured that it would help restart the rink.
