Arsenal's French forward Olivier Giroud won FIFA's Puskas Award for the best goal of the year, for his scorpion kick against Crystal Palace earlier this year. The Frenchman had executed a left-foot flicked volley, which smashed the crossbar before going inside the Palace net, following a counter attack by Arsenal in a Premier League match on January 1.
