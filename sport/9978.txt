Australian captain Steven Smith has said that he was embarrassed by Australia's performance against South Africa after losing the second Test at Hobart, making it five consecutive Test losses for the team. He also accused his players of "lacking pride in their wickets".  "I need players that...get in the battle and have some pride in playing for Australia," he added.
