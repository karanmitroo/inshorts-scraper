During the Mohali Test, Murali Vijay survived a scare following an appeal for obstructing the field. After a James Anderson delivery, the pacer attempted a runout, hitting Vijay instead, who was outside his crease but didn't deliberately try to block the ball. According to the rules, a batsman is given out if he deliberately blocks the ball to avoid runout.
