Tottenham's English midfielder Dele Alli gave his boots from the final match at home ground White Hart Lane to a 96-year-old supporter, Ken Stanley, who has been watching Tottenham's matches for the past 88 years. Stanley, who has been a season-ticket holder since 1929, saw the London-based club bid farewell to the stadium, which was its home for 118 years.
