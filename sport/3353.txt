Petra Kvitov√° of the Czech Republic, who was attacked by a knife-wielding robber in December 2016, defeated current Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza in the fourth round of the US Open 2017. This is Kvitova's best run in a Grand Slam tournament following her return to action after needing surgery on her racket-holding hand for cuts she suffered during the assault.
