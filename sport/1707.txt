Tamil Nadu advanced to the U-23 Col CK Nayudu Trophy semifinals after winning against Hyderabad by virtue of a coin toss. The four-day match was marred by rain with no play possible on the second and fourth days. It was extended to the fifth day but no play was possible again, leading to a coin toss to decide the outcome.
