At the ongoing Nitro World Games organised by the action sports entertainment company Nitro Circus, Ryan Williams landed what is believed to be the world's first 1080 front flip on a BMX bike. Nicknamed "R-Willy", the biker won the BMX Best Tricks event after he landed a front bike flip alongside the 1080 front flip.
