Pacer Siddarth Kaul, who played alongside Virat Kohli in the U-19 team, has revealed he was informed of his selection in India's ODI squad by the on-field umpire during a Ranji match. "It was drinks break at that time...I didn't know how to react...It was the biggest piece of news in my cricketing career...I got it on field," Kaul added.
