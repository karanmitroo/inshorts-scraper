Former Indian pacer Zaheer Khan has said Bhuvneshwar Kumar is currently the best swing bowler in India. "The pitches in India are not conducive for swing bowling. Kumar has been able to move the ball in both the ways with a perfect balance," added Zaheer. Bhuvneshwar took his career's third five-wicket haul in India's victory over New Zealand at Kolkata.
