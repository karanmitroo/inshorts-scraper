Indian Olympic Association has revoked the appointment of scam-tainted Suresh Kalmadi and Abhay Singh Chautala as Life Presidents. IOA President N Ramachandran said no resolution for their appointment was passed in a meeting in December, contrary to what IOA Vice President Tarlochan Singh had then claimed. The Sports Ministry had suspended the IOA following Chautala and Kalmadi's appointments.
