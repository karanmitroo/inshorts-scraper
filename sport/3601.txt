West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle and British broadcaster Piers Morgan took part in a dance off in St Kitts, one of the islands hosting matches of the Caribbean Premier League. Gayle's international teammate Dwayne Bravo was seen recording the duo dancing on his song 'Champion'. Bravo later announced that it was a close contest but Morgan had the upper hand.
