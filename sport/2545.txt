Sri Lankan cricketer Chamara Kapugedera suffered a swollen face after being hit by the ball lobbed towards him by wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella at the end of Pakistan's 10th over in the third ODI on Wednesday. Kapugedera didn't know that the ball was coming towards him while he was walking towards the crease, and was hit below his eye.
