Wishing Virender Sehwag on his 39th birthday, Indian boxer Vijender Singh tweeted that since the batsman stopped playing, he stopped watching cricket. "There was a time when I used to watch brother's batting with the help of tractor's battery," he added. Meanwhile, Ajinkya Rahane, in his tweet, wrote, "Wish I could have seen one 300 from the non strikers end!"
