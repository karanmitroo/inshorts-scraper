Gareth Bale's first-half brace helped Real Madrid secure a 3-0 home victory against Leganés in the La Liga on Sunday. The winger scored his first in the 38th minute, before netting a close-range shot from a Álvaro Morata cross in first-half added time. Morata scored the third to make it eight wins in 11 La Liga matches for Real Madrid.
