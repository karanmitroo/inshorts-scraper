After being fined ₹3 lakh over crowd violence, defending I-League champions Aizawl FC have demanded ₹57 lakh which AIFF owes them since the 2015-16 season. The club's president said once the dues are cleared, they "will see how to pay the fine". Aizawl were penalised for their match against Mohun Bagan, which saw spectators resorting to violence over referee decisions.
