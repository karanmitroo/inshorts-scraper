Australian pacer Brett Lee took T20I cricket's first ever hat-trick after registering the feat against Bangladesh on September 16, 2007. Lee's hat-trick contained a caught-behind, an LBW and a bowled. The 40-year-old, who is Australia's only bowler to achieve the feat in T20I cricket, also has a hat-trick in ODI cricket.
