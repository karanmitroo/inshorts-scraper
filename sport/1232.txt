Cricketer and commentator Kevin Pietersen on Friday slammed Emirates airline for misplacing his luggage while he was travelling from United Kingdom to Australia. In a tweet which he deleted later, Pietersen wrote, "How do I work on international TV in a few hours with no clothes?" Emirates responded by giving Pietersen a credit card so he could buy new clothes.
