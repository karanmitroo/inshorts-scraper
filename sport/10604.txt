Former footballer Pelé was declared a 'national treasure' by the Brazil government after his performance in the country's first-ever World Cup win in 1958. Pelé received numerous offers from European football clubs and the decree was to prevent him from being transferred to foreign clubs. Considered as one of the greatest footballers ever, Pelé was born on October 23, 1940.
