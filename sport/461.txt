Former world number one Serena Williams, who recently became mother to a baby girl, will return to competitive tennis at the Fed Cup in North Carolina. Serena will represent the United States, who will begin their title defence against the Netherlands. "There's been a lot of ups and downs in the practice," Williams said ahead of her return.
