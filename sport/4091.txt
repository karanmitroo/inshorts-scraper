BCCI agreed to adopt all the Lodha recommendations barring five at its Special General Meeting on Wednesday. The reforms that have not been implemented include one state one vote, size of national selection panel and apex council, age cap and tenure of office-bearers. Notably, it has been more than a year since the SC ordered BCCI to implement the reforms.
