India's Jasprit Bumrah ran out England opener Alex Hales with a direct throw from the deep during the first ODI at Pune on Sunday. Jason Roy drove the ball towards Bumrah at fine leg, who attempted a direct throw at the non-striker's end knocking off the bails. The decision was referred to the third umpire, who declared Hales out.
