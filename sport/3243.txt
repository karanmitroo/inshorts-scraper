Former Pakistan batsman Younis Khan will not attend the farewell to be hosted for him by the Pakistan Cricket Board. "I don't think this farewell matters now...and I'm not after money. What is its use after I...retired in May this year," said Younis. The PCB had invited Younis, Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul-Haq for a farewell reception in Lahore next week.
