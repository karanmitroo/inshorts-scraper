A China-based artist, known as 'gc911' on Instagram, has painted portrait of basketball legend Michael Jordan using a pair of Air Jordan 1 shoes. The artist used the soles and sides of the shoes, which were the first Jordan sneakers produced in 1984. Notably, Jordan, who also helped design the shoe, was not allowed to wear them for his games.
