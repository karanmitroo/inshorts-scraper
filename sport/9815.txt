Barcelona forward Paco Alcácer failed to register a single touch for the first 31 minutes despite Barcelona having 81% possession and completing 641 passes in their La Liga fixture against Málaga on Saturday. Alcácer was drafted into the playing squad after Barcelona's Argentine forward Lionel Messi felt sick prior to the start of the match.
