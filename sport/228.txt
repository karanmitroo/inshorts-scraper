World number one Test batsman Steve Smith has said he tries to incorporate traits from best batsmen in the world into his batting. "I've copied a bit of AB de Villiers...I just open, myself and set myself to play the ball," he said. "I've learnt a little bit of Virat Kohli...the way he hits the ball through offside," he added.
