Former Pakistani cricketer Javed Miandad has said Pakistan should not play against India at ICC events. "It's time we responded with bricks to stones. There is no need for us to play with India at any forum if they are not willing to restore bilateral ties," said Miandad. He added PCB was wasting money by taking legal action against BCCI.
