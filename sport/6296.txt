Pakistan's Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who will retire from international cricket at the end of the West Indies tour, says he regrets not leading the team against India. "It's not in our hands but yes it is my regret...specially when our Test side was doing so well," said Misbah. He played the last Test held between the two countries in 2007.
