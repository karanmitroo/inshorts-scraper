The Indian Sports Ministry has decided to postpone the Archery Asia Cup, following the Archery Association of India's delay in accepting the Sports Code. The championship was scheduled to begin in Delhi later this month and had received entries from five countries. The ministry denied the association a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for not implementing the code.
