The English Football Association is drafting a rulebook for 'walking football', five years after the sport was invented. Played by almost 800 clubs, the sport comprises teams of five to seven players, with the standard rule being one foot on the ground at all times. The game is mostly adopted by older footballers, or those unfit to play regular football.
