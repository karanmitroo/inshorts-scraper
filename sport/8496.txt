Shuttler Jwala Gutta has slammed the national federation for not giving importance to doubles players and focusing on singles instead. "We doubles players have no support system at all, in terms of sponsorships, nutrition or medical support...We haven't performed as well as the singles have but you have to analyse the situation objectively," said Gutta, a four-time Commonwealth doubles medalist.
