Spain's Rafael Nadal took part in the traditional dive at the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona after winning his record 10th Barcelona Open title on Sunday. Nadal changed into shorts before running and jumping into the pool alongside the ball boys. Nadal became Open era's first man to win a title 10 times after his Monte-Carlo Masters title last week.
