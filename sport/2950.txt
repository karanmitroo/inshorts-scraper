US President Donald Trump has withdrawn his invitation to 2017 NBA champions Golden State Warriors to visit the White House citing Warriors player Stephen Curry's hesitation to attend. Responding to this, NBA star LeBron James called Trump a "bum" and added that it was no longer an honour to visit the White House since Donald Trump became the President.
