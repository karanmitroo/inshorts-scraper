Former Australian pacer Brett Lee expressed surprise at the lack of pacers in India, saying, "You can’t have 1.3 billion people and not one who can't bowl 150 kmph". “You got to encourage fast bowlers to run in and bowl quick. I want to find India’s next fast bowler and I believe youngsters here can bowl 150 kmph,” he added.
