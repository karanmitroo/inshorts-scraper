Following the Formula One crash between Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, Hamilton said, "If he (Vettel) wants to prove that he's a man, I think he should do it out of the car face to face." Hamilton said that Vettel had disgraced himself by deliberately driving into his car at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Sunday.
