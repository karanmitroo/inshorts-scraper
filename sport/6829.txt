Indian wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha tripped over Australian captain Steve Smith trying to grab the ball, stuck in the latter's pad, during the Ranchi Test on Thursday. A Ravindra Jadeja delivery got lodged in Smith's pads, which Saha attempted to grab. He took out the ball and appealed for a catch, but the ball was declared dead.
