Former Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath was nicknamed 'Pigeon' because of his thin legs as a youngster. McGrath's New South Wales teammate Brad McNamara gave him the nickname when he said, "You've stolen a pigeon's legs, McGrath." The pacer, who was born on February 9, 1970, is the most successful fast bowler in cricket history with 949 wickets across formats.
