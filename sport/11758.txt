Indian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt wants late Russian wrestler Besik Kudukhovâ€™s family to keep the silver medal he won at the London Olympics. In his tweet, Dutt said that the sympathy towards the deceased and his family is paramount for him. Yogeshwar's bronze has been upgraded to silver after the original silver-winner, Kudukhov, posthumously failed a retrospective dope test.
