England cricketer Stuart Broad has named his all-time cricketing XI which includes only one Indian, Sachin Tendulkar. Broad wanted Shane Warne as the captain but went with Alastair Cook as Warne was untried as captain at the top level. Broad named his childhood hero Glenn McGrath, and England's top wicket-taker in Tests James Anderson, as the new ball bowling pair.
