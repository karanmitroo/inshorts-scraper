Darren Sammy slammed 16*(4) despite injuring his leg to help Peshawar Zalmi defeat Quetta Gladiators in the PSL. During Gladiators' innings, Sammy couldn't complete his four overs as he pulled a calf muscle after bowling 2.4 overs. He came to bat when Zalmi needed 17 runs off nine balls, and blasted two sixes and a four to help them win.
