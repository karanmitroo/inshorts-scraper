England captain Alastair Cook survived two DRS reviews on two consecutive balls during the second innings of the Mohali Test. He was given not out on the last ball of Jadeja's fourth over for which India sought an unsuccessful review. On the very next ball he played off Ashwin, he was adjudged out LBW but the DRS overturned the decision.
