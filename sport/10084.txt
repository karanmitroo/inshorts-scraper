Novak Djokovic on Friday stated that though his form had deteriorated of late, he was determined to end the year on a high. "I still feel I have a lot of gas in the tank," added the 29-year-old. Djokovic was displaced from the top ranking on Monday after remaining at the summit for 122 consecutive weeks.
