After Indian opener Rohit Sharma trolled all-rounder Kedar Jadhav over his bowling on Instagram, Yuvraj Singh commented that Jadhav throws malai koftas like pies. Rohit Sharma had posted a picture and had mentioned in the caption that he was not sure that even Jadhav knows what he bowls. Jadhav also commented on it, writing, "Even IDK how I get wickets."
