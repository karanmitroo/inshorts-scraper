Ball tampering in cricket is an action in which the fielding side illegally alters the condition of the ball, primarily to get more movement out of it. The rules prohibit rubbing the ball on the ground, scratching it with a fingernail, or interfering with the seam. Polishing the ball with an artificial substance also constitutes ball tampering.
