The International Cricket Council (ICC) has made it mandatory for all international cricketers to wear the latest helmets which adhere to the British Safety Standard. The new regulations would be enforced from February 1 and the players who do not wear the new helmets will be suspended for a match after getting an official warning for the first two matches.
