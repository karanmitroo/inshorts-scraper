England batsman Michael Carberry has marked his return from battle with cancer by scoring a century off 121 balls for domestic side Hampshire. Carberry, who featured in six Tests and seven limited overs internationals, was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour last July and had appeared in a first-class match for the first time since then.
