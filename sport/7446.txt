The first ever T20 international was played between Australia and New Zealand in Auckland on February 17, 2005. Ricky Ponting's 55-ball 98* helped Australia set up a target of 214 runs. New Zealand failed to chase the target and fell 44 runs short. Pacer Glenn McGrath pretended to bowl the final ball underarm, referencing Trevor Chappell's underarm incident from 1981.
