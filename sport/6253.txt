Sharks invaded a surfing venue, halting the Margaret River pro surfing event in Western Australia on Sunday. Organisers called back the two surfers who were competing in the semi-final, after spotting sharks feeding on smaller salmon and tuna fish. The competition was halted for 20 minutes before checks were carried out to ensure the area was safe.
