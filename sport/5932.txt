Bowler Ben Ketola rolled 12 consecutive strikes on 10 different lanes in 86.9 seconds to register what is reportedly the fastest perfect game. Ketola was inspired by a 2015 video of professional bowler Tom Daugherty performing the feat in a minute and 50.99 seconds. Ketola, who works at a bowling alley, said he bowls at least 50 games a week.
