Former Pakistan batsman Javed Miandad is one of the two players in Test cricket whose average never went below 50 throughout his career. Miandad, who turned 60 on Monday, scored 8,832 runs in 124 Tests in his 17-year-long Test career and ended with an average of 52.57. England's Herbert Sutcliffe is the other player to have achieved the feat.
