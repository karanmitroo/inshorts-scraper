International Hockey Federation President Narinder Batra has said Pakistan's junior men's hockey team will visit India for the World Cup that begins December 8 in Lucknow. However, he added "two-three teams were in line to replace them" in case they failed to come, following government refusal. Pakistan had earlier asked for the tournament to be held at a neutral venue.
