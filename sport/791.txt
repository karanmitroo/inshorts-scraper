South Korean tennis player Hyeon Chung took to Instagram to share a picture of his foot injury, which caused him to retire from the Australian Open semi-final against Roger Federer on Friday. "I tried very hard to bring my utmost energy...However, I had to make a tough decision given that I cannot compete 100% against Roger," he wrote.
