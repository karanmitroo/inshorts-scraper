Former Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor has called for shortening of Test matches by a day in order to revive spectator interest. Taylor mentioned that four-day Tests will allow players to be "a little more aggressive in their thinking" and make the longest form of cricket "viewer friendly" as it will suit the "people of this generation".
