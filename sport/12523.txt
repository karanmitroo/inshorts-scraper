The Pakistan cricket team celebrated their win over England at Lordâ€™s on Sunday with five push-ups and a salute. Notably, Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq had celebrated in a similar manner when he scored his century in the first innings. The celebration is reportedly a tribute to the army, with whom the team attended a camp prior to the tour.
