The Decision Review System (DRS) will be used in the Indian Premier League for the first time in the tournament's 2018 edition following BCCI's approval. The Indian Premier League will become the second major T20 league to adopt the system after Pakistan Super League. Ten Indian umpires were called up for a session on DRS last year.
