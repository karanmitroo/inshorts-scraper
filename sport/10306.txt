Virat Kohli came out to bat for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match in 2006, hours after his father had died in the night. The batsman played a match-saving innings of 90 for his team before getting out due to an umpiring error. Kohli, who turns 28 on Saturday, went straight to the funeral after the knock.
