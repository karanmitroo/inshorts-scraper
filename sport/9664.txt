Ravichandran Ashwin became only the third Indian cricketer ever to register over 500 runs and take more than 50 wickets in a calendar year. Prior to this Vinoo Mankad achieved the feat in 1953 before former captain Kapil Dev achieved it twice in 1979 and 1983. Notably, Ashwin has scored 530 runs and claimed 56 wickets this year so far.
