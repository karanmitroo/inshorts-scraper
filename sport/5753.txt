Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second straight and his seventh overall Champions League hat-trick to hand Real a 3-0 semifinal first-leg win over Atletico Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday. Ronaldo's 10th-minute header opened the scoring before he shipped two more past Atletico keeper Jan Oblak in the 73rd and 86th minute respectively.
