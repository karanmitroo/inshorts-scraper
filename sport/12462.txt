Former Argentina football captain Diego Maradona has said he is willing to coach the national team for free. The team has been without a coach ever since former manager Gerardo Martino resigned following Argentinaâ€™s loss to Chile in the Copa America final last month. Maradona previously coached Argentina from 2008 to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
