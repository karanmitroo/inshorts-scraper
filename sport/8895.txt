Sports minister Vijay Goel has expressed "shock" at 2010 Commonwealth Games scam-accused Suresh Kalmadi being made a life president of the Indian Olympic Association. "Both (Kalmadi and ex-IOA chief Abhay Chautala) are facing serious corruption charges. We will seek a report and take appropriate action," said Goel. Kalmadi and Chautala were appointed IOA's life presidents through a resolution.
