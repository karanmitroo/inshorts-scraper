BCCI's Committee of Administrators (COA) member Diana Edulji said that in the best interest of the game the board decided to withdraw its official complaint against Steve Smith for the DRS incident. "We are hopeful that before Virat and Smith go out for the toss in Ranchi, they will sit across the table and amicably sort out differences", Edulji added.
