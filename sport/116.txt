Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has revealed in his autobiography that he was impressed with MS Dhoni from day one. "I wish I had Dhoni in my 2003 World Cup team. I was told when we were playing the 2003 World Cup final, he was still a ticket collector," he added. Dhoni made his debut under Ganguly's captaincy in 2004.
