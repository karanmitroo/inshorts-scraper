India's Gaurav Bidhuri won a bronze at the World Boxing Championships, after losing his bantamweight (56 kg) semifinal bout against American Duke Ragan on Thursday. Bidhuri is now the fourth Indian pugilist to win a World Championships bronze, after Vijender Singh, Vikas Krishan and Shiva Thapa. India thus ended this year's edition with a lone bronze medal.
