Suli, a Spanish fan of footballer Lionel Messi, swam a kilometre from the Ibiza shoreline to meet the player, after spotting the player on his yacht. Messi invited the fan onto the yacht to chat with him, alongside arranging a speedboat to ferry Suli back to the shore. “He was very humble and hospitable,” said Suli, an Atletico Madrid supporter.
