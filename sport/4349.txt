Cricketer Ravindra Jadeja has said he did not know what "rockstar" meant when Shane Warne called him that during their days in Rajasthan Royals in 2008. "I was just thinking: 'I don't sing a song...Why is he calling me a Rockstar...When I met him first, I didn't know he was one of the greatest bowlers in Test cricket," said Jadeja.
