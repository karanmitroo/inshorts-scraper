Adille Sumariwalla, President of the Athletics Federation of India, has said steeplechase runner Lalita Babar's 10th-place finish at the Rio Olympics is "equivalent to winning a medal". "When it comes to athletes, 214 countries take part. So for Lalita Babar to have finished in the top 10 is as good as winning a medal of sorts," said Sumariwalla.
