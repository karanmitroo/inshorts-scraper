German football club Hertha Berlin's footballers linked their arms and knelt before their Bundesliga home game, to show solidarity with NFL players in the United States, who have been doing the same to protest racial injustice. The club's Twitter account wrote, "Hertha BSC stands for tolerance and responsibility! For a tolerant Berlin and an open-minded world, now and forevermore!"
