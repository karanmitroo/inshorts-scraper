Seven-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi got back on a bike for test laps on Monday, 18 days after suffering a double leg fracture in a training accident in August. Rossi had undergone surgery on September 1 and was discharged from hospital the following day. The evaluation of his fitness was inconclusive as rain cut the session short, his team said.
