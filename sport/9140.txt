Indian hockey head coach Roelant Oltmans has implemented a system of charging a â‚¹500 fine from players if they are late for training sessions, team meetings or any get-togethers. The system is being followed by the junior hockey team, which is currently playing the World Cup, and the senior team as well. The amount collected is spent during team outings.
