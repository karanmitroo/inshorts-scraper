Nearly 150,000 school children from 45 cities sent good-luck wishes to the Rio-bound Indian contingent, in an initiative by a sports' education firm. The campaign arranged interactive sessions between the athletes and the children, which saw sportspersons like wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Babita Kumari, shooter Heena Sidhu, shuttler Kidambi Srikanth, among others, participating in the initiative.
