Wrestler Sakshi Malik has been found to be overweight for her original 58 kg category, and will compete in 60 kg at the Asian Wrestling Championships. National champion in 60 kg, Sarita Mor, will compete in the 58 kg category instead. WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said an exception was made for Sakshi since she is an Olympic medalist.
