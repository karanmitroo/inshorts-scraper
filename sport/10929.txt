The World Conker Championships took place in the United Kingdom on Sunday, with participants swinging a conker (horse chestnut) threaded to a string towards their opponent's conker to smash it. Tom Dryden and Lorna Clarke were crowned King and Queen Conker this year. The championships have raised £400,000 (nearly ₹3.2 crore) for blind and visually impaired charities till date.
