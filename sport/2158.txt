Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who was initially named in the squad for first two Tests against Sri Lanka, has been rested for the series starting November 16. The BCCI took the decision to manage Pandya's workload. The Indian squad includes spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who were rested for limited-over series against Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand.
