After not being named in the squad for the first three ODIs against Australia, Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja tweeted about "setbacks", but later deleted his tweet. Jadeja posted a quote about making a strong comeback, alongside a picture of himself with a horse. According to chief selector MSK Prasad, Jadeja was "rested" in line with BCCI's rotation policy.
