Brazil will play a friendly football match against Colombia in January to help victims of the Colombia air crash that killed nineteen of Brazilian football club Chapecoense's players. Brazilian Football Confederation's spokesman Douglas Lunardi said that the federation will be donating $1.5 million to Chapecoense and all the ticket office revenues from the match will go to the victims' families.
