Former Indian all-rounder Roger Binny has said Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya is lucky to be called an all-rounder. "He doesn't contribute with the bat...He has got into the Test team based on his exploits in T20 cricket," added Roger. Pandya has scored 39 runs and has taken six wickets in eight matches in the limited-overs series against South Africa.
