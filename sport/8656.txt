Commentator Harsha Bhogle revealed his T20I Team of 2016, naming David Warner as the captain ahead of Virat Kohli, who he had selected as captain in both his 2016's Test and ODI teams. Bhogle stated he did not select West Indian Chris Gayle as the team would have been left with a bowler short and hence selected De Kock-Maxwell combination.
