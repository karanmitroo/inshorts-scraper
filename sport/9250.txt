A few of the Cleveland Cavaliers' basketballers including LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, took to flipping water bottles during the fourth quarter of their NBA match against the New York Knicks. James, who scored 26 points in the match, failed to land the bottle upright in three attempts, including one in which the bottle rolled on to the court.
