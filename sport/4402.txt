Cricket Advisory Committee member Sourav Ganguly has said skipper Virat Kohli needs to understand how coaches operate. However, the former captain said they will announce the new coach after consulting Kohli. "He has not sent any names, he has no inputs but we feel he is the captain, which is the most important thing in Indian cricket," said Ganguly.
