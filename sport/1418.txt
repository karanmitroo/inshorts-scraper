Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting's nickname 'Punter' was given to him by spin legend and his teammate Shane Warne, while Ponting was a part of the Australian Cricket Academy. Pontingâ€™s liking for dog races and  betting on them prompted Warne to give him the nickname 'Punter.' Post his retirement, Ponting has been associated with Greyhound Racing Victoria in Melbourne.
