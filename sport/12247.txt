A three-minute video explains the ancient origins of the Olympics which were first held in 776 BC. It began as a religious festival honouring the Greek God Zeus in Olympia. According to the video, the first thirteen games included a 200-yard dash in addition to contests for music, singing, and poetry. Overtime, boxing, chariot and mule racing were also included.
