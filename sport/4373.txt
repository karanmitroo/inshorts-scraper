The ball used by Switzerland's Roger Federer to deliver his 10,000th career ace is set to be auctioned for charity. He requested a Wimbledon ball boy to return the ball to him so that it could be auctioned. Notably, Federer, who is aiming to win a record eighth Wimbledon title, is only the third player to have 10,000 career aces.
