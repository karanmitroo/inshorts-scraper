The Phogat sisters, whose story inspired Aamir Khan's 'Dangal', have said that the film felt like a video of their life while they were growing up. "It didn't feel like a movie...it felt very real." said Geeta Phogat. Notably, 'Dangal' tells the story of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat who trained daughters Geeta and Babita Kumari to become international-level wrestlers.
