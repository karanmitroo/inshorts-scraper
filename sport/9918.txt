ICC has charged South African captain Faf du Plessis for ball tampering in the second Test against Australia at Hobart, which concluded on Tuesday. Footage had emerged showing du Plessis applying mint saliva to the ball, but the skipper has pleaded not guilty to the charge. In 2013, du Plessis was charged with ball tampering in a Test against Pakistan.
