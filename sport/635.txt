Former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone called the racing league's new owners' decision to end the use of 'grid girls' in the Formula One races as being 'prudish'. Typically, the grid girls in Formula One display team placards or stand with an umbrella that shields drivers waiting in their cars from the weather before the start of a Grand Prix.
