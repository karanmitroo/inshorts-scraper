West Indies' cricketing legend Gary Sobers became the first cricketer to hit six 6s in an over in first class cricket, after smashing Welsh bowler Malcolm Nash for six sixes in a county match on August 31, 1968. Notably, Glamorgan bowler Nash, who was a left-arm seamer, was asked to bowl spin by his captain Tony Lewis.
