Virat Kohli broke Virender Sehwag's record of most Test runs in a single home season, during the ongoing Hyderabad Test against Bangladesh on Friday. Kohli went past Sehwag's mark of 1,105 runs, scored by the former opener during the 2004-05 season. During his innings, Kohli also equalled the record for most 150-plus scores by an Indian captain in Tests.
