European football's governing body UEFA on Thursday announced a new international tournament, the UEFA Nations League, which will see participation from 55 nations in a league-style format. The teams will play in four leagues based on their UEFA rankings.  Winners of the groups in the top-most league would advance to the knockout stage, while bottom-placed teams will be relegated.
