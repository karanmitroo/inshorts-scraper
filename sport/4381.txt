Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor wore a pinstriped suit saying "f**k you" during his first face-off with opponent Floyd Mayweather, ahead of their bout on August 26. "He's in a fu**ing tracksuit...He can't even afford a suit anymore," said McGregor. Mayweather, in return, took out a $100 million cheque from his bag and showed it to the crowd.
