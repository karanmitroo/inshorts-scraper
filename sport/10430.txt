Barcelona have signed a new kit deal with Nike which will fetch them around £140m (₹1139k crore) per season from 2018. The deal will run through 2023 when Barca's members will decide on a further five-year extension. "It is a figure which puts us No. 1 in the world for sponsorship in the sports industry," Barca's vice-president Manuel Arroyo said.
