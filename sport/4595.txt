Australian batsman Usman Khawaja shared a photo on social media of him applying for a job online after 230 Australian cricketers including him became unemployed as they failed to sign the contract offered by their board. In the job application entries, Khawaja filled "Cover Driver" as the position, and mentioned "Flat wickets, very flat wickets" in the location field.
