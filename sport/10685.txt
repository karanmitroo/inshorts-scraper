Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag, who celebrates his 38th birthday on October 20, 2016, is the only captain in ODI history to score a double ton, while leading India against the West Indies in 2011. Sehwag's 149-ball 219, the then highest individual score in ODI cricket, helped the Men in Blue post  their best ever ODI total of 418.
