World number three tennis player Grigor Dimitrov jumped the net to check on his opponent Kyle Edmund who tumbled to the court, clutching his right ankle during a Brisbane International match. Dimitrov consoled Edmund and walked him to his chair as the crowd applauded the sportsmanship. "It was just...a natural instinct for me to go and jump over," said Dimitrov.
