The ATP Brasil Open tennis tournament in Sao Paulo on Saturday employed six dogs as ball persons for an exhibition match for the third straight year. The move was aimed at promoting the adoption of homeless dogs. The dogs, trained to fetch balls and return to the net post, currently live at an NGO called 'United Paws'.
