TV broadcaster Piers Morgan has come out with a three-point plan which he claims will 'save England cricket'. Morgan's points comprise removing Alastair Cook as Test captain, replacing him with Joe Root and bringing back discarded player Kevin Pietersen. England, who are currently touring India, have been winless in the five-match Test series, trailing 0-3 after four matches.
