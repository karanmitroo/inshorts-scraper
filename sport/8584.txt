British football club, Morecambe's supporters have contributed to help club manager Jim Bentley pay around ₹83,000 (£1,000) in fines and costs, charged by the Football Association for improper conduct. Bentley was sent off during the club's League Two defeat against Cheltenham Town in December, after having reacted to a player's red card.
