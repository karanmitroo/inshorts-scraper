Bernie Ecclestone, who headed Formula One for around 40 years, has been removed from his position after US-based Liberty Media completed its $8 billion takeover of the sport. The 86-year-old was appointed as the chairman emeritus and will act as an adviser to Formula One board. Ecclestone has been replaced by Chase Carey, Vice Chairman of the 21st Century Fox.
