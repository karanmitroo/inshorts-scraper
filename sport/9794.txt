Snooker's only black professional player, Rory McLeod has said that the sport's governing body is "not doing anything" to attract more black people to take up the sport. "What World Snooker are bothered about is the prize money and sponsors. That is it," McLeod said in an interview. McLeod is currently ranked 52nd in the world.
