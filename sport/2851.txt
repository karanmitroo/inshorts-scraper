Russia and China were among nine nations suspended from weightlifting competitions for up to 12 months after the International Weightlifting Federation retested samples from Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics. Countries with at least three doping offences from those Olympics were suspended. Out of the 49 failed samples, 30 had medaled in various weight categories and disciplines.
