Pakistani batsman Babar Azam became the joint-fastest to reach 1,000 ODI runs, achieving the feat in his 21st innings in the ongoing Perth ODI against Australia. Azam equalled West Indies' Viv Richards, English players Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott and South Africa's Quinton de Kock, all of whom took the same number of innings to reach the milestone.
