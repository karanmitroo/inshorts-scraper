Indian-origin wrestler Jinder Mahal beat Randy Orton at the pay-per-view event 'Backlash' on Sunday, to become the WWE Champion for the first time in his career. Mahal, a Canadian national, is now the second wrestler of Indian descent to win a world heavyweight championship in WWE. The Great Khali was the first, winning the now-defunct World Heavyweight Championship in 2007.
