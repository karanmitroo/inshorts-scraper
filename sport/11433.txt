A helicopter crashed in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar, just after it had completed a flight with Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and his wife. The helicopter had dropped the couple to a resort, but crashed on its return flight to Dhaka an hour later. Shakib expressed his shock at the incident, in which one was killed and four injured.
