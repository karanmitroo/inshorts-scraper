Umpire Virender Sharma, officiating in a Ranji match between Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh at Mysore, had to stand at both ends for a full day's play as his partner Australian Sam Nogajski was hospitalised with food poisoning. The reserve umpire at the venue could only stand at square leg as he was not a part of the BCCI panel.
