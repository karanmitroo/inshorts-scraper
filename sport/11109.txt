Mahatma Gandhi helped establish three football clubs, all named 'Passive Resisters Soccer Club' in the 1900s during his stay in South Africa. Gandhi used football for his fight against racial discrimination and would talk to the teams at half-time about the principles of nonviolent resistance and distributed pamphlets to spectators addressing the issue. October 2 is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti.
