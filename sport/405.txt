Zimbabwe defeated Afghanistan by 154 runs in the second ODI after scoring 333/5 in 50 overs on Sunday. Interestingly, Afghanistan had scored 333/5 in the first ODI on Friday and dismissed Zimbabwe for 179 runs to register an identical 154-run win. In another coincidence, the 47th over of the first innings of both the matches witnessed three no-balls apiece.
