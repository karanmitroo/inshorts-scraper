In reference to the Marylebone Cricket Club setting a limit on bat sizes, West Indies batsman Chris Gayle has said he can hit sixes "with a toothpick". "Give me a toothpick, knife, fork...I will still hit sixes. Size doesn't matter...It is all about the weapon. They can cut down my size, but they can't cut down my sixes," said Gayle.
