The curator of Chennai's Chepauk Stadium called for a special cover weighing 1,000 kgs to protect the pitch when Cyclone Vardah hit the city earlier this week. The cover, costing â‚¹2.17 lakh, was used over the existing covers to save the pitch for the India-England Test. The groundsmen also used 20 heavy iron pipes and 50 nails for the covers.
