English pacer James Anderson is set to miss the team's Bangladesh tour due to a shoulder injury. The 34-year-old pacer has not played since the fourth Test against Pakistan in August in order to help him recover from a stress fracture to his right shoulder blade. Jake Ball will feature as Anderson's replacement on the tour.
