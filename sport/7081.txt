Australian women's cricket team's Meg Lanning, while fielding at mid-off, pulled off a flying mid-air catch to dismiss New Zealand's Katey Martin. Martin advanced down the wicket trying to clear mid-off with a lofted shot but Lanning timed her jump perfectly to not only save the boundary but also dismiss Martin for 77 runs.
