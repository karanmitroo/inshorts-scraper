Ex-Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore has termed Ravichandran Ashwin as one of the most valuable players in the world. Praising his all-round skills, Whatmore said that Ashwin's batting makes him an asset for the Indian side. "Kohli must be really happy to have him. Muralitharan was...world class (but) he didn't bat as well as Ashwin can do," he added.
