Former Chelsea striker Diego Costa, making his first La Liga appearance since returning to Atletico Madrid, was sent off for jumping into the stands to celebrate his goal in the 68th minute. Costa was shown his first yellow card for elbowing a Getafe player, six minutes before getting a second yellow which led to his dismissal.
