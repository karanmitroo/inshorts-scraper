Melbourne Stars' Kevin Pietersen took a diving catch after running back for over 30 metres to dismiss Melbourne Renegades' opener Sunil Narine in their Big Bash League match on Sunday. Narine had mistimed a lofted shot over the mid-off when Pietersen, who was inside the 30-yard circle, chased the ball to complete the catch with arms at full stretch.
