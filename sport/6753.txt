All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja followed up his 54*(55) with two quick wickets before the end of the day's play to help India finish the fourth day in a strong position. India had declared at 603/9 following Cheteshwar Pujara's double ton and Wriddhiman Saha's century, before Jadeja clean bowled David Warner and Nathan Lyon ending Australia's day at 23/2.
