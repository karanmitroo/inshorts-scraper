Former Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath dismissed England's James Anderson to pick up his last and 563rd Test wicket off his Test career's last ball on January 5, 2007. McGrath also picked up a wicket each off his last ball of ODI (April 2007) and T20I (June 2005) career, becoming the only bowler in cricket history to achieve the feat.
