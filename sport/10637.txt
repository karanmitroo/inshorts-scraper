The Sports Ministry inquiry panel probing the OP Jaisha incident at the Rio Olympics, has blamed the marathon runner's coach for the fiasco. Jaisha had complained that no Indian officials were present to provide her personalised drinks during the marathon. The panel said Jaisha's coach had been asked by officials a day earlier about her requirements, but he had refused.
