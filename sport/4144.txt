India women's team captain Mithali Raj has become the first skipper across men's and women's cricket to lead India in two ODI World Cup finals. Mithali, who captained India in the final against England on Sunday, also led in the 2005 final, which the team lost against Australia. Jhulan Goswami is the only other member to play both finals.
