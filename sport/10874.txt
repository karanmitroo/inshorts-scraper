Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra will reportedly launch a high-performance training centre in Chandigarh, which will provide free training facilities to athletes. The centre is said to open in collaboration with Technobody, an Italian company, on October 20. The facilities at the centre will be similar to those used by Bindra during his Rio Olympics' preparation.
