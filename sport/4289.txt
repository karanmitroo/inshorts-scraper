Indian shuttler Jwala Gutta has said national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand was not "irritating" but "let her down" in the past. "Time and again, I was thrown out of the national camp... Being a chief coach, he should be proud and encourage me because I'm number one [doubles player]... I blame him because he was the chief coach," said Jwala.
