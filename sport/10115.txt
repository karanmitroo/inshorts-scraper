In a bizarre coincidence during the first Test between South Africa and Australia at Cape Town, on 11/11/11 at 11:11, SA needed 111 runs to win. All the fans in the crowd stood on one leg for the duration of that minute to commemorate "the Nelson of all Nelsons" with umpire Ian Gould also getting into the spirit.
