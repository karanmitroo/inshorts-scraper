Former American football player Greg Hardy, who has turned into an MMA fighter, won his first-ever professional bout in 32 seconds after knocking out his opponent, Joe Hawkins. The 29-year-old, who was a defensive player in the NFL, was suspended from the league after he was involved in a domestic violence incident.
