A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court on Wednesday allowed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to issue a Letter of Request to the British government for the execution of a non-bailable warrant against Lalit Modi. The ED had issued the warrant against the former IPL commissioner, who is believed to be hiding in the UK, on August 6, 2015.
