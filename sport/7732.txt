The earliest predecessor of chess is believed to have originated in India nearly 1500 years ago. According to a theory, the game was earlier called 'chaturanga', meaning 4-bodied as it was played by 4 players, which evolved to give its present Hindi name 'Shatranj'. Persians and Arabians travelling to ancient India picked up the game and thereafter it spread globally.
