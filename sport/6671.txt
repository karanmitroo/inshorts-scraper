Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has called Aussie media's comparison of Virat Kohli to US President Donald Trump "a load of shit". "Bear in mind, I love Kohli and the Australian public love him. It's just two or three reporters who are trying to tarnish him," Clarke said. An Aussie daily had called Kohli "the Donald Trump of world sport".
