India missed out on two chances in an over to use the DRS to their advantage during the second day of the Vizag Test. In the 105th over, Wriddhiman Saha sought an unsuccessful review of his LBW dismissal. A ball later, Ravindra Jadeja was adjudged LBW but India didn't take a review, even though the ball was missing leg stump.
