Japanese citizens have started donating old mobile phones, which will be used to make medals for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The organisers are looking to retrieve eight tonnes of metal from outdated phones, which will be used to produce 5,000 medals. The project is part of a cost-cutting effort, with the budget being slashed from $26.5 billion to $16.8 billion.
