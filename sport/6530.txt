Former Pakistani cricketer Saqlain Mushtaq was dropped and never played a Test again after the Multan Test against India, in which Virender Sehwag became India's first triple centurion on March 29, 2004. Sehwag reached 300 with a six off Mushtaq, later revealing that he had told Sachin Tendulkar that he would hit a six only if Mushtaq came to bowl.
