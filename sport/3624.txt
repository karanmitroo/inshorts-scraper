Pakistan's Mohammad Amir lost his temper at a teammate who failed to pick up a catch at the boundary during his county side Essex's NatWest T20 Blast match against Sussex. Amir pointed towards his eyes gesturing the fielder to put on his sunglasses, after the fielder blamed the sunlight for it. Notably, Amir dropped two catches himself in the match.
