Premier League club Tottenham handed Kyle Walker-Peters a debut in their season's first match as a replacement for his near-namesake Kyle Walker, who was sold to Manchester City. The 20-year-old defender led Tottenham to a win against Newcastle United and won the Man of the Match award. Walker-Peters got his chance only because Walker's natural replacement Kieran Trippier was injured.
