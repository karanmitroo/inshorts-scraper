Sydney Thunder captain Shane Watson caught Melbourne Stars' Kevin Pietersen off his own bowling in the Big Bash League on Wednesday. Pietersen hit back the full-toss towards the bowler and Watson went low to his left to grab the ball on his follow-through. Pietersen was batting on 60 from 36 balls as Watson claimed his second wicket of the match.
