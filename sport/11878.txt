Almost 8,000 people participated in the Seeueberquerung, a swimming event organised in Lake Zurich in Switzerland on Wednesday. The annual event witnessed people swimming across a stretch of 1,500 metres, while their luggage was transported by boat. Swimmers paid a registration fee to participate, which included a drink, a voucher for risotto and a souvenir glass.
