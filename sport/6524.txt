Former Australian cricket captain Ian Chappell claims that Indian fielder Murali Vijay did take Josh Hazlewood's catch off Ravichandran Ashwin's bowling, which was overruled by the third umpire during the fourth Test's third day. The catch was referred to the third umpire after the appeal. Hazlewood, however, got dismissed after two balls in the same over.
