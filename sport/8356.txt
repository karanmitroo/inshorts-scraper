Pakistan ended their 12-year long winless run against Australia on Australian soil with a six-wicket win in the second ODI at MCG on Sunday. This was Pakistan's first win after a seventeen-match long losing streak against the Aussies in Australia. Driven by Mohammad Hafeez' 72(104), Pakistan chased down the 220-run target with 14 balls to spare.
