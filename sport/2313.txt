Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli was seen talking on a walkie-talkie while sitting in the dugout during the Indian innings in the first T20I against New Zealand on Wednesday. Kohli was reportedly communicating with the dressing room, and had sought permission from ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit to use the walkie-talkie, an official said.
