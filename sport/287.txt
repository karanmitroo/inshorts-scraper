Yusuf Pathan has been dropped from the Baroda squad for Vijay Hazare knockouts, nearly four months after his brother Irfan Pathan was ousted from the team. Yusuf's exclusion has been attributed to his poor form. In January, Yusuf was handed a five-month back-dated suspension by the BCCI for testing positive for a banned substance.
