Kevin Pietersen and Kieron Pollard got involved in an on-field tussle during a Big Bash League match. Pietersen refused to bat against Pollard as the latter's bowling hand was taped. Pietersen claimed it was wrong and asked the umpires to get the tape removed but after a brief discussion, umpires allowed Pollard to continue bowling with the tape on.
