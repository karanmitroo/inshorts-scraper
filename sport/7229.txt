Stating that any bowler could have taken wickets easily on the Pune wicket, Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh said, "I will have to see him (Steve O'Keefe) bowl on a good Test match wicket. Not this one. Till then, I will reserve my comments." Harbhajan had earlier called the present Aussie team "the weakest Australian side to tour India."
