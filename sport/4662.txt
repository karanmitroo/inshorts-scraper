United Kingdom's former Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William have been named in US prosecutor Michael Garcia's FIFA report into 2010's bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups. The report alleges that Cameron and Prince William tried to persuade South Korea to trade votes for hosting the competition, which is a violation of FIFA's ethics rules.
