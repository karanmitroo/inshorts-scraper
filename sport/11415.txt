Cricketer Gautam Gambhir on Saturday posted a tweet saying he doesn’t believe in biopics being made on cricketers. “I think those people who have contributed more to the country than the cricketers deserve a biopic,” wrote Gambhir. Meanwhile, a biopic on India’s ​limited-overs captain MS Dhoni will release on September 30, with another one on Sachin Tendulkar in the pipeline.
