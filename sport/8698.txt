The Melbourne Test between Australia and England was abandoned due to rain on the first three days. It was then decided to play a 40-overs-per-side match on the fifth day to cover the financial losses for the Australian board. A 46,000-strong crowd turned up for the match on January 5, 1971, making the ODIs a permanent fixture in international cricket.
