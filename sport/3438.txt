Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal complained he couldn't hear the sound of the ball due to the noise inside the closed Arthur Ashe Stadium at the US Open. "I was not able to hear the ball when you are hitting, no?" Nadal said. Nadal progressed to the second round of the tournament by beating Dusan Lajovic in straight sets.
