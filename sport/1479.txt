Rahul Dravid has revealed that he went on to score 180 in the second innings of the Kolkata Test in 2001 after then Australian captain Steve Waugh sledged him over his batting position. "Waugh said 'Rahul No. 6 in this innings, what's it in the next? No. 12," revealed Dravid, who was demoted to number six due to poor form.
