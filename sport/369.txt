World number one Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki progressed to the Qatar Open quarter-finals on Thursday after she complained and apparently mocked her opponent Monica Niculescu's grunting. The umpire said he thought everything was "regular", but Wozniacki said, "It's the only way she can win." She later complained that her opponent had used "unfair methods" during the match.
