Formula One teams will be given a chance to invest in the sport, following Liberty Media’s takeover. New F1 chairman Chase Carey said teams had already expressed interest in investing, with former champion McLaren calling the move a “positive step". Earlier on Wednesday, US-based Liberty Media announced acquiring an 18.7% stake worth $4.4 billion in F1 from CVC Capital Partners.
