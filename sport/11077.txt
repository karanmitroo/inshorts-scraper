Justice RM Lodha, Lodha committee's Chairman, has clarified India's participation in the 2017 Champions Trophy won't be affected by the Panel's recommendations. "Champions Trophy remains unaffected because the schedule was prepared before we submitted our report," said Lodha. The recommendation calls for a 15-day window between the IPL and the international calendar, which isn't the case in 2017.
