Virat Kohli became the second Indian after Sachin Tendulkar to feature on the cover of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, an annual cricket reference book published in the UK. Kohli is pictured on the 2017 edition playing a reverse sweep, which depicts how "he has helped revolutionise the sport." Started in 1864, the magazine is the longest running sports annual in history.
