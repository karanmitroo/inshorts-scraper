Australian cricketing legend Shane Warne has said that the BCCI cannot afford to hire him as the head coach of the Indian cricket team. Warne added that he shares a good partnership with Indian captain Virat Kohli but is "very expensive". Virender Sehwag, Tom Moody, Lalchand Rajput and Craig McDermott have applied for the job among others.
