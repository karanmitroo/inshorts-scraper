England-based bat manufacturer Gray-Nicolls has signed up Karnataka captain Karun Nair and Tamil Nadu's Vijay Shankar as it aims to sponsor Indian national team cricketers. This comes amid Nike not renewing its contracts with Indian cricketers. The last time Gray-Nicolls were seen in India was in the late 1970s when former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar was endorsing them.
