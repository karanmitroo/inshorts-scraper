Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Najam Sethi has said all countries want to play against India as it helps generate maximum revenue. He further said it was a wrong impression that Pakistan was desperate to play India and insisted it was about asking for its due. He added India shouldn't have signed the MoU if they couldn't fulfil it.
