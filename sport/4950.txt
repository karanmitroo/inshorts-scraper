A video has surfaced which shows current Indian captain Virat Kohli and Indian pacer Ashish Nehra seeking self-proclaimed godman, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's blessings. "[Kohli] was unable to convert good starts into big scores. I suggested him to practice hard and continue learning," the godman had earlier claimed. The video shows Kohli kneeling down before Ram Rahim with folded hands.
