Sri Lankan Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has been accused of ordering the Lankan cricket team to use witchcraft before its Test series win against Pakistan. A sorcerer claimed SL Test captain approached her to cast spell over Pakistan on Jayasekara's orders. "If she really cast a spell, how come we were whitewashed in ODI series?" Jayasekara asked denying his involvement.
