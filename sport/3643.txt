The Indian Sports Ministry has removed Paralympics gold-winner Mariyappan Thangavelu's coach Satyanarayana from the list of this year's Dronacharya awardees due to a criminal case pending against him. The final mails were sent out to the award winners on Friday after Sports Minister Vijay Goel cleared the file. The lists for Khel Ratna and Arjuna Awards have been kept unchanged.
