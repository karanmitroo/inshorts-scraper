David Warner was batting on 97 in the ongoing Test against South Africa when he was dismissed after being struck by 'commentator's curse'. Commentator Mark Nicholas, while praising Warner, said the batsman was going to score a century as he was never dismissed in the 90s in Test matches. Warner nicked the next delivery from Steyn to the first slip.
