Cricketer Vinod Kambli slammed a Twitter user for wrongly tagging him in a condolence post on veteran actor Vinod Khanna's demise. While the user apologised for his mistake and claimed it wasn't done intentionally, Kambli blocked him on Twitter. Vinod Khanna, who was reportedly suffering from cancer, passed away at the age of 70 on Thursday.
