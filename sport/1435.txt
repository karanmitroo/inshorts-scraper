Reacting to Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur comparing Babar Azam to Indian captain Virat Kohli, the Pakistani batsman said he should not be compared to a "very big player" like Kohli. "Maybe the stats at the start of our careers are similar, but he is the no. 1 batsman in the world," he added. Azam added that he follows Kohli nowadays.
