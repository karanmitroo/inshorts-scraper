PV Sindhu’s coach Pullela Gopichand has revealed that he had confiscated the Rio silver medalist’s phone during her training in the last three months. “The first thing is I would return her phone. She can now have her sweet curd and ice cream too,” said Gopichand, following Sindhu’s silver finish in the women’s badminton singles in Rio on Friday.
