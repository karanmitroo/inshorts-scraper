Former footballer Diego Maradona has said Lionel Messi might have "staged" his retirement, following Argentina's loss in the Copa America final in June. "[Messi] escaped the criticism but Argentines suffered. Maybe his retirement was staged to make us forget about the three final losses," said Maradona. Messi came out of retirement last week, saying he "loved this country too much."
