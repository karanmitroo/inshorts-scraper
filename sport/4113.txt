Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar retweeted a post on Twitter that claimed 19 batsmen were retired hurt after being hit by his deliveries, which is the most by any bowler. Akhtar further revealed that he enjoyed hitting former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden the most. "I did that [hit Hayden] many times during test...now we are best mates," he added.
