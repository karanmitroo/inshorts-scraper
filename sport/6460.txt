Dismissing Pakistan limited overs skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed's claim that the Indian team was scared of playing against Pakistan, Misbah-ul-Haq said, "Sarfaraz has his own views but I don't think he said they were scared directly." "I think the Indian players also would like to play against us but it is politics which is not allowing a bilateral series," Misbah added.
