MS Dhoni was seen performing the usual tasks of a captain during an optional practice session on the eve of the Kolkata ODI. The former skipper inspected the Eden Gardens pitch, took locals' feedback and gave his teammates a pep talk. Dhoni went down on his knees to have a close look at the pitch as Kohli skipped the session.
