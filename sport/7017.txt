Following the successful staging of the Pakistan Super League final, the International Cricket Council will be sending a World XI team to Lahore in September for a four-match T20 series against Pakistan. The tournament, called 'The Independence Cup', will be held to make efforts for the re-introduction of top-level cricket to Pakistan after an eight-year hiatus.
