Following wrestler Sushil Kumar winning the gold at the National Wrestling Championship without fighting in the quarters, semis and final, Farhan Akhtar tweeted he hoped Sushil does not accept the medal. Sushil had gotten walkovers by his competitors, with his rivals in the quarter-final and semi-final touching his feet. "It's not sportsmanlike," tweeted Farhan on Sushil.
