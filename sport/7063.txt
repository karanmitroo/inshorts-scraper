Criticising Virat Kohli for his performance, Australian selector Mark Waugh said, "He's obviously thinking a little bit negatively and that's rubbed off on a few of his teammates." "He (Kohli) made a point of saying 'we need to play with much more intent in this game' but he's been the prime example of not actually doing that," Waugh added.
