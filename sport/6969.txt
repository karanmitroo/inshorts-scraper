The University Oval ground in Dunedin was evacuated after a fire alarm went off during the New Zealand-South Africa Test on Friday. Players were asked to collect in the middle of the field but later asked to leave the ground along with spectators and officials after the alarm rang. Play resumed after 20 minutes when the fire department gave clearance.
