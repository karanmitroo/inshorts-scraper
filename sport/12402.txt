American hurdler, Kendra Harrison broke the 28-year-old world record in the 100-metre hurdles after clocking 12.20 seconds at the London Anniversary Games on Friday. Interestingly, the 23-year-old American has failed to qualify for the upcoming Rio Olympics. Harrison now holds six of the seven fastest times this year and two of the four fastest ever in 100 metres hurdles.
