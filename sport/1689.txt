Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness unveiled a stone statue of former sprinter Usain Bolt at Independence Park in Kingston as a tribute to the eight-time Olympic gold winner. The sculpture has been designed by renowned Jamaican sculptor Basil Watson. "I feel very good and I am very honoured because I never thought it would ever happen to me," Bolt said.
