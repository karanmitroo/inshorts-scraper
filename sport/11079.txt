International Kabaddi Federation chief Deoraj Chaturvedi has said Pakistan won't participate in the Kabaddi World Cup in India, since it's "not the right time to engage" with the country. Pakistan replied saying both nations should've been excluded if there were security concerns. "We were hoping to win the World Cup in India by beating India," said Pakistan's captain Nasir Ali.
