Wrestler Narsingh Yadav, who has been handed a four-year doping ban by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, has claimed he would have won a medal had he been allowed to compete at the Rio Olympics. Narsingh's claims have been supported by Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has demanded a CBI probe in the incident.
