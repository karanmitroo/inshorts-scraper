Virat Kohli's 293 runs in the Delhi Test against Sri Lanka are the most by an Indian captain in a Test match. Kohli surpassed the record of 289, set by then captain Sunil Gavaskar against Windies in 1978. Kohli, who hit 610 runs in the series, also became the first Indian to smash 600-plus runs in three different Test series.
