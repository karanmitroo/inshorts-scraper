Speaking about his activity on social media platform Twitter, former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag said, "Now there is no fear, no BCCI, no match referees to deduct fees or put a (match) ban from playing." Sehwag further said his tweets get so much attention because he speaks his heart out, and is not afraid of anybody.
