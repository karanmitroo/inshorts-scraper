Australian cyclist Shane Perkins, who won bronze at the 2012 Olympics, has been granted Russian citizenship. Perkins has no family ties to Russia and had applied for citizenship in February after failing to make Australia's cycling team at the Rio Olympics. Perkins thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he was ready to race for Russia at the 2020 Olympics.
