Australia's legendary batsman Donald Bradman was dropped from the team after a poor performance in his first Test. Bradman was made to sit out for the only time in his career following his scores of 18 and 1. Australia were all-out for 66 in the second innings and lost the match, which ended on December 5, 1928, by 675 runs.
