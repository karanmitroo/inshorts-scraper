A group of around ten individuals attacked the match officials of the Chinese League One, after the football match between Baoding Rongda and Wuhan Zall ended in a draw last Saturday. The officials were attacked in their hotel room after the power in their room was cut off. Notably, the referees had been accused of 'fixing' the match.
