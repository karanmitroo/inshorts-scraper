Speaking about Sri Lanka resorting to witchcraft for winning the Test series, Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed said, "If they could win Test matches because of witchcraft, then they should have also won the ODI and T20 series". "We lost the two Tests because of our poor batting and that is all," Sarfraz added.
