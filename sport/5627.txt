Weapons belonging to India's shooting team were seized by the customs department at Delhi airport on Tuesday, with the shooters being detained for over 13 hours. The shooters, which included a few Olympians returning from the Plzen Grand Prix, were reportedly clueless about the reason for detention. They also alleged the customs officials used foul language with them.
