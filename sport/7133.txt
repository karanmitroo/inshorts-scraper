Karachi Kings' wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara pulled off a one-handed leaping catch to dismiss Islamabad United's Dwayne Smith in the second qualifying final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in Sharjah. Smith tried to slog a Mohammad Amir delivery but instead offered a thick outside edge which the 39-year-old wicketkeeper caught with his right hand completely stretched.
