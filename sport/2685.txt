The first Pakistani-origin Australian Test cricketer, Usman Khawaja, said being racially abused when growing up led him to stop supporting Australia in sporting contests. Khawaja said he was the target of racist sledging from not only the opposing players but also their parents. "[W]hen I watched Aussie team, I saw men who were hard-nosed, confident, almost brutish," he added.
