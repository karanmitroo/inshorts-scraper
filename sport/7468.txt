India's former cricket captain Kapil Dev has warned current Indian team captain Virat Kohli of a possible burn out due to his excessively strenuous training schedule. "Sometimes I think he is over-fit. When you train that hard, your muscles can burn out faster. With that much fitness training, you're worried about getting injured also," Kapil said.
