Qui Nguyen, a former nail salon owner from Vietnam, won a $162.2 million pot after bluffing in the 2016 World Series of Poker tournament in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Nguyen, playing against pro Gordon Vayo, started the hand with an 18% winning chance, which fell to 0% at the final card. However, he bluffed and went all-in, with Vayo folding.
