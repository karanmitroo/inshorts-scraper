England's Football Association (FA), the world's first football body, was formed in London on October 26, 1863. Eleven clubs met to form the association, most of which are now defunct or play only Rugby, with Civil Service FC being the only one still existent and playing football. The inaugural game was held on December 19 in the same year.
