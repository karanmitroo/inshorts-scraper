Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo became the first-ever player to score 100 goals in the UEFA Champions League, after bagging a match-winning hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday. Earlier, the 32-year-old Portuguese had also become the first player to register 100 goals in European club competitions, netting two goals against the German opponents in their quarter-final tie's first leg.
