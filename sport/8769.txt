Cricket's first ever hat-trick was taken on January 2, 1879, by an Australian pacer Fred Spofforth. Spofforth, whose popular nickname was "The Demon", claimed three English wickets in what was cricket's third international Test match. The second wicket Spofforth took was of a player who was facing his first ever ball in international cricket.
