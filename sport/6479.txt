Australian pacer Mitchell Starc mistook a fake Virat Kohli Twitter profile to be the Indian skipper's actual account and sent a personal message to it. The fake profile, with the handle @imVkohlli, shared a screenshot of Starc's message, in which the former RCB bowler has joked that hopefully he "doesn't have to look for a new IPL team".
