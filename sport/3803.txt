English spinner Moeen Ali, who picked up 25 wickets in the series against South Africa, stepped aside during the champagne-spraying celebration by England players after they clinched the series. The 30-year-old spinner, who avoids taking part in the champagne celebrations due to religious reasons, said, "I don't feel I miss out, it's just spraying a bottle, not that exciting really."
