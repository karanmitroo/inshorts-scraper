Former women cricketers have reportedly written to BCCI, questioning the Committee of Administrators' decision of awarding select ex-players a one-time payment of ₹25 lakh. The board has claimed that a few former players have also demanded the amount, but the BCCI is not able to verify their credentials. Three players were awarded ₹25 lakh, while three were given ₹15 lakh.
