Baljit Singh Joban, the father of 31-year-old alleged fixer and ex-Delhi cricketer Sobers Joban, has said that if his son is found guilty by ICC then "let them hang him". This comes after Joban appeared in an undercover video by a British tabloid as one of two men offering to sell details of "fixed" sessions of the third Ashes Test.
