Former English spinner Jim Laker was the first bowler in Test history to claim all ten wickets in an innings, achieving the feat against Australia in 1956. This, however, was not the only time Laker took a 10-wicket haul as he had dismissed the entire Australian line-up earlier that season as well while playing for Surrey in a tour match.
