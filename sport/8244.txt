The record for the longest bowling run-up in cricket is of 4.2 kilometres set in 2015 by Ian Biddle, a 43-year-old amateur cricketer. Biddle, a pacer, started his run-up from a Warwickshire town hall and took three laps of the pitch before bowling the delivery. He broke the previous record of 2.7 kilometres, set by UK's Jason Rawson in 2010.
