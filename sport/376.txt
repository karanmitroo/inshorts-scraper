With their series victory against South Africa, India extended their bilateral ODI series winning streak to nine, which is the second-longest in history after Windies' 14 straight series wins. India's winning streak began with a 3-0 victory over Zimbabwe in June 2016 and they have beaten New Zealand (twice), England, Windies, Sri Lanka (twice), Australia and South Africa since then.
