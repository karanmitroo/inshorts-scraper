Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya who hit three straight sixes against Sri Lanka on Sunday has achieved the feat three times in the past three months. Pandya managed to hit three consecutive sixes twice against Pakistan while playing in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. Pandya's debut century is also the fastest by an Indian while batting at number 8 or lower.
