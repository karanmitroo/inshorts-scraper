Sunrisers Hyderabad openers Shikhar Dhawan and David Warner became T20 cricket's first duo to have scored 2,000 runs in partnership for any wicket, after going past the landmark against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday. This was the opening pair's sixth century partnership, the most by any opening pair in the history of T20 cricket.
