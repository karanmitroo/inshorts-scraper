French tennis player Adrian Mannarino hit a drop shot with so much spin that it bounced back 
over the net in the first round match against Pablo Cuevas at the Rome Masters tournament. Mannarino's drop shot, which is popularly called the 'boomerang drop shot', helped him gain a point in the second game of the second set.
