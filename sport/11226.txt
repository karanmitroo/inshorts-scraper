Following his inclusion in the Indian Test squad after two years, Gautam Gambhir tweeted, "Excitement of a debutant, certainty of experienced, nervousness of a novice...am feeling it all. Eden here I come loaded with ambitions." Gambhir, who also thanked the BCCI on Twitter, has been named in the squad for the remainder of the New Zealand series, replacing KL Rahul.
