The fourth India-England Test at Wankhede is the first match in Mumbai without a local player. Since 1933, when Bombay Gymkhana hosted the first-ever Test in India, 43 Tests have been played at three different grounds in the city, each featuring a local. Ajinkya Rahane, who has played for Mumbai, was ruled out of the current Test following an injury.
