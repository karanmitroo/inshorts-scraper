The design of the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, the world's first fully demountable football stadium to be used for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, has been unveiled. Shipping containers will be used as one of the main building blocks and will have removable seats. The stadium will be capable of being reassembled or turned into multiple smaller venues.
