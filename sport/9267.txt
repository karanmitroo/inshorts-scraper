Indian all-rounder Jayant Yadav, while batting in the Mumbai Test, played an off-drive on the bowling of spinner Moeen Ali through the legs of a fielder. The fielder, who was stationed at silly mid-off for close-in catches, could not react quickly enough to stop the ball. Yadav on Sunday became the first Indian to score a century at number nine.
