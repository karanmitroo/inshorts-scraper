The Davis Cup, in existence since 1900, may be converted into a 'World Cup of Tennis' from next year. The new format will feature 18 teams playing a week-long event at one venue, instead of the existing 16 teams playing across four different months. A 25-year, $3 billion partnership with investment group Kosmos is in place for the new event.
