Just before leaving India, New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor shared "one last message" for Virender Sehwag, writing, "Dhullai aur Silaai Anne waale samay mein jaari rahegi." Earlier, after India's T20I series win, Sehwag had tweeted, "Dhulaai ke baad silaai, but well played NZ. Never feel very bad losing against NZ." Sehwag had earlier trolled Taylor by calling him 'darji' (tailor).
