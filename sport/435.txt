Canada's Mark McMorris won the bronze medal in men's snowboard slopestyle event at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics on Sunday, 11 months after being involved in a near-fatal accident. McMorris broke 17 bones, besides suffering a collapsed lung and ruptured spleen, after slamming into a tree while snowboarding in March 2017. "It's definitely a miracle," McMorris said after winning the medal.
