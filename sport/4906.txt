Former cricketer Virender Sehwag has denied reports that he sent a two-line CV for the post of India coach. "I would be happy to get that two-line CV from the media source. If I had to send a two-line resume, my name was enough," said Sehwag. He added that the resume he sent was compliant with BCCI's requirements.
