The 31st World Bog Snorkelling Championships was held on Sunday in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales. The annual event involves people swimming through two lengths of a 55-metre swamp in the fastest possible time, with only a snorkel for help. The world record for the same was set in 2014 by Kirsty Johnson with a time of 1 minute and 22.56 seconds.
