Cristiano Ronaldo and his mother have starred in a Portuguese advertisement for a telecom company, which is a parody of the 1990s film 'Home Alone'. Ronaldo, playing the protagonist Kevin McAllister, recreates scenes from the film, including scaring the pizza delivery man away using television gun shots. Other clips include his mother realising that she left her son at home.
