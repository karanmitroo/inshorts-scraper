PSG forward Kylian Mbappe has won the Golden Boy award for the best young player in Europe, beating competition from world's second-costliest player Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford. The 18-year-old Frenchman scored 15 goals last season for eventual Ligue-1 winners Monaco. The award, in its 15th year, is given to Europe's best player aged under 21.
