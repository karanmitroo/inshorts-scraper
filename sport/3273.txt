India became the first team to complete a clean sweep across all the formats while playing away from home, after completing a 9-0 drubbing of Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Before this series, Australia's 9-0 drubbing of Pakistan while playing at home in 2009-10 was the only other instance of a team winning nine matches as a part of a tour.
