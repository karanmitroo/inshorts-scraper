After winning the Ballon d'Or for a record-equalling fifth time, Cristiano Ronaldo said that he is the best player in history and that there isn't a player more complete than him. "No player can do the things that I can..I play well with either foot, I'm quick, powerful, good with my head, I score goals, I assist goals," he added.
