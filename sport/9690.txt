The Mumbai Test between India and West Indies, which ended on November 26, 2011, was only the second Test which ended in a draw with the scores level. The match is considered a draw, and not a tie, as India still had a wicket remaining when the time expired. The first such Test was in 1996, between Zimbabwe and England.
