The roof of a sports hall at a gymnasium in the Czech Republic collapsed during an indoor hockey tournament. Seven local teams and one from abroad were present in the complex during the incident but managed to escape unharmed. The incident was reportedly caused by heaps of snow which put pressure on the roof's wooden beams.
