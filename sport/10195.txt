Barcelona women's team player BÃ¡rbara Latorre scored a Messi-like solo goal in the women's first division city derby match against Espanyol. She picked up the ball in her own half and sprinted past five defenders before scoring with a top-corner finish. Latorre was tripped by the fifth defender just outside the box, but managed to pick herself up before scoring.
