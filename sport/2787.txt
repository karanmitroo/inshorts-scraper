Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, who began his professional career at Portuguese club Sporting CP, has revealed that he used to sneak out of the academy's dormitory to conduct overnight workouts as an 11-year-old. Ronaldo also revealed that he decided to work hard as he was frustrated by the coaches' comments about him being talented but 'too skinny'.
