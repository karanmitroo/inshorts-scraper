British Indian orthopaedic surgeon, Chinmay Gupte, is leading a team at the Imperial College of London to assess cricket bat performance. The research is aimed at maintaining a balance between batting and bowling in cricket. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), cricket's governing body, has incorporated Gupte's team's findings by introducing new laws that restrict bat size and depth.
