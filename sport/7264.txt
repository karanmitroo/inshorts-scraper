Indian pacer Umesh Yadav mistakenly threw the ball over the ropes while attempting a catch near the boundary on Day 3 of the Pune Test. As Nathan Lyon swept the ball towards deep square leg, Yadav took the catch and tried to throw the ball back into the field but instead lobbed it over the fence for a six.
