Rudi Bosman, a lecturer, won ₹23 lakh for taking a one handed-catch in the crowd during the New Zealand-England T20I on Sunday. This is the second time in the tri-series that a fan won the ₹23-lakh cash reward after Mitchell Grimstone in the Australia-New Zealand match. "I'm sure the wife's already spending some of it at home," Bosman said.
