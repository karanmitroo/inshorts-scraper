The year's final Grand Slam, the US Open, is using around 275 ballpersons, who are being paid around $11 (â‚¹700) per hour for their on-court duties. The voluntary ballboys are divided into teams of six to work on-court shifts, lasting about two hours. After the tournament, the ballboys are allowed to keep the official US Open ballboy attire.
