South Africa defeated India by 115 runs on Saturday, ending India's four-match winning streak in the Women's World Cup. Mithali Raj, who required 34 runs to become Women's ODI cricket's leading run-scorer, was dismissed for a golden duck, her first in her 18-year career. Only four Indians were able to score more than 10 runs.
