Four junior trap shooters were disqualified at the ongoing Nationals in Jaipur, for not using ammunition conforming to international standards. Pellets belonging to the shooters failed to pass through the sieve, implying they did not conform to the 24.5 grams weight and 2.6 mm diameter standards. The National Rifle Association of India blamed the manufacturers for the error.
