Current Wimbledon champion and 22-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams took to Facebook to address the issue of rising gun violence against the African-American community in the US. "As Dr. Martin Luther King said 'There comes a time when silence is betrayal.' I won't be silent," wrote Serena, recounting her thoughts when she was driving with her 18-year-old African-American nephew.
