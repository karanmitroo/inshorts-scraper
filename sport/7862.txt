Virender Sehwag shared a childhood picture of himself alongside his nine-year-old son Aaryavir's similar photo. In the photos, both Sehwag and Aaryavir are wearing sunglasses and posing in a similar manner. "Pic 1 - Virender Sehwag. Pic 2 - Aaryavir Sehwag. Every Father should remember that one day his Son will follow his example instead of his advice," Sehwag wrote.
