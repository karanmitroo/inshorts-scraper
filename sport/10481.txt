Michael Lee had predicted in his high school yearbook quote that Chicago-based baseball club Chicago Cubs would be appearing in the MLB World Series in 2016. Lee's quote read, "Chicago Cubs. 2016 World Champions. You heard it here first." The Chicago Cubs are appearing in the tournament for the first time in seven decades.
