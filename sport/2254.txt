Virat Kohli, in a recent interview, revealed that he has become more sensible in the last four years because of his girlfriend Anushka Sharma. Kohli said he had "no sense before" and ever since Anushka has come into his life, he has learnt a lot. "Manners, poise, how to use my position in life for good...it's all Anushka," he added.
