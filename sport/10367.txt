Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh took an aerial catch to dismiss South African opener Stephen Cook during the ongoing Test at Perth on Thursday. In the first over of the match, Cook edged a Mitchell Starc delivery towards gully where Marsh was fielding, who leapt to his left to take a blinder. South Africa lost their top-three batsmen for 20 runs.
