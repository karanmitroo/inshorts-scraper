The Australian and Windies women's cricket team captains got into an argument during the toss of their World Cup match on Monday. Windies captain Stafanie Taylor, who had told her Australian counterpart Meg Lanning and the referee that they would bat first, changed her decision. The referee intervened, who declared that Taylor would have to stick to her original decision.
