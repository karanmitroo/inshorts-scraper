Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble are reportedly unhappy after India was allotted a smaller practice arena compared to the main facility in Birmingham on Thursday. The small size of the ground restricted pacers Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya, who could not complete their run-up. The team is training in Birmingham ahead of the match against Pakistan on Sunday.
