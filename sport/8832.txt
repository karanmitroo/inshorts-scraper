Former Australian spinner Shane Warne shared a photo on Instagram comparing statistics of major spinners who toured Australia in the last 25-30 years. Warne explained in the post why the visiting spinners fail in Australia, stating, "Plenty of reasons why this is the case...the main two reasons are the spinners have bowled too fast and had the wrong tactics."
