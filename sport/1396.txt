Brisbane Heat's Mitchell Swepson took a diving catch to dismiss Melbourne Stars' Ben Dunk for a duck in the Big Bash League on Wednesday. Swepson, while fielding at the short third man position, leapt to take a catch following Dunk's drive but the ball burst out of his hands. He then dived and completed the catch on his second attempt.
