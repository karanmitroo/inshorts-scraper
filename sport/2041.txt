Late boxer Muhammad Ali's daughter Laila, who was into professional boxing between 1999 and 2007, has said she was advised by people to model as she was "too pretty to box". "[People] couldn't fathom the fact that I was a woman, a pretty woman, who wanted to fight," she added. Laila never lost a bout in her professional boxing career.
