Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag has alleged that the Sri Lankan team complained about smog and delayed the match during the second day of the Delhi Test in order to stop Virat Kohli from reaching 300 runs. "When they came to bat, they didn't wear masks. Did the pollution level reduce all of a sudden then?" he questioned.
