Dutch tennis player Robin Haase did a 'Robin Hood archery pose' at the umpire during his French Open second round match against Rafael Nadal on Wednesday. Haase played a backhand shot which smashed into the umpire's chair, following which he gestured taking out an arrow and shooting it. The umpire in turn joined his hands in a "mercy" gesture.
