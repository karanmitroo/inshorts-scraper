Former Windies' cricketer Garry Sobers, the first professional cricketer to score six sixes in an over, was born with six fingers on each hand. Sobers had played his first colonial game with 11 fingers, after one of the spare fingers was removed before he was nine. The other spare finger was removed with a sharp knife when he was 14.
