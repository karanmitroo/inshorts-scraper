The Red Bull Skydive Team attempted to set a world record by swinging on a 125-metre-long rope attached to two hot air balloons 1,800 metres above the ground in Austria. The skydivers parachuted to the ground after their 'Mega Swing' stunt. Red Bull said it is waiting to hear whether the stunt had set the record for the longest swing.
