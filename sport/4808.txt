A study conducted by BBC into 68 different sports has revealed that 83% of the sports are currently paying men and women equal prize money. Despite the reduced pay disparity between the genders, men still get higher prize money in sports like football, cricket and golf. Notably, not one sport rewarded men and women equally nearly four decades ago.
