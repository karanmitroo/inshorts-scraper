Athlete Sudha Singh, who won the women's 3000-metre steeplechase gold at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar, has said the UP government is reluctant in giving her a job. "The government order to give jobs to medal winners was issued in 2014...since 2015, I am running from pillar to post," said Sudha, who plans to meet UP CM Yogi Adityanath.
