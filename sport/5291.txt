West Indies' Sunil Narine became the first and the only player to bowl a maiden Super Over in T20s, while playing in a Caribbean Premier League match in 2014. Representing Guyana Amazon Warriors, Narine defended 12 runs in the deciding over against Trinidad & Tobago Red Steel. Narine, who turned 29 on Friday, also picked a wicket in the over.
