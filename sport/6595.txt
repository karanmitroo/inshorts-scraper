New Zealand's Tom Latham, fielding at short-leg, pulled off a one-handed catch after anticipating South Africa's Faf du Plessis' paddle sweep shot. Latham had started running to his right even before the ball was pitched and had predicted Du Plessis' sweep would come to him. He then plucked the ball with his right hand while still running to his right.
