Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Associate Vice President Narinder Batra has resigned from the post after the IOA failed to withdraw Suresh Kalmadi and Abhay Chautala's life president nominations. Notably, IOA had not taken any action regarding the withdrawal of the two nominations for the post even after 3 days of the Annual General Meeting.
