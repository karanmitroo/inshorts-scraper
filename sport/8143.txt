Actor Shah Rukh Khan has given the title of 'Baazigar' to former Indian skipper MS Dhoni and 'Don' to captain Virat Kohli. "Virat's grim determination on his face, mind ticking all the time, the calmness at the crease, knowing that he will win it all...He is Don...Dhoni is that guy who can play the last bet," said Shah Rukh.
