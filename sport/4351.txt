A clip from a 1993 FA Cup match between Queens Park Rangers and Manchester City has been voted as the 'worst 20 seconds of football' by an Italian magazine. The clip shows QPR taking a corner with an unmarked player jumping but unable to meet the ball. It then reaches a City player who dribbles it into his own box.
