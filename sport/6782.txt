Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has called South Africa's wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock a superstar. A Twitter user had posted, "Seems like @QuinnyDeKock69 is the new @gilly381. Comes in late in the middle order and scores at an impatient pace!" "Nice compliment for me. That kid is a superstar," Gilchrist replied to the user's tweet.
