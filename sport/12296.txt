American skydiver Luke Aikins became the first person to successfully jump from an altitude of 25,000 feet without using a parachute. Aikins achieved the feat, called ‘Heaven Sent’, on Saturday in California desert, using air currents and landed on a 10,000-square feet net. Aikins has done over 18,000 skydives with a parachute and performed stunts in movies like 'Ironman 3'.
