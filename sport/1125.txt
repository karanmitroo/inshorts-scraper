Two out of Test cricket's top-three opening wicket stands are by Indians, with Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy setting a then-record stand of 413 against New Zealand on January 7, 1956. India's Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag missed equalling the same mark by three runs while playing against Pakistan in Lahore in 2006.
