Indian pacer Ishant Sharma dismissed Australia's Matt Renshaw after bowling consecutive bouncers at him during the Ranchi Test on Monday. The over started with a dead ball which Ishant hurled towards the keeper, followed by three short-pitched deliveries. On the fourth ball of the over, Ishant trapped Renshaw LBW on a full delivery which pitched outside off but seamed in.
