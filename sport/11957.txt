Former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist claims he always found it difficult facing Mutthiah Muralitharan and Harbhajan Singh. "I could never read the delivery from Muraliâ€™s finger movements. He always made me feel like a 10-year-old," Gilchrist said. Meanwhile, Harbhajan dismissed Gilchrist four times in 2001's Test series and restricted him to an average of 25 in their 10 Tests together.
