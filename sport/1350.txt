Following his record ton against Sri Lanka in the Indore T20I on Friday, Indian opener Rohit Sharma took to Instagram to post a picture of himself with wife Ritika Sajdeh. He captioned it, "There you go, my lucky charm". Earlier this month, Rohit had dedicated his third ODI double ton to his wife after scoring it on their anniversary.
