Former Indian all-rounder Ravi Shastri on Monday termed the recent increase in payment for Grade A cricketers by the BCCI as "peanuts". "It's nothing, ₹2 crore is peanuts. How much is an Australian (top player) getting, ₹8 crore?" Shastri said. "Your A grade contracts have to be massive, I know it has been doubled," the commentator added.
