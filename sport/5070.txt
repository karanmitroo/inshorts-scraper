Australian vice-captain David Warner has said that the 2013 punch-up incident with Joe Root helped him "transform into the cricketer and man he is today". "It was a learning curve for myself," said Warner. The altercation between the two happened in a Birmingham bar after England defeated Australia in the Champions Trophy 2013, following which Warner was suspended and fined.
