Former Indian player Virender Sehwag has said that he and West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle would discuss Australian bowlers during their conversations. “When we used to chat, we used to discuss about hitting sixes and how to thrash bowling attacks, especially Australian bowlers,” said Sehwag, at the launch of Gayle’s autobiography ‘Six Machine’ in New Delhi on Friday.
