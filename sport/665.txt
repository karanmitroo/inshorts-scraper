The coin toss in the Pakistan-Zimbabwe Test at Harare on January 31, 1995, was done twice as Pakistan captain Saleem Malik called 'bird' instead of heads or tails. The coin had an eagle, the national bird of Zimbabwe, inscribed on one side. Malik won as the 'bird' turned up but referee ordered a re-toss which came out in Zimbabwe's favour.
