England all-rounder Ben Stokes on Wednesday took to Twitter to publicly apologise to model Katie Price and her disabled son Harvey over a video wherein he mocked Harvey. The video had surfaced just after the all-rounder was placed under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm in an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September.
