Ukrainian top-tier football club Karpaty Lviv's players were forced to take off their jerseys by their fans after losing 1-6 to NK Veres Rivne on Sunday. "Take them [the team jerseys] off! It's our colour!" a fan told players by the side of the pitch. A section of the crowd was also heard chanting, "We are Karpaty, you are sh*t."
