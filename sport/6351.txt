Harsha Bhogle has announced on Facebook that he will be part of the Hindi commentary panel for broadcasters SET Max during IPL 2017. "It will be a new experience doing commentary in Hindi. I've done it before but only a little bit here and there...You will have to pardon (or be amused by) the Hyderabadi intonation and accent!" Bhogle stated.
