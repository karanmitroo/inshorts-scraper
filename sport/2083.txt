When Rohit Sharma smashed 264 in an ODI against Sri Lanka on November 13, 2014, India's victory margin was 153 runs, the same margin of victory when Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag scored ODI double centuries. Sachin scored men's ODIs' first-ever double ton against South Africa in 2010, while Sehwag broke his record with 219 against Windies in 2011.
