Marcus Stoinis, who became the first Australian cricketer to score a 100 and get 3 wickets in an ODI, was helped by Anand Chulani, an Indian peak performance coach. Stoinis met Chulani during his stint with Kings XI Punjab, where Chulani was the official peak performance and mental conditioning expert. The player-coach duo has been working together since IPL 2016.
