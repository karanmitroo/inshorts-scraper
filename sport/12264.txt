Former Australian pacer Brett Lee said that he will pray if he ever gets to bowl to Indian Test captain, Virat Kohli. “Virat is so powerful. He is a 360 degree player. There will be a lot of praying going. Please don’t hit me for a six,” said Lee, who is in India for promoting his debut film ‘UnIndian’.
