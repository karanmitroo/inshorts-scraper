Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, in partnership with Wisden India, has launched the world's first auction fantasy league named 'Cric-Trade' for cricket fans. It is played on a match-day basis and pitches two players against each other, who bid for a particular cricketer. The auctions begin two hours before a match and run for one and a half hours.
