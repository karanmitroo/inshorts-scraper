FIFA President Gianni Infantino has suggested expanding the football World Cup to 48 teams, from the existing 32-team format. As per the new format, 16 teams would be eliminated in a one-match knockout, and the remaining 32 will play according to the existing format. A final decision on the proposal would be taken at a FIFA Council meeting in January.
