England opener Alex Hales refunded £4.10, 10% of the ticket price, to English fan Alexis Fuller, after the latter complained of slow over rate in the England-Pakistan Birmingham Test. Fuller tweeted to English cricketers asking for a refund, since only 81 out of the scheduled 90 overs were bowled. Later, Hales asked for Fuller’s bank details and transferred the amount.
