Reacting to ex-South African captain Graeme Smith's comments about Australian cricket, skipper Steven Smith said that he's "not sure" what the former knows about the country's cricket scenario. Steve said, "He obviously wasn't involved in it...the team is in a good place". Graeme Smith had earlier remarked that Australian cricket was in "turmoil and lacked self-belief".
