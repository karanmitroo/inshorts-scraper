South African pacer Kagiso Rabada has been suspended from his side's second Test against England for his animated send-off to English all-rounder Ben Stokes in the first Test. Rabada, who was heard over the stump microphones using inappropriate language, admitted the offence on Friday afternoon and accepted the sanction imposed on him by the match referee.
