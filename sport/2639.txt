The ICC on Friday gave an in-principle approval to a nine-team Test league and 13-team ODI league. The Test league, which would start after the 2019 World Cup, will span over two years with each country playing six series, culminating in a World Test League Championship Final. The ODI league will be a direct qualification pathway to the World Cup.
