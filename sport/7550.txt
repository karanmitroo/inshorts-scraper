Indian batting coach Sanjay Bangar revealed that the Indian batsmen have gone back to a "narrower stance" in order to play spin better. Former coach Duncan Fletcher had prescribed a wider stance for the batsmen earlier. "A lot of batsmen have gone back to narrower stance purely because mobility is a crucial aspect in batsmanship," said Bangar.
