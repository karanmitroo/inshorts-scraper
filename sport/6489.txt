South Africa's limited overs captain AB de Villiers will lead Royal Challengers Bangalore in Virat Kohli's absence in IPL 10, coach Daniel Vettori has said. Kohli, who missed the final Test against Australia because of a shoulder injury, will join RCB on April 2, after which BCCI doctors and the team's medical staff will decide if he is fit.
