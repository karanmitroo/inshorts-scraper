Speaking about the comparison between the Indian captain Virat Kohli and Australia's Steve Smith, Sourav Ganguly said, "There will be a time when Virat Kohli will score and Steve Smith will not score runs." "I think it's just one of those times when one person gets the runs and the other person doesn't get runs," Ganguly added.
