Speaking about his return to Tests, South Africa's AB de Villiers has said he feels like "he is in the best form of his life". "It feels like my debut back in 2004 when I started as an opening batsman then a keeper at No 7...I am feeling in a good space and the energy is good," said the 33-year-old.
