India's women's cricket team player Harmanpreet Kaur has been offered a job in Punjab Police by CM Captain Amarinder Singh, after she was rejected by the department in 2010. Harmanpreet was then told that the department had no provision to employ female cricketers, but Captain Singh said he would review the state's policy to employ the cricketer now.
