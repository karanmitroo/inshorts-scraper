Cricketer Ramnaresh Sarwan has won a case against the West Indies Cricket Board, for which he has been awarded $161,000 as damages. In 2010, WICB chief Ernest Hilaire had sent a notice to Sarwan after a series against Australia, commenting on Sarwan’s “attitude and approach to fitness and physical preparation.” Sarwan’s claim of “being denigrated” were accepted in court.
