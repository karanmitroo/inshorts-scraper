BCCI's Committee of Administrators has said the Board's treasurer had objected to the cash awards announced for the team after their win over Australia, saying such announcements could only be made at general body meetings. "India have won today. What is the point of announcing the award three weeks later. It will look strange if we did so," CoA said.
