Turkey's Asli Cakir Alptekin, winner of 2012 Olympics' 1500m race, has been banned for life over a third doping offence. In 2015, Alptekin was stripped of her Olympic and European 1500m titles after her second offence. The 2012 Olympics women's 1500m final is dubbed as the 'dirtiest race in history', as six of first nine finishers received drug bans.
