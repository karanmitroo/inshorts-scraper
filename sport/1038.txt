The French football league (LFP) has suspended its goal-line technology system after a series of errors, including two in League Cup recently. The league said in a statement that the company behind the goal-line technology had been warned last month after some errors in the earlier stage of the season. In one instance goal-line technology had to be discarded mid-match.
