Former England captain Nasser Hussain said that Indian captain Virat Kohli is the Cristiano Ronaldo of cricket, following Kohli’s 122 in India's 1st ODI win against England on Sunday. "[Kohli] prefers Ronaldo, who has made himself the footballer that he is and pushed himself on and off football pitch, that is what Kohli has done in cricketing terms,” added Hussain.
