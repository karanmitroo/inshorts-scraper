The Sports Ministry has ordered the National Anti Doping Agency to conduct dope tests on Indian cricketers during domestic and international games in India. This comes after a WADA report revealed one Indian cricketer tested positive for banned substances in 2016. "If the BCCI resists...NADA's functioning, we won't hesitate from taking further action," secretary of sports was quoted as saying.
