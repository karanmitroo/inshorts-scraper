Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on Saturday registered his 22nd five-wicket haul in Test cricket, after capturing five wickets for 67 runs in England's first innings. Ashwin took the wickets of Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. Only Kapil Dev (23), Harbhajan Singh (25) and Anil Kumble (35) have more five-wicket hauls than Ashwin among Indians.
