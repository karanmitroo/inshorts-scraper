Spain's Ana Carrasco became the first woman to win an individual World Championship motorbike race on Sunday. The 20-year-old achieved the feat after finishing 0.053 seconds ahead of second-placed Alfonso Coppola from Italy in the Supersport 300 World Championship's round 10 in Portugal. Notably, Carrasco, in 2013, had become the first woman to win a World Championship point since 2001.
