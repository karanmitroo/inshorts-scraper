Goldberg defeated Brock Lesnar in the former's WWE comeback match after 12 years at the Survivor Series on Sunday. Goldberg had announced last month that he would be returning to WWE, accepting Lesnar's challenge of a rematch of their 2004 WrestleMania XX encounter, which Goldberg had won. Goldberg finished the match in under two minutes with his trademark 'Jackhammer' move.
