Indian captain Virat Kohli has shared a picture of himself with teammates MS Dhoni, Ajinkya Rahane and Umesh Yadav, among others, at a restaurant. "One from last night, meal with the boys after a good day at work!" wrote Kohli. India had beaten New Zealand by 45 runs (D/L method) in a rain-curtailed warm-up match on Sunday.
