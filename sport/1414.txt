BJP spokesperson S Prakash condemned its MLA Panna Lal Shakya's recent remarks questioning cricketer Virat Kohli's patriotism for preferring Italy over India to get married. Adding that it's not Shakya's business to question Kohli's patriotism, Prakash said the former has "no right to tarnish" the party's image and he hopes the MLA mends his ways.
