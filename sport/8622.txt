India's recently-announced T20I squad for the England series includes Delhi's uncapped wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant, who scored a triple century in the Ranji Trophy this season. The 19-year-old recorded the fastest century by an Indian in first-class matches, hitting a 48-ball hundred in November. He also registered the fastest fifty in U-19 cricket, off 18 balls, during the 2016 World Cup.
