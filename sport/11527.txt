The World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed on Tuesday that a confidential WADA medical database had been hacked into by a Russian cyber espionage group called Fancy Bear. The group leaked personal files of several American athletes, including Serena and Venus Williams, gymnast Simone Biles, and claimed to soon publish “sensational proof” of famous athletes taking doping substances.
