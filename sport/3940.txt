KL Rahul and captain Virat Kohli were seen 'dabbing' after Ravichandran Ashwin picked up Upul Tharanga's wicket during the second day of the Colombo Test on Friday. After managing to hold on to the ball after it hit his belly, Rahul started running around the field doing the 'dab' and was joined by Kohli towards the end of the celebration.
