BCCI's Committee of Administrators has reportedly put on hold the contracts being offered to new head coach Ravi Shastri and the rest of the staff, and sought the drafts from BCCI's legal team. An internal meeting will reportedly be held which will decide the payment being offered to the new staff. Shastri is also scheduled to meet CoA on Monday.
