Former Manchester United player Wilfried Zaha, while playing for Ivory Coast, dribbled past four defenders and struck the top net from the near post against Russia on Friday. The striker, who used to play for England before switching allegiances in December 2016, received the ball 35 yards from the goal before skipping past four defenders and unleashing a near-post stunner.
