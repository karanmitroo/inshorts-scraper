Indian captain Virat Kohli has revealed that he was scared of facing Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga's yorkers during the 2011 World Cup final. "Mujhe darr lag raha tha Malinga yorker nahi daale, already I was nervous. But after 2-3 balls, I settled down," he added. Kohli scored 35 runs off 49 deliveries in the final, which India won.
