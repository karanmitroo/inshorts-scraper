Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath registered golden ducks after getting dismissed for zero on the very first deliveries in both his Test and ODI debuts, the latter of which happened on December 9, 1993. McGrath, who picked 381 ODI and 563 Test scalps, got dismissed for duck 35 times in his Test career, the third most in Test cricket.
