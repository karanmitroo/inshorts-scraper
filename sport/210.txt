Pakistan Super League showed Barbados-born pacer Jofra Archer as a Pakistani cricketer in the Quetta Gladiators' line-up ahead of their match against Karachi Kings on Friday. The line-up showed the country flag beside the names of the overseas players except Archer's. The 22-year-old is eligible to play for Windies but has chosen to represent England as his father is British.
