Football-governing associations in England, including the Premier League, have announced they will be stricter while awarding red and yellow cards to players to enforce discipline. This season onwards, red cards will be given to players abusing or gesturing at the referee, while yellow cards will be awarded to any player who runs to confront an official about a decision.
