Former England captain Kevin Pietersen has spoken against tennis player Maria Sharapova's comeback after serving a doping ban. Pietersen tweeted that he "wasn't having the return at all" and those indulging in doping and match fixing should not be allowed to return to the sport. Sharapova got a wildcard at the Stuttgart Open after she completed her 15-month ban.
