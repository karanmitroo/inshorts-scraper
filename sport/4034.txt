England's Ben Stokes hit three consecutive sixes in the first innings of the ongoing Test against South Africa, becoming the second England cricketer to achieve the feat. Stokes joined Wally Hammond, who had achieved it against New Zealand 84 years ago. First of Stokes' consecutive sixes came after Du Plessis touched the rope after catching the ball near long-on boundary.
