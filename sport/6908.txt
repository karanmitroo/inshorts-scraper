Real Madrid's former Brazilian player Ricardo Kaka has said that Barcelona's Brazilian forward Neymar Jr must change his name to 'Reymar' in order to become the best player in the world. "I think if he changed his name to 'Reymar', he'd have an even better chance. All the successful Brazilians begin with the letter 'R'," Kaka added.
