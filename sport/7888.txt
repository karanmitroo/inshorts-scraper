Former Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor Chappell to bowl an underarm delivery as New Zealand needed seven runs off the final delivery in Melbourne on February 1, 1981. The Kiwi batsman threw away his bat in frustration after defending the delivery. The laws of the game were later changed to make underarm bowling illegal in cricket.
