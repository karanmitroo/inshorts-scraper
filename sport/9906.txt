Dharam Pal Singh, an Indian cow herder who claims to be 119 years old, is set to compete at the World Masters Athletics Championships in Perth, Australia. If Singh's claims are true then he could be the oldest man alive. Singh has won more than 20 medals at several national and international meets in his age category.
