The International Olympic Committee has prohibited media agencies and news organisations covering the Rio Olympics from making GIFs and Vines at the event. Live broadcast from the venue is also not allowed, with everything pre-recorded and broadcast later. However, the general public attending the Games are not restricted from making GIFs, Vines and other short video formats.
