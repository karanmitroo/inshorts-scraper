Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has suggested that every Ranji Trophy match should be played on two different pitches to prepare a better Test team for overseas tours. Sachin also suggested that bilateral Test series could be made more engaging by having back-to-back home-and-away rubbers so that the varying conditions could pose as "a bigger challenge".
