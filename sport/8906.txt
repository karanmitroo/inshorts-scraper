Abhay Singh Chautala, former president of the Indian Olympic Association, who was recently appointed a life president of IOA, has said Sports Minister Vijay Goel is "not interested in sports". "Goel should work for improving sports infrastructure in the country rather than levelling baseless allegations," said Chautala. Goel had expressed shock at the appointment of corruption-accused Chautala.
