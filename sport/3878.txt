The International Cricket Council introduced a system of 'Demerit Points' in September 2016 to punish players for misconduct on the field. As per the level of offence, a player is awarded demerit points, which remain valid for 24 months from the date of imposition. Accumulation of points will lead to suspensions from matches, depending upon the number of points accumulated.
