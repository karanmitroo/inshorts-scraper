Cricket Australia has banned the black bat used by West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell in the Big Bash League, stating the bat left black marks on the white ball. The Australian board allows players to use a coloured bat if it is either black or the same colour as the team uniform, but has withdrawn the approval in this case.
