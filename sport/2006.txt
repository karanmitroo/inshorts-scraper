Australia's Indian-origin 18-year-old Jason Sangha became the second-youngest player behind Sachin Tendulkar to score a first-class ton against England. The right-hander, who scored the ton at the age of 18 years and 71 days, is also the ninth youngest Australian to make a first-class hundred and the youngest since Ricky Ponting.
