Australian cricketer Cameron Bancroft suffered a wardrobe fail while fielding during a tour match in South Africa on Friday. Bancroft ran down to the boundary to bring the ball back and started running in an awkward manner as his jockstrap snapped. "It caused a little bit of awkwardness in my running gait and the boys...they don't miss anything," said Bancroft.
