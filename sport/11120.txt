Baseball player Yasiel Puig, who plays for Major League Baseball team Los Angeles Dodgers, made a young fan do push-ups before giving him his bat. The fan was holding a placard saying 'Will do Push-ups 4 a bat!!'. A video shows the fan doing at least 21 push-ups with Puig by his side, with the player later offering him water.
