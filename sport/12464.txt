A complaint has been filed by a Delhi resident against boxer Vijender Singh, for allegedly disrespecting the national flag. According to the complaint, Vijender wore the tricolour on his shorts during Sunday's WBO Asia-Pacific title bout in Delhi, which is “a clear violation of flag code of India”. Vijender defeated Australia's​ Kerry Hope to win his first professional title.
