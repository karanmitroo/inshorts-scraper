Switzerland's Roger Federer said that at heart he will always be a ball-boy as he recalled receiving a medal from the then world number two Michael Stich while serving as a ball-boy in Basel in 1993. The 36-year-old said that the medals he received while he was a ball-boy in his youth are still with him.
