United World Wrestling, the world governing body for wrestling, has given a clean chit to Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav. Earlier on Monday, the National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) had cleared Yadav of doping charges, giving him a go-ahead for the Rio Olympics. However, Yadav is still awaiting clearance from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which will be reviewing NADA's decision.
