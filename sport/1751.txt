Former world champion Garry Kasparov trolled an Indian fan by asking him to "stay off Twitter" after the latter asked him for a strategy to win a chess tournament. A day later, Kasparov asked him how he fared in the tournament to which the fan replied, "I lost the match in quarter-finals...I can't believe i m talking to u..the master."
