South African batsman AB de Villiers has said Spain's top-ranked tennis player Rafael Nadal inspires him. "I've found inspiration through a lot of athletes like Nadal. The way he's come back has inspired me a lot...I'm still motivated to play and as long as that motivation is there mentally, nothing is going to stop me," added de Villiers.
