American gymnast Simone Biles, who won four golds in Rio, told Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar that the Federation Internationale de Gymnastique should consider re-naming the Produnova vault to the ‘Karmakar Vault’. Speaking about the incident, Dipa said, "I think she must have been joking when she said ‘Karmakar vault,’ either way it gave me a massive confidence boost."
