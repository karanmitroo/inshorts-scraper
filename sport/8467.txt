Brisbane Heat's Brendon McCullum and Joe Burns ran into each other while going for a catch near the boundary in their BBL match against Perth Scorchers on Wednesday. Burns got to the ball first but collided with McCullum and got pushed beyond the boundary. As the catch was completed past the boundary line, Perth Scorchers were awarded six runs.
