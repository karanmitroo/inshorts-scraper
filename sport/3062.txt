An Argentinian top-flight match between San Lorenzo and Arsenal Sarandi was brought to a temporary halt after a dog invaded the pitch. The dog stole the ball from a player and started playing with it during the second half, evading capture from three players. It was then taken off the pitch after officials distracted him with another ball.
