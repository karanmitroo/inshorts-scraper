Following his match-winning hat-trick against South Africa, England all-rounder Moeen Ali said that it was a "much better feeling" than the hat-tricks he had scored during the team's football warm-up games. Ali further said that he had never taken a hat-trick at any level in cricket before. Ali became the third bowler to finish a Test by taking a hat-trick.
