The pet dog of British footballer Asa Charlton ran onto the pitch during a Northern Premier League match between Halesowen Town and Skelmersdale United, causing a delay of over seven minutes. The dog, Dusty, was cheered on by the audience while commentators gave a play-by-play of its antics. Meanwhile, Dusty will now be sent to a training school for dogs.
