Former basketball player Michael Jordan has won a trademark case against Chinese sportswear manufacturer Qiaodan Sports Co., which had been using the sportsman's name without permission. Jordan is called Qiaodan in China, with the company using his name beside a logo with a silhouette of a basketball player, resembling the logo used by his own Air Jordan brand.
