The family of martyred BSF Head Constable Prem Sagar have asked PM Narendra Modi and the BCCI to stop India from playing Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Sunday. The late jawan's son said the government must "understand the pain of the aggrieved family of the martyr". Sagar was killed and his body was mutilated by Pakistani soldiers last month.
