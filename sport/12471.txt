Shooter Abhinav Bindra is using an 'Electromagnetic System’ to improve the functioning of his nervous system, as a part of his Rio Olympics’ training. Bindra’s father Apjit Bindra said the system induced “positive shocks”, which relax the heartbeat. Abhinav, who is currently training in Munich, climbed a 40-feet pole before the 2008 Games to overcome his fear of heights.
