Tibet's women's football team has been denied a US visa after being told by the embassy that they have "no good reason to travel". The team, comprising girls from Tibetan Children's Village schools, had sought a 10-day tourist visa to play a friendly tournament. They were invited by former English football player Gordon Harold Jago for the Dallas Cup.
