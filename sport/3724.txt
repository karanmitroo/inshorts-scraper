Sri Lanka's cricket board has approved a tour to Pakistan, eight years after the Sri Lankan team's bus was attacked by gunmen in Lahore which left eight people dead. The board's chairman Thilanga Sumathipala has stated that Sri Lanka will play at least one T20I in Lahore in September "if all logistical and operational plans fall in place".
