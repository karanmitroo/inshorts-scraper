Baba Ramdev and Harbhajan Singh engaged in an arm-wrestling contest at the inauguration of the Chhattisgarh Cricket League on Wednesday. A video of the contest has emerged, which shows the two arm-wrestling before the contest ends in a deadlock and with Ramdev lifting Harbhajan. The cricketer later tweeted about the meeting, posting, "Had a good time chatting with yogguru @yogrishiramdev."
