Former pacer Zaheer Khan was recently rejected for the role of India's bowling coach over financial differences and his inability to take up the role on a full-time basis. Zaheer reportedly demanded â‚¹4 crore for a 100-day stint, which BCCI thought was a "very expensive deal". As per reports, Indian head coach Anil Kumble had approved Zaheer for the post.
