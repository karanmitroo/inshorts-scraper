New Zealand selected its first transgender athlete for the Commonwealth Games after naming weightlifter Laurel Hubbard in the squad for the 2018 Games in Australia. The 39-year-old, who has previously competed as a male, will represent the country in the women's over-90kg category. Earlier in 2017, Hubbard became New Zealand's first transgender athlete to win an international weightlifting title.
