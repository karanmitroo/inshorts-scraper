Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif has reportedly been approached by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) for the post of the team's head coach. This comes a month after ACB decided not to renew the contract of current coach Lalchand Rajput. Kaif, who last played an international game in 2006, was appointed the captain-cum-mentor of the Chhattisgarh team last year.
