Dipa Karmakar, India’s first Olympic-bound female gymnast, used springs and shock absorbers from discarded scooters for her initial practice apparatus. Post her Rio qualification in April, Sports Authority of India imported apparatus worth $120,000 (₹80 lakhs) for her training. Karmakar is among the only five women in the world to complete the Produnova vault, which she will attempt in Rio.
