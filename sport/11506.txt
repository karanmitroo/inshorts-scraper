A Formula E race car was driven by ex-F1 racer Lucas di Grassi across the Arcticâ€™s polar ice cap to raise awareness about global warming and promote the idea of electric cars as they produce zero emissions. The Brazilian racer was runner-up at the 2015-16 Formula E season, the world's first fully-electric racing series that came into existence in 2014.
