Lionel Messi's brother Matias is facing an eight-year jail sentence if the charges of illegal possession of firearms are proved. A gun was found inside a blood-stained boat after Matias had crashed it in the Parana River. Currently, the 35-year-old is recovering from a fractured jaw and other injuries at a hospital in Argentina's Santa Fe province.
