A 90-year-old woman from Germany, Johanna Quaas, is the oldest gymnast in the world, according to the Guinness World Records. She was recognised for the same in April 2012 when she was 86 years old. Quaas, who likes using parallel bars, says that a "very well-roundedâ€‹, healthy diet" is the secret to her fitness.
