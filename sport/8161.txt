Yuvraj Singh's father, Yograj Singh, who had blamed former skipper MS Dhoni for his son's ouster from Team India, has said he has forgiven Dhoni and wished for him to score a century in India's second ODI against England. "The way both of them (Yuvraj and MS Dhoni) batted and rescued India, this had made me forgive Dhoni", added Yograj.
