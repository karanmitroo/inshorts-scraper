Ex-Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist had put a squash ball inside his left glove when he slammed the highest individual score in a World Cup final in 2007 against Sri Lanka. Gilchrist, who hit 149(104), revealed that he had kept the squash ball to improve his grip. Sri Lanka had later claimed Gilchrist broke the "spirit and tradition of the game."
