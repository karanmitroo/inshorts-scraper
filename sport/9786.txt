England's 246-run loss to India in the Vizag Test on Monday is their largest-ever defeat in terms of runs in Asia. It went past their 187-run defeat to India at Kolkata in 1961, which was previously the largest by runs in the continent. England's worst-ever loss in Asia is by an innings and 215 runs, against Sri Lanka in 2003.
