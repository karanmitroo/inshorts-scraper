The US Open is the only Grand Slam to have been played on all the three surfaces, starting with grass from 1881-1974. From 1975-1977, the season's last Grand Slam was played on clay before being shifted to a hard-court surface in 1978. Notably, Jimmy Connors is the only player to have won the US Open on all the three surfaces.
