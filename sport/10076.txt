BCCI is scheduled to conduct over 900 matches this season but reportedly its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) has just three dedicated officers. BCCI stated it is impossible for an ACSU officer to be there at every match. "Our main priority is to secure the players and match officials' area. Except that, ACSU can't do anything," said a BCCI official.
