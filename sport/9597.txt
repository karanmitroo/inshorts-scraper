Indian Test captain Virat Kohli rose to a career-best third spot in the ICC rankings for Test batsmen, after scoring a half-century in the recently-concluded Mohali Test against England. Last week, Kohli had broken into the top five for the first time, jumping nine places to the fourth spot. Cheteshwar Pujara is the other Indian in top 10, ranked eighth.
