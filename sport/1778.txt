Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has said that he should have retired after the death of his friend and teammate Phillip Hughes on November 27, 2014. "My career should have stopped then. It was too hard for me," he added. Clarke revealed that he cried himself to sleep every night during Australia's tour of Windies in 2015.
