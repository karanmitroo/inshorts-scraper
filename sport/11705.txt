ICC has allocated $135 million for next yearâ€™s Champions Trophy in England, which is triple the $45 million allotted to the World T20 held in India in March. BCCI has expressed its reservations about the allocation, saying it hosted 58 matches in the 27-day World T20 event at one-third cost, whereas England will host 15 matches in the Champions Trophy.
