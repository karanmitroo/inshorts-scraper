Parthiv Patel has replaced wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha in the Indian squad for the third Test against England, making his comeback in the Test team after eight years. Saha suffered a thigh strain during the Vizag Test and is being rested as a precaution. Patel's last Test came against Sri Lanka in 2008, while he played his last ODI in 2012.
