Pakistan chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq has criticised England pacer James Anderson for his comments about Virat Kohli's batting technique. Inzamam said he was surprised that the bowler questioned Kohli's technique after failing to take wickets in India. "Kohli is a quality player and when he is getting runs his team does well," added Inzamam praising the Indian captain.
