Mexican League side Cruz Azul's forward Angel Mena pulled off a Messi-like solo goal, going past six players in just six seconds before successfully applying the finish. Mena started his run from the right side, nutmegging a defender before dribbling past another two. The goalkeeper's dive went in vain as Mena's shot found the bottom corner of the near post.
