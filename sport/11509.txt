Cristiano Ronaldo scored with a free kick against Sporting Lisbon in Real Madrid's UEFA Champions league opener on Wednesday, to break the all-time free-kick goalscoring record of the tournament. Ronaldo's 12th goal from a free-kick broke the previous record of 11 goals held by former Juventus player Alessandro del Piero in the European competition.
