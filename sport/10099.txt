Padma Shri awardee boxer Dingko Singh was denied entry at the AIIMS hospital in Delhi due to insufficient money. The Asiad gold medallist, suffering from hepatitis, had â‚¹50,000 with him but the authorities did not let him in. The 37-year-old was later helped by a doctor from Manipur but Dingko is still unsure if his treatment will continue or not.
