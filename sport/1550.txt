Fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee has revealed that it took 67 karigars (artisans) and 32 days to complete Anushka Sharma's wedding lehenga. "We chose a colour that would blend in with the whimsical Tuscan surrounding rather than stand out," said Sabyasachi. He added, "Exotic birds and butterflies were rendered (on the lehenga) with the finest quality needlecraft."
