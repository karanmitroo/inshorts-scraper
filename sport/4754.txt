Pakistani pacer Mohammad Amir has revealed that ex-England captain Alastair Cook has asked him to teach him Urdu. Amir, who has returned to international cricket after serving a five-year ban, will be playing for English county side Essex, which Cook also represents. Amir said there was no problem with Cook, who had earlier said match-fixers should be banned for life.
