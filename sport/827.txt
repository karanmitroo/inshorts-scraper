Team India has played four Test matches at The Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, winning one and drawing the other three. India's Test win at the stadium came in 2006 when Sreesanth's five-wicket haul helped India dismiss South Africa for 84 runs in first innings. In India's previous Test in Johannesburg, Virat Kohli slammed 119 and 96 to help India draw.
