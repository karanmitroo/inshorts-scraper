Virat Kohli is followed by over 1.39 crore users on Twitter, but the cricketer himself follows only 44 persons. Kohli follows Punjabi singer Gurdas Maan, musician AR Rehman, former batsman Sachin Tendulkar, and some of his teammates among others. "I don't have too many people in my life that I am close to. I think that helps," Kohli recently said.
