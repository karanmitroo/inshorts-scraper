India coach Ravi Shastri has defended the team management's decision to keep Ajinkya Rahane out from the first two Tests against South Africa, saying Rohit Sharma was the best option going by current form. "If Ajinkya had played the first Test and not done well, you would have asked me the same question about why Rohit hasn't played," said Shastri.
