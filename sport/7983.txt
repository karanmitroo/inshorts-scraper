Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt returned his 4x100m 2008 Olympic gold on Friday, after the International Olympic Committee disqualified the team following Nesta Carter's positive dope test. Bolt said he still has "accomplished a lot" and it "does not change what he has done" throughout his career. Bolt added he might financially assist Carter's appeal against the verdict if need be.
