Former England captain Nasser Hussain has said he finds India's Test skipper Virat Kohli to be 'tactically naive'. "I'm surprised by how defensive he's been in the field so far in this series. Some of his decisions on the fourth afternoon (during the Vizag Test) were strange...Kohli is still young in captaincy terms and will get better," said Hussain.
