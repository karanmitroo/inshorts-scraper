Pakistani pacer Wahab Riaz finished the third ODI against England at Nottingham on Tuesday with the bowling figures 0/110 in 10 overs, the second-worst in ODI history. Australia's Mick Lewis holds the record for most ODI runs conceded, with figures of 0/113 against South Africa in 2006. Riaz is the first Pakistani bowler to give away 100-plus runs in ODIs.
