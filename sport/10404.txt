Mesut Özil's solo goal in the 87th minute of Arsenal's Champions League group match against Ludogorets Razgrad helped the team stage a three-goal fightback. Özil received the pass from Mohamed Elneny and then chipped the ball over the goalkeeper who had advanced from his penalty area, before dribbling past two defenders and finishing the open goal.
