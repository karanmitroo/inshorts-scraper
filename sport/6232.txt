All India Tennis Association Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee has said he expected senior players Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi to behave more maturely, following the spat between the two over Leander's exclusion from Davis Cup. "Both of them are over 40 years...the reactions they have given could have been much better...We have to talk to them," said Chatterjee.
