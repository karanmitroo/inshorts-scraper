The Delhi & District Cricket Association named one of Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium's playing ends after veteran pacer Ashish Nehra to mark his farewell match against New Zealand on Wednesday. With this, Nehra became only the second bowler after England's James Anderson to bowl from his own end. Nehra ended his career by beating the batsman for a dot ball.
