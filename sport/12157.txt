Actor Salman Khan, who is the Indian Olympic Association's (IOA) Goodwill Ambassador, on Sunday referred to India's gymnast Dipa Karmakar as 'Deepika' as he forgot her name. When a journalist corrected Salman, he said, "Yes, Dipti", getting her name wrong for the second time. Notably, Dipa has become the first Indian to qualify for the individual vault finals.
