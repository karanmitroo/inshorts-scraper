Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga has alleged that the 2011 India-Sri Lanka World Cup final, which India won, was fixed and has demanded a probe. Ranatunga said he was "shocked" by Sri Lanka's defeat and he would reveal the truth one day. His comments came after Kumar Sangakkara demanded an inquiry into the team's 2009 tour of Pakistan.
