The International Boxing Association (AIBA) on Tuesday unanimously voted to induct the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) as one of its permanent members. India was provisionally suspended in December 2012 for “possible manipulation” in the erstwhile Indian Amateur Boxing Federation’s elections. AIBA's chief also congratulated the BFI for organising and conducting the Nationals.
