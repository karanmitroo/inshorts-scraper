Tennis player Serena Williams, who recently posted a picture of her baby bump on Snapchat, says she accidentally revealed the news of her pregnancy. "I've been checking my status and taking pictures every week to see how far along I'm getting...I was just saving them...I've been so good about it, but this was the one time it slipped," said Serena.
