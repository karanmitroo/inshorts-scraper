Responding to UFC President's offer of $25 million to fight Conor McGregor, former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather tweeted, "Before you ask for $25M, be worth more than $25M.You have the "2" and the "5" right but you meant to say $2.5M not $25M." Earlier, Mayweather had demanded $100 million and offered McGregor $15 million and pay-per-view share for the fight.
