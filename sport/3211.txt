The Bangladesh Cricket Board has granted all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan a break from Tests, but not for six months as he had requested. It has allowed Shakib a break from tour of South Africa and said he can play the second Test "if he wants". Shakib has played 51 Tests and missed just 7 since his debut in 2007.
