Manchester United's new number 7 Alexis Sanchez used to wash cars and do somersaults on the streets when he was six years old to support his family in Chile. Sanchez's father abandoned the family when he was a toddler, while his mother was a cleaner and would also sell fish. Sanchez joined Manchester United from Arsenal on Monday.
