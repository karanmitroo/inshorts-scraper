Former cricketer Virender Sehwag has apologised for his tweet on the tribal man killing in Kerala wherein he mentioned three Muslims accused in the case. Twitter users slammed him over the tweet, pointing out that the 16 people arrested in the case belonged to different faiths. Sehwag later deleted both the original tweet and the apology.
