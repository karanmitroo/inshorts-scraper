The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has turned down an invitation from its Pakistan counterpart for a tour before July this year. "We had a BCB security team visit Pakistan during the final of the PSL T20 last month. The reports were not satisfactory enough due to which we had to pull back," the Bangladesh board said.
