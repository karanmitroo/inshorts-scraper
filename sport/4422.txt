Batsman Rohit Sharma has been named in the 16-member Indian squad for the three-Test series against Sri Lanka starting July 26, while uncapped Hardik Pandya has also been included. Rohit, who replaces Karun Nair, last played a Test for India against New Zealand in October 2016. The SL series will be the first for India under a new coach.
