England middle-order batsman Dawid Malan has revealed that he almost started crying after slamming his maiden Test ton against Australia in the third Ashes Test on Thursday. "The amount of sacrifices my old man and mother have made...it's nice to repay them," he added. Malan was one of the 'no-name' players mocked when England first landed in Australia in October.
