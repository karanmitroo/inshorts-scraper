England wicketkeeper-batsman Jonny Bairstow was given out LBW on 89(177) by the on-field umpire against India after he was struck on the pads by a Jayant Yadav delivery. On reviewing, the ball was seen hitting the leg-stump, which was enough to stick with the original decision. Yadav's first Test wicket came after a successful DRS review in the second Test.
