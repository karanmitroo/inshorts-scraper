Pakistan Cricket Board chief Najam Sethi has said India should play Pakistan in their scheduled Champions Trophy encounter on June 4, 2017, in England, or forfeit the match. BCCI President Anurag Thakur had earlier requested the ICC to not group India and Pakistan together in the tournament. "Pakistan-India game is the most lucrative match," the PCB added.
