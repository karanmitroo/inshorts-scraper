Pacer S Sreesanth on Sunday received a letter from the BCCI, which stated that the board is very particular in ensuring that discipline is maintained and reiterated that the life ban imposed on him will stay. This comes after Sreesanth filed a review petition seeking the lifting of the ban in view of him being exonerated by a Delhi court.
