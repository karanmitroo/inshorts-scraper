Australian captain Steve Smith has admitted he refrained from walking off the field despite edging a delivery which was caught by Pakistan keeper Sarfraz Ahmed, during the ongoing Brisbane Test on Thursday. "I was very surprised, it was pretty loud...I was on 9...Yeah, I did nick it, and no one went up so I wasn't going to walk," said Smith.
