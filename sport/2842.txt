Sri Lanka Cricket has permitted batsman Chamara Silva to participate in domestic matches, after he appealed his two-year ban. Silva, who will be allowed to play pending the outcome of appeal, was banned last month for breaching spirit of the game during a first-class match. This comes after ICC said it was conducting an anti-corruption probe in Sri Lanka.
