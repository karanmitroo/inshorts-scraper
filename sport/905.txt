Former Australian captain Ian Chappell said Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya's run-out during the second Test against South Africa was a result of his "laziness, sloppiness, arrogance". Chappell emphasised the need to adhere to basic principles of the sport, like grounding the bat. "These principles apply in any form of the game and ignored, they can lose games," Chappell said.
