ICC President Shashank Manohar has reportedly offered BCCI an additional $100 million (₹642 crore) to make them accept their new financial model, which the Board had rejected earlier. BCCI is opposing ICC's suggested move of scrapping the Big Three revenue model, which reduces India's share by almost ₹1,000 crore in the 2015-2023 cycle, thereby increasing the share of other Boards.
