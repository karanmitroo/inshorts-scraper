BCCI has initiated a tender process for the IPL's global broadcast rights, a move in conformity with the Lodha Panel recommendations. Currently, the IPLâ€™s media rights are held by Sony, a deal that comes to an end in 2017. The rights were granted in 2008 for a 10-year period for $918 million, later reworked to $1.63 billion in 2009.
