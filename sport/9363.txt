Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Matthew Wade survived getting bowled out after a Trent Boult delivery went onto hit the stumps but could not dislodge the bails. Wade was trying to divert the ball onto the leg side when he got an inside edge and the ball rolled back onto the stumps with Wade trying unsuccessfully to stop the ball hitting the wickets.
