Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar became the first-ever batsman to reach 10,000 runs in Test cricket on March 7, 1987, almost 110 years after the first-ever Test. Gavaskar achieved the feat during his 63-run knock in the first innings against Pakistan in Ahmedabad. As many as 13 batsmen have scored over 10,000 runs in Test cricket till now.
