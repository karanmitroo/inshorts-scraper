Wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel attempted a no-look run out similar to MS Dhoni, during the Mumbai Test against England on Friday. England's Jake Ball played a shot towards deep cover and ran for a two, while the fielder returned the throw to Patel who attempted to run Ball out. Patel got the bails but Ball had made it to the crease.
