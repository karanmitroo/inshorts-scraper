The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has claimed its database is safe despite being targeted by Russian hackers 'Fancy Bears' this month. WADA said it believes the attack was made possible by email phishing and added that it is working towards preventing any further intrusions. Earlier this month, confidential medical data about athletes, including Serena Williams and Simone Biles, was leaked.
