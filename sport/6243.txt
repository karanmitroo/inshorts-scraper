Delhi Daredevils' batsman Rishabh Pant scored a half-century against Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL on Saturday, two days after his father's death. Rishabh's father passed away in his sleep on Wednesday, following which the cricketer left the team's camp to perform the last rites. He returned for Delhi's opening match, in which he was the highest scorer for the team.
