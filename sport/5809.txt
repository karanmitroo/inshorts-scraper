Indian cueist Pankaj Advani won silver at the Asian Snooker Championship, losing the final to China's Lv Haotian in Doha on Friday. A win would have made Pankaj the only player in history to win all Majors in two sports at all levels across all formats. With the loss, Pankaj missed out on a career Grand Slam in cue sport.
