Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma has said that he might open the innings at some stage in the IPL but that will totally depend on the team requirement. Sharma, who consistently opened for MI in the last edition of IPL, has batted at either number three or number four in the 5 matches this season, scoring just 49 runs.
