Cricket South Africa has handed an eight-year ban to pacer Lonwabo Tsotsobe for his part in a 2015 match-fixing scandal. Six other South African players had been banned earlier for two to 20 years for being a part of the scandal. "I was, at the time, in a very vulnerable financial state," Tsotsobe revealed in a statement.
