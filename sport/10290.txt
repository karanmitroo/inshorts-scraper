South Africa's Temba Bavuma reacted in just 0.264 seconds to run David Warner out in Australia's second innings during the first Test at Perth on Sunday. Warner nudged the ball towards point where Bavuma was fielding, who ran ahead, collected the ball while still in motion and attempted a near-perfect aerial throw which hit the base of the middle stump.
