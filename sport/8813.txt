Former West Indies pacer Sylvester Clarke picked up a brick used to mark the boundary in the Multan Test on December 31, 1981, and hurled it at the spectators. The incident was triggered by an orange thrown by the spectators hitting the Caribbean fast bowler. The brick hit a local student leader, following which play was temporarily suspended.
