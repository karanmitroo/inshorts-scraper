Delta Air Lines staff has accused National Hockey League player Jiří Hudler of doing cocaine in a flight bathroom and attempting to pee on the food cart. Hudler allegedly asked a crew member to bring him coke, and clarified that he meant cocaine when she brought him coca-cola. Hudler later denied the allegations and called it "a small incident."
