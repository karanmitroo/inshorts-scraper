An American MMA fighter has said that he temporarily "died" in the arena after his heart stopped and he suffered kidney failure during a fight last week. The paramedics restarted Clovis Hancock's heart twice after he fell during his fight, for which he had undergone a hard weight cut. "Doc says I shouldn't fight again. I'm broken," Hancock added.
