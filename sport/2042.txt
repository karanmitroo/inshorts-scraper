Indian-origin county cricketer Shiv Thakor was found guilty of exposing himself to two women by a Derby court on Wednesday. Thakor had claimed that he could not have done it as he had already been "sexually satisfied" by his 16-year-old girlfriend. Thakor has been suspended by his county team, Derbyshire, on full pay since his offence in June.
