New Zealand wicketkeeper Tom Blundell, who scored a Test century on debut, walked home in his match uniform clutching a stump rather than taking the official transport to the team hotel. Blundell scored an unbeaten 107 in his maiden Test innings to set New Zealand up for an-innings-and-67-run victory in the first Test against Windies.
