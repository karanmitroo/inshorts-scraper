The soldiers fighting the World War I ceased hostilities and played football with the enemy troops on the Christmas Day in 1914. Starting on Christmas Eve, many German and British troops sang Christmas carols to each other and exchanged wishes. The Christmas Truce of 1914 came only five months after the outbreak of the first world war in Europe.
