Gymnast Dipa Karmakar's physio has been flown to Rio, ahead of the Olympic gymnastics' vault final on Sunday. Reportedly, the physio was earlier disallowed from travelling to Rio, with the Sports Authority of India terming Dipa's request to take him along "wasteful". Dipa is India's first gymnast to reach an Olympics final, after she ranked eighth in qualification on Sunday.
