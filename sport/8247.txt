Former Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf has rated Sachin Tendulkar as a better performer than current Indian captain Virat Kohli. Yousuf said that Tendulkar was a masterclass and he produced match-winning knocks against strong opposition in all conditions and in all formats. "I don't think Kohli is facing the same quality bowlers or opposition," he added.
