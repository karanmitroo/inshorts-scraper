The Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA) has issued a report which advises foreign cricket players against participating in March's Pakistan Super League Final due to concerns over player safety. PCB has planned to organise the tournament's final on March 7, in which participation of overseas players has been kept optional. Notably, all earlier games will be played in UAE.
