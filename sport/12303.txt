A chapter, dedicated to Maria Sharapova in Goa's school textbooks, will be removed from the next academic session due to her doping scandal. Titled 'Reach for the Top', the chapter was removed after parents and educationists demanded its removal. Sharapova has been banned for two years after testing positive for a banned substance, in tests conducted during the Australian Open.
