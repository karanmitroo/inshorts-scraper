England's Ben Stokes produced a 'flying' catch to dismiss Virat Kohli off Adil Rashid's bowling in India's second innings during the Vizag Test on Sunday. Kohli attempted a full-blown drive, but the ball hit the edge of the bat towards Stokes at first slip, who leapt to his right and took a single-handed catch. Kohli was dismissed for 81(109).
