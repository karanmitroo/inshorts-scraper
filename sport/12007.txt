Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal has been admitted to a hospital in Hyderabad to undergo a treatment for her knee injury, her father Harvir Singh confirmed. The 26-year-old, who recently crashed out of the Rio Olympics, had cited an inflammation in her right knee which hampered her on-court movement during her loss in a group match against Ukraine's Maria Ulitina.
