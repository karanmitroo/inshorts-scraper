Indian Test captain Virat Kohli has said he doesn't believe in the concept of 'form'. "Cricket is a game where you can only prepare well. Results cannot be in your hand all the time. You get caught to a no-ball and different things happen which are out of control," said Kohli, who has averaged 26 in his last three innings.
