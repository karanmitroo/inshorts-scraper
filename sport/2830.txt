Pictures have emerged of England cricketers, including Jos Buttler and captain Eoin Morgan, 'bowling' with a sex toy in Amsterdam's red light district during Buttler's bachelor party. The wicketkeeper, along with a group of 20 friends, was also spotted talking to a prostitute. The cricketers were earlier asked to cancel the party after Ben Stokes' recent nightclub brawl.
