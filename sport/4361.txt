Newly appointed India coach Ravi Shastri has said both he and Sourav Ganguly have moved on from their alleged spat last year, after Shastri was rejected for the coaching role. Speaking on his interview this year, Shastri said, "There were good questions asked...We are two former captains...Everyone is not on the same page all the time. But there's mutual respect."
