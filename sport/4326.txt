India's newly appointed overseas batting consultant Rahul Dravid will not be travelling to Sri Lanka for the team's upcoming tour, which starts July 26. Rahul, instead, would go to South Africa with the India 'A' team, of which he is also the coach. BCCI clarified that Dravid's services will be sought on a "tour-to-tour" basis.
