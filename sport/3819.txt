The BCCI will reportedly appeal against the Kerala High Court order that lifted fast bowler Sreesanth's life ban for spot-fixing. BCCI had imposed a life ban on Sreesanth after the cricketer's involvement in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing case. After the court ruling on Monday, Sreesanth had said he was hoping to represent India at 2019 Cricket World Cup.
