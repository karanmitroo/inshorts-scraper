Security was increased at former captain MS Dhoni's house in Ranchi following India's loss against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Sunday. Fans indulged in sloganeering, burning effigies and smashing TV sets after India's loss, following which the measure was taken. Dhoni earlier had 'Z' category security, which was downgraded to 'Y' by the Jharkhand government in 2014.
