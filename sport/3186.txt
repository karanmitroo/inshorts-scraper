An Australian journalist was trolled by Virat Kohli's fans on Twitter, after he tried trolling the Indian skipper. The scribe, who goes by the handle @DennisCricket_, posted a picture of Kohli sweeping a stadium's stands with a broom, and called the skipper a sweeper. Fans commented, "Doing practice before sweeping Aussies," and, "We Indians are expert in clean sweeps."
