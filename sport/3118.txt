Australian cricket team roped in local left-arm wrist spinner KK Jiyas for practice to prepare their batsmen for Indian Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav. Jiyas, an ex-Delhi Daredevils player, was called by Australia's batting consultant Sridharan Sriram. "It was a dream day for me. I bowled 12 overs and I tried all variations...and was able to beat their bats," said Jiyas.
