England pacer Stuart Broad picked up the wicket of batsman Lokesh Rahul by using the DRS to overturn the on-field decision. The Indian opener was originally given not out on a caught behind appeal by umpire Rod Tucker but the Ultra-edge technology showed the ball had taken the outside edge. Murali Vijay was dismissed using the Ultra-edge technology as well.
