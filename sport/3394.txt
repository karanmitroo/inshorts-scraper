All players of the Pakistan team were once awarded the 'Man of the Match' award, in an ODI against England on September 1, 1996. Adjudicator Tom Graveney apparently did not find "anyone suitable enough", as nine out of 11 men had contributed to Pakistan's victory. Among those awarded were three debutants, including a player who was out on a duck.
