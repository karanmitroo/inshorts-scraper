Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli was chosen as the international player of the year by England's Barmy Army, which is a semi-organised group of English cricket fans. "It feels nice to be recognised by fans of other countries...Especially from Barmy Army who made my life hell in England in 2014 when I had a tough time," said Kohli.
