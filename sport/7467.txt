Australian allrounder Glenn Maxwell has said he would not risk provoking Indian captain Virat Kohli in the upcoming four-Test series starting February 23. "I am probably not going to say anything to him, that is for sure," said Maxwell. Talking about Australia's strategy to counter Kohli, Maxwell added, "[H]opefully..we can create that doubt and get him wondering about his technique."
