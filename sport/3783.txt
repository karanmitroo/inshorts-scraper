Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag was slammed by several Twitter users over his tweets on deaths of children in a hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur. Many users commented that Sehwag did not have the courage to criticise the government for its failure and said he should have questioned its negligence. "You should have mentioned the reason too," a user tweeted.
