USA U-17 football team's forward Timothy Weah's father George Weah is running for the presidential post of African nation Liberia. George, a retired footballer himself, became the first African to win the Ballon d'Or in 1995 and represented Liberia in 60 matches. "It's really cool to have a dad like him," said Timothy, who is in India for U-17 WC.
