Following India's win over England in the Chennai Test on Tuesday, Virat Kohli equalled Sunil Gavaskar's record of longest unbeaten streak of 18 Tests by an Indian captain. India has won 14 Tests and drawn four in Kohli's unbeaten streak. India, led by Kohli, has been unbeaten since August 2015, which is also the longest Test streak for the team.
