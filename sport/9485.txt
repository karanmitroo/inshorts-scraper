Sachin Tendulkar has said he enjoyed watching teammate Virender Sehwag bat the most. "With Sehwag, I didn't know what was going to happen next. After playing with him for a while, I understood what he was thinking," said Tendulkar. He called ex-West Indies batsman Brian Lara a "special package" and tennis player Roger Federer his "favourite non-cricket hero".
