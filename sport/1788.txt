The BCCI has decided to retire Sachin Tendulkar's number 10 jersey from the Indian men's cricket team. "It unnecessarily creates controversy and players get criticised. So it's better to retire the number," a BCCI official said. It will be retired unofficially as there's no provision to retire jerseys under ICC guidelines, but players can wear it for India A matches.
