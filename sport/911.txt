The T20I tri-series between India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, scheduled in March, has been preponed. The series, which will be played in celebration of Sri Lanka's 70th year of independence, will now be held from March 6 to 18, instead of culminating with the final on March 20. The tri-series will feature all the three teams playing each other twice.
