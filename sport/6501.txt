UIDAI has blacklisted the e-governance centre that shared MS Dhoni's Aadhaar details, after the cricketer's wife Sakshi tweeted a complaint to IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. The Twitter handle of CSC e-Governance Services had shared a picture of Dhoni giving his biometrics, along with his Aadhaar receipt. Sakshi brought this to Prasad's notice, who promised action.
