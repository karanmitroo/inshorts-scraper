Windies' Gus Logie was adjudged Man of the Match despite him neither batting nor bowling in an ODI against Pakistan on November 28, 1986. Adjudicators awarded Logie for his three catches and two run-outs, which helped Windies dismiss Pakistan for 143. With this, he also became the first cricketer to win a Man of the Match award for fielding.
