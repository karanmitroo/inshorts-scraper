Amul has released a poster on the DRS controversy which involved Australian captain Steve Smith looking towards the Australian dressing room to consult a review. Amul captioned it, "Indecision Review System?" while adding, "Amul won't give you a brain fade." Smith had said he suffered "a bit of a brain fade" when he looked up to the dressing room.
