The Indian men's team posted a video wishing the women's side luck for their World Cup final against England on Sunday. The video shows the entire men's team, which is on tour in Sri Lanka, standing together while coach Ravi Shastri says, "Go for it ladies. Give it to the Poms." The team then says in unison, "All the best."
