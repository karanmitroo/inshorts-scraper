Kings XI Punjab opener Hashim Amla walked off the crease despite no appeal from Royal Challengers Bangalore players during their IPL match in Bengaluru on Friday. Amla slightly edged the ball, which was caught behind by keeper Kedar Jadhav, and immediately walked off despite no appeal. Seeing Amla walk away, bowler Aniket Choudhary appealed and the umpire signalled out.
