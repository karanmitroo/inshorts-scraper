Former India skipper Mohammad Azharuddin has criticised the Rising Pune Supergiants franchise for MS Dhoni's removal as captain of the team. "The decision and manner of execution was third-rate and disgraceful. Dhoni has been a jewel in Indian cricket," said Azharuddin. "Belittling Indian sporting legends like Dhoni through corporate board-rooms is stooping down to the lowest," Azhar added.
