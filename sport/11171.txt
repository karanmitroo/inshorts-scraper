Cricket Association of Bengal President Sourav Ganguly got stuck in an elevator at the Eden Gardens stadium on Thursday. A stool was lowered to help Ganguly climb out of the 1987-installed lift, with power switchover being cited as the reason for the malfunction. The stadium is set to host India's 250th home Test, which starts on Friday against New Zealand.
