After wishing former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee with a ‘Gunda’-inspired dialogue, Virender Sehwag wished ex-cricketer and current NIFT chairman Chetan Chauhan in ‘Agneepath’ style on his 69th birthday. “Naam - Chetan Pratap Singh Chauhan. Kaam - DDCA VP, NIFT chairman. Record-1st player 2,000 test runs w/o century. Umar - Aaj Poori 69,” wrote Sehwag.
