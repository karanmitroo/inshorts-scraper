Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath (38) became the oldest player to take a Test hat-trick, when he achieved the feat against Australia in Galle on Thursday. Herath is the second Sri Lankan to take a Test hat-trick, after Nuwan Zoysa in 1999. Englandâ€™s Johnny Briggs is the only other left-arm orthodox bowler to take a Test hat-trick, back in 1892.
