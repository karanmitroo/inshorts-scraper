Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, who earned over $100 million with his win against Conor McGregor, won a $100,500 (over â‚¹64 lakh) jackpot at a slot machine in a casino. The undefeated boxer posted a video of him winning at the slots, with a filter that featured Irish shamrocks, a reference to Ireland's McGregor whom he had defeated in ten rounds.
