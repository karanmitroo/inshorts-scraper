The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has said its laboratories will use a gene doping test "shortly" to catch cheats. WADA further said they had invested a lot of money in the test, developed in Australia, that detects if athletes are injecting synthetic genes to produce a hormone which boosts the body's ability to carry more oxygen in its blood.
