During their 5-0 ODI series win against Sri Lanka, the Pakistani bowling unit for the first time in their cricketing history managed to complete a five-match ODI series without conceding a single no-ball. The Pakistani bowling unit, which did not feature Mohammad Amir, was praised by both the captains, Sarfraz Ahmed and Upul Tharanga.
