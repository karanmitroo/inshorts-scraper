Former Indian cricketer Ravi Shastri was trolled on Twitter after he mistook England's Ben Stokes to be another player. During the presentation of the final India-England ODI on Sunday, Shastri asked Stokes how he was feeling when Kedhar Jadhav's catch was coming towards him in the final over. Stokes replied saying, "Ah, it wasn't me, it was actually Sam Billings."
