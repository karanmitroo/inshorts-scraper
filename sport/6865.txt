Members of the Australian cricket team interacted and played football with young girls from a Ranchi-based NGO ahead of the third Test starting Thursday. The event, organised in association with the Australian High Commission, saw 81 girls from an NGO called Yuwa sharing their experiences in sports with the cricketers and how it has benefited them.
