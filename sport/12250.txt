India shot putter Inderjeet Singhâ€™s B-sample has tested positive for banned substances, putting his Rio Olympic participation in doubt. Earlier, the athlete had asked for a second test after his first sample tested positive in an out-of-competition test on June 22 by the National Anti-Doping Agency. Notably, Singh was the first Indian athlete to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.
