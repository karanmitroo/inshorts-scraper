India opener Rohit Sharma has said he did not celebrate his century against South Africa in the fifth ODI on Tuesday as he was involved in the run-outs of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane earlier in the innings. "My hundred has gone now and the next game I play, the hundred I scored isn't going to matter much," he added.
