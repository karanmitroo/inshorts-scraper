An Australian trio has set the world record for the highest basketball shot ever, shooting from a height of 180.968 metres at the Mauvoisin Dam in Switzerland. The trio, who call themselves 'How Ridiculous', had previously set the same record twice, before it was broken earlier this year by an American group named 'Dude Perfect' who shot from 162.458 metres.
