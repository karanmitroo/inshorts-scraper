England captain Joe Root was forced to retire hurt twice after suffering from dehydration, diarrhoea, and vomiting at the SCG. Root, hospitalised after Sunday's record-breaking temperatures in Sydney, could not take the field after lunch on the final day of the Ashes 2017 on Monday. Vice-captain James Anderson came in to give the speech at the end of the match.
