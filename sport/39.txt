A report by a British parliamentary committee has revealed five-time Olympic winner cyclist Bradley Wiggins used performance-enhancing drugs under the guise of treating a medical problem during the Tour de France in 2012. The report also called for an investigation into the injection given by an England football team doctor to Olympic champion Mo Farah before the 2014 London Marathon.
