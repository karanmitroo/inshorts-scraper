French club PSG is being probed by UEFA, European football's governing body, to see if the club's transfer activity, including Neymar's world record â‚¬222 million transfer, has broken Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. FFP rules ban clubs from spending more than their generated revenue. The Qatari-owned club also signed Kylian Mbappe on loan from Monaco on the transfer deadline day.
