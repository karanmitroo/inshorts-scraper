After English batsman Jason Roy's 'obstructing the field' dismissal against South Africa, Ben Stokes tweeted, "Can't believe that @JasonRoy20 was given out in that manner today....embarrassment is the only word that can be associated with the decision". The right-hander became the first cricketer ever to have been given out in such a manner in T20Is and the eighth overall.
