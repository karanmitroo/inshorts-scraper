The Indian team has not lost an international series at home since losing an ODI series to South Africa 2-3 in October 2015. After defeating New Zealand 2-1 in the three-match ODI series, India registered a record seven straight bilateral ODI series wins. India are set to face New Zealand in the series-deciding third T20I in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday.
