Cricketer Harbhajan Singh has said Yuvraj Singh's comeback in the Indian team is "inspiring". "Yuvi is a fighter who never gives up easily...His comeback is inspiring for others too...I haven't given up and want to do well in whatever chances I get in the coming three-four months," said Harbhajan, who last played an ODI for India in October 2015.
