The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday officially awarded the 2024 Summer Olympic Games to Paris and the 2028 edition to Los Angeles following a vote in Peru's capital Lima. Paris will be hosting the quadrennial event 100 years after its last Games in 1924. This is the first time that the IOC granted two Summer Olympics at once.
