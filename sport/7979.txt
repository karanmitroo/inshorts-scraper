Indian team management has reportedly told the Nagpur stadium authorities to keep the boundary size to 75 yards, 10 yards more than normal Indian grounds. The decision is aimed at keeping the Indian spinners in the game as batsmen will have to hit longer to clear the fence, while there will be more chances to run doubles and triples.
