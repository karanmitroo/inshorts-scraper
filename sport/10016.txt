Australian cricketer Callum Ferguson's brother, who had flown from London to Hobart, Australia to watch his brother make his Test debut, walked out of the stands in disappointment after he got out. Playing his first innings for Australia, Ferguson was run out on 3 by a direct hit. Ferguson's father, however, stayed in the stadium after his dismissal.
