Chicago's first baby of 2017 has been named 'Wrigley Rose', after baseball team Chicago Cubs' home ground Wrigley Field. Chicago Cubs won the World Series Championship after 108 years in 2016, but the baby's parents say the title win did not inspire the name. "We'd like to let people know we chose the name before the Cubs won," they said.
