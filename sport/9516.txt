Barcelona and Real Madrid's rivalry started peaking during dictator General Franco's regime in the 1930s, with the dictator supporting Real and disregarding Barca. Franco's government disapproved of any kind of regional affinity, with Barca's Catalonians, who identified themselves separately, being disliked by the regime. In 1943, Barcelona was greeted with stones and coins on the pitch in Madrid.
