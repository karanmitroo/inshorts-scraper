England all-rounder Ben Stokes has been fined 15% of his match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the second Test at Dhaka. The incident happened when Bangladeshi batsman Sabbir Rahman took the attack to Stokes' bowling, and Stokes started verbally engaging with him. Stokes disregarded on-field umpires' continuous requests to stop which led to the punishment.
