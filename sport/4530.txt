The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to take its compensation claim case against the BCCI to the ICC's Disputes Resolution Committee. BCCI has maintained that the Indian team cannot play a bilateral series against Pakistan as the Indian government cannot give clearance for the same. PCB has claimed that BCCI's denial has resulted in financial losses for the board.
