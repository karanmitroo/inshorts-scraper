Umpires can now eject cricketers temporarily or permanently from a match for misbehaviour, under new laws approved by the Marylebone Cricket Club. Certain limitations on bat sizes were also announced, with the maximum dimensions being 108mm width, 67mm depth and 40mm edges. The new laws, which are first to be issued since 2000, will come into force starting October 1.
