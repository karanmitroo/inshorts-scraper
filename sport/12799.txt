Spain national football team coach Vicente del Bosque has announced that he will step down from his post after the team's pre-quarterfinal exit in the Euro 2016. The 65-year-old led Spain to its maiden World Cup title in 2010 and Euro title in 2012. Sevilla's Joaquin Caparrós and Granada's Paco Jémez have declared their intention to succeed Del Bosque.
