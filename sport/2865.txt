Reacting to Indian opener Rohit Sharma's run-out after another mix-up with Virat Kohli against Australia, a user tweeted, "Bowlers se darr nahi lagta sahab Kohli se lagta hai: Rohit Sharma." Another user wrote, "Isn't Kohli getting Rohit Sharma run out anti national?" In 2013, Kohli was run-out while batting with Rohit, who scored ODIs' highest individual score in the match.
