Chandigarh police have declared a cricket stadium a "temporary jail" on the day the CBI court will give a verdict on Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who has been accused of raping a woman follower. The stadium will be used to detain the huge number of protestors who, authorities expect, might turn violent if the judgement goes against Singh.
