Actress Anushka Sharma, who is accompanying husband Virat Kohli on the Indian team's tour to South Africa, was seen dancing alongside a random passer-by on a street of Cape Town. The impromptu dance comes days after Indian captain Virat Kohli and batsman Shikhar Dhawan were seen doing 'bhangra' on the streets of Cape Town, where the first Test is underway.
