Rising Pune Supergiant's captain Steve Smith has backed teammate MS Dhoni, saying that he is not bothered about his form in the IPL. "He is a class player, and we have just played three games, so he will be fine (with the bat) in the tournament," added Smith. Dhoni has managed to score 28 runs in the first three matches.
