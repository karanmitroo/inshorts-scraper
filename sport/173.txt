Former sprinter and eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt on Sunday took to Twitter to announce that he has signed for a football club. The 100-metre world record holder added that he will reveal the name of the team on Tuesday. Last year, Bolt, who is a lifelong Manchester United fan, said a "lot of clubs" had reached out to him.
