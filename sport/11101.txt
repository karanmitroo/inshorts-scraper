BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said India's participation in next year's Champions Trophy will be doubtful if the Lodha Panel recommendations are followed in totality. "As per Lodha recommendations, you have to give a 15-day window before and after IPLâ€¦ So BCCI members have to take a call whether they will play IPL or Champions Trophy," Thakur said.
