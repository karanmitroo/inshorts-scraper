South Africa's Jiveshan Pillay was dismissed obstructing the field after he returned a ball to Windies' wicketkeeper-captain Emmanuel Stewart during the teams' U-19 World Cup match on Wednesday. Pillay picked up the ball and gave it to Stewart after it stopped near the stumps following a mistimed shot. Stewart then appealed and Pillay was given out by the third umpire.
