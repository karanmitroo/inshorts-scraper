Ex-IPL chairman Lalit Modi slammed BCCI after it revoked Rajasthan Cricket Association's suspension on the condition that he stays away from its functioning. "[T]he #Crook's in @BCCI...afraid of my name. Clowns just living off what I created for India.Good luck to these jokers who never did a days work in their life except live off what others created," Modi tweeted.
