The BCCI released a video for pacer Ashish Nehra, in which Indian cricketers can be seen wishing him luck for the future. Dinesh Karthik recalled that Nehra was the first bowler who bowled when he kept wickets for India for the first time. Rohit Sharma termed Nehra's 6/23 World Cup spell as the fondest memory of Nehra for him.
