American tennis player Serena Williams was eight weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open in January this year. She defeated her sister Venus in the final, winning the tournament without dropping a single set. Her publicist confirmed the player's pregnancy on Wednesday, saying Serena will miss the rest of the 2017 season and will aim to return in 2018.
