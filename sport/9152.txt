The Indian cricket team competed only against England in their first 15 years of Test cricket, playing three Tests at home and seven away. India, who played their first ever Test at Lord's in June 1932, went winless in their first 20 years of international cricket. India's next opponent after England was Australia, touring the country in 1947.
