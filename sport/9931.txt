Sachin Tendulkar was given a champagne bottle when he got his first Man of the Match award in 1990 but was not allowed to drink because his age was less than 18 years. He later opened it at his daughter's first birthday party and keeps the emptied bottle as a memento. Tendulkar retired from international cricket on November 16, 2013.
