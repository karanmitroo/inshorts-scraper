Ukraine's 15-year-old player Marta Kostyuk has become the youngest to enter the third round of a Grand Slam since Croatia's Mirjana Lucic-Baroni in the 1997 US Open. Kostyuk achieved the feat by defeating Olivia Rogowska 6-3, 7-5 in Australian Open on Wednesday. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Ivo Karlovic became the oldest man to reach the Australian Open third round in 40 years.
