Reza Rezamand, a 31-year-old English bodybuilder, 'almost died' after being stung by a multi-coloured harlequin ladybird on his hand. Reza was hospitalised after his legs swelled to twice their size, with doctors diagnosing sepsis with a "30% chance of dying". "I can bench press 180 kg but I was almost killed by a titchy thing like a ladybird," he said.
