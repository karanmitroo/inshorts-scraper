Ex-Spanish king Juan Carlos, aged 79, has been crowned world sailing champion along with his crew after winning the International Six Metre Class World Championship in Canada. Carlos, who abdicated the throne in 2014, won one race of eight, but sailed the most constant and was, thus, crowned winner. The championship is for yachts constructed before December 31, 1965.
