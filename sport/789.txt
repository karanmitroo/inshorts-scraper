Australian wheelchair tennis player Dylan Alcott crashed into a linesman while playing a shot, which won him a point at the Australian Open on Thursday. Chasing a long ball behind the baseline, Alcott crashed into the official just after hitting the ball. The shot went over his opponent and bounced on the line, bringing the game back to deuce.
