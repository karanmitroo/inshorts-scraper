Argentina football captain Lionel Messi's statue in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires has been knocked over by vandals for the second time this year. Photographs posted on social media showed the sculpture, chopped off at its ankles, lying on the pavement. In January, the statue was cut at the waist before being repaired and re-erected by the city government.
