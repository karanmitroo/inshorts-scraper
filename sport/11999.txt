Congratulating PV Sindhu on assuring at least a silver medal at Rio Olympics, a user tweeted "Every shot of #PVSindhu feeling like Le Shobha De ek aur Le". While some other tweets read, "Now the goal is gold, but fingers and toes and legs, all crossed" and "Sindhu's aggression & her jump smashes+Gopichand's calmness = Perfect combination! Smelling the #Gold!"
