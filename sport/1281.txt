Indian Arrows' Nongdamba Naorem pulled off a solo goal, going past five defenders in eight seconds before successfully netting against Shillong Lajong in the I-League on Tuesday. The 17-year-old midfielder, who played in the U-17 World Cup this year, started his run from the left-flank and wrong-footed two defenders before dodging three others to score in the 86th minute.
