After winning the gold medal in alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics, Czech snowboarder and skier Ester Ledecka asked a cameraman how it happened. "This must be some mistake, that they're going to switch the time for some others," she added. The 22-year-old beat Austria's Anna Veith by 0.01 seconds to win the super-G event of alpine skiing.
