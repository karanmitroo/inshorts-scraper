A 99-year-old Australian swimmer broke the world record for the 100-104 age category in the 50m freestyle on Wednesday. George Corones, who turns 100 in April, completed the 50m freestyle in 56.12 seconds, surpassing the previous record of 1:16.92 set by the late Canadian swimmer Jaring Timmerman in 2009. Corones took up swimming "seriously" when he turned 80.
