Indian captain Virat Kohli shared a video of himself batting left-handed while playing gully cricket in Sri Lanka, following India's fourth ODI. The 28-year-old regular right-hander captioned the video, "Not bad for a left handed shot." Recently, Kohli became only the third batsman after Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting to score 30 hundreds in ODI cricket.
