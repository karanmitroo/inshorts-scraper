Experienced pacers Irfan Pathan, Lasith Malinga and Dale Steyn were among players who went unsold at the IPL auction. Further, nine players having a base price of â‚¹2 crore, including England T20I captain Eoin Morgan and Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews, also did not find any takers. Ishant Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara and Pragyan Ojha were also not bought by any team.
