British boxer Anthony Joshua defended his WBA and IBF world heavyweight titles after defeating France's Carlos Takam in 10 rounds by a technical knockout on Saturday. Takam, whose eyes got injured, was treated twice by ringside medics before the referee called for a stoppage. The two titles Joshua is yet to win are the WBC and WBO heavyweight titles.
