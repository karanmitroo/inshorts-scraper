As many as five Indian girls, participating in the Pacific School Games, were swept away by sea at the Glenelg beach in Adelaide, Australia on Sunday. While four girls were rescued and taken to the hospital immediately, one of them belonging to Delhi, died. The deceased's father has requested that an inquiry be initiated at the earliest.
