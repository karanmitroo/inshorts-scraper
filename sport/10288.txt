North Korea's Under-17 goalkeeper, Jang Paek Ho has been handed a 12-month ban alongside a $20,000 fine on the North Korea Football Association for "deliberately" conceding a goal from a goal-kick. The Asian Football Confederation said that if Korea's Under-19 team indulges in similar behavior in the AFC U-19 Championship 2018 qualifiers, they will be automatically excluded from the competition.
