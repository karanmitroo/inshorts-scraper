ICC tweeted about the first-ever tied Test, which ended on December 14, 1960, in Brisbane, accidentally with a picture from another match. The error was noticed by commentator Harsha Bhogle and statistician Mohandas Menon, who tweeted, "@ICC is this pic of the Brisbane tied Test? The West Indian keeper was Gerry Alexander...the keeper in pic doesn't look like Alexander."
