Australian pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile became the only bowler to dismiss Indian captain Virat Kohli for a duck twice in his career, after getting him caught by Glenn Maxwell in the first India-Australia ODI on Sunday. Earlier this year, Coulter-Nile had dismissed Kohli for a duck in the KKR-RCB game in IPL in Kolkata.
