Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata invited a group of children from slums in Mumbai to the club's stadium, Old Trafford. The 29-year-old gave the kids a behind-the-scenes guided tour of the stadium and also posed for selfies in the dressing room. Mata also unveiled a photography exhibition that featured photographs taken during his trip to Mumbai earlier this year.
