French judoka Teddy Riner won all-time record 10th world title at the World Open Championships in Morocco on Saturday. The 28-year-old has lost only eight matches in his elite championship career, with his last defeat coming in 2010, after which he won more than 100 consecutive judo contests. Riner, the world's most successful judoka, has also won two Olympic golds.
