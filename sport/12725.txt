Speaking about Lionel Messi’s retirement from international football, Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo said that it hurts him to see Messi in tears. “He isn’t accustomed to defeats and disappointments, not even finishing second. Missing a penalty doesn’t make you a bad player”, Ronaldo added. The Portuguese captain was addressing the media ahead of Portugal’s Euro Cup semi-final against Wales.
