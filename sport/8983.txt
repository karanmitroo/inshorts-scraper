The fourth Test between India and Pakistan at Green Park, Kanpur that began on 25 December 1979 is the only one to have started on Christmas Day in 139 years of Test cricket. Notably, Kapil Dev, who picked up six wickets in that match, claimed 32 wickets in the six-match series, highest by an Indian pacer in a Test series.
