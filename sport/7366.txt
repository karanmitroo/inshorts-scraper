Thirteen-year-old Mohammed Alsheikh from Palestine broke the world record for the 'Most full body revolutions maintaining a chest stand in one minute'. The teenager contortionist, dubbed as 'Spider-Boy', ran around his body 38 times, thereby beating Leilani Franco's record of 29 revolutions. Alsheikh has been a competing athlete for around five years and has also participated in Arab's Got Talent.
