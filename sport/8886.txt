Legendary Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar was almost exchanged at birth after a nurse accidentally placed him next to a fisherwoman in the hospital. Gavaskar's uncle had noticed a birthmark near his ear and when he did not see it in the other child, he brought the matter to the notice, following which Gavaskar was returned to his parents.
