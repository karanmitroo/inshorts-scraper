Former England players David Gower and John Morris flew WWII planes over the stadium after getting out in a warm-up match on January 21, 1991 in Australia. The planes were supposed to fly at over 2,000 feet above the ground but Gower convinced his pilot to hover at 200 feet. Both the players were fined Â£1,000 each for the incident.
