Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who is currently completing a five-match La Liga ban, scored with a curling shot into the far-post while playing in a friendly against Fiorentina on Wednesday. Ronaldo had provided the assist for the first goal, before running on the left flank and cutting inside to go past a defender to score the match-winning goal.
