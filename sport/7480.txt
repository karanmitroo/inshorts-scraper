Ashish Nehra has shared anecdotes from his early cricketing days with Virender Sehwag, when both of them would go to Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla stadium on a scooter. "Viru would come to my house early and wake me up...He would drive to the ground while I would nap, and I would drive back on the return journey.," said Nehra.
