Former New Zealand all-rounder Sir Richard Hadlee has said he did not foresee Sachin Tendulkar doing well when they played against each other towards the end of Hadlee's career. "In 1990, Sachin was just a kid. He scored an impressive 80 as far as I remember...back then I didn't think he'd become as big as he eventually did," said Hadlee.
