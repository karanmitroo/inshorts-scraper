Former South African player Sunette Viljoen has become the first cricketer in 96 years to win an Olympic medal, after her silver-winning effort in the women's javelin throw final at the Rio Olympics on Thursday. Viljoen played only one Test in her career, incidentally against India, and 17 ODIs for the South Africa national women's team between 2000 and 2002.
