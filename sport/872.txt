French club Lyon's captain Nabil Fekir gave his team a 1-0 lead against PSG with a 30-yard curling free-kick in the second minute of the match on Sunday. Fekir's left-footed shot went over the wall and into the bottom corner after beating goalkeeper, who expected Fekir to deliver a cross. It was Fekir's third goal through direct free-kick this season.
