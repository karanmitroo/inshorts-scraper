The managers of luxury Italian shoe firm Gianvito Rossi have been accused of racism in a lawsuit by a former employee. She has claimed that the managers refused to give tennis player Serena Williams a celebrity discount because 'the company did not want African American women to wear its shoes'. The shoe firm has, however, rejected the claims.
