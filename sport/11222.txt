Experienced opener Gautam Gambhir has returned to the Indian squad for the New Zealand series, two years after last playing a Test for the team. He comes in place of KL Rahul, who sustained a hamstring injury during the first Test at Kanpur. Gambhir, who averaged 71.20 in the recently-concluded Duleep Trophy, played his last Test in 2014 in England.
