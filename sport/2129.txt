Former Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath was given the nickname 'Pigeon' by one of his New South Wales teammates due to his thin legs as a youngster. Ex-Australian captain Steve Waugh had revealed Brad McNamara gave McGrath the nickname, when he said "You've stolen a pigeon's legs, McGrath." McGrath made his international debut in a Test on November 12, 1993.
