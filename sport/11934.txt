The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has hiked the daily allowance of women and under-19 cricketers, bringing it at par with the national men's team. The women's and under-19 teams will now receive $125 per day on international tours and the equivalent of $100 during a home series, the BCCI said in a statement.
