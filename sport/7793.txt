India's cricket board BCCI has voted against the new financial model and governance structure proposed by the ICC, world cricket's governing body. The decisions, which have been agreed upon in principle by the ICC, will be up for a final approval once again in April 2017. ICC has given time for member nations to recommend changes in the propositions.
