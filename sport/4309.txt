India's Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha has said there was "nothing wrong" with the dressing room environment under former coach Anil Kumble. "We used to crack jokes, have fun...I get along well with everybody...I strongly feel the same will happen when Ravi [Shastri] Bhai will come. During the Test matches, I didn't see anything wrong," said Saha.
