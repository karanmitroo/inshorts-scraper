Newly appointed India head coach Ravi Shastri will reportedly receive an annual pay package of ₹7.5 crore, ₹1.25 crore more than what former coach Anil Kumble was earning. Shastri had reportedly demanded ₹7.75 crore, but the BCCI settled on ₹7.5 crore keeping in mind that he will forego his media commitments. Assistant coach Sanjay Bangar will get ₹2.2 crore.
