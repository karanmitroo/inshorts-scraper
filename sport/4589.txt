A batsman can only be dismissed by the umpire if the opposition team appeals for his dismissal, including for LBWs and caught behind among others. If the opposing team fails to appeal, the umpire cannot rule a batsman 'out'. However, the batsman has the freedom to leave the ground despite no appeal being made by the opposing team.
