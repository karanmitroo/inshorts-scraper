Ravichandran Ashwin's strike rate of 49.4 is the best among spinners in the last 100 years, and the third-best overall for spin bowlers. Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne, the top wicket-takers in Tests, are at fifth and sixth spot respectively. Sri Lanka's Rangana Herath and Australia's Nathan Lyon are the only other active spinners besides Ashwin in the top 10.
