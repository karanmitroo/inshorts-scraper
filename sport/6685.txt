Pakistan cricket team's new ODI and T20I captain Sarfraz Ahmed claims that Pakistan cricket is going through tough times, following the involvement of several Pakistani players in PSL spot-fixing scandal. "[W]e need to do well in the coming series [against West Indies] to boost our people," Sarfraz said. Notably, Pakistan are yet to qualify for a World Cup 2019 spot.
