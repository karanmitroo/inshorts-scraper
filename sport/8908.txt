Former cricketer Rahul Dravid was the first non-wicketkeeper in Tests to take 200 catches, accomplishing the feat on December 27, 2010, at Durban. Dravid achieved the feat after taking a one-handed catch to dismiss South Africa's Dale Steyn off Harbhajan Singh's bowling. Dravid, who took 210 catches in Tests, also holds the record for most catches by a non-wicketkeeper fielder.
