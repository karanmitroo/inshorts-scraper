India's National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) will test approximately 4,000 athletes for drugs in various disciplines this year, besides holding educative programmes for juniors to apprise them of the side effects of doping. According to NADA, India had 95 violations in 2014, third-most globally. The figure rose to 120 in 2015, but came down to 73 in 2016.
