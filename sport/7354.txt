Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi announced his retirement from T20 internationals on Monday, thereby ending his 21-year long international career. Afridi burst onto the scene in 1996, scoring a 37-ball century in only his second match to set a world record that stood for 17 years. In the second half of his career, he became known as a bowling all-rounder.
