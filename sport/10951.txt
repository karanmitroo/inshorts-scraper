Ravichandran Ashwin became only the second Indian to take two ten-wicket hauls in a Test series. He registered his career's sixth 10-for, finishing with match figures of 13/140 in the final Test against New Zealand, besides taking a ten-wicket haul in the Kanpur Test. Harbhajan Singh was the first to achieve the feat, taking two 10-fors against Australia in 2001.
