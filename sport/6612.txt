Leg spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who debuted in the Dharamsala Test against Australia, has become the first-ever men's Chinaman bowler to represent India. Chinaman bowling is left-arm unorthodox spin, where the bowler spins the ball into a right-handed batsman. The direction of turn is same as that of a right-handed off-spinner, but the ball turns more sharply due to wrist spin.
