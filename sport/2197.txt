English referee Bobby Madley was replaced by the fourth official after suffering a leg injury during a Premier League match between Leicester City and Stoke City on Saturday. Madley handed over the notepad and set of cards, and took over the role of fourth official. As Madley left the field, Leicester fans chanted "you're not fit to wear the shirt."
