Former captain Sourav Ganguly has said Virat Kohli should consult wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha and the bowler concerned before opting for a DRS review. Ganguly further said, "They get excited when going for the DRS...the wicketkeeper and the bowler should take a call...Virat Kohli should be at slip instead of point to judge whether a review should be taken or not."
