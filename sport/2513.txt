Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott played the first-ever ball of ODI cricket on January 5, 1971, in Melbourne. Boycott, who turned 77 on Saturday, came out to bat with John Edrich after Australian captain Bill Lawry decided to field first. Boycott faced Australian pacer Graham McKenzie for the first delivery and went on to score eight runs off 37 balls.
