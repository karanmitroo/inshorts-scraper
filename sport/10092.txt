South Africa became the fourth visiting team, after England, West Indies, and India, to dismiss Australia below 100 after bowling them out for 85 in the ongoing Hobart Test. While England has dismissed Australia at home below 100 runs nine times, the most by any visiting team, it was for the first time that South Africa achieved the feat.
