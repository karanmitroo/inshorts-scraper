England cricketers took the London Underground (The Tube) to reach The Oval for the third day of the Test against South Africa, the record 100th Test at the stadium. Joe Root, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, and Jonny Bairstow were among those who took the train. Broad was photographed at the platform, looking at an advertisement featuring him alongside other sportspersons.
