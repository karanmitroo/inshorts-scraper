Lalita Park, the Delhi ground where batsman Mohit Ahlawat scored the first-ever T20 triple ton, is at least five times smaller than the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The ground, a 60m x 40m patch with a 25-yard boundary behind the batsman, is also used for Ram Leela functions. Ahlawat, however, said most of his sixes came towards the longer leg-side boundary.
