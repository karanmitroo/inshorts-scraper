On being asked about 38-year-old fast bowler Ashish Nehra's chances to represent India in the World T20 in 2020, former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag said that age should not be the criteria to play in the World Cup. "Sanath Jayasuriya played till 42, Sachin Tendulkar played until the age of 40, then why not Ashish Nehra," said Sehwag.
