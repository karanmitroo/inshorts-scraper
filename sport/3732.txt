India was in a position to enforce follow-on in all the three matches of the recently-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. Virat Kohli chose not to enforce the follow-on in the first Test and led India to a 304-run victory, their biggest away Test win. In the next two matches, India enforced the follow-on and won both by an innings.
