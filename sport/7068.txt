Sanjay Manjrekar has explained Australian captain Steve Smith's unusual stance, which sees the right-hander going on the back foot, opening himself up and bringing in his bat from gully to play shots. Explaining the stance, Manjrekar says it is opposite to what is normally taught. It gives Smith more time to play shots, besides avoiding hits on his pad.
