Indian pacer Mohammed Shami has been ruled out of the final Test against Australia in Dharamsala as he has not yet recovered from his injury and is still undergoing treatment under physio Patrick Farhart. Indian captain Virat Kohli's inclusion in the squad is also in doubt as he is also under observation after his shoulder injury in the third Test.
