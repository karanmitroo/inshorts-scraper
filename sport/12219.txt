The Indian men’s hockey team will skip the opening ceremony of the Olympics on Friday at the Maracana Stadium in Rio. Reportedly, the team is unhappy with the “ill-fitting” kit provided to them by the Indian Olympic Association. However, Hockey India president Narinder Batra said the team was skipping the ceremony since they are playing a match on August 6.
