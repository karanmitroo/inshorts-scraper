Indian team management on Wednesday decided to block the media from watching the team's nets session on the eve of the one-off Test against Bangladesh. Black screens were put behind every batting net to ensure the media could not observe the proceedings. The team management asked us to block the view, said the Hyderabad Cricket Association's media manager.
