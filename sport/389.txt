Reacting to her looks being compared to Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie, Russian curler Anastasia Bryzgalova said it is very pleasant to receive compliments but medals are not given for beauty. The 25-year-old recently won bronze in the mixed doubles curling event along with husband Alexander Krushelnitsky at the Winter Olympics. The couple had also won gold at 2016 World Championships.
