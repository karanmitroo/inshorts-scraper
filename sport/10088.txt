Virat Kohli and former wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia are the only Indians out hit wicket in both Tests and ODIs. Kohli was first out hit wicket against England in the Cardiff ODI in 2011, and was dismissed in similar fashion at Rajkot against the same opposition. Mohinder Amarnath holds the Indian record for most hit wickets, with three Test dismissals.
