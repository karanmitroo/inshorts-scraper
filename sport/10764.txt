There is no video record of former India captain, Kapil Dev's unbeaten 175-run innings against Zimbabwe in the group stage of the 1983 World Cup, which was the then highest score by a batsman in limited-overs cricket. The BBC was on strike on that day and no professional video camera recorded Kapil Dev's performance.
