India registered their biggest victory in T20Is after defeating Sri Lanka by 93 runs in the first T20I in Cuttack on Wednesday. India were driven by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who took a four-wicket haul and became the leading wicket-taker in T20Is in 2017. India are unbeaten in 15 home series across all formats since November 2015.
