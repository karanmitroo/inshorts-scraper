Sri Lanka registered their first T20I victory over India after two years by registering a five-wicket win in the tri-series opener on Tuesday. With this, India's seven-match winning streak in T20Is against the island nation came to an end. Further, this was India's first defeat under Rohit Sharma's captaincy in five T20I matches.
