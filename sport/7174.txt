Responding to a query on Twitter on whether he will act in Bollywood films like his compatriot Brett Lee, Australian batsman David Warner tweeted, "Tora tora Hindi". Warner added it was "not likely" for him to act in Bollywood films unless he was asked. Former pacer Brett Lee starred in the Bollywood film 'UnIndian', which released in 2015.
