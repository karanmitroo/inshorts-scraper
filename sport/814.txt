A fan allegedly hacked Facebook and other social media accounts of Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj and sent 'I love you' messages to the pacer's friends. Following a complaint by Siraj, police tracked the culprit and found him to be a 14-year-old boy, whose brother is Siraj's friend. Later, Siraj took to Instagram and thanked Telangana Police for recovering his accounts.
