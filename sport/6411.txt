German football club Schalke's mascot showed referee Felix Zwayer his own red card after he failed to award Schalke a penalty at the end of their match against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Schalke's appeals for a penalty in injury time were turned down by the referee, following which he dropped his red card, which was picked up by the mascot.
