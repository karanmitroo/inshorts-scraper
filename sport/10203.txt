Former cricketer Kapil Dev has said spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has the ability to bowl out the world's best 11 batsmen in one session. "England aren't going to find it easy...especially if the pitches start helping spinners...This will be a very long winter for the English batsmen against Ashwin and Co," said Dev.
