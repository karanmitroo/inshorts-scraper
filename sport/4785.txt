The first ODI between India and Windies was abandoned due to rain on Friday. Batting first, Ajinkya Rahane and Shikhar Dhawan  contributed 132 runs for the first wicket, the highest ODI opening stand for India in West Indies. Yuvraj Singh, playing his 400th international match, became the first Indian to score 500 ODI runs in WI before rain played spoilsport.
