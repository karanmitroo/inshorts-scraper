German tennis player Angelique Kerber was presented with the WTA Year-End World No. 1 award on Tuesday. The 28-year-old is the second German to achieve the feat after Steffi Graf who held the year-end number 1 ranking for a record eight times. Kerber won two Grand Slams this year and ended Serena Williams record-equaling 186 straight weeks at the top.
