Formula One will end the practice of using 'grid girls', starting from the first race of the 2018 World Championship. F1 stated the custom does not "resonate with its brand values and clearly is at odds with modern day societal norms". 'Grid girls' are models who wear clothing that bears the name of a sponsor and hold up driver name-boards.
