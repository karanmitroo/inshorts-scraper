England woman cricketer Danielle Wyatt, who earlier tweeted that she wanted to marry Virat Kohli, was slammed for misspelling his name as 'Kholi' on a bat gifted to her by him. A user wrote, "Kholi again!! Kholi means room & Virat means big/huge!! It means there's "big/huge room" for improvement. Best wishes." Wyatt had met Kohli in 2014.
