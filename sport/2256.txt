Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne has said the team would consider quitting Formula 1 from 2020 if changes proposed by new owners Liberty Media were implemented. Marchionne said while he supported cost-cutting, there were other issues like new engine design that could force Ferrari to consider racing elsewhere. Ferrari is the only team to have participated in all F1 world championships.
