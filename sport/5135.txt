Dismissing rumours of a rift between him and coach Anil Kumble, Indian captain Virat Kohli has said there are no problems and people are "making up issues". "People like to find rumours, especially before a big tournament...they are trying to create livelihood by spreading rumours...we are focussed on our livelihood, which is on the field," said Kohli.
