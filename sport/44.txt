Team India head coach Ravi Shastri has said that captain Virat Kohli reminds him of former Pakistan captain Imran Khan. "He wants to lead by example...Just the ability to always want to dominate, want to compete, irrespective of whatever conditions you get, believe that you can do it...that was very similar to the way Imran led," Shastri added.
