Indian pacer Irfan Pathan, who is celebrating his 32nd birthday today, is the only bowler in the Test history to claim a hat-trick in the first over of a Test. Pathan achieved the feat against Pakistan in 2006 when he dismissed Salman Butt, Younis Khan, and Mohammad Yousuf with the last three deliveries of the match's first over.
