Australian spinner Steve O'Keefe has been fined Australian $20,000 for making sexual remarks at a female cricketer and her partner under the influence of alcohol. A journalist revealed O'Keefe made "sexual, not homophobic" comments to cricketer Rachael Haynes and her partner at the Cricket New South Wales event. Invitees had earlier tried to get O'Keefe out of the function.
