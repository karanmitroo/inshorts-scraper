Pakistan Cricket Board has sent a legal notice to BCCI for not honouring a Memorandum of Understanding which had been signed between them in 2014. The MoU stated that India and Pakistan would play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023. PCB is demanding compensation after claiming to have lost over $200 million due to India's refusal to play.
