Athletes from Russia, who participated in the recently concluded Winter Olympics as neutrals, secretly kept the national flag under a white scarf attached to their uniform jackets. Russian flag was not allowed to be displayed as Russia was banned from the Games over state-sponsored doping. Olympic silver medalist figure skater Evgenia Medvedeva revealed the secret through a video on Instagram.
