Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt's bronze from the 2012 London Olympics won't be upgraded to gold, after United World Wrestling cleared Azerbaijan's gold medalist Togrul Asgarov of doping. However, Dutt's silver upgradation is subject to his samples clearing retests. Samples of London 2012's silver medalist, late wrestler Besik Kudukhov, had tested positive for banned substances, prompting the upgradation.
