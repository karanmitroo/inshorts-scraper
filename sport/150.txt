Twenty-three-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams' husband Alexis Ohanian has put up four billboards, along a highway in California with images of their daughter Alexis Olympia, which say, "Greatest momma of all time. G.M.O.A.T." "(Olympia) & I wanted to welcome her back to tennis. Designed them myself, with some help from Jr. #GMOAT," Ohanian tweeted.
