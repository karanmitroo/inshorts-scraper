Spanish female racing driver Carmen Jorda has suggested women could be better suited to Formula E than Formula One as the all-electric cars are less physically challenging. The comments, which drew criticism from several women racers, were made after the 29-year-old former Lotus and Renault F1 development driver tried out a Formula E car in Mexico City.
