India has never lost a three-T20I series since the inception of the format. India played three series last year against Australia, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, winning all. The Indian team, which won its first-ever bilateral series in the format in 2010, defeating Zimbabwe 2-0, is playing the final T20I of the three-match series against England in Bengaluru on Wednesday.
