Australian cricketer Tom Garrett replaced debutant umpire George Hodges during an Ashes Test at Melbourne in 1885. Hodges refused to officiate after tea on the third day due to English bowlers' complaints about his decision-making. Garrett, who had been dismissed twice, replaced Hodges, as the other on-field umpire had already been substituted earlier by a deputy due to illness.
