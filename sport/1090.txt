Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is set to be Australia's assistant coach for the upcoming T20I series against New Zealand and England ahead of coaching the Delhi Daredevils team in IPL 2018. It is the same role Ponting took last year when he worked with the T20 squad for the three-match series against Sri Lanka.
