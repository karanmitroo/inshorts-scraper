South Africa defeated Australia by four wickets at Durban on Wednesday, to complete the second-highest successful run chase of all time. Chasing 371, SA achieved the target with four balls remaining, led by David Miller's 118*(79). The record for the highest ODI chase is also held by the Proteas when they chased down 434 against Australia at Johannesburg in 2006.
