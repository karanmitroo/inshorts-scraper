Cricketer Suresh Raina posted a video of his one-year-old daughter, Gracia, saying "Papa" on Father's Day on Sunday. Raina captioned the video, "Love being a dad! The #EarlyMomentsMatter so be a #BaapWaliBaat & talk to your baby!" Earlier this year, Raina brought his daughter to the stadium for an IPL match and dedicated his Orange Cap to her.
