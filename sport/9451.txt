Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly played gully cricket with a tennis ball in the streets of Kolkata while taking part in a shoot. Ganguly, however, seemed to have done some damage to his shoulders as he was seen rubbing them between deliveries. The ex-cricketer started by driving some full-pitched deliveries but soon began playing lofted shots as he got set.
