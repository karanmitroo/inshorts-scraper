Melbourne Stars captain John Hastings' helmet was knocked off after being hit by a bouncer off Brisbane Heat's Ben Cutting in the BBL on Tuesday. The helmet went on to land near the stumps while the ball, which was going towards the stumps, was kicked away by Hastings. However, Hastings was unhurt and the play resumed after a slight delay.
