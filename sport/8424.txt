Pakistan's Mohammad Amir got the wickets of David Warner and Steve Smith off consecutive deliveries in the first ODI against Australia. Amir bowled Warner with a full and straight delivery that clipped the top of the bails. The pacer made Smith drive the next ball by bowling it full and wide and successfully took the outside edge.
