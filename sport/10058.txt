Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has said that it is frustrating to get injured frequently when you are in the national team and performing well. "When you are playing well you are into rhythm...but when you are injured, it's difficult to return to rhythm straightaway," said the 26-year-old. Kumar was ruled out of the England Tests after sustaining injury against NZ.
