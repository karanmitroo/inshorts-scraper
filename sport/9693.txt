Parthiv Patel has set a record for the longest gap between two Tests played for an Indian player. Parthiv, who is playing in the ongoing Mohali Test against England, last played a Test in August 2008, missing 83 Tests in between. The gap of eight years and 107 days is also longest in terms of days for an Indian player.
