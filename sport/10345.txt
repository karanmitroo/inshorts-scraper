Harvard University has suspended its men's soccer team for the remainder of the season over sexual comments made about members of the women's soccer team in 2012. The players had rated the attractiveness of the female players in a "scouting report". The team will forfeit all the current season's remaining matches and will not participate in this year's NCAA tournament.
