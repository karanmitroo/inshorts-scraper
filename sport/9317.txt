Indian middle-order batsman Karun Nair was dismissed by Moeen Ali on the third day of the Wankhede Test, following a successful review by England. Nair was given not out by the on-field umpire Bruce Oxenford for an LBW appeal. The decision was reversed after the third umpire got convinced that the ball had not hit the bat first.
