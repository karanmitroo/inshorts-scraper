Australian spinner Stephen O'Keefe, who picked up 12 wickets in the first Test against India, was pulled out of the Big Bash T20 League to focus on his preparation for the Test tour of India. O'Keefe had been named in the Sydney Sixers squad but went to Dubai for a training camp ahead of the India tour.
