Fox Sports Brazil paid tribute to club team Chapecoense by airing 90 minutes of silence in place of the team's scheduled Copa Sudamericana final on Wednesday. The match had to be cancelled as the team plane crashed in Colombia on Monday, killing several Chapecoense players. Meanwhile, rival team Atletico Nacional has requested Chapecoense be named as the tournament's champions.
