Rufus the hawk, is the official bird scarer at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club's Wimbledon tennis championships each year. The hawk ensures that no birds litter in or around the Wimbledon tennis courts. Rufus has been the official bird scarer for the past 15 years, after having taken over from Hamish the hawk.
