Adelaide Strikers Women's player Bridget Patterson saved a four before hitting the stumps directly from a boundary line throw, thereby running out Melbourne Renegades' Molly Strano. Strano was caught way outside the crease as she tried to take a double. Strikers ran out three more opponents before going on to win their Big Bash League match by 14 runs.
