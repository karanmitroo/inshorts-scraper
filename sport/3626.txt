British long-distance runner Mo Farah won his final race on British soil with his 3,000m race at the Diamond League. Farah, who has won three World Championships in 5,000m races, later ripped off his British vest and passed it to his teammate, Andy Butchart. Farah will next race over 5,000m in Zurich on Thursday and at September's Great North Run.
