Nike's Co-founder and former CEO Phil Knight has said that Nike's golf division did not break-even despite the "celebrity" of Tiger Woods and "his legion of fans". He further said, "It’s a fairly simple equation, that we lost money for 20 years on equipment and balls”. Notably, Nike exited the category a year ago amid the sport’s declining popularity.
