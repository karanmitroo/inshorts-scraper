Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag took to Twitter to share an image of hand-shaped 'rotis' and jokingly asked Indian wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel if he needed a set of wicketkeeping gloves. Replying to Sehwag, Parthiv wrote, "Idhar meri perfect size wale bahut gloves le ke aaya hu...ise udhar hi rakhe aap..delhi mai thand Badh gayi hai...to ghar me kisi ke Kaam aayenge."
