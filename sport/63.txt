Ex-Australia captain Ian Chappell has said the Committee of Administrators (CoA) running the BCCI, cricket's "most powerful administration", is a black mark on cricket. This comes after CoA overruled BCCI's attempts to play a day-night Test against Windies for not consulting them. "At a time when cricket needs clear-headed decision making...confusion seems to be the prevalent emotion," he added.
