Former Olympic champion Donghua Li from China performed a routine on the Pommel horse in Rio's gymnastics gala, 20 years after winning the gold in the same event in Atlanta Olympics. The 48-year old was dressed in a suit and pretended to be an old man before entering the act. The Olympics gala is an informal non-judged performance by gymnasts.
