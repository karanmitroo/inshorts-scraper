South African pacer Morne Morkel set a record for the most number of wickets taken on no-balls in Test cricket, registering his 13th such instance against England recently. Morkel bowled Ben Stokes while he was batting on 44, with replays showing the bowler's front foot was over the line. "World record, thank you. Somebody has to hold it," said Morkel.
