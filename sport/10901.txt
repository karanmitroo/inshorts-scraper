Indian Test team captain Virat Kohli's lookalike was spotted in the stands at Indore's Holkar Stadium during the day two of the third Test against New Zealand. The lookalike, who sported a beard similar to Kohli's, was confused to be the cricketer by commentator Sanjay Manjrekar, who commended Kohli's gesture of meeting the fans right after his double hundred.
