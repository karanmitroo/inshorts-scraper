Ahead of the selection meeting for the tri-nation T20I series against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, a BCCI official said if India captain Virat Kohli wants rest, he will get it. "In Virat's case, it's he who decides on whether he would like to opt out or not," he added. Meanwhile, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah are likely to be rested.
