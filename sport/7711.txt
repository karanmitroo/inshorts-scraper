Australian coach Darren Lehmann has said the team is yet to find a way to tackle Indian skipper Virat Kohli on their upcoming four-Test tour to India, which starts February 23. "Bowl well and have a bit of luck along the way...challenging his defence and making sure he's playing in the areas we want him to play," said Lehmann.
