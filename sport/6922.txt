La Liga defending champions Barcelona followed up their 6-1 comeback win against PSG in the Champions League with Sunday's 2-1 loss against Deportivo La Coruña. An error by Marc-André ter Stegen helped former Real Madrid youth trainee Mato Joselu score the opener in the 40th minute. Luis Suárez equalised in the 46th minute before Deportivo defender Álex Bergantiños' 74th-minute match-winner.
