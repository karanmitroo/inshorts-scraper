Reacting to former Pakistani cricketer Rashid Latif's video criticising Virender Sehwag, Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary said that Latif uploaded the video to get "60 seconds of fame". He further called Latif "shameless" and a "donkey" for talking against one of the greatest cricketers. Earlier, Sehwag had responded to the video saying, "A meaningful silence is always better than meaningless words."
