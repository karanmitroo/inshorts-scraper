NBA side Milwaukee Bucks' mascot, Bango the buck, trolled the Toronto Raptors by holding cue cards mocking the Toronto-based side. One cue card read, "Did you hear the Toronto Raptors basketball team doesn't have a website?", with the next response cue card reading, "They can't get 3 'W's' together." Notably, the Bucks hold a 2-1 series lead over the Raptors.
