Telecom firm Maxx Mobilink has accused MS Dhoni of "wilfully" misleading the Delhi High Court, following his complaint that the firm was using his name to sell their products, disobeying the court's November 2014 order. The court order had asked the firm, of which Dhoni was the brand ambassador, to stop using his name following the contract's expiration in 2012.
