Pakistan's Ramiz Raja became the first batsman in ODIs to get out obstructing the field against England on November 20, 1987. Raja was batting on 98 before playing the match's last ball. While trying to take a second run to get to his century, Raja used his bat to prevent the ball from hitting wickets and was signalled out.
