Marylebone Cricket Club, international cricket's law-making body, has approved two umpiring signals which will be used to send off misbehaving players. To send off a player temporarily, the umpire will raise both hands with fingers spread and palms point towards scorers. To permanently remove a player, the umpire will point their index finger with their arm outstretched to the side.
