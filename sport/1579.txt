During the 2019-2023 cricket cycle, the Indian cricket team will host 81 matches across formats, 30 more than the current Future Tours Programme cycle. Despite the additional number of matches, BCCI insists that the number of playing days per year for India will decrease by 20% in the 2019-2023 cycle, which will feature matches against Australia, England, and South Africa.
