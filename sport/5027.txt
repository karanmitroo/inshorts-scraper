A portion of the first ODI between Afghanistan and Windies featured stumps without bails as strong winds on Friday made it impossible for the bails to remain in place. The rules allow cricket to be played without bails during strong winds, entrusting umpires with the responsibility of taking calls about wickets being broken in cases of run-outs, bowleds and stumpings.
