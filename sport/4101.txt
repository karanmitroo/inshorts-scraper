Five-year-old baseball fan Leo Schneider from Northern Kentucky kicked Boston Red Sox's Dee Gordon when he got the chance to meet the star before Sunday's Marlins-Reds game. Leo's mother, Amy, later said, "Leo loves baseball. He loves every single player. He was just thrilled to be there in the first place."
