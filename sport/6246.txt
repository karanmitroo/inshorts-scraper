Delhi Daredevils lost their opening match of the IPL 2017 season to Royal Challengers Bangalore by 15 runs despite Rishabh Pant's fighting half-century on Saturday. Batting first, Royal Challengers Bangalore put up 157/8, driven by Kedar Jadhav's 37-ball 69. In reply, Pant's 36-ball 57 proved to be insufficient as it could not help Delhi Daredevils reach the target.
