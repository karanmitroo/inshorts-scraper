South African Test captain Faf du Plessis praised pacer Kagiso Rabada for his match-winning figures of 7 wickets for 170 runs against Australia in the first Test. Du Plessis said that he was "incredibly proud" of Rabada for his "champion" attitude. "I'm sleeping with him (Rabada) tonight," added Du Plessis jokingly.
