Australian batsman Peter Handscomb lost around 4.5 kilograms while batting on the second day of the second Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong. The right-hander, who finished the day at 69*(113) in Australia's first innings on Tuesday, took several drink breaks, with temperatures over 40 degree Celsius, and 80% humidity. Australian coach Darren Lehmann described the performance as "gutsy".
