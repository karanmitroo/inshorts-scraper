Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov tended to an injured ball boy at the ongoing Shanghai Masters 2016 tournament. The 25-year-old world number 18 was receiving a service in his second-round clash against Vasek Pospisil, when the wide serve hit a ballboy, who began crying. Dimitrov then handed his pink wristband to the ballboy and patted his head.
