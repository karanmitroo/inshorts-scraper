Spain's world number one tennis player Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals due to knee injury, after losing his opening round match to Belgium's David Goffin on Monday. Nadal, who despite his 13 straight qualifications for the season-ending tournament has never won it, will be replaced by compatriot and US Open semifinalist Pablo Carreno Busta.
