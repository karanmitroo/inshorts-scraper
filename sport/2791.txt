BCCI on Tuesday named pacer Deepak Chahar in the Board President's XI squad for New Zealand warm-up matches and later admitted they had chosen the wrong "Chahar". The BCCI replaced Deepak with his brother Rahul Chahar, saying that Deepak's name was "inadvertently mentioned". Both Rahul and Deepak represented Rising Pune Supergiant in this year's Indian Premier League.
