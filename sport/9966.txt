England batsman Ben Stokes, who scored a century in the recently-concluded Rajkot Test against India, has said that he can't eat during session breaks when he's not out. "I literally can't eat, not even a protein shake...The team staff was trying to force-feed me pretty much," said Stokes, who suffered cramps in Rajkot due to his inability to eat.
