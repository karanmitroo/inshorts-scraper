Indian women's hockey team captain Vandana Kataria reportedly left a movie hall as it didn't play the national anthem. Kataria enquired with the head of the Cineplex who told her that they are yet to receive a written order from the apex court. Kataria protested, saying, "You don't need to wait for a written directive...to respect the national anthem."
