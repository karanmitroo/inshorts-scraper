Royal Challengers Bangalore batsman Kedar Jadhav pulled off the 'Helicopter shot', which was made famous by former Indian captain MS Dhoni, in the team's IPL match against Delhi Daredevils on Saturday. Facing Delhi Daredevils' West Indian fast bowler Carlos Brathwaite, Jadhav anticipated the delivery and moved inside the crease and pulled off the shot from around his heels.
