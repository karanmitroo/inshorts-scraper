India's Olympic gold winning shooter Abhinav Bindra said that he lost interest in cricket after former Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar retired from the sport. "I'd follow Team India's performances, but have stopped doing so after Sachin called it a day... He was different, definitely, a cut above the rest," Bindra said during an interview.
