World number 21 tennis player Nick Kyrgios walked off the court after losing the first set in his Shanghai Masters first round match. Kyrgios was heard saying he would quit if he lost the tie-break after getting a point penalty for "audible obscenity". Kyrgios was fined and banned for "not trying" in a match at the same tournament last year.
