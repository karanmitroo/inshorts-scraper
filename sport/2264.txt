Virat Kohli, in a recent interview, revealed that Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya only listens to English songs, but he doesn't know five words of even one song. "He just wants the beat and all he does is move around," Kohli added. Further, Kohli said he hasn't seen anyone as lost as the all-rounder, who once called Ravichandran Ashwin as 'Ravikashyap'.
