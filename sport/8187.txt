In England's 47th over in the second India-England ODI, Liam Plunkett sought a review after being given out LBW by on-field umpire Anil Chaudhary. After watching the replays, third umpire Kumar Dharmasena asked Chaudhary to stick with his decision despite the replays proving Plunkett to be safe. Chaudhary followed the instruction but was quick to reverse it, declaring Plunkett not-out.
