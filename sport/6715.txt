The Indian Wells ATP trophy was taken away from the women's singles champion, Elena Vesnina, during her post-match press conference to present it to Roger Federer as the organisers had only one trophy at that time. Vesnina was later presented with her own personalised trophy. Notably, Federer won his fifth Indian Wells title, his 90th ATP title overall.
