India won the inaugural ICC World T20 tournament in South Africa on September 24, 2007. Facing Pakistan in the finals, India made 157/5, driven by Gautam Gambhir's 54-ball 75. With one wicket remaining, Pakistan needed 13 in the final over, in which Misbah-ul-Haq's scoop shot off Joginder Sharma's third ball was caught by S Sreesanth to hand India the title.
