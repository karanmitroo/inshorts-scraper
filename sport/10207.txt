Reacting to commentator Ian Chappell saying that South African pacer Kagiso Rabada hails from a village, a user tweeted, "If any 'village' needs an idiot then #IanChappell is applying #ausvsa". "Chuffed Kagiso Rabada and I come from the same village... It's a pretty big one, called Johannesburg. #SAvsAUS", tweeted another user.
