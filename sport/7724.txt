American high diver and 2013 World Aquatics Championships gold medal winner Cesilie Carlton performed successive somersaults in the course of her 55-foot dive into the world's deepest swimming pool on a moving cruise ship. The footage of the 35-year-old's dive was filmed aboard the Harmony of the Seas cruise ship, one of the biggest passenger liners in the world.
