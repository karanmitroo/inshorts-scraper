Cricket legend Sir Donald Bradman, in 1936-37 Ashes Test, reversed the Australian batting order to protect his batsmen from the 'wet' wicket. The batsman himself came at number seven to score 270, later named by Wisden as the greatest innings in Test cricket history. Bradman, born on August 27, 1908, described the strategy as "a sensational battle of tactics".
