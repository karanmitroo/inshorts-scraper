Following Yuvraj Singh's match-winning 150 in India's win over England in the second ODI, former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted, "This man (Yuvraj Singh) has defeated Cancer. Today, he only defeated the English bowlers. Everyone can learn not to give up. Proud of @YUVSTRONG12 #INDvENG." Notably, Yuvraj on Thursday scored his first international hundred in over six years.
