Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin asked the Indian media to stop criticising the rank turner Indian pitches. "I don't know why these pitch jibes come back at us...you can definitely assess (pitches) better than we do," said Ashwin to the reporters. Ashwin further praised the Vizag pitch saying that it was "as good as Indian pitch one can get".
