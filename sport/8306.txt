Indian captain Virat Kohli, in a recent interview, said that thriving in run chases has become a habit for him. Kohli added that a balance between being aggressive and taking one's time initially is key in chasing big targets. "I read the body language of the opposition and look to finish the game two to three overs before," added Kohli.
