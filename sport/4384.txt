BCCI has denied reports that former cricketer Ravi Shastri has been appointed as head coach of the Indian cricket team, saying the Cricket Advisory Committee is still deliberating over the issue. Earlier, BCCI's Committee of Administrators' Chief Vinod Rai had asked BCCI to announce the new coach on Tuesday itself. CAC member Sourav Ganguly had expressed "surprise" at the decision.
