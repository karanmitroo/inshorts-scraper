Kolkata Knight Riders' players wore black armbands in their IPL match against Rising Pune Supergiant on Wednesday, as a tribute to the 25 CRPF jawans who were martyred in Sukma on Monday. KKR officials revealed it was captain Gautam Gambhir's idea, with the skipper also tweeting about the incident. "Sometimes I wonder if we deserve their sacrifice," tweeted Gambhir.
