The Olympic torch for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics was unveiled by the Games' organising committee in PyeongChang, South Korea, this week, one year before the opening ceremony. The white and gold torch, measuring around two feet, has been specifically designed for all weather conditions with an air tunnel and a pentagon-shaped hole to drain out any water.
