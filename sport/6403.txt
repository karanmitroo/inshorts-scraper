Needing 19 runs in the last six balls to win the 2016 World T20 on April 3, West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite hit four straight sixes against England's Ben Stokes. Brathwaite's sixes helped the Windies, who were chasing 156, win the match with two balls to spare and become the first team to win two World T20 titles.
