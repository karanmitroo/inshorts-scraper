The Olympic Torch has been flown to space twice, and taken on a spacewalk. Shuttle Atlantis first flew the Torch to the International Space Station before the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. During the 2014 Sochi Olympics relay, the Torch was again taken to the Space Station in November 2013, where it was kept for five days and taken on a spacewalk.
