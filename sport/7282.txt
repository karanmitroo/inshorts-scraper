Indian captain Virat Kohli on Friday got out without scoring a run for the first time in Tests in India. The duck was Kohli's fifth in 93 Test innings, with other four coming in West Indies, Australia and England (2). Last time, Kohli got out for a duck in Tests was in August 2014 against England in Manchester.
