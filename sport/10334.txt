Former English cricketer, Kevin Pietersen claims that it is unfair to even compare Indian Test captain Virat Kohli and English top-order batsman Joe Root, since the former is statistically ahead of the Yorkshire man. Speaking about Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, Pietersen said, "Ashwin is a good bowler. He uses his variations very well, especially the way he approaches the crease".
