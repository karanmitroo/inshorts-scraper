New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham feels that Test cricket could have been more interesting if ball tampering rules were not imposed on bowlers. "If you could just do whatever you wanted to the ball. That would probably make Test cricket more interesting. It could make more tedious sessions more exciting with the ball reversing more," added Neesham.
