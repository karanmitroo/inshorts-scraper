Four South African batsmen were out for golden ducks in the Oval Test against England on Monday, marking the first such instance in Test history. Moeen Ali took a hat-trick to hand England a 239-run win, only the third time a Test was won by a hat-trick. This was the first hat-trick at the Oval in the ground's 100th Test.
