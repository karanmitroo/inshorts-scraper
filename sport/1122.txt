On the eve of the second anniversary of his world record 1009* in an innings, Mumbai's 17-year-old Pranav Dhanawade slammed 236 runs in a 45-over inter-college match on Thursday. Pranav's knock included 35 fours and three sixes and helped his side score 459. Last year, Pranav had returned the scholarship given to him by Mumbai Cricket Association over poor form.
