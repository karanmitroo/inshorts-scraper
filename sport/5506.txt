England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has termed the England and Wales Cricket Board's decision to make Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler report for a training camp in Spain as "pathetic". "The last week of the IPL is a huge occasion...What are they going to Spain for? To field a couple of balls? He should be playing in the IPL," said Pietersen.
