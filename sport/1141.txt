Lukas Podolski, who was part of Germany's 2014 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, has unveiled Mangal Doener, a new kebab restaurant in his home city of Cologne. Over a thousand fans turned up on Saturday for the opening of the restaurant, with some arriving more than five hours early. Podolski will run the restaurant along with two co-owners.
