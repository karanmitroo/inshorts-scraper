A lower league football match in Romania was brought to a halt as all match balls had been hit into a nearby river. The hosts Bistrita Brosteni were leading 2-0 in the 58th minute against Vanatorul Dorna CanÂ­drenilor when they ran out of balls. Reacting to the abandonment, the fans started chanting, "Get them back from the dam."
