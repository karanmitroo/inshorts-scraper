Jharkand's wicketkeeper-batsman Ishan Kishan equalled the record for hitting the most sixes in a Ranji Trophy innings. The 18-year-old achieved the feat after smashing 14 sixes in his knock of 273 runs off 336 balls in the first innings against Delhi. He equalled the record of Himachal Pradesh's Shakti Singh, who had hit 14 sixes against Haryana in November 1990.
