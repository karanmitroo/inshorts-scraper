Cricketer Gautam Gambhir has filed a case in the Delhi High Court against a bar in the city for using his name. The bar uses the tagline "by Gautam Gambhir", with the owner also reportedly being named Gautam Gambhir. Gambhir, a teetotaller, said the public is being misled into believing that the bar is owned by the cricketer.
