Argentine Football Association has ordered the Buenos Aires-based Liniers club to fix its crooked home ground, 30 years after the team started using it. Officials realised that the field was crooked after seeing aerial shots of the stadium on Google Maps. A Liniers player said they always knew the field was crooked and would joke about it with rival teams.
