Pakistan-born USA batsman Fahad Babar quit the WICB Regional Super50 tournament midway and returned to Chicago fearing President Donald Trump's immigration ban. Babar, who was representing the ICC Americas squad, returned on the advice of his immigration lawyer. Even though the immigration ban does not cover Pakistan, Babar's lawyer reportedly asked him to return since the ban could be extended.
