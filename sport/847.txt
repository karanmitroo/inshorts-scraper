Reacting to Cheteshwar Pujara scoring his first run after 53 balls against South Africa on Wednesday, a user wrote, "Pujara's like a person who walks into a bank without an Aadhaar number. Just can't open his account." Other tweets read, "In parallel universe. Pujara playing with 100+ strike rate#IndvSA," and, "Quality 50 by Pujara. What a knock. 0* off 50."
