Pakistani pacer, Mohammad Amir broke the record for the maximum number of Tests taken before taking a catch, after claiming his first catch in his 20th Test while playing against West Indies. Amir, who leapt to take a catch that dismissed Darren Bravo, broke the record held by Geoff Pullar of England, whose first catch came in his 18th Test.
