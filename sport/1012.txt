Following his dismissal at the hands of Ravichandran Ashwin in the second Test, South African youngster Aiden Markram was lauded by Indian captain Virat Kohli for his 94-run innings. Markram revealed later that Kohli came to him and said, "Well played, you were unlucky to get out." "It was a great gesture and it meant a lot," Markram added.
