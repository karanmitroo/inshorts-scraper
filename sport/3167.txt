Real Madrid forward Marco Asensio missed the team's Champions League opener against  APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday because of an infected pimple he got after shaving his legs. The pimple prevented him from pulling his socks up, manager Zinedine Zidane revealed. Asensio has scored four goals in six appearances across all competitions so far this season.
