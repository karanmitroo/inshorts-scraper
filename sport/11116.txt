On October 2, 1994, Pakistan were struggling at 258/9 against Australia before Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed combined for 57 runs, registering the highest last-wicket partnership ever to win a Test. Interestingly, when Pakistan needed 3 runs to win Australian wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance and the ball went for four byes, thus giving Pakistan the victory.
