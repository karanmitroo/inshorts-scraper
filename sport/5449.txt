ATP is set to try out new tennis rules in the Under-21 ATP Next Gen Finals in Milan in November. The tournament will feature 4-game best-of-five set matches, with a shot clock in place to check the time between points. Notably, the number of games required to win a match, 12, still remains the same in new format.
