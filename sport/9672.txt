Indian wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel was given not out by umpire Marais Erasmus after a Adil Rashid delivery struck him on the knee-roll. England sought DRS which showed that the ball was hitting the leg-stump, and Parthiv was given LBW out. Parthiv was rescued early in the innings after a wrong decision against him was overturned using DRS.
