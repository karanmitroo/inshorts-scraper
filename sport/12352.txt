Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan on Wednesday claimed that one of the two wrestlers accused of spiking suspended wrestler Narsingh Yadav's food has confessed. In an FIR, Yadav has accused the two wrestlers of adding banned substances to his food, which led to his disqualification from the Rio Olympics following a failed dope test.
