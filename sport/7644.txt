Reacting to Virat Kohli's double century against Bangladesh on Friday, a user tweeted, "Like SRT, Dravid, Kumble before him - Kohli has become less a cricketer. And, more a role model for what an Indian can achieve with work." Former English cricketer Michael Vaughan tweeted, "I see that bloke from another planet is at it again ..... #Freak @imVkohli."
