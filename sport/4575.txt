Kapil Malhotra, Indian cricket team's manager during the Champions Trophy, has reported no incident of discord between captain Virat Kohli and former coach Anil Kumble. BCCI had specifically asked Malhotra to report any incident which may have affected the dressing room environment. BCCI has now sought reports from Anil Patel, who was the administrative manager during India's home Test season.
