International Cricket Council (ICC) has denied media reports that Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar has been withdrawn from England series in India starting next month due to security reasons. "Two things - a person can only be withdrawn if he had been appointed first... Secondly, and more importantly, Dar had been named for the Australia-South Africa series", an ICC spokesperson said.
