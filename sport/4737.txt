The World Taekwondo Federation has changed its name to World Taekwondo after its acronym 'WTF' was found to have "negative connotations". "In the digital age, the acronym of our federation has developed negative connotations unrelated to our organisation and so it was important that we rebranded to better engage with our fans," the organisation's head said.
