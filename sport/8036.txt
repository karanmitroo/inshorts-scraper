Sumo wrestler Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to be titled 'yokozuna', the sport's grand champion, in almost 18 years. The 30-year-old, who weighs 178 kilograms, became the sport's 72nd yokozuna and Japan's first after Wakanohana, who won the title in 1998. The sport had seen foreign sumo wrestlers getting crowned grand champions for the past few years.
