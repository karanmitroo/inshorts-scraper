Indian captain Virat Kohli was surprised after smashing a six over the long-on boundary into the stands' second tier, during the first T20I against New Zealand in Delhi on Wednesday. Kohli, who was facing New Zealand pacer Colin de Grandhomme, went towards non-striker Rohit Sharma after hitting the six and smiled, muttering something to his batting partner.
