World number two badminton player Lee Chong Wei has denied featuring in a sex video which is being widely circulated. The Malaysian said that the video was an attempt to slander, malign and defame his good name and character, and urged social media users to stop circulating it. This comes ahead of next month's premiere of a biopic on him.
