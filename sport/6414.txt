An unexploded bomb from World War II was found in River Thames on Saturday, ahead of the annual Oxford-Cambridge boat races to be held in London on Sunday. The device was spotted near a bridge by a bystander, who then informed the police. The races remain doubtful, with the bomb still submerged in the water.
