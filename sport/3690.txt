Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo called his five-match ban a "persecution" and said that the ban is "exaggerated and ridiculous". Ronaldo received the ban after reacting to his red card against Barcelona by pushing the referee, and his appeal to overturn the ban was turned down later. "Impossible to be immune to this situation, 5 games!" he wrote on Instagram.
