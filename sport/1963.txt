Former Indian opener and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar said that batsmen should be allowed to take help from the dressing room when in doubt over a Decision Review System (DRS) review. "A fielding side has 11 players and they can have a word with each other before going for a review. Rules should be fair for both teams", Manjrekar added.
