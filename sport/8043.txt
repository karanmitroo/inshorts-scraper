South African spinner Imran Tahir was reprimanded by the ICC on Wednesday for displaying a 'personal message' on his jersey during a T20I against Sri Lanka in Johannesburg on Sunday. Tahir had displayed late Islamic preacher Junaid Jamshed's image on a t-shirt worn under his jersey during a wicket celebration. Jamshed had died in a plane crash last month.
