The English Football Association (FA) has charged former FC Barcelona and current Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola for promoting political messages by wearing a yellow ribbon in support of Catalan independence. Guardiola, who was born in Catalonia, has been sporting the ribbon since October when a banned independence referendum was held in the region and two key activists were imprisoned.
