Australia and South Africa played the shortest-ever completed Test that got over in 5 hours and 53 minutes, on February 15, 1932. Interestingly, the match was spread over three playing days due to bad weather. As South Africa were dismissed for 36 and 45, the match saw the lowest aggregate in history for a complete Test with 234 runs scored.
