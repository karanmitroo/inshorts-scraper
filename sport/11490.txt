USA’s Olympic gold-winning gymnast Simone Biles has said in a statement that she got Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE) for certain drugs because she is suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A hacker attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s database has revealed certain US athletes, including Biles and Serena and Venus Williams, had been given TUEs for otherwise banned substances.
