Indian Test captain Virat Kohli remained not-out on 151 after surviving a DRS review on the opening day of the second Test against England on Thursday. Kohli tried to play a reverse sweep off Moeen Ali on the last ball of the 80th over. The ball struck Kohli on the pad, but the umpire stayed with his original not-out decision.
