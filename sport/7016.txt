Chhattisgarh captain Mohammad Kaif staged a walkout along with his team during a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Karnataka to protest an umpiring decision. Chattisgarh had appealed for a catch which the umpire had denied and even refused a TV referral, at which the team showed dissent. Kaif was given a warning and fined a part of his match fee.
