Masseuse Leanne Russell claimed in a court that she cried uncontrollably after Windies cricketer Chris Gayle pulled his towel to expose himself to her during the 2015 World Cup in Australia. Russell said Gayle asked her what she was looking for, to which she said, "A towel", following which Gayle removed the towel and said, "Are you looking for this?"
