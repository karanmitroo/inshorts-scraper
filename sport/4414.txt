Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar's first-ever Test runs were actually leg byes, which were wrongly awarded to him. Gavaskar, who made his Test debut against West Indies in 1971, revealed in his autobiography that the leg byes awarded to him made him get rid of his nervousness. He went on to score 65 runs in his debut innings.
