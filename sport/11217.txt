The Supreme Court on Wednesday slammed the BCCI for not complying with its directives as per Lodha Panel recommendations. “We know how to get our orders implemented. BCCI thinks it is the lord. You better fall in line or we will make you fall in line,” the Court said. The SC gave BCCI until October 6 to explain its non-compliance.
