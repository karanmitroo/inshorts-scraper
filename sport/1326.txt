The Indian cricket team celebrated Christmas Eve wearing Santa Claus hats after finishing 2017 with their 37th victory in international cricket, the second most in a calendar year behind Australia's 38 international wins in 2003. Team members, including MS Dhoni, later posed and took pictures with the trophy and with each other wearing the Santa Claus hats.
