Sri Lankan Test captain Dinesh Chandimal has suggested that Sri Lanka whitewashed Pakistan in the Test series because of witchcraft. Chandimal added that he had received a special blessing from a 'meyni' (sorcerer) ahead of the series. His comments come a week after Sri Lanka's Sports Minister denied ordering him to use witchcraft ahead of the Test series.
