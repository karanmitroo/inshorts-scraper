National Sports Day in India is celebrated on August 29 to mark hockey legend Dhyan Chand's birthday. Dhyan Chand, considered the greatest player in hockey, played a key role in India's three consecutive Olympic triumphs in 1928, 1932 and 1936. Notably, the government gives away awards such as Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, Arjuna and Dronacharya Awards on this day.
