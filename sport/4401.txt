Vijay Mallya has quit as Indian motorsport's representative in the world body FIA after intervention from the sports ministry. The ministry sent a directive to Federation of Motor Sports Club of India, after which Mallya resigned ahead of FIA's World Motor Sport Council's last meeting. FMSCI can now only nominate a new representative to the world body in December.
