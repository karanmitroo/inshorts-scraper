Former Indian cricketer and nominated Rajya Sabha member Sachin Tendulkar had raised a question in the House in 2016 about constructing additional bridges at high-density stations including at Elphinstone, where a stampede recently killed 23 people. In 2015, Tendulkar had also asked about the first-aid and ambulance provisions for the critically injured at railway stations.
