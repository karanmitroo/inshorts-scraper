Multiple-division world champion Philippines' Manny Pacquiao and Britain's Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan have agreed to fight in a bout, which is scheduled to be held on April 23. Khan is likely to drop to welterweight to fight Pacquiao for the World Boxing Organisation title. Pacquiao won the WBO welterweight title last November against American Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas.
