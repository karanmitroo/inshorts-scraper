Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal mocked teammate Kedar Jadhav's bowling action after the latter shared a picture of himself bowling in the first India-South Africa ODI. Jadhav wrote, "Rolled my arm over in our win... I love bowling in the middle overs," to which Chahal replied, "Rolled your arm under not over Kedar bhaiyaaaa. Let's keep this momentum going."
