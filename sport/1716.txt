English all-rounder Ben Stokes played his first match since the nightclub brawl incident in Bristol in September. The all-rounder debuted for Canterbury in New Zealand's 50-over Ford Trophy on Sunday. A video had emerged in September showing Stokes punching a man outside a pub in Bristol, following which he was provisionally suspended, effectively becoming unavailable for the ongoing Ashes.
