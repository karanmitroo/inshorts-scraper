Alex Blackwell, captain-keeper of Sydney Thunder in the Women's Big Bash League, asked the umpire to not declare Sydney Sixers' Sara McGlashan out, after she collided with the latter while stumping her. McGlashan had failed to turn back into the crease after the collision when Blackwell was stumping her. However, Blackwell signalled to the umpire to not give her out.
