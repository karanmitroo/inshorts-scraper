Former captain Imran Khan has opposed Pakistan's decision to host the Pakistan Super League (PSL) final in Lahore, stating that hosting it in 'curfew like situation' would dampen Pakistan's image. Khan added that international cricket would only resume in the country if the government overcomes terrorism and deteriorating law and order situation instead of making 'cosmetic security arrangements'.
