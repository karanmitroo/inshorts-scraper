Swiss tennis star Roger Federer lost a point through unforced error after his opponent Jack Sock turned his back to show Federer his behind after lobbing his shot, at the ATP World Tour Finals' first round. "It was a big distraction...because it was very big... That's what I should have aimed for", Federer jokingly said after winning the match.
