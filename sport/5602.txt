World number one Andy Murray has claimed that the recent wildcards given to Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova are a result of media coverage. "I do think the tournaments are going to do what they think is going to sell the most tickets," said Murray. Sharapova, currently ranked 258, was given a wildcard at the recent Stuttgart and Madrid Opens.
