Danish F1 driver Kevin Magnussen has refused to apologise for obscene comments made to driver Nico Hulkenberg after the Hungarian Grand Prix. Hulkenberg had interrupted a live Magnussen interview and called him "the most unsporting driver," to which Magnussen replied, "Suck my b***s." "I'm not here to please anyone. I'm here to get results," said the Dane, refusing to apologise.
