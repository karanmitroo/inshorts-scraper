Former boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather has claimed that he is ready to come out of retirement and fight UFC champion, Conor McGregor, only if he is assured a payment of $100 million (₹680 crore). If the fight goes ahead, McGregor would be paid a career-high amount of $15 million (₹102 crore), in addition to a slice of pay-per-view revenue.
