Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella has been fined by the ICC for attempting to stump Zimbabwe's Solomon Mire after waiting for an unusually long time. The incident occurred in the seventh over of Zimbabwe's record run chase. Following a wide bowl, Dickwella waited with the bowl for extended period and dislodged the bails at the first instance of Mire's movement.
