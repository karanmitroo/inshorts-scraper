Bangladesh's first-innings total of 595/8d became the highest ever total in a losing cause, as they suffered a seven-wicket loss against New Zealand on Monday. Resuming the day at 66/3, the visitors were bundled out for 160 following which Kane Williamson's unbeaten 104(90) helped the Kiwis chase down 217 in under 40 overs to complete a come-from-behind win.
