Cereal company Kellogg's sued Australian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis over his right to use his 'Special K' nickname commercially. Kellogg's wants to stop the 21-year-old from using the term Special K as part of a branding campaign that would include clothing and tennis wear. The company's Australian trademark for Special K dates back 59 years.
