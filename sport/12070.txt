Singapore's 21-year-old swimmer Joseph Schooling won his nation's first ever Olympic gold medal with victory in the 100m butterfly, denying Michael Phelps his 23rd Olympic gold medal. Phelps was one of three men to finish joint second. "I hope that Michael can stay around long enough for me to race him again. I'd love that", Schooling said after the victory.
