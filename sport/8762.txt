Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle termed BCCI President Anurag Thakur's removal by Supreme Court as a "revolution". Bhogle tweeted, "This is a revolution the kind of which I haven't seen in all the years I have followed Indian cricket. Await the calm beyond the storm." Bhogle further suggested that the appointment of new administrators should be carried out with great care.
