India's assistant coach Sanjay Bangar has said that one should not read too much into Virat Kohli's failures with the bat in the opening two Tests against Australia as he has performed well prior to the series. "Virat's mindset is that he will learn from failures. This is his greatness. In the coming matches, he will perform well," added Bangar.
