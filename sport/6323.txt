A group of Kashmiri local cricketers was detained on Wednesday after a video clip surfaced on social media, showing them wearing the Pakistani team's jersey with the neighbouring country's national anthem being played in the background. According to reports, the video was from a cricket match between two teams, one representing Pakistan and the other India.
