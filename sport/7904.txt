Spinner Ravichandran Ashwin trolled a fan on Twitter, who had asked him to learn bowling from English all-rounder Moeen Ali. The follower wrote, "@ashwinravi99 are you watching @MoeenAli bowl, learn something as you are anyway not playing." Ashwin replied he deliberately tuned in later when Ali had finished his spell. Ashwin has been rested for the T20I series against England.
