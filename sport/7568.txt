Indian cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara feels that Ravichandran Ashwin "thinks like a batsman", which makes him such a dangerous bowler. "The kind of brain he has, he thinks as a batsman, what are his weaknesses and areas he needs to bowl. I think it's his experience that makes him one of the strike bowlers in this team," Pujara said.
