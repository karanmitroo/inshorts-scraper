Belgium's Paralympic athlete Marieke Vervoort, who had earlier claimed to be considering euthanasia after her final Paralympics appearance at the Rio Games, said that she is not yet ready for euthanasia. "Now my fear of death is gone," said Vervoort, who won silver in the T52 400-metre wheelchair race event at the Rio Paralympics on Saturday.
