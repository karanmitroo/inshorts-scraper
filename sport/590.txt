Eighteen-year-old Prithvi Shaw led India to their record fourth ICC Under-19 World Cup title on Saturday. India had won their first Under-19 World Cup in 2000 under Mohammad Kaif's leadership before India's current senior team captain Virat Kohli led the Under-19 team to victory in 2008. India's third Under-19 World Cup triumph had come in 2012 under Unmukt Chand's captaincy.
