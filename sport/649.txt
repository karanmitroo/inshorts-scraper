Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli is the only player to be associated with the same franchise for 11 years. Harbhajan, who represented Mumbai Indians for 10 years, was bought by Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 IPL auction, making Kohli the only player to be with one franchise throughout. Kohli was retained by RCB before the auction.
