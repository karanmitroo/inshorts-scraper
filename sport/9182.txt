The pool deck at Brisbane's Gabba cricket ground was inaugurated on the first day of Australia's day-night Test against Pakistan on Thursday. According to Cricket Australia, the 32,000-litre infinity pool is a first-of-its-kind in cricket and equally accessible to everyone. Spectators dressed in beach attire will be picked at random and allowed to spend over three hours at the deck.
