Liverpool, who had beaten Arsenal 4-0 in their previous match, lost 0-5 against Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday. Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero scored his 124th goal, overtaking Dwight Yorke's tally of 123 goals to become the top-scoring non-European player in Premier League history. This was the joint-biggest margin of defeat for Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.
