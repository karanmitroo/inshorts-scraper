Former Australian fast bowler Rodney Hogg has said that legendary batsman Sir Donald Bradman would not have been as successful now as he was in his playing days. "I don't think Sir Donald Bradman in this current era would've averaged anywhere near 99.94... it was easier to bat between 1920 and 1950, than what it is now," added Hogg.
