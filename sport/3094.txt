Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar took to Twitter to congratulate former captain MS Dhoni on scoring his 100th half-century in international cricket, against Australia on Sunday. "Yet another 100 for @msdhoni! This time in front of the stumps! Congratulations on a century of 50s Mahi," Tendulkar tweeted. Notably, Dhoni had become the first player with 100 ODI stumpings earlier this month.
