A chess player banned from the Iranian national women's team for not wearing a hijab in an international competition has reportedly joined the US team. Dorsa Derakhshani had refused to wear the hijab during a competition in Gibraltar in February. In the same competition, Dorsa's brother Borna Derakhshani, also a chess player, competed against an Israeli and was consequently banned.
