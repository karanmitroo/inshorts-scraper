World number two tennis player Roger Federer donned a traditional Scottish skirt (kilt) during an exhibition match against Andy Murray in Glasgow on Tuesday. A fan had given the kilt in the second set to Federer, who took a few shots wearing it and signed it before returning it to her. Federer went on to win the match 6-3, 3-6(10-6).
