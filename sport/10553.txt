The Lodha Committee sent a letter to BCCI stating the Board cannot go ahead with the IPL media rights bidding scheduled for Tuesday, till they "unreservedly comply" with the Supreme Court. The order in question fixes a ceiling over which BCCI cannot enter into contracts. Eighteen bidders were contesting for the rights which were expected to sell for $4 billion.
