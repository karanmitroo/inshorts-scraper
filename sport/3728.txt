MSK Prasad, Indian cricket team's selection committee chief, has said MS Dhoni is not an automatic choice for selection. "If he is delivering, why not? If he is not, we will have to look at alternatives," he added. Prasad further compared Dhoni to former tennis player Andre Agassi, saying, "Agassi's real career only started after the age of 30."
