West Indies' Dwayne Bravo has lashed out at the West Indies Cricket Board, for its decision to sack the team's former coach, Phil Simmons. "It's very difficult for a bunch of guysâ€¦to go play when on the day of travelling, they find out their head coach was fired. Which organisation in the world would do things like that?" said Bravo.
