Virender Sehwag, who is commentating at the India-England Test in Rajkot, revealed that his opening partner Gautam Gambhir would make him eat the same food for days as a superstition. According to Sehwag, Gambhir would follow the superstition on overseas trips if he'd scored in nineties eating a certain food. "Main pakh gaya (I was sick of it)", he added.
