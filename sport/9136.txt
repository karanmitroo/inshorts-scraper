Former Indian hockey goalkeeper Romeo James has said that Indian limited-overs wicketkeeper MS Dhoni's style of keeping is quite inspirational even for the young hockey goalkeepers in India. James said that though hockey has changed a lot but goalkeeping still remains an exciting art. "Courage, agility...hockey sense has to be there to be a good goalkeeper," he added.
