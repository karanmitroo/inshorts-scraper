Former Indian cricketer Rahul Dravid was nicknamed 'The Wall' during his career. He once revealed that this nickname of his came from a newspaper headline after one of his "long, typically maybe boring innings". "I think someone really clever in a newspaper office somewhere sitting there decided you know this is a good one for the future," said Dravid.
