The England one-day team's two warm-up matches in Mumbai may face logistic problems after BCCI's reluctance to cooperate in organising the matches, according to reports. BCCI will reportedly not agree to the Mumbai Police's demand for â‚¹60 lakh as security cover for the two games, meaning the games could be played in front of empty stands at the Brabourne Stadium.
