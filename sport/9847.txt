During an NCAA Division I American football match between Memphis Tigers and Cincinnati Bearcats, a person dressed entirely in a Batman costume successfully kicked a 30-yard field goal during a break in the official play. While the backstory of the incident was not clear, it was believed to be some sort of a TV timeout promo.
