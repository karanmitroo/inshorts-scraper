Barcelona forward Lionel Messi dedicated his goal against Sevilla in the La Liga on Wednesday to cancer-struck children through a new celebration. Messi pointed two fingers to his right cheek, referring to a two-fingered mark which represents a cancer movement in Spain called Para los valientes (For The Brave). Messi is helping raise funds for a cancer hospital in Barcelona.
