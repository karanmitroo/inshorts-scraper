Expressing concern over the future of Test cricket, former England captain Kevin Pietersen tweeted, "Poor crowd for Boxing Day Test match. Poor crowd at GABBA for today's ODI. FULL HOUSES at BBL games. Where will cricket be in 5yrs?" Notably, the Melbourne derby at the MCG on New Year's Day saw record crowds for the Big Bash League.
