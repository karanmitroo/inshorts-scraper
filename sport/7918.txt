The Great Khali has revealed in his autobiography he could not afford school and a ₹5 daily salary seemed like a "jackpot". "The principal would accost me for not paying my school fees...my schooling ended...I heard of a job with a ₹5 salary daily...we didn't even have ₹2.50 for fees," wrote Khali adding he wasn't allowed to take that job.
