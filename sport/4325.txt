Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor has said he's "half black below the waist", in response to his alleged racist comments at opponent Floyd Mayweather. During their press meet in New York, McGregor gyrated his hips in a tribute to his "black female fans". McGregor had said "dance for me, boy" to Mayweather in their earlier face-off in Los Angeles.
