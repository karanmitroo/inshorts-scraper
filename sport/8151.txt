English author Jeffrey Archer criticised the Cuttack crowd for not applauding Eoin Morgan's century, tweeting, "I have stood & applauded at Lord's for Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman and Shastri." The author was trolled for his post, with a user tweeting, "But Sachin and Laxman don't have a century at Lord's. Thank you for standing up and applauding Ajit Agarkar, sir."
