A Sikh man has alleged that he was asked by authorities to leave an overnight Wimbledon queue because he was making people “uncomfortable”. The revelation has been made through a Facebook post, in which the man claims he’s a victim of “post-Brexit racism”. Wimbledon authorities confirmed the incident, but added that the man was warned on six different occasions earlier.
