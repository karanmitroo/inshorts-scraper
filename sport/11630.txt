Ex-Australian captain Ricky Ponting said the 2001 India Test series was the most “remarkable” he’s played in. "We lost the series but the level of cricket that was played and the intensity...unbelievable. It wasn't our proudest moment, but certainly one of Indian cricket’s proudest,” said Ponting. India won the series 2-1, with VVS Laxman scoring 281 in the second Test.
