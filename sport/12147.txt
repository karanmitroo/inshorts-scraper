French midfielder Paul Pogba on Tuesday became the most expensive footballer after Manchester United agreed to sign him from Juventus for a world record fee of around $116 million (approximately ₹777 crore). Interestingly, Juventus had signed Pogba from Manchester United for free four years ago. The transfer fee eclipsed $112 million paid by Real Madrid for Gareth Bale in 2013.
