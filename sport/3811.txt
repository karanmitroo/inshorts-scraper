NBA champion Kevin Durant, talking about his visit to India, said the country is 20 years behind in terms of knowledge and experience. "You see cows in the street, monkeys running around everywhere, hundreds of people on side of road," he added. Durant further said that he thought India would be like Dubai, but returned home with a 'culture shock'.
