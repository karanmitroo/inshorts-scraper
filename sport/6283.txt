ABVP students from Jammu University allegedly halted an inter-university football match in Jammu on Friday and played the national anthem. The activists reportedly disrupted the game alleging that two students had disrespected the national anthem during the tournament's inaugural ceremony on April 3. The activists later also stalled the volleyball and basketball finals, which had to be postponed.
