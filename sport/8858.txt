There have been only two instances in first-class cricket when a team managed to score over 1,000 runs in a single innings. Australian domestic side Victoria made a record total of 1,059 in 1923 and bettered its own record when it got all-out for 1,107 on December 28, 1926. Notably, both the timeless matches were played at Australia's MCG.
