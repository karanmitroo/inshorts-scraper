Italian football club AS Roma honoured recently retired club legend Francesco Totti, who spent 24 years at the club as a player, by launching his number 10 shirt into space. The rocket 'Vega' carrying the shirt, which Totti wore in his final game against Genoa on May 28, was launched from French Guyana on Tuesday night.
