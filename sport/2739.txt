Brazilian footballer Neymar Jr reportedly asked European football's governing body UEFA to expel his former club Barcelona from the Champions League after they failed to honour his Â£23-million loyalty bonus. The governing body rejected Neymar's request. Barcelona had declined the payment as Neymar was negotiating with other clubs before the payment was due.
