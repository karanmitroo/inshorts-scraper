Ravichandran Ashwin has termed Steve Smith's DRS controversy as an "under-10" approach. "He actually turned back and asked the dressing room if he could take a review. That is completely unheard of...Last I thought that to happen was in an under-10 game, when my coach used to suggest where point fielders and cover fielders used to stand," said Ashwin.
