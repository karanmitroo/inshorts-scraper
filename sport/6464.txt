Sachin Tendulkar has said he feels other countries are envious of the Indian cricket team because of its bench strength. "When we have the full strength, it is a good problem...Whom to leave out? That means your bench strength is really strong. That is how champion teams are...Everyone is watching us the way we have played," said Tendulkar.
