The Andhra Pradesh Assembly on Tuesday passed an amendment to its public services law to appoint Olympics silver medal-winning shuttler PV Sindhu as a Group-1 officer in the government. Certain provisions in the law had earlier prevented Sindhu's appointment as any recruitment in public service should be made through the state Public Service Commission, selection committee, or employment exchange.
