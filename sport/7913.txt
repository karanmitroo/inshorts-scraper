Switzerland's Roger Federer praised his wife Mirka and called her his number one supporter following his 18th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open on Sunday. "She's been there when I had no titles and she's still here 89 titles later, so she had a big part to play in [the win]", said Federer after his win.
