The proposed fight between Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao and British-Pakistani boxer Amir Khan has been called off after a promised $38 million from an unnamed investment group failed to materialise. Pacquiao's manager Michael Koncz is in the process of delivering a revised proposal for a potential fight to the 38-year-old fighter, who wants to fight "as soon as possible".
