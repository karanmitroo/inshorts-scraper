After being adjudged out, Karachi Kings' Colin Ingram called for a review claiming the ball hit just his helmet before Quetta Gladiators' Rahat Ali caught it during a PSL match. Interestingly, the no-ball replay showed Ingram standing at the non-striker's end with Jofra Archer bowling a legitimate delivery. Further, the replays confirmed Ingram's glove had touched the ball.
