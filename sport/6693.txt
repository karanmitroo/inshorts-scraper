Australian pacer Mitchell Starc has said that he is looking forward to bowl to Ravichandran Ashwin in Australia and he might take Ashwin's advice and hit him on the badge. Starc was given a send-off by Ashwin during the second Test, with Ashwin tapping his forehead. It was in reply to Starc taunting Abhinav Mukund in the similar manner earlier.
