Indian cricketer Shardul Thakur has revealed college kids "googled" his picture to be sure it was him while he was travelling on a local train in Mumbai after getting off the flight from South Africa. "I could sense people in the compartment looking at me and wondering whether I really was Shardul Thakur," the 26-year old said.
