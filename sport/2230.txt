NBA side Phoenix Suns' Eric Bledsoe was handed a $10,000 fine and a provisional ban from the squad after he tweeted, "I don't wanna be here". Bledsoe later said that he was in a salon and the tweet was not directed at the franchise. The 27-year-old averaged 21.1 points, 6.3 assists and 4.8 rebounds in 66 games last season.
