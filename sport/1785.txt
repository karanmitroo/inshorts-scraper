Haryana government will reward six female boxers, who recently won gold and bronze medals in the World Youth Women Boxing Championship, with 'desi breed' cows. State agriculture minister OP Dhankar said the girls deserved something 'more unique' than monetary awards for making the state proud at a young age. Desi cow's milk makes people beautiful and sharpens minds, he added.
