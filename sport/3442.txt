Olympic champion Michael Phelps has jokingly challenged UFC champion Conor McGregor to a swimming race, days after the latter lost to Floyd Mayweather in the 'richest fight in history'. Phelps posted a picture on Twitter, which read, "Phelps vs McGregor" and asked if they both should race. Notably, McGregor had challenged Mayweather despite having no experience in professional boxing.
