Reacting to Roger Federer's rushed half-volley forehand winner from near his feet in Australian Open's final, Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, "Grace, power and agility. No one in the world could play that shot." Sachin, who is a self-confessed fan of the Swiss star, has attended Federer's Grand Slam matches several times in the past.
