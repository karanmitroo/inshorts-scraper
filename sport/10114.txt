Spanish club Barcelona has released a video of Argentine forward Lionel Messi's first goal for the club that came in a friendly against Palamos 12 years ago. The then 17-year-old scored the goal on July 20, 2004 after beating two defenders and attempting a low shot in the bottom right corner. Messi recently scored his 500th goal for Barcelona.
