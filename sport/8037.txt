A shark was photographed in a picture of a 10-year-old boy surfing in Australia on Tuesday. The boy's father noticed the shark while he was taking his son's picture and immediately whistled to call him back. Researchers said the shark was a juvenile great white about 2.5 metres long, which was trying to escape a collision with the board.
