During a Big Bash League match, Melbourne Renegades captain Aaron Finch leapt in the air to take a catch with his left hand and bobbled before completing it successfully on the second attempt. With the catch, Finch dismissed Sydney Sixers opener Jason Roy for five runs off 13 balls on the bowling of Dwayne Bravo.
