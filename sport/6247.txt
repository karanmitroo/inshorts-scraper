Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner stopped in the middle of a run to hand over Gujarat Lions' bowler Basil Thampi's shoe back to him in the IPL on Sunday. Thampi's shoe came off on his follow-through, while non-striker Warner took off for a run. Warner picked up the shoe and gave it to Thampi before completing the run.
