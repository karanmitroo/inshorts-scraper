South African batsman Hashim Amla's dismissal in the first Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday was the 10,000th LBW dismissal in Test cricket. Around 14.5% of all dismissals in Tests have been LBWs, meaning roughly one in seven dismissals is an lbw. The first batsman to get out LBW was England's George Ulyett, the 12th wicket in the first-ever Test.
