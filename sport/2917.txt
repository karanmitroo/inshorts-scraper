Indian all-rounder Axar Patel has revealed that it was due to his school principal that his name became 'Axar' from 'Akshar'. Axar said that the principal mistakenly wrote 'Axar' in his relieving certificate when he was applying for a passport. "All resulting documents, passport, driver's licence, had Axar. So, I decided to continue writing Axar not Akshar," the 23-year-old said.
