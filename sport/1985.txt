Brazil's Pel√© became the first man to score 1,000 goals in competitive football on November 19, 1969, after converting a penalty for Santos against Vasco da Gama at Rio's Maracana stadium. The match was stopped for 30 minutes as supporters invaded the pitch. Pele also made a speech appealing for better treatment of Brazil's poor children before the match restarted.
