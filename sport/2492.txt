Indian pacer Shardul Thakur, who was criticised for wearing Sachin Tendulkar's former jersey number 10 during his debut ODI series, has changed his number to 54. Thakur had revealed that he had chosen the number 10 jersey due to numerological reasons. Thakur, who sat out of the first ODI against New Zealand, was seen wearing the new jersey in warm-ups.
