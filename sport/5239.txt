Rising Pune Supergiant spinner Washington Sundar has revealed the reason behind having 555 as his jersey number. "I was born on 5th of October at 5:05 AM. So, I decided to go with 555 as my kit number," said Sundar. The bowler was called in as a replacement for R Ashwin, who missed the tournament due to a sports hernia.
