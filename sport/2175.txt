Defending Premier League champions Chelsea have banned celebrity hairstylist Ahmed Alsanawi from the club's training ground over image rights, after he was found taking selfies with footballers. Alsanawi has been accused of cashing in on players like Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Eden Hazard. Alsanawi promoted his business online using Chelsea players' photos and signed shirts, among other things.
