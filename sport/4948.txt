Pakistan defeated hosts England by 8 wickets on Wednesday to reach the final of the Champions Trophy tournament for the first time. Batting first, England hit only 15 boundaries, the least in a completed innings for them since the 2015 World Cup. Pakistan last played the final of an ICC ODI tournament 18 years ago, in the 1999 World Cup.
