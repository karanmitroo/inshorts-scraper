Australia's Nick Kyrgios confused a line umpire for a ballboy before throwing a towel at him. Kyrgios, facing Italy's Paolo Lorenzi at the Montreal Masters, wiped his sweat before throwing the towel towards the line umpire, who did not react. "Haha real talk, that's my bad. I was sweating so much," Kyrgios later tweeted about the incident.
