Talking about his sacking from the Indian Premier League's commentary team, Harsha Bhogle revealed that no one could look him in his face and tell him the reason behind his ouster. "It's been the biggest learning experience of my career. Offers started coming right away. Everyone thinks doors are shut, which is true... but windows are open," added Bhogle.
