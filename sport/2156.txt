South African apprentice jockey Dylan Caboche was suspended for two weeks for punching a horse in the ribs before a race in Australia. Caboche was trying to guide his mount, Reneldsagirl, into the stalls but was struggling and dismounted before hitting the horse. The jockey later apologised for his actions, calling them "unacceptable".
