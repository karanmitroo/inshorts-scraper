Muttiah Muralitharan is set to become the first Sri Lankan to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. Murali, the leading wicket-taker in both Tests and ODIs, is one of only two players with over 1,000 wickets in international cricket. England's George Lohmann and Australia's Arthur Morris will be inducted posthumously alongside former Australia Women's captain Karen Rolton.
