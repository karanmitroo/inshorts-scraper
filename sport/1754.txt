Former boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather, who is on a tour of China, has adopted a baby giant panda in Chengdu. The 40-year-old boxing star has named the giant panda 'TMT Floyd Mayweather'. The 100,000 yuan (around $15,000) adoption fee paid by Mayweather and his sponsor will go to the research centre where the panda lives.
