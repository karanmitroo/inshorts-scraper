Referring to the DRS controversy in the recently concluded India-Australia series, PM Narendra Modi said to his Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull that he is glad that the decisions taken between them are not subject to DRS review. "I hope your visit to India is as productive as it has been for Steven Smith's batting, the other Australian captain," added Modi.
