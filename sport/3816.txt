A softball team from Virginia was removed from the championship game of the Junior League World Series, an international tournament for girls aged 12-15, for posting an image to Snapchat of various players showing the middle finger. The team, whose gesture was intended for the Kirkland team, was replaced by the Kirkland side that lost the match 7-1 to Ohio.
