Sri Lanka Cricket has offered extra cash and clothes to temporary groundsmen, who were forced to strip and return their pants before being paid for their services at Hambantota stadium. Board chief Thilanga Sumathipala called the act "inhuman and slavery", saying an investigation was underway. The staff were among 100 locals hired for the final ODI against Zimbabwe on Monday.
