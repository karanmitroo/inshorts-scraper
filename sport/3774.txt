NBA champion Kevin Durant apologised for his '20 years behind' remark he made about India after his promotional visit to the nation last month. Durant said that he was grateful for the time he spent in India and accepted blame for how he had phrased his comments. "Just a bunch of underprivileged people there (in India)", Durant had said.
