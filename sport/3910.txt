Three-sided football is played between three teams instead of two on a hexagonal pitch with three goal posts. Contrary to regular football in which the team scoring maximum goals wins, the winner in three-sided football is the team conceding the least goals. The game was developed in 1960s, with the first three-sided football World Cup having been held in 2014.
