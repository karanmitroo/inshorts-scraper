Defending champions Real Madrid entered their 15th European final, defeating Atlético Madrid 4-2 on aggregate in the UEFA Champions League semi-final on Wednesday. Atlético's 2-1 win in the second leg was not sufficient, following their 3-0 defeat by Real in the first leg last week. Real will now face Italian champions Juventus in the final in Cardiff on June 3.
