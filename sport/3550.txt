MS Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar set the record for India's highest eighth wicket partnership in ODIs, after sharing an unbeaten 100-run stand against Sri Lanka on Thursday. The partnership is also the highest stand for the eighth-wicket in a successful ODI chase. The highest-ever eighth-wicket ODI partnership is 138* runs by South Africa's Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall.
