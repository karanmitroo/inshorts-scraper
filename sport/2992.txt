Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni visited the India Cements' office in Chennai after the first ODI and met Chennai Super Kings owner N Srinivasan. The visit comes ahead of CSK's return to IPL next year, after serving a two-year suspension due to its owners' alleged involvement in 2013 IPL spot-fixing scam. The company termed the visit an "official" one.
