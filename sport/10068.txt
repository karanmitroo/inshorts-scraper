VVS Laxman was the last Indian to be out hit wicket in Tests, before Virat Kohli was dismissed similarly against England at Rajkot on Saturday. Laxman, playing against West Indies in 2002, stepped onto his stumps while tackling a Mervyn Dillon delivery after scoring a century. Kohli's wicket is the 22nd instance of an Indian being hit wicket in Tests.
