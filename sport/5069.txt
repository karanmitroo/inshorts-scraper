Saudi Arabia's football team continued their warm-up while the Australian team and spectators observed a two-minute silence for the London terror attack victims, before a World Cup qualifier between the countries. The Australian team lined up in the middle of the pitch, while the Saudi players and their supporters refrained from participating. They were later booed by the home supporters.
