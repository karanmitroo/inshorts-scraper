For the first time, BCCI's anti-corruption unit has restricted cricketers from meeting outsiders in private during the two IPL matches on May 10 and 13 in Kanpur. Players will only be allowed to interact with outsiders in the presence of the hotel manager in the lobby. Additionally, phone records of players and franchise owners would be checked daily.
