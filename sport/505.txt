Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath, who turns 48 today, once dismissed Sachin Tendulkar LBW for zero after the ball hit his shoulder in front of the stumps. The dismissal happened in 1999 Adelaide Test when Tendulkar tried to duck an intended short ball which didn't bounce as much as he expected. The dismissal led many to term it 'shoulder-before-wicket'.
