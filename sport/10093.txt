Mexican Formula One driver Sergio Perez, who drives for Force India, has ended his sponsorship contract with sunglasses company Hawkers after they posted an anti-Mexico tweet. The company tweeted that Mexicans should buy a pair of shades to hide their tears when President-elect Donald Trump's border wall is constructed. Hawkers deleted the tweet, with the CEO apologising through a video.
