Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic and wife Jelena welcomed their second child, a baby girl, on Saturday. The couple, who already have a 2-year-old son named Stefan, have named the newborn girl Tara. Notably, the 30-year-old former world number one had announced in July that he would miss the remainder of the season due to an elbow injury.
