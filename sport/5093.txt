Former MMA fighter Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, who changed his name to War Machine, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and assaulting his porn star ex-girlfriend, Christy Mack. Koppenhaver assaulted Mack in 2014 and left her with a broken nose, missing teeth, fractured eye socket, and a lacerated liver. "[S]hould have killed myself by now," Koppenhaver said in court.
