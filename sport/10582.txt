Indian Test captain Virat Kohli tried imitating pacer Jasprit Bumrah's bowling action during India's practise session before the last ODI against New Zealand in Mohali. Indian limited overs captain MS Dhoni was also seen practising his bowling during the session. Bumrah's sling-arm action is considered by many to be an unconventional action.
