Responding to the tweets by Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna, Indian tennis star Leander Paes said that a "few underachievers" are always trying to tarnish his hard-earned reputation. "There are some competitors out there, who are highly jealous of what I have achieved," added Paes. Paes also said that he could not care less about people who "bark" about him.
