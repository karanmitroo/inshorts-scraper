Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has said that Indian captain Virat Kohli cannot be another MS Dhoni, as both of them are "totally different kind of characters, [with] totally different personalities". Rhodes also compared Indian opener Rohit Sharma's on-field demeanour to South African great Jacques Kallis. "Remember Jacques Kallis...didn't look like a guy who was trying", Rhodes said.
