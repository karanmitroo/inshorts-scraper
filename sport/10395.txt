Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir was involved in a "comical" run-out, in which he hit West Indies' Devendra Bishoo towards the long-on boundary and admired his shot, expecting it to be a six. Meanwhile, fielder Roston Chase caught the ball and threw it back into play after which Amir realised and ran towards the non-strike but failed to avoid the run-out.
