Kings XI Punjab pacer Sandeep Sharma was fined 50% of his match fee for showing dissent and snatching away his cap from the umpire during the IPL clash against Gujarat Lions on Sunday. Sandeep was unhappy with the umpire calling a no ball on the grounds that the bowler did not notify him that he was bowling round the wicket.
