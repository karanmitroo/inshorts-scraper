England's Jim Laker is the only bowler to claim 19 of the 20 wickets on offer in a Test, achieving the feat in the 1956 Ashes Test at Manchester. The spinner had dismissed the entire Australian line-up in an innings earlier that season as well, while representing Surrey in a tour match. Notably, today is Laker's 96th birth anniversary.
