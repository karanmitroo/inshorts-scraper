Virat Kohli on Saturday received the ICC Test Championship mace on behalf of Team India for the second consecutive year for being the number one Test team. India, who have been at the top since October 2016, retained the mace after winning the third Test against South Africa last month. India will also receive a cash award of $1 million.
