Former Windies' pacer Tino Best took to Twitter to troll England batsman Alex Hales over a pull shot he played during the England-Windies ODI on Tuesday. Best said he would have liked to bowl to Hales at the speed of 90+ mph back when he was playing. Hales reminded Best he had faced the pacer in 2010 at his "peak".
