Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not eligible to vote or contest elections in his home state's cricket association. Jharkhand State Cricket Association has made Dhoni only an honorary member, who cannot participate in the association's decision-making. Several bureaucrats, lawyers, and even bodyguards of the elite in Ranchi have been appointed as permanent members in the association.
