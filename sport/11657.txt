Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has invited 16-year-old Nepalese spinner Sandeep Lamichhane to represent Sydney-based club Western Suburbs and train at his academy in Australia this season. Clarke and Lamichhane played for the same side in a T20 tournament in Hong Kong this year. Lamichhane was the second highest wicket-taker at the U-19 World Cup in Bangladesh this year.
