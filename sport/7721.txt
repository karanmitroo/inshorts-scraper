Team India coach Anil Kumble, who is only the second bowler to take 10 Test wickets in an innings, has said he never thought he would be able to achieve the feat. "It can happen tomorrow...or it may not happen at all...I don't think anybody gave me a chance of picking up ten wickets. It's very rare," said Kumble.
