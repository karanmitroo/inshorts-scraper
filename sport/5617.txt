The wicket's bails remained intact despite the middle stump getting uprooted during a domestic match in Australia on Saturday. After deliberation, umpires adjudged the batsman out despite cricket laws stating that a dismissal occurs if a bail is "completely removed" from the stumps. In this case however, the batsman was dismissed since the "stump was struck out of the ground".
