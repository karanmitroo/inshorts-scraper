Australia's Anthony Stuart took a hat-trick in his third ODI against Pakistan on January 16, 1997, becoming the second Australian to register an ODI hat-trick. Stuart dismissed Ijaz Ahmed, Mohammad Wasim and Moin Khan on consecutive deliveries, registering figures of 10-1-26-5. However, he was never selected again and thus became the first player with a hat-trick in his last ODI.
