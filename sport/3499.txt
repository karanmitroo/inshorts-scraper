The specially-created 'Money Belt' for the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor bout on Saturday features 3,360 diamonds, 600 sapphires, 160 emeralds and 1.5 kilograms of solid 24-karat gold. World Boxing Council President Mauricio Sulaiman refused to reveal the cost of the belt, saying it "costs a fortune" and involves "many, many, many hours of work of many artisans."
