Reacting to Mahendra Singh Dhoni becoming first wicketkeeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODIs, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, "Who said lightning doesn't strike twice? Today it did for the 100th time! Well done, @msdhoni! Keep them coming." Notably, MS Dhoni's first stumping in ODIs had come off Sachin Tendulkar's bowling against Bangladesh in 2004.
