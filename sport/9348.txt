Former Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath got out on the first ball he faced in international cricket, in his debut Test match in 1993. The pacer again bagged a first-ball dismissal, called a golden duck, in his debut ODI match on December 9, 1993, against South Africa. Interestingly, McGrath was dismissed for zero 49 times in his international career.
