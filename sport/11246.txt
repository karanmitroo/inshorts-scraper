In the last English County Championship match between Middlesex and Yorkshire, bad bowling was used as a tactic to force a result. The winner would be crowned champion but in case of a draw Somerset would've become champions. Yorkshire conceded almost 15 runs/over for a period to force a declaration. Following Middlesex's declaration, Yorkshire were dismissed with 4.4 overs remaining.
