Brazilian lower league forward Mirrai scored against Catanduvense, past their goalkeeper with a lob from the halfway line right after the kick-off. The player restored his side's lead just seconds after Renan had equalised for Catanduvense. Mirrai lobbed over the rival goalkeeper after his team-mate stepped over the ball as a diversion after the game's restart.
