Police in Jupiter, Florida, have released footage showing golfer Tiger Woods in an inebriated state during his arrest for Driving Under Influence earlier this week. Woods is seen taking a failed sobriety test, stumbling and swaying while walking on a line. He was found asleep in his Mercedes, which was parked at the roadside with the engine running.
