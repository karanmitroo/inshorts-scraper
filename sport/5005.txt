Jamaica's eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt competed for the final time on his home soil on Saturday, winning the 100-metre dash in 10.03 seconds in an event which was a tribute to him. Bolt, who plans to retire after London World Championships in August, ran on the same track where he launched his international career back in 2002.
