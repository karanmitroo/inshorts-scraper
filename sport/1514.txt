Following his record third ODI double ton, Rohit Sharma in an interview to Ravi Shastri said he relies on timing as he doesn't have "so much power" like MS Dhoni or Chris Gayle. On being asked which was his favourite double ton among the three, Rohit said, "It's so difficult to pick one because all three came at crucial points."
