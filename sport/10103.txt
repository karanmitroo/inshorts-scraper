The Sports Ministry on Friday warned National Sports Federations (NSFs) and the Indian Olympic Association to disclose details of their events, selection criteria and audited accounts on their websites by November 30, or face derecognition. The Ministry stated that only a few NSFs had fully complied with the directions as of now, while some did not even have a website.
