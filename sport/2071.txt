Virat Kohli stopped his batting session and attended a TV crew member who was hit by a Mohammed Shami delivery at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Kohli had missed Shami's delivery which went out of the nets and hit the crew member. Kohli called Indian team's physio to have a proper check of the injury, and resumed his training later.
