Virender Sehwag has said the Decision Review System should be renamed 'Dharmasena Review System', after umpire Kumar Dharmasena. Dharmasena sought the third umpire's referral a number of times during the ongoing Vizag Test between India and England, and was also forced to overturn his calls. Sehwag also added the umpire ruled Cheteshwar Pujara out in a 'dharamsankat'.
