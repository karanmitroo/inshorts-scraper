Swiss tennis player Roger Federer said his two-year-old twin boys and seven-year-old twin daughters were "super excited" to see his Australian Open trophy. "As I walked in (in the hotel) they woke up, so that was a weird moment. But it was so great because...I walked in with the trophy," said Federer, whose previous Grand Slam win came in 2012.
