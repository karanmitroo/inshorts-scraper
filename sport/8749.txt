There were several points of contention between the BCCI and Supreme Court-appointed Lodha panel, including the recommendation to cap office bearers' age to 70 years. Lodha panel also suggested one-state-one-vote policy for BCCI, which was opposed by the board due to multiple state cricket associations. Bringing BCCI under the RTI and banning commercials during live matches were also recommended.
