Former Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt shared a picture of his hamstring's X-ray, after he was accused of faking injury in his last-ever race at the World Championships. "I don't usually release my medical report to the public but sadly I have sat and listened to people questioning if I was really injured," wrote Bolt. He, however, deleted the posts later.
