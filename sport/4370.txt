Roger Federer registered a win in his 100th Wimbledon match to progress to his 12th Wimbledon semi-final. Federer, who swept past Canada's Milos Raonic in straight sets, has become the oldest man to reach the tournament's semifinals since 1974. The seven-time Wimbledon champion will now face Tomas Berdych, who reached the semis after Novak Djokovic retired due to an injury.
