Indian spinner Ravindra Jadeja clean bowled Pat Cummins after he turned the ball away from the middle and leg to hit the top of the off stump. Cummins had offered a forward defensive shot but he was deceived by the turn of the ball. Jadeja went on to take a five-wicket haul in the innings, his eighth in 45 innings.
