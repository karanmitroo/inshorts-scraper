Brazil's Neymar has become the world's most expensive footballer, with Paris Saint-Germain signing him for a five-year deal from Barcelona for a fee of ₹1,680 crore (€222 million). The 25-year-old, who scored 105 goals in 186 Barcelona appearances, will earn ₹6.5 crore-a-week before tax. His transfer fee is more than double that of Paul Pogba's record move to Manchester United.
