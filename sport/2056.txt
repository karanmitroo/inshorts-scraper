Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon announced his international retirement alongside two of his teammates after Italy failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1958. Apart from the inaugural edition in 1930 in which Italy didn't participate, this is only the second time that the four-time World Cup champions have failed to qualify for the tournament.
