Groundsman Chris Scott and his staff were awarded Man of the Match for their efforts to make play happen during a rain-affected Test match between New Zealand and South Africa, which ended on December 12, 2000. They had ensured that 190.5 overs of play were possible despite the first, third and fourth days' play being abandoned without a bowl bowled.
