Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah has credited Mumbai Indians teammate Lasith Malinga's influence for his ability to bowl yorkers in death overs consistently. "Malinga has been a great influence for me to bowl yorkers consistently. I used to bowl yorkers before as well but to bowl consistently you need practice so [Malinga] helped in that," Bumrah said.
