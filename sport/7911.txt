Former Indian cricketer VVS Laxman has called himself "a good boy who sledged people" on the field. "People have wrong perceptions about VVS Laxman. They feel that VVS Laxman has never sledged anyone and he was a good boy. VVS Laxman was a good boy who sledged people. The best kind of sledging is when no one knows," he said.
