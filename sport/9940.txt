Australia's Adam Voges suffered a concussion after being hit on the head by a bouncer from fast bowler Cameron Stevenson during a Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania in Perth on Thursday. The player lay on the ground for some time after the blow, before walking off the field and later being ruled out for the rest of the match.
