A Kabaddi match being played in the city of Faisalabad in Pakistan turned into a brawl, which saw players fighting each other. The conflict reportedly began with a brief scuffle between the players but soon the crowd also got involved in the act. The brawl forced the organisers to abandon the match a few minutes from its end.
