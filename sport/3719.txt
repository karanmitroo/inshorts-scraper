Former Pakistan cricket team captain Shahid Afridi took to Twitter to wish India on Independence Day. "Happy Independence Day India! No way to change neighbours, let's work towards peace, tolerance and love. Let humanity prevail. #HopeNotOut," read Afridi's tweet. Notably, Pakistan celebrated its Independence Day on August 14, a day before India's Independence Day.
