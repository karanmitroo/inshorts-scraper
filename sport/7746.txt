Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan hailed Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin and said that there exists no competition between them. Instead of a rivalry between the two players, Shakib said that their performances have more to do with the state of their teams. "The importance of a player differs from team to team", said Shakib.
