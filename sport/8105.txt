Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh will lead Punjab in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy domestic T20 tournament, which begins on January 29. Harbhajan had earlier taken a break from cricket following the birth of his daughter. He has led the Punjab team in the past, most recently in the Ranji game against Tamil Nadu in November last year.
