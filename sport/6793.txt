If a player is absent from the field for longer than eight minutes, ICC rules place restrictions on when he can come out to bat. The player, however, is free to come out to bat anytime if he picks up an external injury while participating in the match. Virat Kohli suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the first innings.
