Mumbai Indians' players smeared cake on captain Rohit Sharma's face as they celebrated his 30th birthday following Mumbai Indians' Super Over win against the Gujarat Lions on Saturday. MI managed to restrict GL to six runs after they required 12 off the super over. "Very good birthday present, great game of cricket," Sharma said in the post-match conference.
