Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has missed four out of his team's five Ranji Trophy matches this season as he is working on his fitness at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. Yuvraj is reportedly training in order to clear the Yo-Yo test, which has been made mandatory for Team India selection. BCCI officials have reportedly objected to Yuvraj's decision.
