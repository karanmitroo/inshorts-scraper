Australian pacer Mitchell Starc bowled a yorker, on the last ball of the 17th over of New Zealand innings, to get rid of Henry Nicholls in the final ODI at Melbourne. Nicholls tried to get his bat on the ball but the ball swung in late and rattled his leg stump. Starc took two more wickets helping Australia win.
