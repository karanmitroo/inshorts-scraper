Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt participated in his first-ever mixed-gender relay, leading the 'Bolt All-Stars' team in the inaugural Nitro Athletics event in Melbourne on Saturday. Bolt raced in the mixed 4x100 metre relay, alongside compatriot Asafa Powell and Americans Jenna Prandini and Jeneba Tarmoh. "I've never handed [a baton] over to a girl. For me that was exciting," said Bolt.
