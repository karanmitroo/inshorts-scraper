Sunrisers Hyderabad bowling coach Muttiah Muralitharan has said current Sri Lankan cricketers are "not capable enough" to play in the IPL. "Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England, there are a lot of good players there. The tournament can have 32 international players, our guys don't fit into it...We had great players but they all retired," said Muralitharan.
