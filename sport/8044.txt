Speaking about the sledging tactics employed by the Australian team, Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara said, "If they sledge...I remember we had a plan to sledge them when we last went to Australia. It will be tough for them when they come here." "All of us are motivated that we will continue the form of last year," Pujara added.
