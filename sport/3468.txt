Indian pacer Mohammed Shami shared a video of his two-year-old daughter Aairah dancing with Indian captain Virat Kohli. The video was reportedly shot after the Indian team took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka. Shami, who brought his family along to Sri Lanka, has been rested for the ongoing ODI series.
