Indian fast bowler Javagal Srinath deliberately bowled wide off the stumps to avoid taking a wicket when the Pakistan team had lost 9 wickets to leg-spinner Anil Kumble in the Delhi Test on February 7, 1999. Kumble, who ended with figures of 26.3-9-74-10, became only the second bowler in Test cricket history to take 10 wickets in an innings.
