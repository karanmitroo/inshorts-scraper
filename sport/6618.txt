Austrian world champion ski jumper Stefan Kraft entered the record books with his 253.5-metre ski jump during the 29th FIS Ski Jumping World Cup taking place in Vikersund, Norway. The 23-year-old landed the longest competitive ski jump for a male skier, beating the mark of 252 metres that Norway's Robert Johansson had set only hours earlier.
