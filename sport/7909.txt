Bengaluru Police has made it mandatory for people to give their Aadhaar card details to watch IPL matches in the city. People buying tickets at the stadium will have to undergo a biometric test before purchasing passes, while online buyers will be required to key in their Aadhaar number. Police said the move was "an important step to enhance security".
