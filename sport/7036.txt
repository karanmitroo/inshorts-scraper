Sourav Ganguly has said he did not feature in Ravi Shastri's list of most successful Indian captains since the latter did not see him play. Ganguly commented that in a Bengali talk show, in which he rated Shastri 7 out of 10 as a player. Shastri and Ganguly have been at loggerheads since the former's interview for the coach's post.
