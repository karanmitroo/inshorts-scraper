Brazilian football legend Ronaldinho featured in the first-ever video to reach one million views on YouTube. The video, an advert for a sportswear company, showed Ronaldinho trying new shoes before juggling a football and smashing the crossbar four times without letting the ball touch the ground. The video was uploaded four months after YouTube was founded in 2005.
