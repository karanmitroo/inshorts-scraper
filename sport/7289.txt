Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag claims that the Indian cricket team under the captaincy of Virat Kohli is the best ever and may win the series against Australia 3-0 or 3-1. "This team has been playing fantastic cricket. They have won eight of their last nine Tests and that is a great achievement," Sehwag said about the squad.
