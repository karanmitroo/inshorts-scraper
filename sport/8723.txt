Australian opener David Warner dedicated his century in the Sydney Test to his late former teammate Phillip Hughes. "I always think he's (Hughes) at the other end with me, so every time I score runs here or score a hundred, it's always for him," said Warner. Hughes died in 2014 after being hit by a bouncer at the same ground.
