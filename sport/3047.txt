Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag posted a video on his Twitter handle wishing Yuvraj on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of his six sixes in one over. Sehwag said after smashing six sixes off Stuart Broad, Yuvraj became the king of Kingsmead, the venue of the match. "[The knock] will remain etched in my heart forever," Sehwag further said.
