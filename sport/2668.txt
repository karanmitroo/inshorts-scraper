Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck for the first time in his T20I career, in his 52nd T20I match, against Australia on Tuesday. Kohli was caught and bowled by Australian pacer Jason Behrendorff, who is playing only his second T20I. Incidentally, Behrendorff had dismissed former Indian cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for their last professional career ducks.
