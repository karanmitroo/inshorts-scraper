Davinder Singh Kang has claimed that Athletics Federation of India (AFI) had asked him to drop out of the World Championships as he was facing doping charges. Kang said an AFI official told him that IAAF will test him and he will be banned. Notably, Kang became the first Indian javelin thrower to reach the final of IAAF World Championships.
