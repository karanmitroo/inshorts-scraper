Indian women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj is writing her autobiography, which will release in 2018. The book will provide "a candid and revealing look into her personal and sporting life", according to her publishers. Raj, who became the all-time highest run-scorer in women's ODIs in July this year, was named in BBC's 100 most influential women list in September.
