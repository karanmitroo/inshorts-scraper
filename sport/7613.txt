Former Australian spinner Shane Warne has said ex-English skipper Alastair Cook is "one of those guys you wouldn't mind your daughter marrying". Talking on Cook stepping down from captaincy, Warne said, "He's respected and he's gone about it with a lot of class. He went through some tough times when a lot of us, me included, thought he wasn't suited."
