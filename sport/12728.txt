The ICC has said that cricketers opting to wear helmets during international matches, must use headgear compliant with the new British Standard. The British Standard certified helmets have a smaller gap between the grille and the peak to prevent the ball from sneaking through and injuring the batsman. The decision was made during the 2016 ICC Annual Conference in Edinburgh.
