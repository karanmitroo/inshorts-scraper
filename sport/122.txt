World's most expensive footballer PSG's Neymar, who fractured his foot during a league match, will undergo a surgery in Brazil later this week. Neymar is expected to miss the remaining season as the recovery could take three months. The 26-year-old forward was stretchered off in tears with nearly 10 minutes remaining during PSG's 3-0 victory over Marseille on Sunday.
