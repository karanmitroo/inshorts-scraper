Sachin Tendulkar smashed five of his 42 centuries in India at Chennai's MA Chidambaram or Chepauk Stadium, the most for him at a single Indian stadium. Sachin's first-ever international hundred in India also came at Chepauk, when he hit 165(296) in a Test against England on February 12, 1993. Interestingly, Sachin hit all five centuries at the stadium in Tests.
