Wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has posted a picture of himself playing golf and claimed he missed the world record for the longest drive by 25 yards (22 metres). He claimed he hit a 490-yard long drive measured by "scientists holding the rulers". He added that he will "one fun day break the world record".
