Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur has suggested that the T20 format should be restricted to domestic franchises in order to maintain the relevance of ODI cricket. "I've never been a massive advocate of international Twenty20 cricket except a World Cup every two or three years," said Arthur. "International cricket belongs in the 50-over and Test cricket (formats) for me," added Arthur.
