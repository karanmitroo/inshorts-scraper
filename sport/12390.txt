Two-time Olympic medal-winning wrestler Sushil Kumar posted a picture on Instagram, after Rio-bound wrestler Narsingh Yadav's failed dope test result. The photo's caption read, "Respect should be earned not demanded". Earlier, Sushil had been denied a chance to represent India in the 74-kg freestyle wrestling at the Rio Olympics, after Yadav was granted the spot, based on quota qualification.
