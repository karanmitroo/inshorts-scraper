An argument broke out between England captain Mike Gatting and Pakistani umpire Shakoor Rana in Faisalabad on December 8, 1987, over field placements. The umpire refused to officiate in the match without a written apology from the English captain. The next day's play was canceled as umpires and Pakistan batsmen refused to take the field.
