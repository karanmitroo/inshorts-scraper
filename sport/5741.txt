Football governing body UEFA is set to test the new 'ABBA' format for penalty shootouts to reduce the psychological pressure on the second penalty taker. In the 'ABBA' system, team A takes the first kick and then team B takes two consecutive shots, followed by team A taking the next two kicks and so on.
