Former India hockey captain and Rajya Sabha MP Dilip Tirkey is getting an artificial hockey pitch laid in his village, Saunamara, in Odisha. Tirkey has generated ₹5 crore in funds, besides contributing ₹1 crore from his MP Local Area Development Scheme fund. Tirkey said he hoped the facility will discourage youngsters "from picking up guns" in the Maoist-infested region.
