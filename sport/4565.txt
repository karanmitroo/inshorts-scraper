MS Dhoni recorded the slowest ODI half-century by an Indian in the past 16 years, after reaching the half-century mark in 108 balls against Windies in the fourth ODI on Sunday. Dhoni's fifty included just one boundary which came in his innings' 103rd ball. The previous slowest ODI fifty for Dhoni came off 88 balls against Pakistan in 2013.
