Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has donated all the leftover food and drinks from his marriage to a charity based in his hometown, Rosario, in Argentina. Messi and his wife Antonella Roccuzzo, who got married on June 30, had also requested guests to donate to a South American non-profit organisation instead of buying them gifts. Over 260 guests attended Messi's wedding.
