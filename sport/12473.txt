Afghanistan cricketer Mohammad Nabi was reprimanded by ICC, for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during an ODI against Ireland on Sunday. Nabi falsely claimed he had stopped a four at the boundary and attempted a run-out, even though Irish opener Ed Joyce thought the boundary was legal and didn't attempt a run. Photographs later showed Nabi crossing the boundary.
