Former England captain Nasser Hussain has suggested a three-point plan to dismiss Indian captain Virat Kohli. The three-point strategy outlined by Hussain includes forcing Kohli to play shots on one side of the field. Hussain also advised the English players that they should work on Virat Kohli's ego and bowl bouncers to him to try dismissing him.
