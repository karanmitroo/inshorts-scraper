Lionel Messi missed a penalty as Barcelona's 29-match unbeaten run ended with a 0-1 loss against Espanyol in the Copa del Rey quarter-final first leg on Wednesday. Messi's spot-kick was saved by ex-Real Madrid shot-stopper Diego LÃ³pez in the 62nd minute before Oscar Melendo scored an 88th-minute winner. Barcelona had last lost a game in August last year.
