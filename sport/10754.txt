The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its order against the BCCI and asked the Board to give a time-frame within which the Lodha Panel recommendations would be implemented. BCCI President Anurag Thakur also submitted an affidavit in the Court on Monday, stating that he didn't seek ICC's intervention to block the reforms, on grounds that they amounted to "government interference".
