Sachin Tendulkar took to Twitter to share a video of cricketer-turned-commentator Mohammad Kaif's son Kabir facing a bowling machine, which displayed Tendulkar as the bowler. "Junior Kaif smashing it beautifully through the covers. Well done. Keep playing always. @MohammadKaif," Sachin wrote. Reacting to it, Kaif wrote, "My son Kabir seems to have handled your bowling much better."
