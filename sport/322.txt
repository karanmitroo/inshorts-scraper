Virat Kohli has become the first-ever batsman to hit 500-plus runs in a bilateral ODI series, achieving the feat in the sixth ODI against South Africa on Friday. Previously, the record for most runs in a series was held by Rohit Sharma, who smashed 491 runs against Australia in 2013. Kohli also became the fastest to reach 17,000 international runs.
