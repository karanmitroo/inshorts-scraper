Ramachandra Guha, former member of BCCI's Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, has said Zaheer Khan, Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid did not deserve "public humiliation". Guha's comments came after CoA chief Vinod Rai said Zaheer and Dravid were just "recommendations", despite a BCCI release claiming that the two had been appointed "overseas consultants" on a "tour-to-tour" basis.
