During the first ODI between New Zealand and Pakistan in Wellington, winds exceeding 100 kmph forced umpires to remove the bails during a part of the hosts' innings. According to rules, the two captains can agree upon, with the umpire's approval, to play the game without bails on the stumps in case of heavy winds.
