West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell came out to play with a black bat with a pink handle in the opening fixture of the Big Bash League. Playing for Sydney Thunder, Russell's innings lasted only seven balls, of which he hit two boundaries. Chris Gayle had wielded a gold coloured bat while playing for the Melbourne Renegades last year.
