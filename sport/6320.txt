There were no gold medals at the first-ever Modern Olympics, which started on April 6, 1896, in Athens, Greece. Winners were awarded silver medals and an olive branch, while second-placed athletes got a copper medal and a branch of laurel. One side of the medal had the face of Greek God Zeus, while the other side had the Acropolis.
