Boxer Vijender Singh, who won his career's second professional title defeating China's Zulpikar Maimaitiali, has offered to return the championship belt and called for peace at India-China border. "Tension on the border is not good...I give this title to people, peace, it's all about friendship, Hindi-Chini bhai bhai", said Vijender, who is now the WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental champion.
