SÃ£o Paulo-based blind photographer Joao Maia has been covering the ongoing Rio Paralympics. The 41-year-old, who lost his eyesight at 28, said, "Photography is about sensitivity. I think it's marvelous to be able to show how I perceive the world... see it, sense it". "You don't need to see to take photographs. My eyes are in my heart," he added.
