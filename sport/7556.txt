Speaking about his experience of coaching the junior India team, former cricketer Rahul Dravid said coaching is easier than playing. "Playing is a lot harder and stressful. You can never match that pressure," added Dravid. The 44-year old further said, "Constantly as a coach, I find that I'm analyzing it even more than I was as a captain."
