Australian high school students were accidentally shown a porn site during an online safety talk by National Rugby League player Jarryd Hayne, when his browsing history was displayed before them. Norton Security, on whose behalf Hayne was presenting the talk, said the images had come from another device that had entered the network. They had included lewd acts and nudity.
