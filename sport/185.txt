Canadian skier Dave Duncan, his wife and coach were on Saturday arrested for allegedly stealing a car in Pyeongchang, where the Winter Olympics just concluded. The trio got into an unlocked Hummer which was left unoccupied in front of a bar and drove it near the Olympic village. The vehicle belonged to a 57-year-old tourist who was visiting the Games.
