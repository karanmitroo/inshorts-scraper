After Virat Kohli admitted he no longer considered the Australian players his friends, Aussie media has called Kohli "classless" and an "egomaniac". "Virat Kohli had to shake hands and move on after series win but he acted like a child," read a headline in Sydney's Daily Telegraph. Another newspaper slammed Kohli for refusing Steve Smith's offer of sharing a beer.
