Cricketer Harbhajan Singh has said Australia will lose their upcoming four-match Test series 0-3 "if they play well" against India. "India will win 3-0...That is if Australia play well. Otherwise, 4-0...I don't think this team has the belief to win in these conditions," said Harbhajan. The series kicks off on February 23, with the first Test being played in Pune.
