Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's bowling partner Ravindra Jadeja claims that it's not only Ashwin's responsibility to pick up wickets for the team but of all the five bowlers. The statement comes after England posted a total of 537 against India in the first Test on Thursday, with Ashwin picking up two wickets after conceding 167 runs.
