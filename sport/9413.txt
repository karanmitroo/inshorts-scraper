Russian lawmakers have asked the state communications oversight agency to take action against the video game FIFA 17 for violating the law against gay propaganda. The game, rated for all ages, invites users to support the English Premier League's Rainbow Laces action which campaigns to support LGBT community. According to Russian law, such propaganda can harm children's health and development.
