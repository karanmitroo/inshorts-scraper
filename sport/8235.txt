Egypt has added retired football star Mohamed Aboutrika to a terrorism list over his alleged links to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, according to reports. Aboutrika is accused of financially supporting the Brotherhood, which Egypt considers a terrorist organisation. The terrorism list designation means Aboutrika will be banned from travel and his assets will be frozen.
