Gautam Gambhir, who made 97 in the 2011 Men's World Cup final, said that if Indian eves win the ongoing ICC Women's World Cup it would be bigger than the 2011 title. "When we won in 2011 it was at home and we were the tournament favourites... [T]he women won the semi-final against Australia in difficult conditions", Gambhir added.
