Abebe Bikila, the first African ever to win an Olympic medal, won the 1960 Rome Olympic marathon while running barefoot. The Ethiopian athlete beat the Olympic record for the marathon by almost eight seconds, covering approximately 42.16 kilometres. He then bested his own record at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, becoming the first athlete to win two Olympic marathons.
