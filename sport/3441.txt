The world's second most expensive footballer, Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, failed at kick-ups during his unveiling at Camp Nou. The 20-year-old had just completed two kick-ups before he lost control while juggling the ball, and later also failed to execute a rainbow flick. Dembele was signed by Barcelona as Neymar's replacement for over â‚¹795 crore.
