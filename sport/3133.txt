Virat Kohli has refused a multi-crore endorsement deal for an aerated drinks brand, since he himself does not consume such products. "If I myself won't consume such things, I won't urge others... just because I am getting money out of it," Virat had earlier said. In June, he reportedly refused to renew his deal with Pepsi for similar reasons.
