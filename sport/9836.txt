Ravichandran Ashwin sought a DRS review during India's second innings in the Vizag Test on Sunday, to overturn an LBW decision against him which was given in favour of England bowler Stuart Broad. However, despite the decision being overturned, the review turned out to be futile, with Ashwin losing his wicket after three deliveries, getting caught behind on Broad's bowling.
