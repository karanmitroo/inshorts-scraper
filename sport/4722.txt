A cow halted play during a club cricket match in England recently. Mossley Cricket Club posted a video of the incident, which shows a fast-moving cow charging at players and an umpire during a match against English club Kerridge. Spectators were heard laughing before a lady shouted "Oh my god", when the animal picked up pace and avoided the official.
