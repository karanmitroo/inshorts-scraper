Switzerland's Roger Federer took to the stage to introduce Spain's Rafael Nadal at the Laver Cup gala dinner. Federer, who was introduced by German youngster Alexander Zverev, recalled how Nadal, a 16-year-old from Manacor, Spain, defeated him in their first ever meeting at the Miami Masters. "Didn't think [Nadal] would go on to win French Opens 10 times," Federer said.
