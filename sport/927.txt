As many as 36 Russian athletes suddenly withdrew from a regional tournament in Siberia after the unannounced arrival of drug testers. Russian Athletics Federation's president said he wasn't "surprised", adding that the list of athletes will be passed to Russian Anti-Doping Agency. This comes after Russia was banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics over allegations of a state-run doping scheme.
