Czech club Sparta Prague's players Lukas Vacha and Tomas Koubek have been asked to train with the women's team after they made sexist remarks at a female assistant referee. Following a wrongly-awarded goal, Vacha tweeted the referee's photo with a caption reading "To the cooker", while Koubek said, "women should stay at the stove and not officiate men's football".
