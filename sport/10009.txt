The first wicket in Test cricket history was claimed by England's pacer Allen Hill, who bowled Australian batsman Nat Thomson on the first morning of the first Test in 1877. Hill, who was born on November 14, 1843, also holds the record for taking the first ever catch in Tests, which was the second wicket to fall in Test cricket.
