The world record for most consecutive innings in international cricket without a duck is held by Rahul Dravid who went 173 innings across four years without getting out on zero. Second on the list is Sachin Tendulkar, whose streak was ended by international retirement. Virat Kohli's dismissal at zero in the Pune Test was his first duck since 2014.
