The Pakistan Cricket Board has purchased four bulletproof buses to encourage teams to visit the country for tours. No country, barring Zimbabwe, has visited Pakistan for a series since 2009 when the Sri Lankan cricket team bus was attacked by militants, injuring six players. PCB has been forced to organise all its “home” series in UAE since then.
