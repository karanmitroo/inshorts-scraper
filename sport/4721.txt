Indian shuttler Kidambi Srikanth revealed he was struggling with diarrhoea while competing in the Australian Open, which he won on Sunday by defeating the Rio Olympics champion. "Since I arrived in Sydney I have gastroenteritis...I have not been at my best physical condition...since I made the final I wanted to continue to play as well as I could," said Srikanth.
