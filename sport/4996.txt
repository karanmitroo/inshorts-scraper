Following Sri Lanka's loss to Pakistan, former Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara has said that he did not expect Pakistan and Bangladesh to qualify for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 semi-finals. "The tournament is left with three Asian teams in the top four, an outcome predicted by few before the tournament begun", the 39-year-old added.
