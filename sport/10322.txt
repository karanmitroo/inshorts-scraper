Russia has reportedly introduced a new law in the country which has made inducement to doping a criminal offence. Coaches and sports medicine specialists who induce athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs will be liable to face rigid punishment including imprisonment. Notably, Russia was suspended from international athletics in 2015 after the uncovering of a state-sponsored doping scandal.
