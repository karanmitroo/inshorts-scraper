Indian Rio bronze medal winning 24-year-old wrestler Sakshi Malik is set to tie the knot with Rohtak-based 22-year-old international wrestler Satyawart Kadian, later this year. The duo was engaged before Malik left for the Rio Olympics. Satyawart has won silver at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and is also a bronze medal winner at the 2014 Asian Championships.
