The German Olympic canoe slalom team's coach, Stefan Henze, who died in a car accident in Rio on Friday was an organ donor, and his organs reportedly helped save lives of four people. The 35-year-old, who was a canoeing silver medalist at the 2004 Olympics, was travelling to the athletes' village when his taxi hit a concrete barrier head-on.
