Confusion between the umpires and Australian captain Steve Smith led to eight extra overs after scheduled stumps against Pakistan on Sunday. As per rules, a captain can request for extra eight overs if a result is possible. Smith inquired about the rule, but the umpires thought he was requesting. Smith later clarified he wanted play closed at the scheduled time.
