Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics, said she regretted going to the Rio Olympics last year, and did not know she was carrying an injury. Saina exited the Olympics in the group stage, and was later operated upon for a knee injury. The 27-year-old has currently reached the semis of the World Championships.
