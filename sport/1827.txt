Australian cricketers wore black armbands featuring late Australian cricketer Phil Hughes' initials on the cricketer's third death anniversary on Monday. Australian opener David Warner looked skywards after reaching the score of 63*, the score at which Hughes was playing on when he was fatally struck by a bouncer during a domestic match in 2014.
