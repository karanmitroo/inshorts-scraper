A national-level kabaddi and wrestling player has reportedly been receiving rape threats by locals of her own village in Bihar over caste-based hatred. The girl said, "They (the locals) say if backward caste girls start to play sports then what will girls from upper caste do." Reportedly, she also went to the police but they did not take any action.
