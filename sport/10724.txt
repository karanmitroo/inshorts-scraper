Ajay Singh, a 13-year old boy from Haryana who learnt and practised the sport of tennis on a mud court, has won the Under-14 boys singles title at the National Tennis Championship. The mud court uses fallen electric poles to support the net and nylon ropes as boundaries. Singh was trained by his cousin who is a self-taught tennis player.
