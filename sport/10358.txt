West Indies' Kraigg Brathwaite became the first opener in Test history to remain not out in both innings of a Test, achieving the feat in Windies' third Test win over Pakistan on Thursday. He scored 142* in the first innings and 60* in second. Notably, West Indies have never lost a Test while chasing a target of less than 200.
