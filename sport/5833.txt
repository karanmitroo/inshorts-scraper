ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar has said the board is willing to increase BCCI's revenue share in the 2015-2023 cycle to $390 million (₹2,500 crore). This comes after all ICC members except India voted for a new revenue model, which cuts India's share to $260 million (₹1,668 crore). BCCI has already rejected an offer of an additional $100 million from Manohar.
