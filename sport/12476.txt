New Zealand Cricket Chief Executive, David White has called for having four-day Test matches and has also backed the idea of a two-tier system in Test cricket. He said that such changes will allow players and organisers to save time and will help bring back the audience's interest in Test cricket in the wake of T20 format's immense popularity.
