A cricket match between Imams and Vicars of two English towns, Dewsbury and Batley, started on September 19 in Yorkshire, England. According to the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation, the aim of the ongoing free-for-all match is to show religion and appearance have little to do with friendship. Earlier, the Imams and the Vicars played a football match, which the Imams won.
