Gautam Gambhir, who has led Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to two Indian Premier League (IPL) titles, has not been retained by the franchise for IPL 2018. KKR opted to retain overseas players Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. However, KKR would still have the option to get Gambhir in the squad by using the Right to Match card in the auction.
