The ICC has amended the existing 'Umpire's Call' in LBWs under the Direct Review System. The ruling will add half a stump's width in either direction of the leg and off stumps, for the ball to lie in for a successful LBW dismissal appeal. The amendment will come into effect from October 1, and will apply on all DRS-employing teams.
