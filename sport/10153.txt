Cricket Australia has partnered with DrinkWise, a social organisation, to promote responsible drinking among fans during matches. The campaign will involve broadcast messages and on-ground activations reminding fans about drinking in moderation. Supported by major alcohol producers Carlton and United Breweries and Hardys Wines, the campaign will be featured on TV, radio and around cricket venues.
