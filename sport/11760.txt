Former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar recently said that no batsman played him better than his former teammate and ex-Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq. "His footwork was quick... I always thought he had an extra second. However fast I bowled, he had placed himself where the ball would land," said Shoaib, who played 34 Test matches alongside Inzamam.
