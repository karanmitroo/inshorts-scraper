India's slip cordon dropped three catches on the first day of the England Test on Wednesday. Fielding at Gully, Ajinkya Rahane fumbled and dropped England captain Alastair Cook off Mohammed Shami on the match's third ball before Virat Kohli dropped Cook in the very next over off Umesh Yadav's bowling. Murali Vijay later dropped Haseeb Hameed off a Yadav delivery.
