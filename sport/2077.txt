The first wicket and first catch in Test cricket history were taken by England's Allen Hill on the first morning of the first Test in 1877. Hill bowled Australia's Nat Thomson for one run to claim Test cricket's first wicket. Hill then took Test cricket's first catch off Alfred Shaw's bowling to dismiss Tom Horan, second dismissal of the match.
