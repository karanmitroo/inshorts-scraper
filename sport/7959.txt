Dingko Singh, who won a boxing gold medal at the 1998 Asian Games, sold his house in Imphal after being diagnosed with bile duct cancer. The 38-year-old underwent a procedure early in January, during which 70% of his liver had to be removed. "We have already spent â‚¹10 lakh... and we definitely need help", said Dingko's wife.
