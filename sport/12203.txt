Members of the Russian Rio Olympics contingent have reportedly called Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav a “cheat”, and questioned United World Wrestling’s decision of clearing him for Rio. They added it was unfair that Russian wrestlers were banned on past offences, whereas Yadav “gained a backdoor entry to the Olympics”. Notably, 118 athletes from the original Russian contingent have been barred.
