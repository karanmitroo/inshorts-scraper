Adelaide Strikers' Ben Laughlin pulled off a diving catch near the long-off position after running behind from the 30-yard circle, to dismiss Melbourne Renegades' Aaron Finch in the Big Bash League on Monday. Laughlin leapt and dived at full stretch to complete the catch of Finch's mistimed lofted shot off Michael Neser's delivery.
