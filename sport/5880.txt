Sports Minister Vijay Goel has asked the National Anti-Doping Agency to consider the possibility of making doping a criminal offence and adopt a "Zero Tolerance Policy". He also asked the agency to sensitise grassroots-level players about the ill-effects of doping through seminars. A mechanism to test food supplements, to ensure they free of prohibited substances, is also being set up.
