After reports of three Amrapali Group companies going into insolvency surfaced, several home buyers slammed cricketer Harbhajan Singh, who was once the brand ambassador of the company. A user claimed that Harbhajan and MS Dhoni had received free flats from the company while he lost his money. Harbhajan responded saying even he was made a fool by the company.
