Belgian international Dries Mertens on Saturday celebrated by pretending to urinate like a dog after he opened the scoring for Napoli against Roma. Mertens ran towards the corner flag and started crawling near it before lifting his one leg like a urinating dog. Mertens, later, shared a photo of himself with his dog, Juliette, captioned, "Go Napoli forever!"
