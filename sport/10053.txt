Mexico and USA football teams posed together for one group photograph instead of two separate team photographs before their 2018 World Cup qualifying match in Ohio on Saturday. The teams posed together to create a "Wall of Friendship" as a symbol of unity between both nations. US President-elect Donald Trump had said that he'd build a wall along US-Mexico border.
