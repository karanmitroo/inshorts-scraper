Brazil's two-time Ballon d'Or-winner Ronaldo played the 1996 Atlanta Olympics with the name 'Ronaldinho', which means little Ronald, on his shirt. It was because there was already a player named Ronaldo Guiaro in the squad and as he was older, he got to keep the name. After Ronaldo Guiaro stopped playing international football, Ronaldo retained his original name.
