Arjuna-awardee gymnast Dipa Karmakar was honoured with a D.Litt. degree from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala on Saturday. The 24-year-old from Tripura became the first Indian woman gymnast to qualify for the Olympics before narrowly missing out on the bronze medal in the women's vault event at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
