The ATP has been accused of sexism over the Next Gen Finals draw which made male tennis players determine which group they would play in by selecting female models. The players were escorted down a catwalk arm in arm with the models, who revealed their groups. Former world number one player Amelie Mauresmo branded the event as a "disgrace".
