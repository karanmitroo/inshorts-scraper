Melbourne Stars' regular wicketkeeper Seb Gotch took a one-handed somersaulting catch while fielding at first slip during a Border Bash T20 match. Gotch dived low to his right to remove Sydney Thunder's Kurtis Patterson for a duck. "I don't usually field in slips so it was just a shock to hold on to one, let alone a one-hander," Gotch said.
