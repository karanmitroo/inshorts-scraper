FIFA will allow the public to vote in the newly-branded 'The Best FIFA Football Awards', scheduled to take place on January 9, 2017. In the system, half of the votes would belong to the public, who will be allowed to cast votes online, and selected media organisations, while the remaining half would belong to 211 national teams' captains and coaches.
