Former Indian batsmen VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid constructed a 376-run stand against Australia on March 14, 2001, which is widely considered one of Test cricket's best partnerships in a follow-on innings. Laxman went on to score 281 runs, India's then highest individual Test score, helping India end Australia's 16-match-long world record winning streak.
