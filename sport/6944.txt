American sportswear manufacturer Nike unveiled a special Air Force 1 Jet sneaker made exclusively for singer Elton John. The silver sneakers are inspired by a British knightâ€™s armour and a disco ball. The tongue of the shoe features Nike's 'Be True' LGBT pride branding. The shoe is intended to thank John for his "commitment to diversity and inclusion".
