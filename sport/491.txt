Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo jumped over New York Knicks' 6-foot-6-inch tall Tim Hardaway Jr for the slam dunk in the NBA on Wednesday. The Greek later claimed that he did not see Hardaway under him when he jumped to score the dunk. Antetokounmpo went on to score 23 points as Milwaukee defeated Knicks 103-89.
