Veteran Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has said that once he retires from cricket he would want to be known as someone who never gave up. "I don't want to leave the game with any regret. I am still playing because I am enjoying playing cricket," he added. Yuvraj last played for India in an ODI against Windies in June 2017.
