Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, while batting on 47, got clean bowled off a Jake Ball delivery on the second ball of the third day of the Wankhede Test. Pujara misjudged the bounce and had left the ball only to see it hit the top of the off-stump. It was the 17th time that Pujara was bowled in Tests.
