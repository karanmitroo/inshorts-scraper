Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath bagged his Test career's eighth 10-wicket haul in the Test against Zimbabwe, thereby equalling Anil Kumble's record. Herath achieved the feat playing in his 81st Test match. With his five-wicket haul in the first innings of the match, Herath had also become only the fifth player in Test history to pick 30-plus five-wicket hauls.
