Barcelona forward Lionel Messi donated his signed jersey to raise funds for Shaun Whiter, an English amateur footballer, who lost both his legs in a hit-and-run accident in July. Messi was joined by other players including Arda Turan, Wayne Rooney and John Terry who also donated their jerseys. The items will be auctioned at a fundraiser on October 9.
