Indian spinner Ravindra Jadeja mimicked Australian batsman Steve Smith's mannerism in the 12th over of Australia's innings, on Day 2 of the Pune Test. After Smith came forward and got beaten while looking to defend, Jadeja impersonated the Australian captain's routine preparation before a ball is delivered. Smith remained unbeaten on 59 at the end of day's play.
