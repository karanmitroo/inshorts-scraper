Sports Minister Vijay Goel met boxer Vijender Singh on Saturday to seek his suggestions for developing a roadmap for Indian boxing. The sport has been without a recognised federation in the country since four years. Vijender, one of the two Indian boxers to win an Olympic medal, hoped the elections on September 25 would bring a change in the sport.
