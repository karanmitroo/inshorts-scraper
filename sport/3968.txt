Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who led the team to its only ODI World Cup victory in 1996, has said that he has stopped watching Sri Lanka play cricket due to its "disgusting" administration. Ranatunga added the administrators were more worried about earnings, foreign trips and perks rather than commitment of winning for the country.
