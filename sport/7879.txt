BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary and joint secretary Amitabh Choudhary have been told by the new board head Vinod Rai to not attend the meeting of the International Cricket Council, scheduled for February 2. The decision comes after the Supreme Court had earlier allowed the two officials to attend the meeting. Amitabh was also barred from chairing the senior selection meeting.
