India's only male swimmer at the Rio Olympics, Sajan Prakash, who demanded financial assistance from the government to undergo high-altitude training in Spain, has threatened to sell his medals if denied assistance. Prakash, who won six gold medals at the National Games in 2015, said he has not received assistance despite being nominated for the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.
