American football club Orlando City's fans chanted "Move b*tch, get off the pitch" to an injured New York City player during their Major League Soccer match in Orlando recently. Orlando were 1-0 up in the 70th minute when the NYC player had hurt his knee. The chant was a spin-off of hip hop artist Ludacris' song by the same name.
