Ireland will face Pakistan on home soil in May 2018 in their first-ever Test match, Cricket Ireland has confirmed. Ireland and Afghanistan were granted Test status in June when they became the 11th and 12th full members of the ICC. Ireland played their first ODI in 2006 and qualified for the 2007 World Cup, where they beat Pakistan and Bangladesh.
