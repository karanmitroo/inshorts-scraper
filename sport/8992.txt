New Zealand tail-ender Geoff Allott was dismissed without scoring a run after facing 77 balls against South Africa in 1999, making the record for the longest duck in Test cricket history. The 101-minute innings helped New Zealand draw the match. Allott, born on December 24, 1971, was also the first bowler to take 20 wickets in a single World Cup.
