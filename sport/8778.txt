The record for most runs in first-class cricket is held by former England batsman Jack Hobbs, who scored over 61,000 runs. The record remains unbeaten since Hobbs retired in 1934. The Englishman also holds the record for most centuries in first-class cricket, with 199 tons to his name. Hobbs was one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the 20th Century.
