A fire broke out on Thursday at a football stadium in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod, which is being built for FIFA World Cup 2018. The blaze started in the 45,000-capacity stadium's stands after a welding spark ignited debris in the commentary box, as per a contractor. It is the third blaze reported to have hit WC venues in Russia since June.
