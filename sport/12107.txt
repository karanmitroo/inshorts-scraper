Over 20 countries participate in Underwater Hockey World Championship, which is held every two years. It is a sport wherein two teams manoeuvre a puck using a one-handed stick across a swimming pool and attempt to score goals. US' Underwater Hockey Team captain Tyera Eulberg says that players hold their breath while playing, using snorkels to watch the play.
