London gym chain Gymbox has launched a new workout, which is claimed to be the world's hardest workout and requires participants to sign a disclaimer beforehand. The gym keeps paramedics and a professional cardiologist on site in case of any emergency medical situation alongside a compulsory oxygen station for cooling down after the completion of the 45-minute long workout.
