Dharambir Singh, India's first 200-metre male sprinter to qualify for the Olympics in 36 years, has failed a drug test conducted by the National Anti-Doping Agency, according to reports. He was scheduled to leave for Rio on Tuesday but was asked to stay back. If confirmed, the Haryana-based sprinter will face a life ban as this is his second offence.
