Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar, who finished fourth at the Rio Olympics in August, is reportedly set to return the BMW car she was presented with by former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. Difficulty to use and maintain the luxury car in her hometown of Agartala is reportedly the reason behind the 23-year-old returning the car.
