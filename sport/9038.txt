Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian, has confirmed his retirement from the Games. Talking about his silver finish in 100-metre butterfly at the Rio Olympics, Phelps said, "I'm coming into my last four or five strokes, and I remember thinking, whatever happens, this is how it's supposed to end...Any other time, I would have been livid about finishing second."
