Less than a week after winning the world championship at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg on Friday announced his retirement from Formula One with immediate effect. Rosberg's father Keke Rosberg had won the championship in 1982, and Nico Rosberg's F1 championship made him only the second son of a champion to take the title since 1950.
