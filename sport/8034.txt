Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, are set to face each other in the Australian Open 2017 final, their first head-to-head Grand Slam final meeting after an eight-year gap. Venus dispatched compatriot CoCo Vandeweghe, while seven-time Australian Open champion, Serena, ended Croatian Mirjana Lučić-Baroni's run on Thursday. This will be the siblings' ninth Grand Slam final against each other.
