Lionel Messi, who turned 30 today, was awarded his first informal contract for Barcelona on a table napkin by Barcelona's then Technical Secretary in 2000. The 13-year-old was suffering from growth hormone deficiency at the time and Barcelona agreed to pay Â£80,000 for his treatment. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner is now the highest goal scorer in Barcelona's history.
