Former world number one and 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams has responded to ex-men's champion John McEnroe's comments, wherein he said Serena would be "like 700 on the men's circuit". Serena told McEnroe on Twitter that she "adored and respected" him but he should respect her and her privacy as she was "trying to have a baby".
