A 25-second shot clock will be introduced at the Australian Open 2018 to ensure players serve within 25 seconds of a point. The decision was taken after the Australian Open organisers requested to raise the time from 20 to 25 seconds, but strictly enforce it. Other Grand Slams will also allow 25 seconds, but aren't currently scheduled to have shot-clocks.
