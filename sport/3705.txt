Indian cricketer S Sreesanth played his first cricket match in four years on Tuesday in Kochi, captaining a side in an exhibition match. This comes after the Kerala High Court recently sanctioned BCCI to lift the ban imposed on him. "I'm really happy that I'm back and I'm beginning my return from same ground where it all began," said Sreesanth.
