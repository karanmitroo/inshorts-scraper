Ahead of the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy match on Sunday, former cricketer Virender Sehwag mocked ex-Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar, saying Pakistani fans should buy radio sets to break, since they will be cheaper than TVs. Shoaib replied, "We have enough old Chinese TV sets which don't work, so we will break them." Sehwag also cited India's World Cup record against Pakistan.
