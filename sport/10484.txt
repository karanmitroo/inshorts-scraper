Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger has revealed that he is against Ballon d'Or as the award "gets in the head of players". Wenger stressed on the fact that football is a "collective sport". He added, "I feel sometimes it (Ballon d'Or) encourages selfishness and people to go too much for their own sake when some partners are in a better position."
