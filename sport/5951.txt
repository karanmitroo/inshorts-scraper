Britain's women's singles number one tennis player Johanna Konta was reduced to tears following former men's world number one Ilie Nastase's abusive comments towards her during Britain's match against Romania in the Fed Cup. Nastase, who was escorted out of the court and suspended, had earlier made a racist jibe about the colour of Serena Williams' unborn baby.
