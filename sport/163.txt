In the 4-0 league win against Alaves, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo let teammate Karim Benzema take a penalty despite being only a goal short of registering 50th career hat-trick and his 300th La Liga goal. "This shows he is a team player," coach Zinedine Zidane said. Benzema had provided assists for Real's first two goals including Ronaldo's first goal.
