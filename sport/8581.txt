Tamil Nadu Cricket Association has written to BCCI citing inability to host two U-19 Test matches between India and England in Chennai next month. TNCA, led by ex-BCCI President N Srinivasan, listed "various domestic programs scheduled during the period" as the reason for not hosting the Tests. Reportedly, the refusal came after Srinivasan met sacked BCCI President Anurag Thakur.
