Indian women athletes will wear trousers and blazers instead of the traditional combination of sarees and blazers at the opening ceremony of the upcoming Commonwealth Games. The decision to have same dress code for men and women athletes was taken after the Indian Olympic Association received feedback from women athletes that wearing sarees for 4-5 hours was "not convenient".
