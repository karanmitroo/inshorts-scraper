Christian Kinner, a supporter of German club Borussia Dortmund, has set a Guinness world record for the longest shout. Kinner yelled "Tor", the German word for 'goal', for 43.56 seconds, maintaining minimum 80 decibels throughout the entire attempt, which was compulsory for the record to be valid. The attempt was aired live, with three people competing for the title.
