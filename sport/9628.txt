With an average of 21.47 runs per dismissal, India has the highest mean partnership for innings' last four wickets in Test history. The Indian tail has played its part in scoring over 56,000 runs for the team since 1932. The Mohali Test recorded the first occasion of number seven, eight and nine scoring fifty-plus in the same innings for India.
