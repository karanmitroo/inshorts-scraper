Perth Scorchers batsman Sam Whiteman was caught at the boundary by Sydney Sixers' Johan Botha on Tuesday in the Big Bash League. Botha caught the ball while running to his right and threw the ball up to keep it inside the boundary. Botha then stepped back inside the fence after going over it and completed the catch.
