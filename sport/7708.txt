The International Association of Athletics Federations has extended its ban on Russia, ruling them out from the World Athletics Championships in London in August. However, Russians may be allowed to compete under a neutral banner, if they satisfy testing criteria. Russia was banned by the IAAF in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency report revealed mass doping.
