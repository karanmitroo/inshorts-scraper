Mumbai Indians' Kieron Pollard has revealed that some senior players in the team are superstitious about their seats in the bus. "Two three seats from the back, I sit there as often as possible...We call it superstitious," Pollard said. Sachin Tendulkar reportedly sits on the front left seat while Harbhajan Singh takes the seat on the right.
