According to a one-minute video, the marathon event at the 1904 St Louis Olympics was held amidst heat and pollution, and the runners were made to run on roads with oncoming cars. Some athletes used objectionable methods to win the race while others suffered due to consumption of rotten apples, rat poison and being chased by wild dogs.
