American skydiver Luke Aikins will attempt to skydive without a parachute from a height of 25,000 feet on July 30 in California, which will reportedly be a world record. The 42-year-old skydiver, who has completed about 18,000 dives in his 25-year career, will land on a special slide-like device. The dive will be broadcast live on TV.
