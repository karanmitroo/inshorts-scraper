Nathan Paulin, a 23-year-old French slackliner, completed a 670-metre walk along a tightrope from the Eiffel Tower while suspended nearly 200 feet up in the air in 30 minutes. It was reportedly the world's first crossing of this length in an urban environment. While practicing, Paulin took a tumble by losing balance, but successfully completed the actual stunt without stumbling.
