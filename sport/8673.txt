Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has said he would have staged a protest had MS Dhoni retired from cricket completely rather than resigning as captain. "If he had quit as a player, I would have been the first one outside his house, having a dharna asking him to make a comeback...India needs him as a player very, very badly," said Gavaskar.
