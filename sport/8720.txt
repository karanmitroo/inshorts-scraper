Australian batsman Peter Handscomb got himself hit-wicket as he stepped deep in his crease to play a wide ball from Wahab Riaz. As Handscomb went down to guide the ball towards the deep point, his bat clipped the leg-bail, ending his innings on 110. This was the highest score for the 25-year-old in his Test career that started last November.
