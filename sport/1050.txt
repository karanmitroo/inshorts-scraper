Pakistan's Hanif Mohammad got run-out on 499 in a first-class match on January 11, 1959, due to a scoring error. The scoreboard showed Hanif on 496 instead of 498 before the third day's second-last ball. Wanting to reach 500 of the last ball to give his captain the option to declare overnight, Hanif got run-out while attempting the second run.
