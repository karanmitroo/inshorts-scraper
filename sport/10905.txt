Indian Test captain Virat Kohli has said he was unaware that Mohammed Shami's 14-month-old daughter was in the ICU during the second New Zealand Test at Kolkata. "Whatever might be happening with him, we won't know. I had no clue that his daughter was in the hospital. He told us after," said Kohli. Shami took six wickets in that match.
