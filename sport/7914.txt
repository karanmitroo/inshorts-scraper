Runner Callum Hawkins' record at Scotland's Great Scottish Run half-marathon in October last year has been invalidated, after the marathon course was found to be short. The 21.1-kilometre course, remeasured after complaints, was short by 149.7 metres, with the miscalculation being attributed to human error. The Great Scottish Run is an annual event, which saw 32,000 people participate last year.
