Nine-time Olympic gold medal winning sprinter Usain Bolt appeared on 'The Late Late Show' and engaged in a rap battle with the show's host James Corden. As a part of his rap, the 30-year-old runner dissed Corden over his appearance and claimed that the show was "the lowest show in the history of ratings".
