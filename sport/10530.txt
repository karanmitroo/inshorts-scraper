Pakistan Cricket Board chief Najam Sethi debunked the claims that the board had barred the Pakistani players from doing push-ups as a celebration in cricket matches. “Oh for God’s sake, there is no ban on pushups! In fact I think players should do 100 pushups when they score a century!!”, Sethi said in a tweet.
