Indian cricketer Virat Kohli, during a recent interaction, said he takes a lot of inspiration from Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. "I have heard he is the most hardworking footballer in the world and that's why he is where he is," added Kohli. Kohli was one of the leading run scorers in 2016, with over 2,500 runs across all formats.
