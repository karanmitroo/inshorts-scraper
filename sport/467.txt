South Africa called up an Indian spinner named Ajay Rajput at nets to help their batsmen prepare for Indian spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal ahead of the fourth ODI. This comes after the South African team lost 21 wickets to the spinners in the first three ODIs. Rajput, primarily an off-spinner, plays in the Johannesburg Premier League.
