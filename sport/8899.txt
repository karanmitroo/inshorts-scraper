Former Pakistani pacer Wasim Akram has said that Australian pacer Mitchell Starc is his favourite bowler in the world at the moment. "I've worked with Starc before in Melbourne and Sydney, he bowls pace and swing. He's got both. He has a high arm action and uses his crease beautifully. And he's smart", said Akram about Starc.
