Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has claimed athletes' sexual relations can cause distortions in dope test results, saying male DNA lingers in female athletes for days after having sex. "One (athlete) can kiss a girl who has taken a drug. A foreign (athlete) is reinstated based on this while a Russian is punished," added the Russian official.
