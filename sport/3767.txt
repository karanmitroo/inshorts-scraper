Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will head to England for a stint in the ongoing County Championship with Worcestershire, after the conclusion of the India-Sri Lanka Test series. Notably, Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara represented county side Nottinghamshire earlier during the current English domestic season as he was overlooked by the Indian Premier League franchises.
