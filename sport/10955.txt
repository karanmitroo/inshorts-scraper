Bowling to New Zealand's Luke Ronchi on the third day of the third Test on Monday, Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin showed his reflexes to effect the dismissal of Martin Guptill. Ashwin bowled a full ball, to which Ronchi played a straight drive, on which Ashwin got his hands in time and deflected it to the non-striker's stumps, running Guptill out.
