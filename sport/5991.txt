Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has said spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will be India's key weapons in the Champions Trophy in England, depending on the weather there. "If they are getting good summer, the wickets will be dry and I think spin will play a part," Clarke added. The Champions Trophy is scheduled to start on June 1.
