Michael Schumacher's 18-year-old son Mick will perform laps in a 1994 Benetton at the Belgian GP on Sunday, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his father's first F1 win, achieved at the same circuit on August 30, 1992. Seven-time world champion Schumacher, who registered record 91 F1 victories, suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in France in 2013.
