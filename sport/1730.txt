Speaking about Indian captain Virat Kohli being a 'role model', former captain Sourav Ganguly jokingly said, "If Virat wins the World Cup in 2019, he will roam around Oxford Street with his shirt off." "The best thing about Indian cricket is that we have had different role models in different eras," Ganguly said about each passing generation of Indian cricketers.
