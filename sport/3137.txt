Conor McGregor, who reportedly earned around $100 million through the Floyd Mayweather bout, shared pictures of himself alongside one of the world's most expensive yachts. McGregor called the $360-million Sailing Yacht A, owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, "truly motivating" and added, "I'm starting to think I don't have a wealth belly just yet. I'm more just rich fat now."
