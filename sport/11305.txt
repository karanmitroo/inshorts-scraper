BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said there's no chance of a series with Pakistan, since they are "sponsors of terrorism". "Priority is to expose Pakistan as a country which sponsors terrorism. No question of playing cricket with such a nation," said Thakur. India hasn't played bilateral cricket with Pakistan since 2012, with plans of a series in 2015 being shelved.
