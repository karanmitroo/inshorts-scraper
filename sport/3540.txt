Indian boxer Vijender Singh shared a picture with American professional boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, ahead of the latter's multi-million dollar bout with Conor McGregor on Saturday. Vijender, who earlier said Mayweather is the favourite in the bout against the Irish MMA fighter, captioned the picture, "One and only @FloydMayweather." Mayweather and Vijender both are undefeated in their pro careers.
