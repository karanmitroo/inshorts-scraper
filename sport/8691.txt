Pakistani batsman Younis Khan became the first player in cricket history to score centuries in 11 nations, after scoring his first ton in Australia in Sydney on Thursday. Younis also became the second batsman in the history to score a century in all ten Test-playing nations. Former Indian cricketer Rahul Dravid was the first-ever player to achieve this feat.
