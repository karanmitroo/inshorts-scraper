Former England football captain Wayne Rooney received a two-year driving ban after pleading guilty to drunk driving in a British court. The 31-year-old, who was arrested on September 1 while driving over the prescribed alcohol limit, apologised for his "unforgivable lack of judgment" in a statement. Rooney has also been ordered to perform 100 hours of unpaid community work.
