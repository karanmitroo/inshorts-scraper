Ex-India captain Kapil Dev has said all-rounder Hardik Pandya doesn't deserve to be compared with him if he continues committing "silly mistakes". "He definitely has a lot of talent but I believe he needs to work on the mental aspect." Kapil added. Dev's comments come after Pandya got out cheaply in both the innings of the Centurion Test.
