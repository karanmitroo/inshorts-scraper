Ex-Australian cricketer Darren Lehmann teased his former teammate Adam Gilchrist over his big ears after seeing him wear earphones while commentating in the Big Bash League. Lehmann tweeted, "Do I have to have those big ear phones on @gilly381? How do they fit you?" Lehman also sledged New Zealand's Brendon McCullum for wearing an orange shirt in the commentary box.
