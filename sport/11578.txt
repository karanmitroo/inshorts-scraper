BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said former President and current ICC chairman Shashank Manohar is working against the BCCI. Manohar had recently commented he had “interests of 105 countries to look after, and BCCI must look after theirs”. BCCI and ICC have been at loggerheads, with the Board opposing the two-tier Test system and objecting to the Champions Trophy budget.
