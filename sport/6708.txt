Pakistan's coach Mickey Arthur on Tuesday said he felt "gutted" over the Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal, adding any players found guilty only had themselves to blame. "Players become greedy and that's hurting international cricket in general and the recent case has hurt Pakistan," Arthur added. Notably, as many as five Pakistani players have been accused of spot-fixing in PSL.
