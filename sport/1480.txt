Australian batsman Belinda Clark was the first cricketer to score a double hundred in ODI cricket after smashing 229 against Denmark in Mumbai on December 16, 1997. Denmark, who conceded 412 runs, were later dismissed for 49, less than one-fifth of Clark's individual score. Sachin Tendulkar became the first male cricketer to score an ODI double ton 13 years later.
