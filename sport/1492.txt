The BCCI's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit chief Neeraj Kumar on Saturday said no evidence was found against the two Indians in the alleged Ashes spot-fixing case. This comes after a sting operation by a British tabloid claimed two Indian bookies attempted to spot-fix the third Ashes Test. The ICC had earlier said investigation will be commenced in the matter.
