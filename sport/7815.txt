Former Australian batsman Michael Hussey has said the Australian team should avoid sledging Virat Kohli during their upcoming four-match Test series in India. "I wouldn't try and fire him up. He thrives on that and he's a real competitor...loves being in the fight," said Hussey. During India's tour to Australia in 2014, Virat had hit a century after being sledged.
