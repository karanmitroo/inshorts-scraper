West Indies have cancelled their proposed tour to Pakistan in March, following a security advisory by the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations. They are the third country now after Ireland and Sri Lanka to reject travelling to Pakistan in the last two years. No country except Zimbabwe has toured Pakistan since 2009 following attacks on the Sri Lankan team.
