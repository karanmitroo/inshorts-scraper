Cheteshwar Pujara has become the first Indian to face 500-plus balls in an innings, going past the mark against Australia on Sunday. He went past Rahul Dravid's record of 495 balls, which were the most faced by an Indian in one Test innings. Pujara spent over 10 hours at the crease, scoring the third double century of his Test career.
