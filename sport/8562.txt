Cricket Association of Bihar Secretary Aditya Verma claimed that MS Dhoni was pressurised to quit captaincy by BCCI joint secretary Amitabh Choudhary. Choudhary allegedly told chief selector MSK Prasad to ask Dhoni his future cricketing plans, which hurt Dhoni enough to resign. Verma said the rift between Dhoni and Choudhary followed Dhoni's refusal to play in Ranji semifinal for Jharkhand.
