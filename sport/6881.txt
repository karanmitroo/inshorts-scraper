A man from Russia has posted a video of himself working out on the ledge of a skyscraper without a harness or any other safety equipment. Oleg Sherstyachenko performed a handstand and dangled off the ledge during the "morning workout" video. He said he was not scared as he had previously scaled higher buildings.
