Following Indian women's cricketer Harmanpreet Kaur's unbeaten 171-run knock in the World Cup semi-final, Ravi Shastri compared her to Kapil Dev. Shastri posted Harmanpreet's picture alongside Dev's from his 175-run innings against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup. Dev had led India to a 31-run victory over Zimbabwe in the league stage, coming in to bat when India was 9/4.
