BCCI's Committee of Administrators chief Vinod Rai has denied reports that claimed Indian team cricketers had not been paid their dues, including match fees, for the past six months. "Show me the records and I'll show you my records that payment has been made," Rai stated. He added that any outstanding payment issues would be rectified in 24 hours.
