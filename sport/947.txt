Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has suggested that MS Dhoni should have just quit Test captaincy instead of leaving Test cricket altogether. "His advice in the dressing room would have been invaluable," he added. Gavaskar's comments come after wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, who replaced Wriddhiman Saha for the Centurion Test, dropped Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis in the first innings.
