Sportswear giant Nike has partnered with game developer EA Sports for limited edition Mercurial Superfly football shoes, marking the launch of FIFA 17 next week. The bright orange shoes sport graphics that transition from a pixelated, 16-bit design, reminiscent of FIFA 94 on one side to a high-definition pattern on the other. The shoes will be available starting September 26th.
