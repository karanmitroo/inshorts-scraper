French ice dancers Guillaume Cizeron and Gabriella Papadakis took second place in Monday's short program at Winter Olympics despite a wardrobe malfunction. The duo was performing on Ed Sheeran's Shape of You when Papadakis' costume unhooked from around her neck and exposed her left breast for part of the routine. "My worst nightmare happened at the Olympics," Papadakis later said.
