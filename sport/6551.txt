Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has revealed what he asked Australian opener David Warner during his spell in the Dharamsala Test on Monday. "When I walked out to bat, Pat Cummins bowled a bouncer and Warner asked me if that was quick. Then I bowled a bouncer to Warner and asked him how quick he thought that was," Bhuvneshwar said.
