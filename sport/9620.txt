Pullela Gopichand reportedly became the first badminton coach whose students reached the finals in both men's and women's single category, after Sameer Verma and PV Sindhu finished as runner-ups in the Hong Kong Open. Verma had joined Gopichand's Hyderabad-based badminton academy five years ago, while Sindhu has been under Gopichand's tutelage for the past eight years.
