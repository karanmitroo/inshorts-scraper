Former world number one and seven-time Grand Slam winner John McEnroe has said he would place 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams "like number 700 in the world" on the men's circuit. "Best female player ever, no question. If she had to just play the circuit, the men's circuit, that would be an entirely different story," said McEnroe.
