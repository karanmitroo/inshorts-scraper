Pakistani cricket commentator Ramiz Raja has said that he is puzzled by BCCI's Grade A contract given to former Indian captain MS Dhoni. Speaking at the MCC World Cricket Committee meeting, Raja said that cricketers like Dhoni and Shahid Afridi quit Test cricket yet they were given Grade A contracts by their respective boards.
