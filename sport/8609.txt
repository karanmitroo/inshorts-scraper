Mahendra Singh Dhoni's former Chennai Super Kings Australian teammate Michael Hussey says that Dhoni was an inspirational leader and he loved playing under the captaincy of the Indian player. "He gave the players perspective and made them realise that though cricket is important, it is not the most important thing in a person's life", said Hussey.
