A match between New Zealand's domestic T20 league sides Central Stags and Otago Volts on Wednesday recorded an aggregate of 497 runs, which is the highest combined score in T20 history. The combined score went past the previous highest of 489 runs, scored in the T20I between India and West Indies played in the USA earlier this year.
