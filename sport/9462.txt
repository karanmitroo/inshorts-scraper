The curator at the Wankhede stadium, Ramesh Mamunkar, has said that the wicket will start turning from the second day of the fourth India-England Test, which starts December 8. "There's heavy dew these days...we're watering the pitch less. We've cut the grass too," he added. Notably, spinners have taken 64 wickets out of the 98 wickets fallen in the series.
