England all-rounder Moeen Ali took a dig at commentator Aakash Chopra after the latter shared a video on Twitter claiming that Ali could not hit his way out of a bouncer-trap. In reply, Ali tweeted a screenshot of Chopra's Test career stats and sarcastically thanked him for his opinion. However, Ali deleted the tweet later and apologised to Chopra.
