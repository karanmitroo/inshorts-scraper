Indian shooter Heena Sidhu has pulled out of the Asian Airgun Shooting Championship to be held in Iran in December, following a compulsion on female shooters to wear the hijab. Heena tweeted, "Im not a revolutionary. But I feel dat making it mandatory for even a sportsperson to wear hijab is not in the spirit of a Sport."
