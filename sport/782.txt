Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker does not know the whereabouts of five of his six Grand Slam trophies, reports said. The 50-year-old German has made an appeal to the public to help him find the trophies in order to pay off his debts. Becker, who won 64 titles in his career, was declared bankrupt in June last year.
