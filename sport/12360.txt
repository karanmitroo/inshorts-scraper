The Sri Lankan cricket board has lodged a complaint against Australia's newly-appointed bowling consultant Muttiah Muralitharan, accusing him of violating ground rules. He allegedly forced the groundsmen to let Australian players practice on the field without permission. Muralitharan responded by saying the board is looking for a fall guy to blame if Sri Lanka loses the upcoming Australia series.
