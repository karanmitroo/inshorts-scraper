Former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson has revealed the team's atmosphere during Michael Clarke's captaincy was "toxic". "The dynamics definitely changed. It became more groups...It wasn't a team...Even some of the young guys coming through could see it a mile away and they didn't enjoy it," said Johnson. Clarke and Johnson weren't on good terms following a spat in 2013.
