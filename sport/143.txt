Before India-England's 2011 World Cup match on February 27, 2011, ex-Australian spinner Shane Warne put out a tweet predicting the match would end in a tie. Warne's prediction came true when England scored 338/8 in reply to India's 338, and he was termed a 'genius' by then England captain Andrew Strauss. Many Pakistani cricketers demanded ICC to investigate Warne's 'prediction'.
