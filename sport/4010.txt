England's Geoff Hurst, who is the only player in football history to score a hat-trick in the FIFA World Cup final, also played first-class cricket. Hurst scored three goals in England's only World Cup final win, on July 30, 1966, when they beat West Germany 4-2. In 1962, he had represented Essex in county cricket, but never scored a run.
