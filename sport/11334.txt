ICC CEO Dave Richardson, while visiting Pakistan, said that international cricket will resume in the country only if the security situation improves. Pakistan has not hosted a full Test series at home against any team since March 2009, when militants attacked the visiting Sri Lankan team in Lahore. UAE has been the team's unofficial home venue since then.
