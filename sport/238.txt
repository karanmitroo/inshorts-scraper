While responding to a question on risk of burnout for players due to a lot of T20 cricket, former India captain Sourav Ganguly said cricket cannot survive without the T20 format. Recently, ex-England captain Kevin Pietersen had predicted that only five Test nations will be left in next 10 years. India will be playing 21 T20Is in the 2018-19 season.
