Former West Indies cricketer Sir Vivian Richards has spoken against BCCI campaigning to retain its majority revenue share in ICC, saying "every dog has his day". "We as West Indies during our hay day made a lot of teams make money by going for tours...it should be equal because everyone is making a contribution to the international stage," said Richards.
