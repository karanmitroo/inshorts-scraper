Chettithody Shamshuddin decided to stand down from the role of the on-field umpire for the final T20I after criticism by England captain Eoin Morgan. Shamshuddin is officiating as the third umpire and Nitin Menon has replaced him as the on-field umpire. The 46-year-old made several mistakes in the Nagpur T20I, including Joe Root's dismissal in the final over.
