After Rahul Dravid-coached India Under-19 team won the World Cup on Saturday, cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Every Indian is delighted, all credit to Rahul Dravid for committing himself to these young kids, and a legend like him deserves to lay his hands on the WC. Only Fitting." He added that India Under-19 boys are in the "safest hands" of Dravid.
