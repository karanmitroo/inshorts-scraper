Sydney Thunder's wicketkeeper Jay Lenton flew to his left to successfully complete a one-handed catch to dismiss Hobart Hurricanes' opener D'Arcy Short in Big Bash League on Sunday. Short had edged a Pat Cummins delivery in the second over when Lenton dived and stretched his left hand to hold onto the ball. Sydney Thunder won the match by 6 wickets.
