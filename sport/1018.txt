England is the only country to appear in two Test matches in two countries of two different continents on the same day. England beat New Zealand in Christchurch on January 13, 1930, the same day another England team was playing a Test against Windies in Barbados. England had sent different teams to the Caribbean and New Zealand to promote cricket.
