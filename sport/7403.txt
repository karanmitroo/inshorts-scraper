Pacer S Sreesanth is considering taking the BCCI and ICC to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over his life ban, the player's associate has revealed. In 2015, Sreesanth was acquitted of spot-fixing charges by a Delhi court, but the Board refused to lift his ban. Sreesanth was recently denied an NOC by BCCI for playing in Scotland and Kerala.
