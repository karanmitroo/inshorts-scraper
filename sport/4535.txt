Pakistan's limited-overs captain Sarfraz Ahmed has been named the side's Test captain by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Tuesday. Sarfraz recently led the Pakistani cricket team to its maiden Champions Trophy title. The 30-year-old wicketkeeper will take over from Misbah-ul-Haq, who stepped down as the Test side's skipper after Pakistan's series against West Indies.
