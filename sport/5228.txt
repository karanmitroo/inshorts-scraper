During the 2000 Champions Trophy, Sachin Tendulkar told Australian bowler Glenn McGrath that he would "hit him out of the ground". "He got really angry and started spraying the ball around... My sledging did work for the team," Sachin later recalled. McGrath failed to take a single wicket in that match as Australia were eliminated in the tournament quarter-finals.
