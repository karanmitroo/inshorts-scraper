Mumbai Indians bowler Harbhajan Singh posted a video on Twitter mocking teammate Tim Southee's mid-journey loo break while the team was travelling in their bus. Southee is seen walking into a hotel while Harbhajan asks the others if they know where he has gone. He captioned the video, "When the tummy acts funny...timmy's tummy goes #timmystummy #funny #WhenYouNeedaLoo @mipaltan."
