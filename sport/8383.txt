The first-ever six in international cricket was hit by Australia's Joe Darling on January 14, 1898, almost 21 years after the first-ever international match was played. Back then, a six had to be hit out of the ground as hits over the boundary counted as five. Darling smacked the ball out of Adelaide Oval to reach his century against England.
