After the hacking of WADA's medical database, hackers revealed that USA's athletes including Serena Williams and Simone Biles had been given 'Therapeutic Use Exemption' for usage of otherwise banned substances. "By virtue of TUE, Biles has not broken any drug-testing regulations, including at the Rio Olympics", USA Gymnastics said. Hackers claim that the exemptions equal "licences for doping".
