Sachin Tendulkar on Friday shared on Twitter a handwritten letter from one of his fans from Kerala. The fan compared Tendulkar's batting to a 'poem written with a cricket bat'. "Anjana, thank you so much for your letter! It is fans like you who have inspired me to keep striving to do better and better...#FanFriday," Tendulkar captioned the post.
