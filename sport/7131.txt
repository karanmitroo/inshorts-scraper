Former Zimbabwe cricketers Mark Vermeulen and Brendan Taylor were involved in a Facebook spat regarding Zimbabwe's performance. Vermeulen expressed disappointment at Zimbabwe's performance against Afghanistan, after which Taylor called Vermeulen as being "chemically imbalanced". "Unfortunately Zimbabwe Cricket did produce the most psycho player ever," Taylor later tweeted about Vermeulen.
