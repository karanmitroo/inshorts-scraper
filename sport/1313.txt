India's stand-in captain Rohit Sharma said that coach Ravi Shastri was the first person to use 'Hitman' on-air as a nickname for him in 2013. Sharma was playing against Australia when Shastri heard someone call Rohit a 'Hitman', before using the nickname himself while commentating. Rohit recently smashed T20I cricket's joint-fastest ton in the 2nd T20I against Sri Lanka.
