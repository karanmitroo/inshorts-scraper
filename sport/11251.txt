The Karnataka Premier League has introduced the Pitchcam, a camera encased in a special case created from hard glass, which is placed at the edge of the pitch and on the popping crease. The Pitchcam provides a closer view of the batsman's stance and shot making, without distracting or obstructing the players involved in the match.
