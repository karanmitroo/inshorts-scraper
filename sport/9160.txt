England batsman Joe Root did batting practice on a concrete road in Chennai's Chepauk Stadium compound ahead of the India-England Test, since the pitch was wet following Cyclone Vardah, which hit the city recently. England Cricket tweeted a video of Root practising with two members of the team's support staff, captioned, "No nets? No problem...@root66 will practice anywhere #INDvENG."
