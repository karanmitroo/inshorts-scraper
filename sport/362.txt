American radio host Patrick Connor has been fired by KNBR of San Francisco for calling 17-year-old American snowboarder and 2018 Winter Olympics gold medallist Chloe Kim "a hot piece of a**". Connor made the comments during a show with his other employer Barstool Sports, and remains employed by them. "I apologise for being a total idiot," Connor later tweeted.
