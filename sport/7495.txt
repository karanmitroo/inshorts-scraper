Responding to the criticism he faced for using the hashtag #OtherMenInBlue for the Indian Blind cricket team, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Better do some research before commenting. But research &media/you don't go hand in hand.It is their official campaign theme." Earlier, Indian Blind cricket team captain Ajay Reddy had said that they too were the men in blue after Sehwag's tweet.
