Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed and Zimbabwe's Graeme Cremer are among the three international captains who have reported match-fixing approaches to ICC in the last two months, according to reports. Ahmed was contacted before an ODI in October while Cremer rejected a fixing offer by a Zimbabwe cricket board member, reports added. The name of the third captain is not known yet.
