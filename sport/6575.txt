During the Dharamsala Test against Australia on Tuesday, Indian opener Murali Vijay edged the ball and got caught behind, but remained not out because the Australians did not appeal. During the 12th over of India's second innings, Vijay got some glove on a Pat Cummins delivery which was caught by Matthew Wade. Nobody appealed, but UltraEdge showed a nick.
