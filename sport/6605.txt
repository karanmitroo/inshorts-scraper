Opener Lokesh Rahul, who hit his fifth 50 in six innings against Australia in the Dharamsala Test on Sunday, said the first session on Day 2 was the toughest he has ever faced in his career. "Hazlewood and Cummins put the ball in the right areas and swung the ball, bowled with lot of pace and venom," Rahul added.
