Sri Lankan batsman Dilruwan Perera, who was given out LBW on Mohammed Shami's delivery, asked for a DRS review after he started walking off. Perera allegedly looked towards the dressing room before immediately turning around to take the review, which overturned on-field umpire's decision. As per ICC rules, taking inputs for DRS from anyone other than on-field players is illegal.
