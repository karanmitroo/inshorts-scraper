Wrestlers Geeta and Babita Phogat have condemned Gurmehar Kaur after her picture with a placard which read, "Pakistan did not kill my father. War killed him" went viral. "If you speak against nation, people will obviously not like it," said Geeta. "Kaur's view that her father was killed by war...was wrong...It's against our nation & martyrs," said Babita.
