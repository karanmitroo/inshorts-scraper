Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes, who was known for his fielding skills, has picked Suresh Raina as the best Indian fielder ahead of the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif. "[Raina] goes for the ball, regardless of whether he thinks he can get it or not. He reminds me a lot of a much younger Jonty," Rhodes said.
