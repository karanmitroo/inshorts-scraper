Afghanistan will play a team from Marylebone Cricket Club, led by former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, at Lord's on July 11. This will be Afghanistan's first match at the venue, which is hosting an associate nation for the second time in as many seasons. Afghan players Mohammad Nabi and Hamid Hassan earlier took part in MCC's Young Cricketers programme.
