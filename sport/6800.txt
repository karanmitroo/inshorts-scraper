As per reports, batsmen will wear helmet cameras in the tenth season of the IPL, which begins on April 5. The 100-gram cameras, which have been used in Australia's Big Bash League, will be stuck on the peak of the helmet with their weight being evenly distributed front-to-back. Fabric shrouds are reportedly being produced in each IPL team's colour.
