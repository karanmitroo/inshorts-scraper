Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja took a running catch on the fifth day of the Chennai Test to dismiss England's Jonny Bairstow. Jadeja ran backwards from midwicket to take the catch near the boundary after Bairstow flicked the ball in the air. Kapil Dev took a similar catch in the 1983 World Cup final to dismiss West Indies' Viv Richards.
