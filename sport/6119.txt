West Indies legend Sir Viv Richards scored Test cricket's then fastest ton, a record that stood for 30 years, smashing a 56-ball century against the English cricket team on April 15, 1986. Richards, whose unbeaten 58-ball 110 included seven fours and seven sixes, helped West Indies complete a series "blackwash" with a 240-run victory in the fifth Test.
