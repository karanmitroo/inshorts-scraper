Former cricketer Brian Lara's request to name a stand after Sachin Tendulkar at the upcoming Brian Lara Stadium in West Indies, has been denied. The President of Trinidad and Tobago board, Azim Bassarath, said, "India have so many stadia...none of them have stands named after our West Indian greats so why must we name a stand after Tendulkar?"
