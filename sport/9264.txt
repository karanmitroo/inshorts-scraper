Praising Virat Kohli for his knock of 235 runs in the Wankhede Test, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said "the world will be at Kohli's feet in a few years' time". Ganguly further said that the circumstances in which Kohli gets his runs make him stand out. "He just stamps his authority to win...be it in ODIs, Tests...T20Is," Ganguly added.
