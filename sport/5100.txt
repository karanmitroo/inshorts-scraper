Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has revealed Virender Sehwag hit Harbhajan Singh for 12 sixes in a game in Rohtak, while being down with fever. Ashwin added that Sehwag did not consider off-spinners to be bowlers and he found it easy playing them. "I realised one fine day that it was Sehwag's ego that you needed to bowl against," said Ashwin.
