Karnataka batsman Manish Pandey got run-out, during his team's Vijay Hazare Trophy quarter-final match against Baroda, after his bat got stuck in the ground 60 centimetres from the crease. Pandey was running for a quick second run when a Baroda fielder threw the ball towards the bowler, who knocked the bails off while Pandey's feet were still in the air.
