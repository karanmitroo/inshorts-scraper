Reacting to Rising Pune Supergiant coach Stephen Fleming wearing a suit in the dugout during the IPL final, a user tweeted, "Not sure whether Fleming dressed up for IPL final or Cannes." Other tweets read, "Do we have a football manager on a cricket field," and, "Can we please take a moment to truly appreciate how @SPFleming7, looks and all?"
