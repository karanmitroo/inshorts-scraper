Ex-Indian captain Kapil Dev has said that pacer Ishant Sharma lacks wicket-taking ability  despite being a "very good bowler". "He has to develop the wicket-taking ball...It's not about bowling two very good deliveries in an over, you have to bowl five good balls," added Kapil. Sharma is back in the Test squad after missing the NZ Tests due to chikungunya.
