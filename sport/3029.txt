A nine-year-old footballer died after a goalpost collapsed on him during a Juventus Soccer Academy session in New York City on Sunday. Tommaso Cerase was playing in goal when he jumped up to swing on the bar before the goalpost toppled over and landed on him. Cerase was taken to the Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
