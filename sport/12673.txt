Reacting to France defeating Germany 2-0 in the Euro Cup semi-final on Thursday, a user tweeted, “Turns out wine is healthier than beer after all. #GERFRA.” Other tweets read, “Now France almost has a goal for every time they've been invaded by Germany in the past 150 years”, and “Can we have one hour more of this game please?”
