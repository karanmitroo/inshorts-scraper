The media village housing journalists covering the Rio Olympics, has been built on a mass grave of African slaves. Members of Camorim Quilombo, a community of descendants of runaway slaves, earlier resisted the construction of the village, since they considered the site sacred. The community has written to Rio mayor Eduardo Paes to complain about environmental damage in the area.
