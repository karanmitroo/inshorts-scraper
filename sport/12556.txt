Former England batsman Michael Carberry, who played for England from 2010 to 2014, has been diagnosed with a cancerous tumour. Carberry was left out of Hampshireâ€™s county match this week to undergo tests, which revealed the illness. Earlier in 2010, Carberry suffered from a severe lung disease, which had kept him out of action for eight months.
