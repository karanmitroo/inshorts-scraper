A fan of captain Virat Kohli was detained after he entered the ground to congratulate the Indian skipper after he scored his 32nd ODI century against New Zealand in Kanpur on Sunday. The fan jumped on to the ground and started running towards him with a shirt bearing Kohli's name, before being stopped near the square leg umpire.
