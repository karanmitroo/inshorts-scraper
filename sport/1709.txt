After scoring his sixth Test double ton, Indian batsman Virat Kohli became the Test captain with the most number of double centuries to his name, surpassing former West Indies captain Brian Lara's five. Kohli also became only the sixth player to score double hundreds in consecutive innings. Notably, prior to 2016, Kohli did not have a single Test double ton.
