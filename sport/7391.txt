Pakistan Cricket Board has charged players Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif under its anti-corruption code on Saturday and gave them 14 days to respond to the charges. The charge sheet was issued after the players pleaded not guilty and denied any role in spot-fixing during the Pakistan Super League. Both the players were representating Islamabad United in the tournament.
