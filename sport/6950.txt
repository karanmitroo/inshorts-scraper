Three footballers from the football club Toluca of Mexico's Copa MX league each saw a red card in a span of about 30 seconds during their match against Morelia on Thursday. Jesús Méndez was handed a second yellow for a late tackle, following which two of his teammates including the goalkeeper reacted aggressively to the decision and were sent off.
