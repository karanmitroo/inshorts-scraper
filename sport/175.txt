Virat Kohli, who received the ICC Test Championship mace on Saturday, said that Team India is still 80% in Tests despite being world number one. "When we're able to achieve what we want to in...(England and Australia), we'll be more content. But our 80% is also exciting. To be a world-class side, you have to be 100%," he added.
