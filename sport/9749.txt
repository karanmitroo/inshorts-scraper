Former Pakistani cricketers including Abdul Qadir and Haroon Rashid have demanded the International Cricket Council (ICC) to take action against India's Test captain Virat Kohli after ball tampering allegations were levelled against him. Qadir said that if the ICC doesnâ€™t take action against Kohli then ICC's member cricket boards should pressurise it to take action.
