Six Afghan girls have been denied visas to travel to the US for an international robotics competition, while the robot built by them has been allowed entry. On being asked why the girls were banned, an official cited regulations prohibiting the agency from discussing individual visa cases. The girls will watch their robot compete via live-streaming, the contest organisers said.
