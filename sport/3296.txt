Bangladeshi all-rounder Nasir Hossain stood beside umpire Nigel Llong and imitated him after a successful review dismissed Australia's Pat Cummins in the Chittagong Test on Wednesday. Hossain, along with the umpire, gave the 'change of decision' and 'out' signals. Mehidy Hasan Miraz's LBW appeal was initially given not out, following which Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim reviewed the decision.
