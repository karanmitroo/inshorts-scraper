Ravichandran Ashwin mocked Australia's Mitchell Starc after claiming his wicket during the Bengaluru Test on Tuesday, by imitating the latter's gesture of pointing to the forehead. Starc had earlier gestured similarly towards Indian opener Abhinav Mukund when the latter had hit his bouncer for a six on day three. Ashwin repeated the same action when he bowled Starc.
