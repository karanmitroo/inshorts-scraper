Several cricketers engaged in Twitter banter in 2016, including Virender Sehwag, who teased New Zealand's Ross Taylor for tagging him in a tweet. Sehwag tweeted "What happened Taylor ji.. Why tagging without typing," following which Taylor replied that it was done by his daughter. In another instance, Sehwag asked Sachin Tendulkar to encourage the commentators, not just the cricketers.
