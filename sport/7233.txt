Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who had predicted a 4-0 series win for India, on Saturday blamed Pune's pitch for the 333-run loss suffered by India in the opening match of the four-match series. "Credit to @CricketAus for playing unbelievably well on that wicket.let's hope we play on good tracks from here onwards and get the right results," read Harbhajan's tweet.
