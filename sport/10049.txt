West Indian cricketer Darren Bravo was replaced in the team's squad for a triangular series in Zimbabwe, after he tweeted that the country's cricket board chief Dave Cameron was a 'big idiot'. Bravo made the comments after being given a grade 'C' contract due to his falling average. "You hav been failing 4 d last 4yrs...Big idiot @davec51," tweeted Bravo.
