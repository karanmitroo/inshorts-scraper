Fifa on Thursday announced that it has upheld the transfer bans on Spanish football clubs Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid for the next two transfer windows. The ban has been imposed on them for breaching rules on signing non-Spanish under-18 players. The body has also imposed a $923,000 fine on Atlético and a $370,000 fine on Real Madrid.
