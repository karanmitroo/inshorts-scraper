Romania's Gabriel Sincraian, who won bronze in the men's 85 kg category in the Rio Olympics, has tested positive for excess testosterone. The International Olympic Committee is yet to decide whether Sincraian's medal will be passed to fourth-placed Denis Ulanov of Kazakhstan. The lifter has already served a two-year ban for a past offence, and risks a lifetime suspension now.
