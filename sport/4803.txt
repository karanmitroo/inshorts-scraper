The communication between the Indian cricket team's coach Anil Kumble and the team's captain Virat Kohli had reportedly stopped almost six months ago. Kumble had cited in his statement following his departure that the relationship with the team's captain had become 'untenable'. BCCI General Manager MV Sridhar will supervise the team during the upcoming tour to the Caribbean.
