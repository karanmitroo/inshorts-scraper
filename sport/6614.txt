Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger slammed a troll on Facebook who insulted the Special Olympics by saying it makes no sense as the Olympics is only there for the world's best athletes to compete. Responding to this comment, Arnold wrote, "I guarantee you that these athletes have more courage, compassion, brains, skill - actually, more of every positive human quality than you."
