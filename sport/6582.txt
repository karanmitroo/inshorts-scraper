Sachin Tendulkar came out to open the innings for the first time in international cricket on March 27, 1994, against New Zealand in Auckland. Sachin got a chance to open as Navjot Singh Sidhu, the first-choice opener, woke up with a stiff neck and did not play the ODI. Tendulkar scored 82 off 49 balls in his innings.
