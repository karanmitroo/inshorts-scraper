Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar overtook Mohammad Azharuddin to become ODI cricket's highest run-getter in 81 fewer ODIs than the latter. Sachin, playing in his 253rd ODI against New Zealand on October 15, 2000, smashed 69 runs to overhaul Azharuddin's 9,378 ODI runs, which had come in 334 ODIs. Sachin's record as highest ODI run-getter is still unbroken.
