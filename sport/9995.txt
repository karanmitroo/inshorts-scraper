A group of 25 swimmers is attempting to swim across the Dead Sea in a bid to draw attention to the environmental degradation that the lake is undergoing. The 15-kilometre swim from Jordan to Israel will last for approximately seven hours. Unsustainable water management and over-exploitation of the lake's minerals have been attributed for the lake's shrinkage over the years.
