Italian football team skipper Gianluigi Buffon won 2016's Golden Foot award at a ceremony in Monaco. The 38-year-old goalkeeper, who was also voted the best player of 2003's UEFA Champions League in Monaco, said, "Now I'm thinking about winning other awards". The Golden Foot award, won by Samuel Eto'o last year, is given in recognition of a player's athletic achievements.
