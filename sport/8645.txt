Reacting to MS Dhoni's resignation as India's limited-overs skipper, Virat Kohli tweeted, "Thanks for always being the leader a youngster wants to have around him. You'll always be my captain @msdhoni Bhai." Kohli was made the Test captain after Dhoni retired mid-series during the Australia tour in 2014. Moreover, Kohli was named India's ODI and T20I captain on Friday.
