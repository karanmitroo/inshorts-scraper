Former Indian cricketer Jacob Martin, who has a criminal history, has been appointed as the Baroda Ranji team's head coach. Martin, who is yet to be proven guilty, was arrested in 2009 in Delhi in connection with a 2003 human-trafficking case. Currently, Martin is out on bail as "there was no concrete evidence to press charge against him".
