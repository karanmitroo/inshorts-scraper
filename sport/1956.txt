Indian pacers took all Sri Lankan wickets in the first innings in Kolkata, marking the first instance of Indian pacers dismissing all batsmen in an innings of a home Test after 34 years. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami took four each, while Umesh Yadav took two. The previous instance was against Windies in 1983, when Kapil Dev posted career-best 9/83.
