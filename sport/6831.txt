Ending a streak of 41 Tests, Australia are playing without a player named 'Mitchell' in their playing XI for the first time in almost four years, in the Ranchi Test against India which began on Thursday. Since the Test against England at Chester-le-Street in August 2013, either Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Marsh or Mitchell Johnson has played for Australia.
