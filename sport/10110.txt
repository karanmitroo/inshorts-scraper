Olympians Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar met Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday seeking permission to begin their professional boxing careers. Both boxers, who are serving as DSPs in the Haryana Police, have already requested for permission from the Haryana Police's DGP. Olympic bronze medalist Vijender Singh, who turned professional last year, had also followed the same route.
