Ramchandra Guha, who resigned from the Supreme Court-appointed BCCI's Committee of Administrators, has questioned the â‚¹2 crore Grade 'A' contract given to MS Dhoni, despite him not playing Tests. In a letter to CoA Chief Vinod Rai, Guha highlighted BCCI's "superstar culture" and blamed the Committee of "silence and inaction" over the reported rift between Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli.
