Melbourne Renegades' Callum Ferguson, while fielding at the deep backward square, completed a diving catch to dismiss Adelaide Strikers' Kieron Pollard. Pollard had pulled a short ball flat towards the deep backward square boundary off a Thisara Perera delivery in the 14th over. Ferguson dived to his left and held on to the ball at head height near the boundary.
