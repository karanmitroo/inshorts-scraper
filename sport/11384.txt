Mumbai's host stadium for the 2011 World Cup final, Wankhede Cricket Stadium is set to be renamed as a part of a sponsorship deal. The ground, named originally after the former president of the Bombay Cricket Association SK Wankhede, will accommodate a sponsor's name after the deal between Mumbai Cricket Association and advertising company DDB Mudra, is finalised.
