Ajinkya Rahane took a one-handed catch at first slip to dismiss England's Joe Root during the Mohali Test on Tuesday. In the 67th over, Root attempted a straight drive on a Ravindra Jadeja delivery which was turning off, resulting in an edge towards Rahane, which he caught with his left hand in a reflex. Root was dismissed for 78(179).
