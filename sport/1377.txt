A Test is considered drawn, and not tied if the batting team has wickets remaining when the time expires, even if the scores are level. A Test can be termed tied only if the chasing side gets all-out with the scores level. The Bulawayo Test between England and Zimbabwe was declared drawn with the scores level, on December 22, 1996.
