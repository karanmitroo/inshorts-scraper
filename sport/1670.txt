Australia lost both their reviews within three balls while defending 354 against England in the second Ashes Test. Australia burnt their first review against England captain Joe Root and the second against Dawid Malan. Earlier, teams used to get two unsuccessful reviews every 80 overs in an innings, but new rules allow just two reviews in an entire innings.
