National-level hockey player Rizwan Khan was found dead with a bullet wound on his right temple in his car and a gun in his hand on Tuesday in Delhi. The body was found near his female friend's house. While the police said prima facie it appeared to be a suicide case, Khan's family suspects he was murdered.
