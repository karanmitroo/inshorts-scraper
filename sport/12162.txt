New Zealand captain Kane Williamson became the first Kiwi player to score a century against all Test-playing nations after scoring 113 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Sunday. Williamson is the 13th player in the world to do so, but is the quickest in terms of innings, age, time from debut and number of tons taken to reach the milestone.
