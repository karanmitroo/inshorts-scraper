Former Pakistani pacer Jalal-ud-Din picked up ODI cricket's first-ever hat-trick in his career's second ODI, against Australia on September 20, 1982. Jalal-ud-Din achieved the feat by dismissing Rod Marsh, Bruce Yardley and Geoff Lawson with the last three balls of his seventh over. The pacer went on to play eight ODIs for Pakistan, picking up a total of 14 wickets.
