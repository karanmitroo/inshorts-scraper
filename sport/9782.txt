Australia's colour-blind wicketkeeper Matthew Wade has been picked for the team's upcoming day-night Test against South Africa. Wade admitted his vision problem makes it difficult with the pink ball under lights but said he is confident of adapting. Former Australian opener Chris Rogers also suffered from colour-blindness and had withdrawn from a pink ball match in 2014.
