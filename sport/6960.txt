Former Indian captain MS Dhoni visited the Jharkhand State Cricket Association Stadium in Ranchi on Wednesday and inspected the pitch. Dhoni met the curator SB Singh and had a discussion about the wicket, though the latter insisted he was giving inputs and not intervening in pitch preparation. Ranchi will host its maiden Test on March 16.
