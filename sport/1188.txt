Former heavyweight boxing world champion Mike Tyson is reportedly opening up his own cannabis resort. This comes after California's recent legislation for recreational marijuana. Tyson has bought a 40-acre property in California City, with 20 acres dedicated to marijuana cultivation, as per reports. Tyson also plans to open Tyson Cultivation School to instruct farmers on how to grow cannabis.
