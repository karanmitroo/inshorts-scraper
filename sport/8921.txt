Australian spinner Nathan Lyon foiled a record attempt by taking a wicket during the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan on Monday. Around 22,000 spectators had planned to set a world record of most people shouting "Nice Garry" simultaneously on Lyon's third ball. The record attempt was inspired by keeper Matthew Wade saying "Nice Garry", referring to the bowler's nickname.
