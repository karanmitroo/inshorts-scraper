Virat Kohli, who was named India's limited-overs captain on Friday, says his predecessor MS Dhoni saved him from getting dropped from the team on many occasions. "He'll always be the person who guided me...He gave me ample space to grow...He also saved me from getting dropped from the team many times. That's why, there's huge amount of respect," added Kohli.
