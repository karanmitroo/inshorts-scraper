Former Indian wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia's 18-year-old son Mohit slammed 260 runs off 266 balls for Baroda against Kerala, breaking his father's nearly 30-year-old record of the highest score by a Baroda batsman in the Cooch Behar Trophy. Nayan had hit 224 in 1988 against Mumbai, the then highest score for any Baroda Under-19 batsman in the tournament.
