Former recipients of the Arjuna Award, including ex-India hockey captain Ashok Kumar and former Indian volleyball skipper Suresh Mishra, claim that the honour has been "devalued" and made "cheap". "The dignity has to be maintained. Why do you need to give Arjuna every year? Is it necessary? We are now throwing the awards away," Kumar said.
