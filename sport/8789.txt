Former Australian spinner Shane Warne, who made his Test debut on January 2, 1992, conceded 150 runs and took just one wicket in the Test. Warne, who later became the first cricketer to pick 700 Test wickets, dismissed Ravi Shastri in his debut Test and failed to pick a wicket at all in his next Test.
