Pacer Irfan Pathan has blamed his exclusion from the Indian team on his recurrent injuries, rather than on former coach Greg Chappell who was in charge of India from 2005 to 2007. "No one can ruin anyone's career...When I was dropped from the team, I was injured... Making a comeback was a bit difficult. I don't blame anyone," said Irfan.
