Wimbledon’s trademark towels, considered a keepsake by players, are being manufactured by an Indian company, Welspun, in Vapi, Gujarat, since 2009. Recently, world number one Novak Djokovic admitted to sneaking extra towels to give away as souvenirs. “It makes a lot of people who are close to me back in my country happy. The towels are great memorabilia,” said Djokovic.
