Sri Lanka dismissed India for their lowest all-out ODI score at home in 24 years after restricting the side to 112 in the first ODI on Sunday. In the 38.2-over innings, India faced 13 maidens, the most for the Indian side in ODI cricket history. This was also the third-lowest score at which India got dismissed while at home.
