Australian cricketer David Warner has defended using thick, lightweight bats and said that flat pitches are responsible for the batting-bowling imbalance in cricket. "If we look around the country, I think the wickets are pretty much dictating,” said Warner. Recently, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting had said that bat thickness must be regulated in Test cricket to ensure balance.
