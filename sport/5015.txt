Pakistan-born London terrorist Khuram Butt, who masterminded last Saturday's London Bridge attack, was trying to land a job with a firm that provides security at Wimbledon and other sporting events. The 27-year-old had previously worked six months with the London Underground metro before quitting in October. Butt and his aides rammed a high-speed van into pedestrians on the London Bridge.
