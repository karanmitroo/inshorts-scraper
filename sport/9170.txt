Ishant Sharma picked up his 100th Test wicket in Asia after dismissing Keaton Jennings caught behind off a full-length delivery. Sharma bowled five consecutive good-length deliveries to push Jennings back inside the crease before bowling the full-length delivery. Jennings stayed inside the crease thinking it to be another good-length and drove it without any foot movement which caused the edge.
