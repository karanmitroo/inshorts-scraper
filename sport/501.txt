Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga, who went unsold at the 2018 IPL auctions after playing 10 seasons with Mumbai Indians, hinted at possible retirement, saying he is mentally done with cricket. The 34-year-old has picked 101 wickets in 30 Tests, while he has 391 scalps in 272 limited-over internationals to his name. Notably, Malinga is IPL's highest wicket-taker.
