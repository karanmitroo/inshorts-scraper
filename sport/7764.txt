ICC has introduced a system of demerit points for venues producing substandard pitches and outfields, which will lead to a ban for defaulting on a regular basis. A venue will be suspended for 12 months when it gets five demerit points and 24 months on reaching 10 demerit points. The points will remain active for a five-year period.
