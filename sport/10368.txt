Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered authorities to build a house for Bangladesh's 19-year-old cricketer Mehedi Hasan Miraz in his home town of Khulna. Making his international debut, Hasan was adjudged the Man of the Series for his 19 wickets in the two Tests against England and was reported to have struggled against poverty while captaining Bangladesh's junior sides.
