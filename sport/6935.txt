Bangladesh opener Soumya Sarkar was clean bowled by Sri Lankan bowler Asela Gunaratne, but still took a DRS review during the Galle Test on Saturday. Gunaratne bowled a straight-pitched delivery which spun away and clipped the top of off stump. Sarkar, who had scored his second half-century of the match, thought he was caught behind and asked for a review.
