After getting trolled by former South African cricketer Herschelle Gibbs over his running speed on Twitter, Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin responded with a match-fixing jibe aimed at Gibbs. Ashwin cited Gibbs' involvement in the 1999 match-fixing scandal and said he wasn't as fast as him, but he was "blessed with wonderfully ethical mind not to fix games".
