Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar attended the Rajya Sabha a couple of days after Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agrawal asked him and actress Rekha to resign from their positions due to their low attendance. Among the 12 nominated members, Sachin and veteran actress Rekha were found to be among the worst performers in terms of attendance in the Rajya Sabha.
