English all-rounder Ben Stokes, who became IPL's most expensive overseas player last year, was bought by Rajasthan Royals for ₹12.5 crore. IPL has granted the option to replace Stokes if he misses the tournament over his involvement in legal proceedings. Royals used their Right to Match option to buy Ajinkya Rahane after Kings XI Punjab bought him for ₹4 crore.
