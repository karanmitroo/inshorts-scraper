Former captain Sourav Ganguly has backed BCCI's decision to not play cricket with Pakistan, saying, "Terrorism is an issue and you can't play cricket (with Pakistan) when people are getting killed at borders." Earlier, BCCI president Anurag Thakur said there was no question of playing cricket with Pakistan as it "sponsored terrorism". India-Pakistan cricket ties have been strained since 2012.
