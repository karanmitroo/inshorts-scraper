Muhammad Ali was inspired to become a boxer after his red-and-white Schwinn bicycle was stolen in 1954. The then 12-year-old reported the theft to a policeman and told him he wanted to beat whoever stole it. Joe Martin, the policeman, who was also a boxing trainer, suggested Ali to first learn how to fight and began his boxing training.
