For the first time in Formula One history, a commoner will wave the chequered flag at the Austrian Grand Prix this Sunday. The promotional move is aimed at increasing ticket sales which have dropped considerably. Fans with race tickets are required to upload a picture or video of themselves waving the flag to stand a chance to win the competition.
