Russian wrestler Khasan Baroev, who was recently stripped of his 2008 Olympic silver medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), said he will go to court to petition against the decision. IOC had issued a statement saying it disqualified Baroev from the 2008 Beijing Games after reanalysis of his samples resulted in a positive test for a prohibited substance.
