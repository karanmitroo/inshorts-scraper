Former WWE wrestler CM Punk made his UFC debut on Saturday and lost in the opening round against 24-year-old welterweight fighter Mickey Gall in Cleveland, US. "This was a hell of a mountain to try to climb. I didn’t get to the top tonight", the 37-year-old said, and added, "Life’s about falling down and getting back up."
