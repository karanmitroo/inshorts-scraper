MS Dhoni dismissed Windies captain Jason Holder in the second ODI at Port of Spain on Sunday, which Twitter users described as the "slowest stumping ever". Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav bowled a googly while Dhoni collected the ball from the offside. He waited for Holder to make his ground, and then knocked off the bails in slow motion.
