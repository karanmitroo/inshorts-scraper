Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott suggested that he would have had a better chance of being knighted if he "blacked up" his face. Eleven West Indian cricketers have been knighted so far, while Sir Ian Botham was the last England cricketer to get a knighthood in 2007 for services to charity and cricket. Boycott later apologised for his remarks.
