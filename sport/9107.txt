Indian spinner Axar Patel came on as a substitute fielder in the fifth Test between India and England on Saturday. Fielding near the ropes Axar caught a lofted shot, but fell backwards, spurning the chance of a dismissal and injuring his hand in the process. Patel had to be immediately substituted by another substitute.
