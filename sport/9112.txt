Nine-time French Open champion Spain's Rafael Nadal has added former French Open champion and compatriot Carlos Moya in his coaching team after the latter parted ways with world number three Canada's Milos Raonic. The 30-year-old will retain his uncle Toni Nadal in his coaching team, who has been with him since childhood. Moya is a long-time friend of the Nadals.
