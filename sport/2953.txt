Indian cricket team's official Instagram handle mocked Australia's batting collapse in the third ODI by posting a picture of Virat Kohli with a caption that read, "Every Indian fan's reaction after the Australian batting collapse." Australia lost five wickets for 69 runs after being 224/1 in the 38th over. The post was, however, deleted later.
