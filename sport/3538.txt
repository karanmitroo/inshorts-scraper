Following his record 100-run eighth-wicket stand with MS Dhoni against Sri Lanka on Thursday, Bhuvneshwar Kumar revealed that Dhoni had told him not to take any pressure and play just like he would in a Test. The 27-year-old, who joined Dhoni when India were at 131/7, scored his maiden ODI fifty to help India chase the target.
