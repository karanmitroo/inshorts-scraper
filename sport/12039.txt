Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider naming a special aeroplane and train after India's Rio Olympics athletes Lalita Babar and Dipa Karmakar. Sehwag added that such a gesture "will encourage parents and inspire many youngsters to take up less popular sports as a career".
