The ongoing Kabaddi World Cup follows the standard rules of the game. Both teams have seven starting players and five substitutes. A raider's first goal is to get past the Baulk line in the opposite half and touch the opposition players before returning back, to earn points. If a raider fails to return, the opposition is awarded a point.
