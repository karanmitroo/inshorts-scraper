Rising Pune Supergiant's MS Dhoni trolled commentator Kevin Pietersen over the on-field microphone during their encounter against Mumbai Indians on Thursday. Pietersen asked Pune's Manoj Tiwary to tell Dhoni that he is better at golf than him, to which Dhoni replied, "He (Pietersen) is still my first Test wicket." Pietersen later said it was a referral rather than Dhoni's wicket.
