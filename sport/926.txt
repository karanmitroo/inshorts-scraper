India have called up Mumbai's Shardul Thakur and Delhi's Navdeep Saini to act as the team's net bowlers after the team management reportedly complained that South Africa have not provided them with quality net bowlers. Thakur, who is already a part of the squad for the upcoming ODIs, has been withdrawn from Mumbai's T20 squad for Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.
