Indian blind cricket team captain Ajay Reddy has responded to Virender Sehwag's tweet where he congratulated the team using the hashtag  "#OtherMenInBlue". "We wear the same blue jersey, represent the same tricolour and play with equal pride and passion, then why term us as other?" said Reddy. "[W]e are no others. We too are the men in blue," Reddy added.
