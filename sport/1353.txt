Indian Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra has requested the Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore to relieve him from key shooting posts to avoid a potential conflict of interest as he is also involved in private projects. Bindra holds the position of the National Observer for Shooting and is the Chairman of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme's Identification Committee.
