Chelsea extended their winning run to seven matches after ending Tottenham's season-long unbeaten run with a 2-1 London Derby win at the Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Christian Eriksen's 11th-minute goal opened the scoring for Spurs ahead of Pedro's curling equaliser at the half-way mark. Victor Moses' 51st-minute match-winner extended Chelsea's 26-year-long winning run in the London Derby at home.
