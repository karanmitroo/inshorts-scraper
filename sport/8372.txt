Bangladesh player Imrul Kayes set a world record for most catches taken by a substitute keeper in Tests, taking five during the ongoing Wellington Test against New Zealand on Sunday. Imrul came in place of an injured Mushfiqur Rahim in New Zealand's first innings, and matched the latter's record of highest wicketkeeping dismissals for Bangladesh.
