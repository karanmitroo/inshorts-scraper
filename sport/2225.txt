Reacting to MS Dhoni's full split that helped him evade a stumping in the second T20I against New Zealand, a user tweeted, "Dhoni is the Hrithik Roshan of cricket." Other users reacted with tweets like, "Do not even try to stump @msdhoni out students, He is the PRINCIPAL of that school" and "Size of India's defeat shown by Dhoni's feet."
