MS Dhoni has revealed he was not part of the conversation when he became captain in 2007. "Maybe it was the honesty...and my ability to read the game," said Dhoni on why he was made the captain. He added even though he was one of the youngest, he never hesitated to share his feelings about the game with senior players.
