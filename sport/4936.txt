Former Australian spinner Shane Warne wore the England team jersey after losing a bet against Sourav Ganguly. Warne and Ganguly had bet on the Australia-England Champions Trophy match, which Australia lost, making Warne wear the jersey. "I'm in a world of hurt wearing this shirt right now, but a bets a bet so on with the England shirt," Warne posted.
