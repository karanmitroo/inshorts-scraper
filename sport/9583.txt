Pakistan became the first-ever team to lose nine wickets in a Test's last session, collapsing from 131/1 to 230/10 in 30 overs against New Zealand on Tuesday. This is also Pakistan's third instance of losing 10 wickets for below 100 runs after first-wicket century stand. Notably, England once lost 10 wickets in one session, but in the Test's ninth session.
