As per reports, 10 players are not in favour of Anil Kumble continuing as coach of the Indian team, with only one player speaking in his support. The players have reportedly told BCCI that Kumble is "too bossy" and has an "inhuman approach while tackling fatigue and injury". Captain Virat Kohli has reportedly suggested Ravi Shastri's name for the post.
