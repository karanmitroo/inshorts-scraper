Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi has said that Pakistani cricketers should aim to surpass top players like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. The 36-year old attributed Pakistan's dismal showing in Australia to the substandard pitches found in Pakistan's domestic cricket. Pakistan lost five Tests on the trot in New Zealand and Australia.
