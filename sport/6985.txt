Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland has called Virat Kohli's allegations against Steve Smith "outrageous". Virat had alleged on Tuesday that the Australian team had, for three days consistently, turned towards the dressing room while taking DRS reviews. "We reject any commentary that suggests our integrity was brought into disrepute or that systemic unfair tactics are used," said Sutherland.
