Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath was shown a red card by umpire Billy Bowden for a mock underarm delivery in the first-ever T20I, on February 17, 2005. The pacer was re-enacting the 1981 incident when Australian player bowled underarm to save seven runs off the last ball. McGrath, however, was not sent off and finished the match with a wicket.
