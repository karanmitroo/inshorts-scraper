During the women's 5,000m race at the Rio Olympics, New Zealand's Nikki Hamblin tripped and fell, with American Abbey D'Agostino then tripping over Hamblin and falling as well. D'Agostino then helped the injured Hamblin up, and the two continued to run. "That girl was the Olympic spirit right there," Hamblin said after the duo had completed the race.
