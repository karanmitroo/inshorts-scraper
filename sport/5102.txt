Porn site RedTube became the shirt sponsor for amateur US football club Washington Square FC, with fans calling themselves the "RedTube Army". The fourth-tier team called the move an attempt to bring attention to lower-league football. Following the sponsorship, fans tweeted to the team with a post reading, "Gonna follow you guys from Australia because you seem like legends #redtubearmy."
