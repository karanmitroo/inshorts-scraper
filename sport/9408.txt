The Supreme Court allowed BCCI to spend ₹2.83 crore for the remaining part of the England series after the board filed a plea. SC allowed spending ₹1.33 crore for the remaining Tests and ₹25 lakh each for the three ODI and three T20I games. BCCI does not have access to funds since it has not complied with the Lodha reforms.
