Ivory Coast's Serge Aurier helped save Malian midfielder Moussa Doumbia's life during a World Cup qualifier match between the West African rivals on Saturday. Doumbia collapsed on the pitch after colliding with an opponent and appeared to have started swallowing his tongue, which was pulled out by Aurier. Aurier later visited Doumbia in the hospital as well.
