Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has said he has "utmost respect" for Virat Kohli after the latter attended late Aussie cricketer Phil Hughes' funeral in Australia during their tour. "This is clearly above the game of cricket...They could not have turned up for the funeral. They didn't have to do anything they did. I will always remember that," said Clarke.
