Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib al Hasan has displaced Ravichandran Ashwin as the top-ranked player in the ICC list of Test all-rounders. Ashwin, who has scored only 20 runs in four innings against Australia so far, had displaced Shakib from the top spot in December 2015. Notably, Ashwin and Jadeja occupy the top rank in the ICC Test bowler rankings.
