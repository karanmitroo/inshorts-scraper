World number 3, Roger Federer has never lost a semi-final match at Wimbledon Championships. The seventeen-time Grand Slam winner, who will make a record 11th Wimbledon semifinals appearance against Milos Raonic on Friday, has won seven Wimbledon titles, a joint all-time record with William Renshaw and Pete Sampras. He is also the only player to reach seven consecutive Wimbledon semifinals.
