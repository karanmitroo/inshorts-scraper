Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj Singh has accused MS Dhoni for his son's absence from the Indian squad. "Yuvraj is in the team because Dhoni is no longer the captain. I had said this couple of years ago that he would be back in the team once Dhoni wasn't the captain," said Yograj in a recent interview.
