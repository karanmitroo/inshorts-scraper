A street artist has drawn a graffiti portraying FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi kissing Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo on a bus stop in central Barcelona, ahead of the El Clasico encounter. The artist said he had been inspired by the fact that the El Clasico falls on April 23, the day when people in Barcelona celebrate their own Valentine's Day.
