In a single edition of Wimbledon, approximately 28,000 kilograms of strawberry and 10,000 litres of cream is consumed. The grass court Grand Slam has a longstanding British tradition of eating strawberry and cream, which is thought to have begun during the Victorian times. The fruits are sold in a small box called a 'punnet', containing a minimum of 10 berries.
