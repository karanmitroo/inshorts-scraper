BCCI's official Twitter account mistakenly wrote on the microblogging platform that South African captain Faf du Plessis was run-out by Rohit Sharma for 30 runs in the ongoing ODI in Durban. BCCI tweeted after a run-out appeal by India during the 17th over but the replays showed du Plessis was safe. Faf du Plessis went on to hit 120 runs.
