Pune-based extreme sportsperson Shital Mahajan-Rane has become the first Indian to skydive wearing a 'Nav-wari sari'. She said she skydived twice from an aircraft at heights of around 13,000 feet above Pattaya in Thailand. The Padma Shri laureate, who holds several world records, said wearing the Maharashtrian sari was a challenge as it is longer than a traditional Indian sari.
