Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh, sharing his disappointment over the omission of Karun Nair from the Indian squad for the T20Is and ODIs against England, tweeted, "Hello guys Where is Karun Nair?? Who just scored 300 vs Eng..he isn't part of even practice games against Eng. forget ODI. Wah kamal hai." Harbhajan, however, deleted the tweet immediately.
