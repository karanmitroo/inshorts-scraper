Over 3,000 Russians set a new Guinness World Record for the most number of people to simultaneously perform boxing exercises at Moscow's Red Square. Two-time Olympic boxing champions Olga Saitova and Alexei Tischenko taught the participants continuously for 30 minutes. The previous record was established in Moscow in 2015 with American boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr training 791 boxers.
