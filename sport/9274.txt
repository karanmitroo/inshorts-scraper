Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got England keeper Jonny Bairstow's wicket with a 'carrom ball' delivery during the Mumbai Test on Monday. During the 50th over of England's second innings, Bairstow attempted a leg drive while the ball sharply turned towards off stump trapping the batsman leg before. Bairstow, who unsuccessfully sought a DRS review, was dismissed for 51 (107).
