The CAS's hearing report of wrestler Narsingh Yadav's case concluded that Narsingh “was doping, not... a victim of sabotage.” The panel also observed that Narsingh had “intentionally ingested the prohibited substance in tablet form on more than one occasion”, as evidenced by the high test readings. Narsingh had earlier claimed that his food was spiked with the banned substance.
