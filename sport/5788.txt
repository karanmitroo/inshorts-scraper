SRH captain David Warner smashed a 43-ball ton, the joint-fifth fastest hundred in the IPL, against KKR on Sunday. Warner also became the first SRH player to score a century in the IPL. Only Chris Gayle (30), Yusuf Pathan (37), David Miller (38) and Adam Gilchrist (42) have scored a ton in fewer balls than Warner and AB de Villiers.
