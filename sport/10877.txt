Indian middle-order batsman Suresh Raina has been ruled out of the first ODI against New Zealand due to viral fever. The BCCI has not yet named a replacement for the batsman. Raina, who last played an ODI for India in October 2015, had been recalled for the first three matches of the five-ODI series against New Zealand.
