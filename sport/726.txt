Dinesh Karthik, who was not a part of India's playing XI, kept wickets in place of injured Parthiv Patel in the final session of the third Test against South Africa on Saturday. The rules, which came into effect in October last year, allow a substitute to keep wickets. Karthik had not kept wickets for India in Tests since January 2010.
