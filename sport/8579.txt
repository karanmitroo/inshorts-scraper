Paying tribute to former captain MS Dhoni, Mohammad Kaif said that Dhoni is the sharpest cricketing brain. Adding that Dhoni's calculations on the field were 10/10, Kaif said, "From his unorthodox field placements to unusual bowling changes, he had all the angles covered." "Go on MS Dhoni, at 35 years...prove to us that age is just a number," he added.
