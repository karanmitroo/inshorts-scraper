Lionel Messi scored a brace to help Barcelona win 3-0 against Las Palmas in La Liga on Sunday, in a match which was played in an empty Camp Nou stadium. The move was made over security fears amid violence in Catalan capital due to the Catalonia referendum. This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga win in as many games this season.
