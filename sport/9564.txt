Tennis player Serena Williams has written an open letter for women, in which she has discussed gender issues and pay inequality. "It frustrates me because I know that I, like you, have done the same work and made the same sacrifices as our male counterparts," wrote Serena. The letter was a part of Porter Magazine's 'Incredible Women of 2016' issue.
