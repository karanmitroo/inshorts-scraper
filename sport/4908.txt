Former cricketer Virender Sehwag has tweeted it was fun to see the "utra mooh" of Pakistani bowlers when he did well against them. "Maza aata tha Pakistan ke saath achha karne mein aur unke bowlers ka utra mooh dekhne mein," Sehwag wrote. The former batsman played Pakistan in 42 international matches, scoring 2,381 runs, including a triple century at Multan.
