Two women from London, Jen Offord and Freya Rodger, have tried almost every Olympic sport, after taking inspiration from the Games. Offord, inspired by the 2012 London Games, tried 37 out of 38 women sports, except Greco-Roman wrestling. Rodger, a cancer survivor, vowed to complete all 41 Olympic sports before Rio 2016â€™s closing ceremony, and is only left with sailing.
