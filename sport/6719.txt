Spartak Moscow fans displayed a banner reading, "Blah Blah Channel", taunting the BBC during their Russian Football Premier League derby match with Lokomotiv Moscow on Saturday. The banner was displayed in reference to BBC's documentary 'Russia's Hooligan Army' that aired last month. The documentary reportedly portrayed Russian football fans in a bad light.
