Sri Lankan spinner Akila Dananjaya took career-best figures of 6/54, in the second ODI against India, a day after his wedding, which took place on August 23. "Wedding was in the afternoon. I got back to the team hotel around 11:30 in the night. I wanted to reach earlier than that but it took a little longer," said the 23-year-old.
