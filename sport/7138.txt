On March 2, 2002, then Arsenal player Dennis Bergkamp scored the 'pirouette' goal against Newcastle United, widely considered one of the Premier League's best-ever goals. Bergkamp received a pass just outside the penalty box before rounding off the defender with a left-footed flick and going around him to score past the goalkeeper into the bottom right corner.
