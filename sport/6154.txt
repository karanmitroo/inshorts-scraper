Mumbai Indians defeated Royal Challengers Bangalore by 4 wickets in the IPL on Friday, helped by Kieron Pollard's 70(47). Batting first, RCB put up 142/5 driven by Virat Kohli's 47-ball 62, which helped him become the leading run-getter in IPL. RCB's Samuel Badree's four-for went in vain as Pollard and Krunal Pandya's 93-run stand helped MI chase down the target.
