Australian captain Steve Smith has equalled the record for most centuries in a Test series by a visiting captain in India, hitting his third during the Dharamsala Test on Saturday. Smith equalled former England captain Alastair Cook's record, who also scored three centuries in a series in 2012. Smith is the highest run-getter this series, having an 80+ average.
