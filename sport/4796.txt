Virat Kohli would have stepped down as the Indian team's captain if Anil Kumble had not resigned as the team's head coach, according to reports. Kohli had allegedly informed BCCI and the Cricket Advisory Committee members that Kumble needs to be replaced. The communication between the duo had allegedly broken down six months earlier following India-England Test series.
