A 35-year-old man was on Saturday arrested on suspicion of attempted grievous bodily harm (GBH) after he allegedly fired a metal crossbow into England's Oval cricket ground while a county match was underway. The ground was evacuated and the match between Surrey and Middlesex abandoned after the crossbow landed near the players. Notably, nobody was injured in the incident.
