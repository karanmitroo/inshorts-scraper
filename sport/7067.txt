Indian captain Virat Kohli decided against going for a review following a caught-behind appeal against Shaun Marsh, who was then batting on 4, on the bowling of Umesh Yadav. The replays showed a clear daylight between the bat and the ball but the snickometer proved the ball clipping the glove. Marsh went on to score 66 before getting out.
