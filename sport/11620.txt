The third ODI between India and New Zealand, originally scheduled to be held on October 19 in New Delhi, has been rescheduled for October 20 because of Karva Chauth. Senior BCCI and DDCA Vice President CK Khanna said the BCCI considered their request to postpone the match, wherein they cited "practical difficulties" associated in organising the match on the festival.
