Barcelona forward Lionel Messi dribbled past three defenders covering more than 41 metres to score with a low shot during his team's 5-0 win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. Messi began Barcelona's rout in the 24th minute, collecting the ball from Sergio Busquets before breaking through Celta's defence to find the net with a left-footed shot from outside the box.
