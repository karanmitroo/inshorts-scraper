Farmer Roman Ponomaryov has built a straw replica of Russia's FIFA World Cup semi-final venue, the St Petersburg Stadium, to mock the 43 billion ruble (â‚¹4,625 crore) spent on its construction. Ponomaryov's arena is made of 4,500 straw bales and comes with tiered seating for 300 and flagpoles. St Petersburg's Zenit Arena was completed in December after a 10-year delay.
