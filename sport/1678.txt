Australia defeated England by 120 runs to win the first-ever day-night Ashes Test on Wednesday. England slumped to their seventh consecutive defeat in Australia, and will have to win at least two of the remaining three Tests to stand a chance of retaining the Ashes. Shaun Marsh was named Man of the Match, his first in Tests after 25 matches.
