A Pakistani Facebook user has posted a video of Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli's doppelganger working at a pizza outlet in Karachi. The video was posted on a Facebook group called 'Just Pakistani Things'. "Indians can take all our team and give us #Kohli for a year," a Pakistani journalist had earlier tweeted.
