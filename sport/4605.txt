MS Dhoni has become India's fourth highest run scorer in ODIs, after reaching the 15-run mark in the second ODI against Windies on Friday. Dhoni overtook former captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who had scored 9,378 ODI runs, to take the fourth spot. Notably, Dhoni had crossed the 9,000-run mark in October 2016, becoming the fastest wicketkeeper-batsman to achieve the feat.
