Former world number one tennis player John McEnroe compared 12-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic to American golf player Tiger Woods. McEnroe said that Djokovic's dip in form is due to him being distracted by "off-court issues with the family". Notably, Woods was recently arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and has also undergone rehabilitation after that.
