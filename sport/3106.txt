A picture of a Pakistani policeman with a placard reading, 'Kohli, Marry Me!' at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium during the final Pakistan-World XI T20I match on Friday, has surfaced online. Reacting to it, a user tweeted, "That's the spirit...You are the man." Kohli had earlier received a marriage proposal on Twitter from England woman cricketer Danielle Wyatt.
