A football match in Greece was abandoned after the visiting team Olympiacos' coach Oscar Garcia got injured after being hit by a toilet paper roll thrown by a fan of the home team before kick-off. Garcia fell to his knees and was taken to hospital. Olympiacos' players left the pitch, with the match being called off two-and-a-half hours later.
