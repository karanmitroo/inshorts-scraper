Nirmal Yadav, a 65-year-old woman shooter from Delhi, set a record at the recently-concluded National Shooting Championship in Pune. She shot 341/400 in the Veteran Women's 10-metre Air Pistol event to claim the national record in the category. Nirmal, wife of a former Major General, started shooting two years back and has won gold at a national championship last year.
