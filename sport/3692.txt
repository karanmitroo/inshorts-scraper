Reacting to Indian selector MSK Prasad's remark on MS Dhoni's selection, a user tweeted, "Who are you MSK Prasad to say that if @msdhoni not performs there are alternatives. You are only selector but Dhoni is Inspiration". "@BCCI ask him [Prasad] to do one stumping. As per his records he can't even enter a cricket stadium," tweeted another user.
