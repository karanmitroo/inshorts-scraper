Australia-based researchers have used mathematics to highlight the changes in the length and direction of the ball's pitch with small variations introduced in the ball's rotation. The study revealed one such instance where introducing a small amount of top-spin at the expense of off-spin was found to reduce the lengthâ€‹ of the ball's pitch by as much as 25 centimetres.
