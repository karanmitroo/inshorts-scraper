Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane said on Monday that the hosts were not concerned about Australia's sledging in the upcoming four-match Test series, as they have "plans for every single Australian cricketer". "They're known to play mind games so let them do what they want to... Our only objective is to dominate in every section of the game," Rahane added.
