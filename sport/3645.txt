Sri Lanka can directly qualify for 2019 World Cup if they win at least two matches in the ODI series against India. They are currently eighth with 88 points and winning two matches will take them to 90 points. Ninth-placed Windies will reach 88 points even if they win all their ODIs by September 30, cut-off date for direct qualification.
