According to Football Leaks, Doyen Sports, one of footballâ€™s major transfer market dealers, spent funds on prostitution and tax evasion schemes to facilitate player transfers. Doyen officials attempted to get France's Geoffrey Kondogbia transferred to Real Madrid by offering prostitutes. Notably, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez denied being at a party in 2013 where prostitutes were present.
