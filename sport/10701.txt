Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum revealed that he smoked cigarettes during New Zealand's semi-final win over South Africa at the Eden Park in the World Cup 2015. McCullum said that he had shared his pack of cigarettes with two Indian caterers at the venue and had smoked in the team toilets during the "tense" final moments of the match.
