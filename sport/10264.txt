In conventional swing bowling, the ball moves away from the batsman if the seam is pointed towards slips and comes into the batsman if pointed towards fine-leg. In reverse swing, which occurs when an old ball has a relatively shinier side, the ball moves towards the shinier side. Usually, conventional swing lasts longer with red balls as compared to white.
