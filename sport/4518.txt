Kapil Malhotra, manager of Team India during the Champions Trophy, has written in his report that he did not see much communication between then coach Anil Kumble and captain Virat Kohli. He said Kohli was "very positive, always approachable, even when the team had a bad day on the field". Kapil added he found Kumble to be "slightly reserved" initially.
