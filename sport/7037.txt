KL Rahul was bowled on a dead ball while Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade mock-celebrated during the Bengaluru Test on Monday. In the 22nd over of India's second innings, Rahul pulled out following a sight screen disturbance before Nathan Lyon could release the ball. However, the ball hit the stumps and Wade celebrated, while the umpire called it a dead ball.
