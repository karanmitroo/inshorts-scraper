Talking about his first ever tour to England in 1991, Brian Lara said, "Viv Richards threw the keys of the car he was gifted, towards me, and sat at the passenger's seat. After that I knew all the roads in England." Lara revealed this while delivering the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at the Lord's Cricket Ground in London.
