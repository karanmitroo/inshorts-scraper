Ex-Australian captain Michael Clarke has said that Virat Kohli has a lot of Australian spirit in him even though the Australian media does not write positive things about him. "[W]hen people get to know Virat, they realise that what they see on the field is just his competitive spirit...I certainly think there's respect for...[him] in Australia," he added.
