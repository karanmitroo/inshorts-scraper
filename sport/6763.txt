The new BCCI Constitution, finalised by the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, allows the general public for the first time to register complaints against facilities at cricket stadiums. The complaint, pertaining to the ticketing, access and facilities at a stadium, will be submitted to an Ombudsman who will summon the Association if the issue is found to be legitimate.
