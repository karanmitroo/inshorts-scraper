During the closing ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics, a two-minute clip broadcast showed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe transform into popular video game character Mario. PM Abe emerged in Mario's costume from a green pipe at the middle of the Maracan√£ Stadium, clutching a red ball which serves as a logo for the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
