Australian legend Don Bradman was left stranded at 299 against South Africa in 1932 when his teammate Pud Thurlow, batting at No.11, got himself run-out. Thurlow, who was born on January 10, 1903, did not play another Test and finished his career without a wicket or a run. Bradman's 299* was then the highest score on the Australian soil.
