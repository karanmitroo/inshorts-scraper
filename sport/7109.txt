Kerala High Court has sent a notice to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on a petition filed by pacer Sreesanth to lift the lifetime ban imposed on him. It was sent after Sreesanth filed a petition on Wednesday against BCCI's decision to not let him play cricket. The next hearing will take place on March 5.
