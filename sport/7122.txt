Indian snowshoe racer Tanveer Hussain was arrested in New York on Wednesday for sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl. Hussain was participating in the 2017 World Snowshoe Championships, and was due to leave the country on Thursday. The 24-year-old Kashmiri athlete was initially denied a visa for the event, but was granted one after the mayor of Saranac Lake intervened.
