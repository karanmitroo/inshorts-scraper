Royal Challengers Bangalore have announced batsman Harpreet Singh as replacement for the injured Sarfaraz Khan for the rest of the IPL 2017 season. Harpreet Singh was earlier ignored from the auction after being mistaken for Harmeet Singh, a former IPL player, who was arrested for driving his car into one of the platforms of the Andheri station in Mumbai.
