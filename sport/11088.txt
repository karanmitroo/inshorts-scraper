The Lodha panel has written a letter to banks, asking them not to release funds to the BCCI, following the Board's Special General Meeting (SGM) on October 1. The letter, also sent to BCCI top officials, says that since the Board defied deadlines, they're not entitled to receive funding for future business, with violations being reported to the Supreme Court.
