Sachin Tendulkar has revealed a mongoose was a good omen for India in an ODI against South Africa at Eden Gardens in 1993. "There was a mongoose which kept coming...We got some wickets when it came...I was waiting for it to keep coming," said Sachin, who had bowled the last over. India had won the match by two runs.
