Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has said that cricket these days has become a soap opera, whose overdose can lead to boredom among fans. "It's reaching a crossroad where the cricket community had to say, 'Stop a little bit' because cricket too has to be entertaining...Finding the balance is very important than saturating itself," said Fleming.
