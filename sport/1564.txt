Reacting to the 12-foot-tall statue of Diego Maradona which was unveiled in Kolkata recently, a user tweeted, "That's Ronaldo R7 in a wig. Other tweets read, "Hand of God..  Hair of Susan Boyle," and, "Supposed to be Maradona.. looks more like someone's gran." "Good to see the chap that did the Ronaldo one is still in business," another user wrote.
