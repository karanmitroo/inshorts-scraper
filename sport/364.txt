The state government of Odisha would sponsor India's national men's and women's hockey teams for the next five years. "This is a first where a state government will not just be promoting a sport within its boundaries but will also support and nurture Indian hockey. This is Odisha's gift to the nation," Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said.
