Bouldering, a form of rock climbing without ropes, may effectively treat symptoms of depression, a US-based study claims. The study divided over 100 individuals into two groups, one of which joined the eight-week course later. Researchers found that a specific depression score in the group which started early dropped way more than those of the wait-listed group.
