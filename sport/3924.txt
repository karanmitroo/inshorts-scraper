A knife-wielding man wearing a Paris Saint-Germain shirt was arrested at Eiffel Tower, which was lit up with the team colours of PSG to celebrate the arrival of Neymar on Saturday night. The man reportedly shouted 'Allahu Akbar' before taking out the knife in front of the soldiers as he tried to force his way into the tower.
