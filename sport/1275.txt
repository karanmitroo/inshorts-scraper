Indian batsman Shikhar Dhawan took to Twitter to slam Emirates airline after his wife Aesha and their kids weren't able to join him in Cape Town due to the airline staff's "unprofessional" behaviour. Dhawan's wife and their kids were reportedly forced to stop in Dubai on account of not having birth certificates or identification proofs with them.
