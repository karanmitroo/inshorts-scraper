Barcelona's Brazilian forward Neymar has said that he was embarrassed to talk to Argentina captain Lionel Messi and felt like he was in a video game when he signed for Barcelona in 2013. "[I]n the end it all worked out thanks to the help of my teammates, family and friends. They helped to keep me focused and concentrated," Neymar added.
