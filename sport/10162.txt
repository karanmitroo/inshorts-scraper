Cricket South Africa has suspended two Indian-origin players, Shabnim Ismail and Trisha Chetty, from its women's national team until January 31, 2017. The duo was suspended for repeating offences that breached the CSA's Rules and Code of Conduct. CSA's chief Haroon Lorgat said that such incidents are "always disappointing and cannot be tolerated".
