Olympic gold-medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra announced his retirement from shooting on Sunday. He said, "It is time to move on, hand over the baton to the younger generation." Bindra added, "I came fourth in Rio and now retiring after playing for two decades. In Rio, I didnâ€™t win a medal and stood fourth but it gave me a great closure."
