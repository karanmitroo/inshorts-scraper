In an interview to Yuvraj Singh, spinner Yuzvendra Chahal said that being picked up by Yuvraj after taking his sixth wicket in the Bengaluru T20I felt like being in the movie Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Yuvraj also asked Chahal if the ball is heavier than him or not, to which Chahal sheepishly replied that he's slightly heavier than the ball.
