Brisbane Heat's Alex Ross became the first cricketer to be dismissed obstructing the field in a professional cricket match in Australia. While attempting a second run in a BBL match against Hobart Hurricanes, Ross deviated from his path and the ball hit him and the stumps. Hurricanes appealed for run-out, before asking the umpire to check for obstructing the field.
