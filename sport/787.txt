India cueist Pankaj Advani won India's third-highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan, for his contribution to snooker and billiards. The 32-year-old has won combined 18 world titles in billiards and snooker to go along with his gold medals in 2006 and 2010 Asian Games. "This is motivation for me to continue my pursuit of excellence," Advani said.
