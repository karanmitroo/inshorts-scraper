England all-rounder Ben Stokes became the most expensive overseas player in the IPL history after the Rising Pune Supergiants bought the player for ₹14.5 crore during this year's IPL auction on Monday. Stokes also became the second-most expensive buy in the tournament history, after Yuvraj Singh's ₹16-crore price tag, set by the Delhi Daredevils in 2015.
