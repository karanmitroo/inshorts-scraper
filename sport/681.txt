On January 30, 2008, Cristiano Ronaldo, playing for Manchester United, scored a powerful free-kick from 25 yards out against Portsmouth which left the goalkeeper unmoved. Ronaldo used knuckleball technique with the ball dipping at the last moment to go into the top-right corner. A knuckleball free-kick gives the ball an erratic movement as it's struck with little or no spin.
