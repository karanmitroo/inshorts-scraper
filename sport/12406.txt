Ahead of the upcoming Rio Olympics, Jamaican sprinter and six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt won the 200-metre sprint at the Anniversary Games in London's Olympic Stadium on Friday. He clocked 19.89 seconds, 0.15 seconds ahead of the second-placed sprinter. Notably, Bolt had pulled out of the 100 metres final in Jamaica's Olympic trials earlier this month with a hamstring strain.
