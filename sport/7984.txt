Ahead of his Australian Open final match against Swiss ace Roger Federer, former world number one Spain's Rafael Nadal has said that his past wins against rival Federer mean nothing. "It's a different match, a different moment for both of us. I think this match is completely different from what happened before", added the one-time Australian Open champion.
