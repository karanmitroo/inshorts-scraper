BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke in a recent interview said the IPL 2017 is in danger of not taking place due to the ongoing tussle with the Supreme Court. "The 2017 IPL is in danger. We have no idea whether it's happening," said Shirke. BCCI had earlier said it won't be able to pay England team's hotel and travelling bills.
