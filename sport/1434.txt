Pacer Navdeep Saini, who picked up seven wickets to help Delhi win the Ranji semi-final, said he owes his life to Gautam Gambhir. "I was a nobody and Gautam bhaiyaa did everything for me," he added. Saini revealed it was Gambhir who advised him to play the semi-final, instead of going to South Africa as a net bowler for India.
