Former British Prime Minister David Cameron jokingly said that the England cricket team should train with Sachin Tendulkar following their recent defeats. "Given the way the Test series (between India and England) is going...we need to kidnap him (Tendulkar)...for training," said Cameron. He also added that one must "never play golf with US President Barack Obama" since they cannot win.
