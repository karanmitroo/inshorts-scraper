Talking about his workload ahead of the first Test against Sri Lanka, India captain Virat Kohli said that he will ask for rest for when he needs it. "It's humanly impossible to maintain the same intensity for a player who plays all three formats... I am not a robot you can slice my skin and check, I bleed," Kohli added.
