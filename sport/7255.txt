WBO Oriental Champion China's Zulpikar Maimaitiali, who was set to fight Asia Pacific title holder Vijender Singh, has backed out from the bout as the talks between the boxers' promoters did not materialise. Reportedly, Vijender, who has an 8-0 record in pro-boxing so far, will still fight on the scheduled date, April 1, in Mumbai but against a different opponent.
