Australia's team doctor Peter Brukner has said the ICC should "very seriously" consider allowing concussion substitutes. This comes after Aussie opener Matt Renshaw was withdrawn from the ongoing Test against Pakistan after being struck on the head twice. "The more examples we have...the more pressure there will be on ICC to do something about a concussion sub," said Brukner.
