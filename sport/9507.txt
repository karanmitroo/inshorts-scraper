Indian professional boxer Vijender Singh, who will be defending his WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title against former world champion Francis Cheka, has claimed that he would show him "what his place is". "He can't come to my country and challenge me for my own title," added Singh. The fight will be held on 17 December at Delhi's Thyagaraj stadium.
