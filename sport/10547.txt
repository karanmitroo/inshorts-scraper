Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt's 2012 London Olympics bronze medal will not be upgraded to silver after the International Olympic Committee dropped the doping investigation against deceased silver medalist Besik Kudukhov. The late wrestler's preserved samples had allegedly tested positive for banned drugs in doping retests in August, following which there were reports that Dutt's medal might be upgraded.
