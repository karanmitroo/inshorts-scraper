As per reports, the salary of Indian cricket team's assistant coaches, Sanjay Bangar and R Sridhar, has been increased to ₹15 lakh per month from the existing ₹10 lakh. The hike came through when coach Anil Kumble took up the matter with BCCI, after the coaches rejected an earlier raise of 25% proposed by BCCI CEO Rahul Johri.
