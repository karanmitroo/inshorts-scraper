Pakistan's Mohammad Irfan, while playing a domestic match, was dismissed after the bowler decided to 'Mankad' him while he was about to deliver. Irfan had taken a step out from the crease when the bowler dislodged the bails in his delivery stride. The on-field umpires asked the fielding side if it wanted to rethink the appeal, which it denied.
