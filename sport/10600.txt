Former Brazilian footballer Pelé and his club Santos visited the war-affected African country Nigeria in 1967 and the warring sides declared a two-day ceasefire so that the fans could watch him play. The exhibition match was played as part of the club's international tour. Pelé, who was born 76 years ago, was the recipient of the 1978 International Peace Award.
