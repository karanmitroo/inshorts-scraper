The original prize of the FIFA World Cup, the Jules Rimet Trophy, was stolen from Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on the evening of 19-20 December 1983 and has not been recovered since. Interestingly, the trophy had been stolen earlier as well, before the start of the 1966 World Cup in England but was discovered seven days later by a dog.
