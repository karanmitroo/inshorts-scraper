The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) was on Wednesday recognised as a national body by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). This comes after the IOA removed the terminated Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) as its affiliate. The BFI assumed office last year after elections conducted in the presence of observers from the International Amateur Boxing Association and the Sports Ministry.
