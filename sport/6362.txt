Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra has unveiled his 'Be a Panda' scheme, which is aimed at tackling racism and promoting inclusion. Evra, who has endured racist incidents in the past, said, "It is against bullying. That's why Be a Panda is black, is white, is Asian and is chubby because he is eating a lot."
