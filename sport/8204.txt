Manchester United have become the first Premier League club to appoint an anti-terror expert, after two high-profile security lapses last year. A former inspector from Greater Manchester Police's specialist search unit has been appointed as the expert, while existing staff are being trained under security protocols. The club originally increased their security after the Paris attacks in 2015.
