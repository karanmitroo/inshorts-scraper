BCCI has released a list of 'reforms' on Twitter under President Anurag Thakur, who was elected in May 2016. Among the reforms are "efficient organisation" of the World T20 and IPL, funds for disability cricket, and promotion of Test and women's cricket. The tweets were posted after the Supreme Court gave the Board a day to accept the Lodha reforms.
