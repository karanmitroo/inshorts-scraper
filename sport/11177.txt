Kolkata's Eden Gardens, which is hosting the second India-New Zealand Test starting Friday, has got its own Lord's-like bell installed. The bell will be rung on Friday morning by former captain Kapil Dev to mark the beginning of India's 250th home Test. "It looks better than the bell at Lord's," said Cricket Association of Bengal President Sourav Ganguly.
