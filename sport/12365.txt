Rio-qualified Indian wrestlers training in Sonepat reportedly turned away National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) officials in March, with no action being taken against the wrestlers. According to World Anti-Doping Agency rules, three missed tests in a year amount to a positive test, resulting in suspension. On Sunday, Rio-bound wrestler Narsingh Yadav tested positive for a banned substance.
