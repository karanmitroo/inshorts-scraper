Adam Rolston, a 28-year-old ex-rugby player, completed the longest hole in golf history, covering 2,011 km taking 20,094 shots in over 80 days across Mongolia. Rolston and caddie Ron Rutland started in the far-west of Mongolia in late June and finished in the country's only golf course in capital Ulaanbaatar. Rolston used a total of 135 balls over the expedition.
