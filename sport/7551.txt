Tony Aarts, a Florida-based golfer, used his golf putter club to beat an alligator that attacked him and caught him by the ankle as he was approaching the fourth hole at the golf course. The alligator dragged Aarts into a nearby water hazard, before his eye socket was attacked by Aarts which caused the animal to loosen its jaw.
