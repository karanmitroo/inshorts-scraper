Speaking after India's Under-19 team's triumph in the Under-19 World Cup, coach Rahul Dravid said that he feels embarrassed when he gets attention instead of the team that won the trophy. "I couldn't be happier for them. It's a memory they will cherish for a long, long time, but it shouldn't define them," Dravid said about the trophy-winning squad.
