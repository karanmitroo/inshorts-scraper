Afghanistan fans started a "No Cricket With Pakistan" hashtag after Afghanistan Cricket Board's Chairman Atif Mashal announced a T20 series between the two countries. Fans slammed the Board saying they did not want any cricketing ties with the nation, calling it a "sponsor of terrorism". Later, an ACB official reportedly said the sentiment of the people will be considered.
