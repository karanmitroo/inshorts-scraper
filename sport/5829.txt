Bayern Munich secured a record-extending fifth consecutive Bundesliga title on Saturday after defeating VfL Wolfsburg 6-0 to register an unassailable 10-point lead at the top of the table with three matches remaining. This was Bayern's 27th German league title with their manager Carlo Ancelotti now being the first manager to win titles in four of 'the big five' leagues.
