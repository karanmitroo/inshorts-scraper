Australian domestic side Victoria's opener Paul Hibbert made a century against the touring Indian team on November 11, 1977, without hitting a single boundary. The opener's performance earned him a call-up for the first Test in Brisbane the following month. Hibbert is one of only two batsmen in first-class cricket to make a century without hitting a four.
