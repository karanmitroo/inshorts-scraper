Indian captain Virat Kohli has said he has started to see himself as a feminist after dating actress Anushka Sharma. "People are very chauvinistic in this country...I certainly wasn't aware of that growing up, to be honest...I would definitely want to think about life from the side of the woman. Everyone should be a feminist," said Kohli.
