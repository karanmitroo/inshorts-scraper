Former boxing world champion Mike Tyson was denied entry into Chile due to his conviction for rape in 1992. Tyson, who planned to attend an awards ceremony for action films taking place in Chile's capital Santiago, was put on a flight home citing non-compliance with Chilean immigration laws. Tyson served three years of a six-year US jail sentence for rape.
