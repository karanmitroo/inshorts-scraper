Indian shooter Abhinav Bindra has said the government's decision to end sporting ties with Pakistan needs to be respected. "At the end of the day, it is the decision of the government…It is a nice thought to separate sports from politics because that is the Olympic value as well…but in reality, it doesn't happen sometimes," said Abhinav.
