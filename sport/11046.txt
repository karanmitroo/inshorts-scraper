The Haryana government on Thursday referred Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav's doping case to the CBI for further investigation. The case had ruled out Yadav from participating in the 74-kg freestyle event at the Rio Olympics following the Court of Arbitration for Sports' (CAS) four-year ban on the wrestler in August.
