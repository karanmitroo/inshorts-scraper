Ex-Australian pacer Glenn McGrath, while talking about Sachin Tendulkar's son Arjun who is a left-arm pacer, said he will be a winner if he has the love and passion for cricket like his father. "When you have a name like Tendulkar, those are pretty big shoes to fill," added McGrath. The 17-year-old was bowling in nets to India Women players.
