Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag on Tuesday said Australian players did not sledge Team India in the recently-concluded ODI series as they were scared of losing out on IPL contracts. Sehwag said if the Australians had sledged, IPL franchise owners "might think twice" before bidding high for them. Sehwag added that the "brain fade" incident also kept the Australians "quiet".
