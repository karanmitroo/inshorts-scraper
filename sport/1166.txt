Skier Valentin Delluc was filmed traversing peaks using a glowing parachute wing and a pair of skis under the moonlight near the foot of Mont Blanc. Delluc spent seven months training for the nighttime mission, which took place earlier in 2017. Delluc managed to travel 1,500 vertical meters in 4 minutes and 20 seconds during the run.
