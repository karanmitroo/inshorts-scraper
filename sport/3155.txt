Leander Paes' estranged partner Rhea Pillai's lawyers have claimed that they erroneously wrote one zero less in the amount Pillai sought from Paes as compensation for domestic violence. The former model wanted  ₹1 crore as damages and not  ₹10 lakh as mentioned earlier, Pillai's lawyers told the Bandra Magistrate Court. The domestic violence case against Paes was filed in 2014.
