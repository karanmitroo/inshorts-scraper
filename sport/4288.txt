Former Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie has said that he "seriously considered" applying for the Indian cricket team's coaching job, which was eventually given to Ravi Shastri. "I talked a lot about that with my family... In the end, I just felt I wasn't quite ready for that opportunity," added the 42-year-old, who is now Papua New Guinea's interim coach.
