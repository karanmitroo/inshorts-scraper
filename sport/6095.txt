Rising Pune Supergiant's former captain MS Dhoni produced a reflex stumping off Imran Tahir's bowling to dismiss Royal Challengers Bangalore's AB de Villiers in their IPL match on Sunday. De Villiers tried reaching out to Tahir's leg-break, got off balance before getting beaten by it. De Villiers walked towards the RCB dug-out much before the third umpire's dismissal confirmation.
