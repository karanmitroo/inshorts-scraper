New Zealand all-rounder Richard Hadlee became the first bowler to take 400 wickets in the history of Test cricket on February 4, 1990, nearly 113 years after the first-ever Test was played. Hadlee bowled India's Sanjay Manjrekar in the Christchurch Test to create the record. Interestingly, 12 bowlers, including three Indians, reached the milestone in the next 25 years.
