Former Australian pacer Brett Lee has said Pat Cummins is "once in a generation" bowler and his return has boosted Australia's pace attack. "What Cummins can bring is pace, aggression, control and anything between that...you have got to harness that amazing talent," added Lee. Notably, Cummins returned to the Australian side this year after a gap of over five years.
