Former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar has said he feels "sad" that current Indian and Pakistani cricketers have not been able to experience the rivalry between the two nations. "The cricketers are not getting a chance to become overnight heroes for their respective countries. Pakistan cricketers are adored in India, I myself have got so much love from India," said Akhtar.
