India has guaranteed the number one rank in Tests, following its 178-run victory over New Zealand in the second Test at Kolkata on Monday. India will replace Pakistan at the top of the table officially at the end of the three-match series. Earlier in August, India was ranked one for five days, before Pakistan replaced them on the top.
