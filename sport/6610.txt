Australian captain Steve Smith got out on a 'Nelson' or a score of 111, during the Dharamsala Test against India on Saturday. The score is considered unlucky by cricketers since it resembles a set of stumps without bails. It is named after British Navy officer Lord Nelson, who reportedly had lost one eye, one arm and one leg in battles.
