Former Pakistani captain Shahid Afridi has said the political relations between India and Pakistan cannot "sour" the cordial relationship he shares with Indian captain Virat Kohli. "He (Kohli) has always shown a lot of respect and has even gone out of his way to present a signed jersey for my foundation (Shahid Afridi Foundation)," Afridi said.
