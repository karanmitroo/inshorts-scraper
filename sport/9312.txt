A ball is considered 'dead' when it is no longer a part of active play, as after the fall of a wicket. The rules of the game, however, are ambiguous and leave the final decision at umpire's discretion, causing some controversies. Ian Bell was run-out by India in 2011 after he left the crease thinking the ball to be dead.
