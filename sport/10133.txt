Tennis player Maria Sharapova will be reinstated as a UN Goodwill Ambassador, once her reduced 15-month suspension expires in April 2017. The UN Development Programme had ended their nine-year relationship with the player in March this year, after she admitted to consuming meldonium, a banned substance. Sharapova was selected as an ambassador for her work related to the Chernobyl disaster.
