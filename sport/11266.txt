Olympian Lalita Babar participated in the Maratha Kranti Muk Morcha in Pune on Sunday to protest against the Kopardi gangrape and murder, which had happened earlier this year. "I walked in the march not as a member of any caste or a sportsperson, but as an ordinary woman still angry about what happened to the school going girl," Babar said.
