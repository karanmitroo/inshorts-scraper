Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed the New Zealand Kane Williamson with a delivery that turned from the 7th stump line outside off to hit the middle stump. Williamson, alongside Tom Latham, had put on an unbeaten 117 run stand for the second wicket, before Ashwin's 4th delivery of the 56th over put an end to his innings.
