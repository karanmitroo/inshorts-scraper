Canadian pole vaulter Shawn Barber was allowed to participate in Rio Olympics despite being tested positive for cocaine, which he inadvertently ingested during an encounter with a woman he met on the personals site Craigslist. Barber testified in front of Canada's Sport Dispute Resolution Centre that he did not realise that there was any potential to ingest drugs by kissing.
