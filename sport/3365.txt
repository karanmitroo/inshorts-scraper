Hockey India on Saturday sacked the head coach of the national men's hockey team, Roelant Oltmans. Under the 63-year-old Dutchman, India won its maiden silver medal in the Champions Trophy and reached the knock-out stages of the Olympics after a 36-year-gap. Oltmans, who took charge in 2015, will be replaced by current High Performance Director David John as interim coach.
