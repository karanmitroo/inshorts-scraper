Sports Minister Vijay Goel held a review meeting of India's Rio Olympics performance with the country's national sports federations on Thursday. Goel said sportspersons need to be given a key role in decision-making in federations, while the bodies' representatives insisted on increased funding for sports. India won two medals, a silver and a bronze, at the Rio Olympics in August.
