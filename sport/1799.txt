India captain Virat Kohli, along with MS Dhoni and coach Ravi Shastri, will lead talks of a pay rise in a meeting with BCCI on Friday. This comes after BCCI pocketed $2.5 billion from a deal with Star India for broadcast of Indian Premier League. BCCI had doubled the annual retainer amounts for the Indian team in March.
