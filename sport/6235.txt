Discussing the differences between the captaincy styles of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli, spinner Ravichandran Ashwin said Virat Kohli is so aggressive on the field that it sometimes scares him. Calling Dhoni's captaincy mature, Ashwin added, "Virat is a completely different individual. He likes confrontation, he likes to be in the thick of things... He's probably a generation transforming individual."
