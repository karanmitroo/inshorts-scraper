Indian cricketer Suresh Raina has said biopics on cricketers inspire people "to do something for themselves and the country." "You never know the true story of why someone like a Tendulkar or a Dhoni became a cricketer. They too were simple just like anyone else", said Raina, adding he was more excited about Sachin Tendulkar's upcoming biopic rather than Dhoni's.
