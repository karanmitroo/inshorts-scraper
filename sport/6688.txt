Sri Lanka cricket was on Monday declared dead by a local newspaper which published an obituary reading, "In affectionate remembrance of Sri Lankan cricket which died at the Oval on 19, March 2017. The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Bangladesh." A similar satirical obituary of the English cricket in 1882 gave birth to 'The Ashes' series.
