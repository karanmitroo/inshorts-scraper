Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo crashed two drones with his football kicks as a part of a challenge to American basketball star Dwyane Wade. Ronaldo and Wade keep challenging each other, asking each other to "Raise It", as they both endorse Poker Stars, a poker company. Ronaldo had earlier successfully landed trick shots as a part of the challenge.
