After a mix-up between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli resulted in the captain's run-out on Tuesday, a user tweeted, "Selfless cricketer, Kohli got run out for Rohit's double century." Other tweets read, "Rohit-Kohli run-out is better love story than Twilight," and, "Kohli turns 1s into 2s; Pandya: black hair into red, yellow, green etc and Rohit turns run-outs into centuries."
