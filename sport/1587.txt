Super featherweight boxer Stephen Smith's ear was nearly ripped off after he clashed heads with Francisco Vargas during their boxing bout in Las Vegas on Saturday. The bout was stopped early after the end of the ninth round by a technical decision after which the referee called the ringside doctor to take a look at Smith's almost detached ear.
