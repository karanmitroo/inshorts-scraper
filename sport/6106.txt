The explosives used in the attack on football club Borussia Dortmund's team bus in Germany on Tuesday may have come from the German armed forces' supplies, according to reports. This comes after unverified letters, claiming that Islamist militants carried the attack, were found. The blast injured a player and postponed the club's UEFA Champions League quarter-final by a day.
