Former Australian cricketer Roy Park was bowled on the first ball he faced in the only innings of his Test career, on December 31, 1920. According to a legend, Park's wife, who was present in the stadium, bent down to pick up her knitting when her husband got out and missed his entire Test batting career as a result.
