India's Swapna Barman, who won the gold medal in the women's heptathlon at the recently concluded Asian Athletics Championships, has six toes each on both her feet. Swapna runs in regular shoes that fit 10 toes, since she cannot afford custom-made shoes. She collapsed after running the final event of the heptathlon at the Asian meet, but still finished first.
