England opener Alastair Cook smashed the highest score by an opener to have carried his bat through an innings, after slamming 244* in England's first innings in the Melbourne Test. Cook overtook New Zealand's Glenn Turner, who set the previous record in 1972 with his 223*. Cook's effort was the 52nd time a player achieved the feat in Test cricket.
