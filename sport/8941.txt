The Test match that starts on December 26, primarily at Australia's Melbourne Cricket Ground, is called the Boxing Day Test. According to a theory, December 26 came to be known as the Boxing Day as the servants in Victorian-era England were given boxes of gifts a day after Christmas. Australia has hosted a Boxing Day Test every year since 1990.
