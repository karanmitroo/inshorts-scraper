Few members of the Padma Awards committee have reportedly objected to Rio silver medalist PV Sindhu's Padma Bhushan nomination by the Sports Ministry. Sindhu was awarded the Padma Shri last year, while rules state there has to be a gap of minimum four years between two Padma awards. All Paralympic and Olympic medalists have been recommended for the Padma awards.
