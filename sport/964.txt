Non-striker Virat Kohli used signals to help Hardik Pandya counter reverse swing of South African bowlers during the Centurion Test. Kohli held the bat with his left hand to indicate ball swinging towards offside and held it with right hand to indicate opposite swing. Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid had used the same tactic against New Zealand's Chris Cairns.
