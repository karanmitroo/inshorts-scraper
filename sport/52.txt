The youth wing of the Indian National Congress party took to Twitter to wish 16-year-old shooter Manu Bhaker for her gold medal win at ISSF shooting World Cup, but instead used the image of another shooter Mehuli Ghosh. Bhaker is making her international debut at the tournament and grabbed the gold medal in women's 10m Air Pistol event on Sunday.
