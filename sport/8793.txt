A ballboy trolled Melbourne City's Tim Cahill after he proceeded towards the corner flag to celebrate his goal against Central Coast Mariners in the A-League. Cahill scored the opening goal of the match and went to punch the corner flag as part of the trademark boxing celebration but the ballboy removed and took the flag leaving Cahill punching at air.
