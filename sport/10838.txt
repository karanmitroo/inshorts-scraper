Ten-man Arsenal relied on a brace from Theo Walcott and a Mesut Ozil goal to get past Swansea City, following Granit Xhaka's red card in the second half of their Premier League match on Saturday. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Borja Baston were on the scoresheet for Swansea, as they twice halved a two-goal deficit, but failed to register a win.
