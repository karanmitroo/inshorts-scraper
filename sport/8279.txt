England fast bowler Jake Ball on Tuesday said that England bowlers will use short balls to unsettle Virat Kohli and will not let him find his rhythm while batting during the second ODI. "He's an unbelievable player. We've got plans for him and, hopefully, we can put them into practice in a couple of days' time," added Ball.
