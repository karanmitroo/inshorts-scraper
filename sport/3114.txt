Ahead of the first India-Australia ODI, Virat Kohli said he doesn't play for the three-figure mark, which is why he ends up crossing it more times. "I don't put myself under pressure. For me, what's most important is to win the match for [India]," added Kohli. Kohli is only behind Sachin Tendulkar on most ODI hundreds list, with 30 tons.
