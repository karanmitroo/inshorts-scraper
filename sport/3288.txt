Australian captain Joe Darling challenged rival captain Stanley Jackson to wrestle to decide the toss in an exhibition match on September 7, 1905. Darling was frustrated after having lost all five tosses in the prior Ashes series to Jackson, who chose to bat all times. Jackson agreed but insisted Darling fight his teammate George Hirst, following which Darling backed out.
