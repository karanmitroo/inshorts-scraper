Gianluca Zambrotta, ISL franchise Delhi Dynamos' head coach, has said, "I will definitely try and convince Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ to play for Delhi Dynamos". "Given his fan following in India, I think Zlatan would want to come and end his career here", he added. The duo were teammates in Juventus from 2004 to 2006, where they won one Serie A title.
