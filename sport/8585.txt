Sydney Thunder's Shane Watson hit a 94-metre six, in the 15th over against Hobart Hurricanes in Big Bash League on Sunday, which was caught by one of the many spectators who tried to catch it. One of the spectators also fell on his back in the process. Watson hit five sixes and two fours in his match-winning 55-run knock.
