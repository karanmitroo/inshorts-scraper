Staff at Hamilton's Seddon Park in New Zealand played South African cricketer AB de Villiers' song 'Maak Jou Drome Waar' to distract him while he was batting during the fourth ODI on Wednesday. De Villiers, who scored 72*, said, "I was singing along...I was actually playing a bit of air guitar on my bat...thought I'd be on the highlights package."
