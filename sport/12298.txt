American sailor Brad Funk, who had failed to qualify for Rio Olympics in the two-man 49er, is helping in cleaning up the waters where Olympics' sailing races will take place. "It is very important to me that the Olympic Games is a success and the trash does not get stuck on the sailboats, taking medals away from them", he said.
