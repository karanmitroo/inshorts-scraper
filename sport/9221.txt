A Scottish Premiership football match between Motherwell and Aberdeen was called off after floodlights went off six minutes into the play. The game was initially halted for 18 minutes when the floodlights went off at one end, only to resume for a minute before the stadium blacked out. The lights were running on generators following electricity crisis in the area.
