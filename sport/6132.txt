Fifteen-year-old Corrinne Calhoun can shoot a bow and arrow using only her toes while standing on her hands five feet above ground. Corrinne has been dancing since the age of 3 and started taking contortion classes at the age of 4. She learned foot archery at the suggestion of her coach. "I like to try new things," said Corrinne.
