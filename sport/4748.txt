Madhya Pradesh police have booked a Kashmiri student over his pro-Pakistan Facebook comment on a minor boy's Facebook post after Pakistan's Champions Trophy (CT) win against India. Locals attacked the minor on Friday and called him anti-national. Local police stated that they will arrest the Kashmiri student when he returns to Gwalior to collect his Post Graduate degree certificate.
