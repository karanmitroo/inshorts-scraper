Columbia University in New York City suspended its wrestling team over a series of lewd text messages shared on messaging app GroupMe, dating back to 2014. The messages made jokes about sexual assault, mocked a woman's Instagram account and used racist slurs, among other things. More than 900 people signed a petition calling for the team to be expelled.
