The conditioning camp for the Indian cricket team, which was supposed to be held in Bengaluru in January, has been cancelled after senior players asked for a longer rest period. Reportedly, coach Anil Kumble had asked for the camp to be conducted. The team will instead have extended net sessions in Pune starting January 10.
