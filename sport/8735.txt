Mohammad Amir bowled a 140km/h bouncer in the Sydney Test that hit Australia's Matthew Renshaw on the helmet grille. The blow required an examination by the team doctor under the new concussion protocols, following which the batsman resumed his innings. Renshaw, who was batting on 91 at the time of the incident, reached 167* at the end of day's play.
