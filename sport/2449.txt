Indonesian footballer Terens Puhiri is being hailed as 'the fastest human' after sprinting through approximately 2/3rd of the pitch in 8 seconds to score for his club Borneo FC. The 21-year-old needed just two touches before netting an open goal. Reacting to the goal, a user tweeted, "Which one is faster than light? Usain Bolt, The Flash or Terens Puhiri".
