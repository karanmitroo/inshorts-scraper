On March 16, 2007, South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs became the first man in the history of international cricket to hit six 6s in an over. Gibbs smashed Netherlands' Daan van Bunge for six 6s in their first round match at the 2007 World Cup in West Indies. Helped by Gibbs' innings, the Proteas amassed 353/3 in their 40 overs.
