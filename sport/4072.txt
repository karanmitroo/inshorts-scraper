Former boxer Mike Tyson has said MMA fighter Conor McGregor has made a mistake agreeing to fight boxer Floyd Mayweather using boxing rules, and predicted McGregor "is going to get killed".
 "[McGregor] put his dumb a** in a position where he's gonna get knocked out because [Mayweather] been doing this all his life since he was a baby," Tyson added.
