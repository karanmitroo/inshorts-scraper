Russian parliamentarian Igor Lebedev has suggested fan hooliganism at football matches should be turned into a legalised sport to "turn fans' aggression in a peaceful direction". Calling the sport "Draka", the Russian word for fight, Lebedev suggested a bout with 20 unarmed fighters on each side in an arena. Russia will be hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
