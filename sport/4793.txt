Sedition charges were slapped on five people arrested in Bikaner for cheering for Pakistan during the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. Lesser charges were framed against them earlier, but were later elevated to sedition following submission of a memoranda to the district collector and police, seeking action against the accused. A person convicted for sedition can be jailed for life.
