A two-minute video revisits the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final between Australia and South Africa, which ended in a tie. Needing 9 runs from the last over, South African all-rounder Lance Klusener, who turned 45 on Monday, hit two boundaries off the first two balls before causing a run-out. Australia qualified for final by virtue of performance in Super-Six round.
