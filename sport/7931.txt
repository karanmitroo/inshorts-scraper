Roger Federer has rejected claims that he "legally cheated" by taking a medical timeout in Sunday's Australian Open final against Rafael Nadal. Ex-Grand Slam winner Pat Cash said Federer's medical timeout was "wrong, wrong and wrong". Federer said Stan Wawrinka also took a timeout in their semifinal and his timeout in the final was "well within the rules".
