Suresh Raina, who had last played a T20I for India in February 2017, said that coming back to Team India feels like he is playing for the first time in the Indian jersey. "The wait to get back...made me tougher and hungrier. Each and every lap I ran during training, I was only thinking about (comeback)" he added.
