Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos gave his jersey to a fan who offered him pork during the team's La Liga match against Real Sociedad on Sunday. The fan carried a placard which read, "Sergio, if you give me your shirt, I'll give you a tray of pork in lard." Ramos tossed his shirt to the fan and took the pork.
