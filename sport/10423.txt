On the occasion of former cricketer VVS Laxman's 42nd birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Happy Birthday @VVSLaxman281. If Vanigurappa Venkata Sai ji was in Sholay, Gabbar would have said "Yeh kalaai (wrist) humka dede Laxman"." Laxman retired from international cricket in August 2012 after a 16-year long career, which included 134 Tests and 86 ODIs.
