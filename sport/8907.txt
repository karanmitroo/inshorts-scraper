Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Shaharyar Khan said on Wednesday that there is "no chance" of a cricket series with India till political ties between the two countries improve. Khan added that a cricket series between the neighbours is "directly connected with the political and diplomatic relations" between the governments of Pakistan and India.
