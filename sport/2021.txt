India ended the second day of the first Test against Sri Lanka at 74/5, after rain forced early stumps at Kolkata on Friday. India lost two wickets during the day, while Cheteshwar Pujara remained unbeaten at 47.  Sri Lanka's Suranga Lakmal became the first bowler in 16 years to bowl seven successive maidens before conceding a run in a Test.
