AB de Villiers slammed the fastest-ever ODI hundred against Windies in 2015 during a Pink ODI, wherein the South African team members were wearing pink jerseys to create awareness for breast cancer. De Villiers reached the three-figure-mark in 31 balls and went on to score 149(44). The 33-year-old former captain has hit 450 runs in five Pink ODIs so far.
