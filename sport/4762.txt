Former powerlifter Kavita Devi will become the first Indian woman wrestler in WWE, after getting selected for the company's first-ever tournament for women, Mae Young Classic. Kavita, who trained at The Great Khali's wrestling academy in Punjab, appeared at the WWE Dubai tryout this year where she was selected. She will compete at the 32-competitor event in Florida next month.
