Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who has been rested for the first two Tests against Sri Lanka starting on Thursday, has revealed he himself asked for the break to work on fitness as he was not feeling 100% fit. "My body wasn't up to it. I was getting niggles because of the amount of cricket that I have played," Pandya said.
