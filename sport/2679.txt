American football franchise Miami Dolphins' coach Chris Foerster resigned on Monday, hours after a video surfaced that appeared to show him snorting lines of a powdery white substance. Foerster later issued a statement in which he said that he apologises and accepts full responsibility for his actions. The video showed Foerster using a $20 bill to snort the unrecognised substance.
