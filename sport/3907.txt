Eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt, who will run the last solo race of his career on Saturday, won his first Olympic gold wearing untied shoes. Bolt clocked 9.69 seconds, a then world record, with his shoelaces untied, to win at the 2008 Olympics. Bolt's coach said he could have finished at 9.52 seconds, based on his opening 60 metres.
