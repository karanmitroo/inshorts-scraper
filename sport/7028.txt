An Indian dance troupe called 'Top Naach' performed bhangra at the half-time show during Washington Wizards' home game against the Toronto Raptors last week in the NBA. The dancers performed a five-minute routine on a hip hop-bhangra infused track in traditional attire with props like dhol and scarves. Bollywood/India night is currently being celebrated by teams across the league.
