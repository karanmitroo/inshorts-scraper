Indian Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha has claimed that he never felt former Indian cricket coach Anil Kumble was strict. "[Kumble] always wanted us to score 400, 500, 600 and the opponent will be all out by 150-200. That isn't always possible. [Ravi Shastri] always tells us to go out there hit the opponent out of the park," Saha said.
