Indian allrounder Ravindra Jadeja did a traditional sword dance using his bat to celebrate his unbeaten half-century on Day 3 of the third India-England Test at Mohali. Jadeja, along with Ravichandran Ashwin, resumed the play from 271/6 on Monday and helped the Men in Blue take lead over England in the first innings of the Test.
