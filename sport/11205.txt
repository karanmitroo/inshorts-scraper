BCCI has filed a fresh application in the Supreme Court, asking for the Court's order regarding the Lodha recommendations be suspended till the Board's review and curative petitions are heard. The Lodha Panel had filed a status report in court on Wednesday, after which Chief Justice TS Thakur told BCCI to "fall in line or we'll make you do so".
