Australian batsman Usman Khawaja was mistaken for a Pakistan player by a cricket official at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. The official came to open the change room locker for Khawaja, who was waiting outside the Australia's change room, but went towards the Pakistan's thinking him to be a Pakistani. Khawaja was born in Pakistan but plays his cricket for Australia.
