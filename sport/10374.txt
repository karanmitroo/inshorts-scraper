World Boxing Association (WBA) on Wednesday has given an official sanction to Anthony Joshua to fight for the WBA heavyweight title in 2017 against Wladimir Klitschko. The WBA title was vacated last month by Tyson Fury amid his recovery from mental health issues. Fury had beaten veteran Klitschko for IBF, WBO and WBA titles in November 2015.
