The cheapest five-wicket haul in international cricket, taken by former West Indies' pacer Courtney Walsh, saw only one run given away. Walsh, playing against Sri Lanka in an ODI at Sharjah on December 3, 1986, ended with figures of 4.3-3-1-5, taking the lone five-wicket haul of his ODI career. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 55, their second-lowest ODI score.
