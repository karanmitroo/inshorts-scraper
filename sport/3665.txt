England opener Alastair Cook, who scored an unbeaten 153 on the first day of the first day-night Test in England against West Indies, said he was yawning in the final session as it was past his bedtime. "It's weird, everything is different because you are programmed to white kit starting at 11 am. But it's a mental thing," added Cook.
