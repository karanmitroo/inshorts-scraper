Afghanistan Cricket Board CEO Shafiq Stanikzai said BCCI's role in cricket's rise in the nation was bigger than the role played by their neighbours Pakistan. "Since we moved to India, the team has done well. The conditions in India are suiting the team quite well," he added. Afghanistan will play their first-ever Test in Bengaluru from June 14 to 18.
