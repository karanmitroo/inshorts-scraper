All-rounder Hardik Pandya, who made his Test debut against Sri Lanka, surprised his father by gifting him a new car. Pandya's father was at a showroom with his son Krunal where he realised that the car is a gift for him. "This is the guy who should get all the happiness in life and deserves all the credit," Pandya tweeted.
