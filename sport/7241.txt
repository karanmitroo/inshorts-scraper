Australian cricketer Steve O'Keefe, who registered 6/35 in both the innings of the Pune Test against India, has the best identical bowling figures in Test cricket history. The previous best identical figures were 6/52 by Indian leg-spinner Bhagwat Chandrasekhar against Australia at Melbourne in 1977-78. O'Keefe became the seventh visiting bowler to take a 12-wicket-haul in a Test in India.
