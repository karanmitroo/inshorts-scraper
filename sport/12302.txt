Scientists from the University of Manchester have revealed that the World Cup trophy on display at the National Football Museum in Manchester, presumed to be the Jules Rimet trophy, is actually a replica. The actual Jules Rimet trophy, awarded to England when they won the World Cup on July 30, 1966, was stolen from Brazil in 1983, and never recovered.
