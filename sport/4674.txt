Harsh Goenka, brother of Rising Pune Supergiant's owner Sanjiv Goenka, has taken a dig at Indian captain Virat Kohli on Twitter. Commenting on the recent Anil Kumble-Virat Kohli controversy, Goenka said that the coach of the Indian cricket team was supposed to "obey the BCCI and Indian cricket captain". During the IPL this year, Goenka had spoken against MS Dhoni.
