Former England footballer and football pundit Gary Lineker fulfilled the promise he made on Twitter last season of conducting the Match of the Day show on BBC without pants if Leicester City won the league. Lineker appeared on the show wearing only shorts featuring Leicester City's emblem alongside fellow fully clothed pundits Alan Shearer and Ian Wright.
