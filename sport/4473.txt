Pakistan Cricket Board has been slammed for giving 10 million Pakistani rupees (â‚¹61 lakh) cash reward to chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq for the team's Champions Trophy win. Former selectors and coaches questioned why the coaches were awarded five million Pakistani rupees, while other selectors got one million Pakistani rupees. The awards were given at the PM's reception in Islamabad on Tuesday.
