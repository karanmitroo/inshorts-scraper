Indian Premier League's Pune-based franchise has dropped 's' from 'Supergiants' and will now be called Rising Pune Supergiant. "Last year...we were looking at four to five players in the squad who had supergiant abilities," the franchise's spokesperson said. "While we were preparing for this IPL, we thought why just a few players, the entire team is supergiant," the spokesperson added.
