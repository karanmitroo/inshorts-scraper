The German Football Association has announced that men's and women's teams will be allowed to make a fourth substitution in the extra-time of the German Cup knockout matches. The decision, part of a pilot project by the sport's rule-making body, has been taken considering player welfare and will allow managers to see what impact a fourth substitute can make.
