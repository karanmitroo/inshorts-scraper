Windies team members were fined 10% of their match fee, while captain Carlos Brathwaite was fined 20%, for slow over-rate during the T20I against India in Jamaica on Sunday. ICC match referee David Boon imposed the fine after the team was found to be one over short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration.
