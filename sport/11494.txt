Former Formula One driver and hand-cyclist Alex Zanardi won the H5 road time trial Paralympic gold on the eve of the 15-year anniversary of a motorsport crash wherein he had lost his legs. The 49-year-old, who won two gold medals at London 2012, needed to have both legs amputated after crashing into a car while racing in Indy Car 2001.
