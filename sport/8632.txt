Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has called Yuvraj Singh's recall to the team a "belated wedding gift". "Yuvraj deserves every opportunity to make a comeback. BCCI gave him a slightly belated wedding gift. He might not be as brilliant as he was when 21 but he is still an outstanding fielder," said Gavaskar. Yuvraj got married to Hazel Keech in November.
