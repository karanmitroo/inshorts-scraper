The bail flew 61.4 metres (67 yards 6 inches) on two occasions in cricket history. On the first occasion, on June 29, 1911, Worcestershire bowler Robert Burrows bowled out Lancashire's Bill Huddleston, sending the bail flying 61.4 metres to create a first-class record. In 1928-29, England's Harold Larwood sent the bail flying the same distance during an Ashes tour match.
