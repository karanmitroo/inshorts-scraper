Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag today paid tribute to Mahendra Singh Dhoni following his stepping down from limited overs captaincy. Sehwag said that he expected Dhoni to be the captain for a little longer. "His skills on the field... are known to everyone, but he is an even better human being with a big big heart," he said.
