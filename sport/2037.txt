Virat Kohli reportedly asked officials to chop off a part of his bat's handle to improve his front foot drive, ahead of the first Test against Sri Lanka. A shorter bat handle helps a batsman drive along the ground, following lesser scope of holding the handle tight. This comes after Kohli was dismissed driving on the front foot against Australia.
