Rio Olympics gold medalist Gil Roberts has won an appeal against WADA relating to a doping ban, after a US arbitration panel agreed the sprinter had tested positive because of "passionate kissing". The sprinter had declared that the banned substance entered his system when he "passionately kissed" his girlfriend after she took her medicine.
