Pakistan's Umar Akmal has been removed from Pakistan's ICC Champions Trophy squad and has been sent back home after having failed to clear a second fitness test in two months.
 "[Akmal] is a good player, we needed him, but we had to take a decision," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq said.
