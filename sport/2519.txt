Sri Lankan head coach Nic Pothas has pulled out of the Lahore T20I against Pakistan citing security concerns. This comes after limited-overs captain Upul Tharanga withdrew for the same reason, with Thisara Perera being named skipper for the matches. The first two T20Is will be played in Abu Dhabi, while the last one will be hosted in Lahore.
