A video has emerged which shows a 4-year-old US boy running away from his opponent, a 5-year-old girl, during a wrestling tournament. The boy is seen running around the ring in circles before the girl eventually pins him down and wins. The boy's mother later said she asked him why he ran, to which he replied, "It was silly."
