The International Olympic Committee has ruled out a blanket ban on Russia in the Rio Olympics, which begin on August 5. IOC has left it on individual sports-governing bodies to decide if Russia can participate. Russia was already banned from athletics at Rio, following a World Anti-Doping Agency report which revealed state-sponsored doping from 2011 to 2015 in the country.
