The Pune pitch, which witnessed India's 333-run loss against Australia in the first Test, has been rated "poor" by the ICC. A pitch is "poor" if it offers excessive assistance to spinners, especially early in the match or it displays excessive seam movement at any stage. Pitches offering uneven bounce or no assistance to seamers or spinners are also "poor".
