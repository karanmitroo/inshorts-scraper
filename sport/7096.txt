Responding to Steve Smith's assertion that India will be under pressure in the Bengaluru Test, Virat Kohli declared that he and his team are relaxed. "I know these minds games... are something they (Australians) are very good at," said Kohli. "The last time we played here against Australia, we won. We know exactly how the wicket plays," he added.
