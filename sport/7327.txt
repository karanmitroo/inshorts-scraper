Briton Ed Wood has set the Guinness World Record for the 'Fastest time to visit all English Football League stadiums' by attending 93 league matches in 189 days. The 51-year-old travelled over 35,400 km across England and raised £5500 (about ₹4.5 lakh) for the charity group, Prostate Cancer UK. Wood said his favourite ground was Newport County's Rodney Parade.
