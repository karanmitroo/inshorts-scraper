South African wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen stepped outside the pitch to smash a boundary during the fourth ODI against India on Saturday. Yuzvendra Chahal bowled the ball short outside off-stump in the 22nd over, as Klaasen moved across and pulled it over square leg for a one-bounce boundary. Man of the Match Klaasen scored 43*(27), including five fours and a six.
