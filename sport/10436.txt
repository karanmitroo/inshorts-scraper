Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has said that Cristiano Ronaldo deserves to win the Ballon d'Or as his past season's achievements are "unbeatable". The 74-year-old Scot stated, "I cannot think of anyone better to take the Ballon d'Or trophy...he (Ronaldo) has had a marvellous year". Ronaldo scored 51 goals in 48 appearances for Real Madrid last season.
