Indian Test opener Murali Vijay on Monday revealed that he played nearly half the recently-concluded Test season with a fractured wrist. "It was a difficult situation to be in, but the team always comes first," said the 33-year-old. "I was in pain and it is not in my personality to show what I'm going through and gain sympathy," added Vijay.
