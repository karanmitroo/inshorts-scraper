Kolkata's Eden Gardens will become the first Indian stadium to have stands named after war heroes, after Cricket Association of Bengal President Sourav Ganguly announced that two stands will be dedicated to soldiers. The Army, which owns the land on which the stadium is located, is yet to finalise the names, which will be unveiled before the next international match.
