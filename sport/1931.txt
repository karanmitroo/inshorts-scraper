Footballer Ryan Colclough, playing in England's third-tier league, left a match midway after scoring two goals, for his son's birth. The 22-year-old Wigan winger, who scored a goal in each half before being substituted in the 60th minute, pretended to cradle a baby in his arms to celebrate his goal. He then went to the hospital clad in his kit.
