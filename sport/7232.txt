Speaking about India's preparation for the remainder of the series, former captain Mohammed Azharuddin said, "I reckon Chinnaswamy won't have this kind of turn. So my gut feeling is that Jayant Yadav and Ishant Sharma may be dropped from the playing XI." "Going by their batting performance, I expect them to play an extra batsman, Karun Nair," Azharuddin added.
