Argentine footballer Mariano Bittolo had to have 10 stitches to his penis after his Albacete Balompi√© teammate Roman Zozulya accidentally kicked him with studs during a second-tier Spanish league match earlier this week. During an aerial attack, Zozulya jumped off the ground and headed the ball, accidentally landing his studs on Bittolo's groin.
