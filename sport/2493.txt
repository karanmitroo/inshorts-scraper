A gate of the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in New Delhi will be renamed after cricketer Virender Sehwag, in honour of the former Delhi player. Sehwag is expected to inaugurate the gate on October 31, a day before the opening T20I between India and New Zealand. The inauguration event will reportedly be attended by several former and current Indian cricketers.
