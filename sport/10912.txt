The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has stated it is confident that China will guarantee "free and uncensored" internet during the 2022 Winter Games to be held in Beijing. Social media sites like Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook are inaccessible in China. Notably, China had committed to providing media with the same freedom to report during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.
