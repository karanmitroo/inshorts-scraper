Brisbane Heat's Nathan Reardon crossed the long-on boundary after losing balance while attempting a catch in the Big Bash League. Reardon, however, threw the ball up in time and stepped back in the field to complete the catch. Perth Scorchers' Michael Klinger refused to leave the field as he believed it was a six but the replays showed otherwise.
