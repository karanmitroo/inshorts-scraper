Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni completed his 100th ODI stumping for India during the third ODI against Australia in Indore on Sunday. Dhoni achieved the feat after stumping Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell off Yuzvendra Chahal's bowling. Out of his 103 ODI stumpings, Dhoni has taken three in three matches for Asia XI in 2007.
