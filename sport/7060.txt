Talking about sledging by Virat Kohli in the Bengaluru Test, Australia's Matt Renshaw said, "He was just reminding me to run off and go to the toilet again which happened in Pune, so it was quite funny." "I was just trying to enjoy it and laugh at what (Kohli) was saying because some of it was quite funny," Renshaw added.
