A parked car caused a mass accident during the fourth stage of Tour of Britain cycling race in Retford town, taking down around 10 riders. The leading group of cyclists was able to avoid the car, which stood near a turn. The following group, however, crashed into the car's rear causing a pile up and injuring a few riders.
