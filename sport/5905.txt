The Wankhede stadium crowd sang 'Happy Birthday' for Sachin Tendulkar to mark the cricketer's 44th birthday, during the Mumbai Indians vs Rising Pune Supergiant match in the IPL on Monday. Tendulkar was also presented a cake by former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden, which he cut in the dugout. "I thought we would cut the cake quietly," said Sachin.
