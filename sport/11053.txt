Due to security reasons, The Great Khali's wrestling event, scheduled to be held in Gurgaon on October 8, was cancelled. Officials revealed that the event venue is being prepared to host Haryana's Golden Jubilee celebrations scheduled for November 1, which PM Narendra Modi will attend. However, Khali cited visa issues of international wrestlers and low tickets' sale for the cancellation.
