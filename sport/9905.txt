Virat Kohli got out on the next ball after Ravichandran Ashwin was dropped off Moeen Ali's bowling during the Vizag Test against England on Friday. In the 101st over, Ashwin played an edge towards Ben Stokes at first slip, who fumbled while Kohli took the strike. On the next ball, Kohli played the same shot, which was caught by Stokes.
