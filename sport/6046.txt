German sportswear company Adidas was slammed for sending "Congrats, you survived the Boston Marathon!" email to 2017 Boston Marathon finishers on Tuesday. The company was criticised for using the word 'survived', in reference to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and injured over 260 people. Adidas later apologised for the email.
