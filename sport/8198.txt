Inspired by Aamir Khan-starrer 'Dangal', residents of Kamod village in Haryana have put up their daughters' names on nameplates outside their houses. Village sarpanch Sudharshan Kumar started the initiative, which was soon followed by other villagers with the panchayat bearing the expenses. 'Dangal' tells the story of Haryana wrestlers Geeta and Babita Phogat, who are Commonwealth gold medalists.
