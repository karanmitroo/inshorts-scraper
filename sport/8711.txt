Swiss tennis star Roger Federer was seen playing on-screen bongo at the Hopman Cup in Australia on Wednesday. Federer, who was sitting in the stands along with the Swiss camp, began playing the bongos digitally superimposed under him on the arena's screen. Federer later tweeted that he has a backup career option as a bongo player.
