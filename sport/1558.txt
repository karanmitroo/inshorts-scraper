Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry paused her team's Women's Big Bash League match against Melbourne Stars after her six went on to hit and injure a young boy watching the game. Sydney Sixers' Perry, who rushed towards the fan after the ball hit him in the head following a deflection off a chair, ensured the boy received proper medical attention.
