A Russian state TV likened record Olympic medallist Michael Phelps' cupping therapy to meldonium, a banned performance drug. Pointing at the traditional Chinese medicinal therapy's effects, the show's anchor said, "the net effect from such practices in many ways, is not unlike those of meldonium". Several Russian athletes, including Maria Sharapova, have been tested positive for meldonium.
