Siberia's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest freshwater lake, recently hosted the 'Ice Storm' endurance skating and cycling competition. Participants had to cover 205 kilometres on bicycles and ice skates across three days. The competition made its debut in 2013 and has been an annual event ever since. In winters, the temperature in the area drops to as low as -30Â°C.
