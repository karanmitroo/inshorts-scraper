Reacting to Brazilian forward Neymar's record €222-million move to PSG from Barcelona, a user tweeted, "If you piled up Neymar's €222m transfer fee in €10 notes it would be nearly 3x taller than the tallest building in the world." Another tweet read, "The £200 million spent on one footballer could take 441,000 people out of poverty for a year."
