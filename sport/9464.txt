England and Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster, while trying to make a clearance, fumbled and produced an air-kick passing the ball to Crystal Palace's Christian Benteke who applied a simple finish to give his team a lead. The incident happened in the 33rd minute of the Premier League match, which was eventually won 3-0 by the home team Crystal Palace.
