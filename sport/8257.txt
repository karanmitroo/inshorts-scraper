Former tennis player Somdev Devvarman has written an open letter to the All India Tennis Association for bringing "bad publicity" to 19-year-old player Sumit Nagal. AITA had dropped Nagal from the Davis Cup squad for allegedly missing practice due to a hangover. Devvarman slammed AITA for giving "crap excuses" on why Nagal was dropped, besides "not caring enough about players".
