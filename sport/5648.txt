Rising Pune Supergiant pacer Jaydev Unadkat credited a 12-year-old boy's advice for his hat-trick against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Saturday. Unadkat shared a video on Instagram of the boy advising him to grip the ball across the seam to get a hat-trick. The bowler had met the boy at a meet-and-greet session a week before achieving the feat.
