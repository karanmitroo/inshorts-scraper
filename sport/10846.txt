Pakistan's Azhar Ali has become the first player to score a double century in day-night Tests, bringing up his 200 during the first Test against West Indies in Dubai. Earlier, Ali's century was the first instance of a hundred in a day-night Test. The ongoing Pakistan-West Indies Test is the second day-night game in Test cricket history.
