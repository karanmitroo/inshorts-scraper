Ex-IPL chairman Lalit Modi has claimed Interpol told him that he is not subject to a Red Notice, and was also not in their database. The Enforcement Directorate in 2016 had moved the Interpol for a Red Corner notice against Modi. A Red Notice means the subject may be arrested and extradited to the country where he is wanted.
