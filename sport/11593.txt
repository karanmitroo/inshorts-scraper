Thirteen swimming world records were set in both heats and finals on Thursday, the opening day of the Paralympic Games in Rio. Great Britain and Chinese athletes set two new records each, while Kazakhstan’s 50-year-old Paralympian Zulfiya Gabidullina clocked 1 minute, 30.07 seconds in the women’s 100-metre freestyle in the S3 category to smash the previous mark by five seconds.
