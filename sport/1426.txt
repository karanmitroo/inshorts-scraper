Egypt's Mohamed Elshorbagy defeated Marwan Elshorbagy in the first-ever men's final between two brothers in the 41-year history of the World Squash Championships in Manchester. "It was not a nice feeling at all," Mohamed said, after defeating his brother in the final. Mohamed landed his first world title after finishing runner-up twice in the last six years.
