Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama met members of the Australian cricket team, ahead of the Dharamsala Test against India beginning Saturday. "I asked him a question about sleep and how he could help me...we rubbed our noses together and he gave me some blessings," said captain Steve Smith. The team members also presented the spiritual leader with a signed shirt.
