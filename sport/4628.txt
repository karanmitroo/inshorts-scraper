A 25-year-old man from Punjab has set the Guinness World Record for balancing a spinning basketball on a toothbrush in his mouth for almost a minute. Sandeep Singh spun the basketball for 53 seconds as opposed to the previous record-holder, who performed the stunt for 6.84 seconds. Singh said, "It was my dream to break a world record."
