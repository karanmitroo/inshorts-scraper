Television umpires will call front-foot no balls in the ongoing England-Pakistan ODI series, on a trial basis. Feed from four cameras will be used to assist the umpire, who will convey his decision to his on-field counterparts. Two incidents this year, of a no-ball being wrongly called and denying a wicket in a Test, were reportedly behind ICC's decision.
