Australian captain Steven Smith flew to his left to complete a one-handed catch to dismiss New Zealand wicketkeeper BJ Watling off Mitchell Marsh's bowling during the first ODI at Sydney. Smith landed face-first but kept the ball secured up against his ribs. Earlier in the match, Smith hit his career-best score of 164 off 157 balls in ODIs.
