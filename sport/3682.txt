In an interview to Cheteshwar Pujara, cricketer KL Rahul jokingly said the seniors were abusing youngsters like him by making them field at short-leg. Pujara had trolled Rahul citing his recent injury, saying the only footprint he could see at NCA was of him. Rahul said Pujara was equally responsible for his injury as he wouldn't share short-leg with him.
