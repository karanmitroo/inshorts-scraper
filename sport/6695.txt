Former Australian cricketer Ian Chappell said that the Indian team has run out of ideas to dismiss Australian captain Steve Smith in the current Border-Gavaskar Test series. Smith is the highest scorer in the four-match series, having amassed 378 runs including two centuries in three Tests so far. "Smith's patience and thirst for runs is never-ending", Chappell said.
