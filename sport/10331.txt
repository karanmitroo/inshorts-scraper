The BCCI has informed the England team that it won't be able to pay its hotel and travelling bills due to financial restrictions levied on it by the Supreme Court. The board stated that it can temporarily pay for it but will need the funds remitted immediately. An ECB spokesman has confirmed that the series will go ahead as planned.
