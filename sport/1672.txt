Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja clean bowled Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal off a no-ball during the final day of the Delhi Test on Wednesday. Jadeja pitched the delivery on the middle before it hit the off-stump, but the Lankan captain survived after replays showed Jadeja had over-stepped the crease. Earlier, Angelo Mathews was given out off a no-ball by Jadeja.
