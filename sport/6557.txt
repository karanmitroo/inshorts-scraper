Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin became the first bowler in Test cricket history to take over 80 wickets in a single season of Test cricket. The 30-year-old, who has 82 scalps to his name, took 68% of his wickets against top-6 batsmen. The spinner averaged 24 against right-handers, four less than what he averaged against left-handed batsmen.
