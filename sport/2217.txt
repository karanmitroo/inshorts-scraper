Banned pacer S Sreesanth has said that he is sad that former captain Rahul Dravid did not stand by him despite knowing him well over the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. Sreesanth claimed he never fought with then Rajasthan Royals skipper Dravid, for which the team terminated his contract. He alleged Dravid knew the truth, but did not tell it publicly.
