All-rounder Axar Patel has been included in the Indian squad for the last two ODIs against Australia in place of Ravindra Jadeja. Axar, who was originally named in the squad for the first three ODIs as well, had sprained his ankle and was eventually replaced by Ravindra Jadeja, who did not play in any of the three matches.
