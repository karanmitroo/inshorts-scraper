The Kerala High Court on Monday lifted BCCI's lifetime ban imposed on cricketer S Sreesanth from the sport over the IPL 2013 spot-fixing case. The 34-year-old was later acquitted from the case by the Patiala House Court in 2015 but the ban stayed. The pacer, who last played for India in 2011, filed a petition challenging the ban in March.
