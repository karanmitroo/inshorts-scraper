Sachin Tendulkar took to Facebook to praise and share the story of how Indian women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj was introduced to cricket. During the ongoing Women's World Cup, Raj became the leading run-scorer in women's ODIs and also set the record for joint-most 50-plus scores. Reacting to Sachin's post, the 34-year-old tweeted, "Thanks for your kind words."
