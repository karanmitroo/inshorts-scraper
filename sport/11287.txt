SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh was elected as the President of the Boxing Federation of India on Sunday. Singh is also among the Vice Presidents of the Uttarakhand Boxing Association. The Federation went to polls after four years of administrative turmoil, with the election likely to benefit the country's boxers, who could not compete under the national flag.
