West Indian all-rounder Dwayne Bravo lost control of his bat which went flying around him while trying to hit a long shot off a Clint McKay delivery in a Big Bash League match on Thursday. Melbourne Renegades' Bravo was expecting a quicker ball but Sydney Thunder's McKay deceived him with a slower one which went on to hit the stumps.
