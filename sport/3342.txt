Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand made a winning start on returning to the Chess World Cup after 15 years on Sunday. Anand defeated 18-year-old Li Tian Yeoh of Malaysia in the first round of the first game. The 47-year-old, who has won the World Cup twice, never needed to play the tournament ever since winning the World Championships in 2007.
