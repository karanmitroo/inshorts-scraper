Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has set a Guinness World Record for the highest altitude football dropped and controlled at the club's training ground. Walcott controlled the football which was dropped from a height of 111 feet through the five touches required for a successful attempt. His teammates Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal and Francis Coquelin failed to match the record.
