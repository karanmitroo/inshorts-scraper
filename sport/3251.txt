England's James Anderson became the second-oldest pacer in the last 100 years to take a seven-wicket haul in a Test innings, after finishing with figures of 7/42 against Windies at Lord's. Anderson's achievement at the age of 35 years and 39 days is only behind Imran Khan's seven-for that he took aged 35 years and 129 days in 1988.
