Ex-England cricketers David Gower and John Morris went for a plane ride and flew the plane over the stadium during a warm-up match on January 21, 1991, on their tour to Australia. England were playing at the Carrara Oval when Gower and Morris, who had been dismissed, went to an airfield to take a plane ride while England were batting.
