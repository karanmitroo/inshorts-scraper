Former Arsenal and Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has been handed a six-month ban from football for undergoing intravenous drip treatment at Los Angeles in 2016. Nasri received 500 millilitres of hydration in the form of sterile water which contained micronutrient components, but it breached rules set by World Anti-Doping Agency. Nasri is currently without a club.
