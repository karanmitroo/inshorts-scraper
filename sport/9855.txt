South Africa's Dale Steyn has said the ball-tampering controversy involving captain Faf du Plessis should be blamed "on a lollipop". Du Plessis was charged for rubbing the ball with saliva with a lollipop in his mouth. Steyn tweeted, "Beaten with the bat. Beaten with the ball. Beaten in the field...Here's a idea, Let's blame it on a lollipop, #soft."
