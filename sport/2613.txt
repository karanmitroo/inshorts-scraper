The three-match T20I series between India and Australia ended at 1-1 after the final T20I in Hyderabad was abandoned without a ball being bowled. The match could not take place as the outfield was wet due to rain in Hyderabad over the past few days. India will next host New Zealand for a three-match ODI series, starting October 22.
