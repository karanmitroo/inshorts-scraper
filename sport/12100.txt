Indian men's hockey team qualified for the Olympics' knockout round after 36 years, earning a quarterfinal berth at Rio on Thursday. The team, which had earlier in the day lost to Netherlands, made it to the next round after Argentina drew with Germany. India's last knockout qualification came at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, in which they had won the Gold.
