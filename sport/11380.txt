Boxer Manoj Kumar has urged PM Narendra Modi to take strict action against the terrorists and answer their bullets with grenades. I can understand the pain of the kin of those who were martyred in the Uri attack as I’m a soldier’s son, he said. Kumar further criticised the separatists and sympathisers of terrorists and demanded their privileges be curtailed.
