Sports Ministry has included former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag and domestic cricketer Vinay Lamba in their Anti-Doping Appeals Panel. It is for the first time that cricketers have found a place in an anti-doping panel of India's National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA). This comes after a WADA report claimed that an unnamed Indian cricketer had tested positive for doping in 2016.
