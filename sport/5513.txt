Pakistan registered their first-ever Test series victory in West Indies, winning the third Test at Roseau by 101 runs on Sunday. The series was the final one for Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq and batsman Younis Khan, who had earlier announced their retirements. Misbah retires as Pakistan's most successful Test captain, without having led the team in his own country.
