A mass brawl broke out on the pitch with the referee showing four red cards during stoppage time in the Russian Cup final in Sochi recently. Lokomotiv Moscow was leading 2-0 during the three added minutes when Ural Yekaterinburg players attacked their opponents. Other players on the field also exchanged blows before the referee sent off two from each side.
