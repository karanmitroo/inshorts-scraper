Wishing Indian pacer Ishant Sharma on his 29th birthday, former cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Happy Birthday @ImIshant. Burj Khalifa ji, found out your trainer. Keep entertaining and stay blessed." Alongside the tweet, Sehwag posted a picture titled 'Unusual portrait of a Victorian lady, 1840', likening it to Ishant's face expression when he mimicked Australian captain Steve Smith in March.
