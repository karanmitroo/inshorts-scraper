The Supreme Court has asked all BCCI officials above the age of 70 years to vacate their posts as per Lodha Panel recommendations. The order means Tamil Nadu's N Srinivasan and Saurashtra's Niranjan Shah will now have to relinquish their positions. This decision by the SC will act like a template for all sports federations in India, Justice Lodha said.
