Playing against Zimbabwe in the Under-19 World Cup, Indian opener Shubman Gill successfully hit a six with a short-arm jab, a shot made famous after Indian captain Virat Kohli played it against England last year. Kohli's shot, which saw him pull a waist-high ball from Chris Woakes with a straight bat, was dispatched into the stands.
