Following Australia's 11th consecutive away ODI loss, Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh said the current Australian team is like the Sri Lankan team playing in yellow jersey. "I don't think in [Australia] anyone other than Finch or Warner or...Steve Smith can take the team forward," he added. Earlier, Harbhajan had asked Michael Clarke to come out of retirement and rescue Australia.
