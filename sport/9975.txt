ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit head Ronnie Flanagan has proposed tracking cricketers' social media activities to prevent match fixing. "Instead of just asking for a player's billing records, we might seek the ability to take the devices and download them to see what communications had been made," said Flanagan. The proposal is likely to be accepted by the ICC early next year.
