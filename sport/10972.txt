Relay catching in cricket is when a lofted shot, sailing towards the boundary, is caught by a fielder who leaps to catch the ball and then throws it mid-air to a fellow fielder, before crossing the boundary. Australia's Glenn Maxwell affected a similar relay catch by leaping and sending the ball into play, before Rob Quiney took the catch.
