Indian captain Virat Kohli will not renew his multi-crore contract with PepsiCo, which he has endorsed for six years. Kohli is reportedly not keen to renew his contract, which expired on April 30, after commenting, "If I myself won't consume such things, I won't urge others to consume it, just because I am getting money out of it."
