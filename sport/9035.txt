The Indian cricket team will not get a performance incentive after their 4-0 victory over England due to the Supreme Court restricting BCCI's financial freedom. As per the order, BCCI cannot take any financial decisions till it complies with the Lodha Panel recommendations. The Board had announced â‚¹2 crore for the team after it defeated South Africa 3-0 in 2015.
