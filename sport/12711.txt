South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius was sentenced to six years in prison on Wednesday for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. The athlete, nicknamed 'Blade Runner', was initially convicted of manslaughter but the case was upgraded to a murder conviction. Pistorius had shot Steenkamp four times through a locked door in February 2013.
