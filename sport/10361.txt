International cricket's first concession occurred on November 3, 1978, when Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi called his batsmen off the field as a protest against the bowling of Pakistan's Sarfraz Nawaz. As a result of the concession the opposition was declared the winner of the match, when India needed 23 runs off 14 balls with eight wickets in hand.
