Australian spinner Nathan Lyon accidentally burnt a toast, setting off the fire alarm during his team New South Wales' first-class match against Queensland on Wednesday. Play was suspended for nearly 30 minutes, as the alarm forced evacuation of the stand where both teams were sitting. "There's a first for everything," said Lyon, after the incident.
