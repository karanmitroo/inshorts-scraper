Australian captain Steve Smith imitated teammate Glenn Maxwell's dismissal against Brisbane Heat in the 2014 Big Bash League, for an upcoming Ashes Cricket video game. Maxwell was left clueless following a swinging delivery, which went on to hit the stumps. Earlier, Maxwell had imitated Smith's batting stance for the game along with Ravindra Jadeja's sword celebration.
