Former players Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly recently picked their most memorable Test matches at an event in Kolkata. While Ganguly chose the 2001 Kolkata Test against Australia, Kumble said the 2002 Headingley Test "changed the mindset of Indian cricketers". Sehwag picked the 2003 Adelaide Test against Australia as his favourite, which India won by four wickets.
