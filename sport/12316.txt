Sports’ statistician Mohandas Menon posted pictures on Twitter of a Sanskrit cricket booklet, which translates cricket glossary and other important events into Sanskrit. Menon shared shots from certain sections of the booklet, which showed translations of batting and bowling terms in Sanskrit, and translation of Ravi Shastri’s commentary during Dhoni’s winning six in the 2011 World Cup final.
