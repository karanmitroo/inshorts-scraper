Australian spinners Steve O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon have consulted former New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath to prepare for their India tour, which begins February 23. "The main things you get from those guys is challenging the batter's defence," said O'Keefe, who also worked with former England spinner Monty Panesar to prepare for the series.
