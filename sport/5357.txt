The national anthem of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was played at the start of a cricket match in South Kashmir's Pulwama district on Sunday, with pictures of terrorists reportedly placed near the trophies. The event was streamed live on Facebook, which showed spectators indulging in "Azaadi" chants before the anthem. A cricketer said the incident was not a rare occurrence.
