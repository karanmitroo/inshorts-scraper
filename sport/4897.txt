Russia's Hermitage Museum has chosen Achilles, one of its resident cats, to predict the results of matches in the upcoming international football tournament Confederations Cup, to be held in the nation starting on Saturday. The five-year-old moggy cat will be offered two different plates before each game to predict the winner of the Confederations Cup match.
