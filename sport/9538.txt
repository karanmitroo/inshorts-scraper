Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid revealed that the greatest fast bowler he faced in his career was Australian Glenn McGrath. Claiming that no one challenged his knowledge of the off-stump as much as McGrath, Dravid added, "He was relentless and gave you nothing...he just had that level of accuracy and control." Dravid scored 2,166 runs in 33 Tests against Australia.
