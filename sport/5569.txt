Mumbai Indians player Kieron Pollard took a deliberate short run in the IPL match against Kings XI Punjab on Thursday so that he could retain strike. By cricket laws, a deliberate short run may be punishable. The on-field umpires may warn the batsman, disallow runs on that delivery, and in case of repeat instances, award penalty runs to the opposition.
