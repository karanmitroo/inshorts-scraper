BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said the Board cannot help Olympic sports as much as they would like to, till their Income Tax (IT) Exemption remains withdrawn. “We want to help other sports grow. We had contributed ₹50 crore to the National Sports Development Fund but we still don’t know whether the money has been spent or not,” said Thakur.
