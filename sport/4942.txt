Indian fans defended Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed after he was trolled for his English-speaking skills on social media. At a press conference where there were just English reporters, Sarfraz had said, "Saare English waley hain kya?" Memes were posted on Sarfraz, on which Indian fans commented, "English isn't a benchmark of genius. He is a cricketer, not a TV anchor."
