Talking about Virat Kohli's captaincy, fast bowler Umesh Yadav has said that Kohli is a bowler's captain as he backs the bowlers to set their own fields. "Kohli asks me what my plan is or whether I need a particular fielder at a position...Only if the plan doesn't work, he would come up and tell...let's try this," added Yadav.
