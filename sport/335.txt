After becoming the oldest world number one in tennis history, Swiss tennis player Roger Federer said, "It's a deep sense of satisfaction...Just having had the year that I've had, winning three slams, that's what it took to get the ranking." The 36-year-old first became world number one in 2004 and went on to stay at the position for 237 weeks.
