Three-time NBA champion LeBron James has criticised US President Donald Trump over his response to the recent Virginia violence and said the "so-called President" has made hate fashionable in the country again. Trump defended some of the far-right factions involved in the violence by saying, "Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, not all of those people were white supremacists."
