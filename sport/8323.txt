Recalling his 254-run innings against Pakistan on January 16, 2006, in Lahore, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "11 years ago, had the privilege to celebrate #PakistanKaBhootBanaya Diwas!". In reply to Pakistan's total of 679/7d, Sehwag and Dravid's 410-run opening stand, which was 3 runs short of the then world record, helped India salvage a draw in the Test.
