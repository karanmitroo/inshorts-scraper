Indian pacer Mohammad Shami has said all the extra-marital affair and domestic violence allegations, made against him from an unverified Facebook account bearing the name of his wife Hasin Jahan, are a conspiracy against him. The account posted screenshots of Messenger and WhatsApp messages allegedly exchanged between Shami and multiple women, and also claimed he had married a Pakistani girl.
