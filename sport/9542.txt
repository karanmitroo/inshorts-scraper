Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Shahryar Khan has said that the board is not "begging" the BCCI to play the country in a series. "We are not begging...BCCI signed a Memorandum of Understanding to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023 and they didn't meet their commitment," said Khan, who will discuss the issue at the Asian Cricket Council meeting.
