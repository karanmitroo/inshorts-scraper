In a unique cricketing occurrence, only one of the eleven batsmen in an under-19 game in South Africa managed to score more than one run in the entire innings. Interestingly, Shania-Lee Swart scored 160 while 'extras' were the next best scorer with nine runs. Moreover, Swart's contribution amounted to 95% of the total, which is the highest in any format.
