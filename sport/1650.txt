Former Indian batsman VVS Laxman trolled former Sri Lankan cricketer Russel Arnold on Twitter after the latter tweeted that the upcoming India-Sri Lanka ODI series would not end in a 5-0 whitewash like it happened during India's tour of Sri Lanka. Laxman responded to Arnold's tweet with, "Sure Russel, it won't in a 3 match series. This prediction won't fail."
