Olympic gymnast Dipa Karmakar, who is scheduled to participate in the Challenger Cup in Germany, might miss the tournament since the Gymnastics Federation of India cannot form a full Indian team. Reportedly, the Federation wanted to form a six-member Indian contingent since it "didn't make financial sense to send Dipa alone", but has been able to finalise only three gymnasts.
