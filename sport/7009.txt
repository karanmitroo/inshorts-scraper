After former Australian cricketer Ian Healy claimed to have lost respect for Indian captain Virat Kohli, Kohli said that there are 1.2 billion people in India, one person doesnâ€™t make a difference to his life. Kohli also suggested the journalists watch a YouTube video of Healy's ill-tempered behaviour after being given out in a Test at Centurion in 1997.
