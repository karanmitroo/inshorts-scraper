Anil Kumble stepped down as Team India coach on Tuesday amid reports of a rift with Virat Kohli. Kumble had stayed back in London while the team travelled to West Indies, citing his commitment to an ICC meeting. Earlier, Kumble was given an extension for the West Indies tour, after his contract expired at the end of the Champions Trophy.
