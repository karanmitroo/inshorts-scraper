Virat Kohli on Sunday became the first player to score six ODI hundreds as a captain in a  calendar year, after smashing his 32nd hundred against New Zealand in the series-decider. With 20 tons in 93 innings, Kohli has now scored third-most international hundreds as captain, behind ex-Australian captain Ricky Ponting (41) and ex-South African captain Graeme Smith (33).
