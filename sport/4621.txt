Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene is reportedly set to lead the International Cricket Council's (ICC) World XI squad for the proposed three-match T20 series against Pakistan. The series, which will be recognised as an international series, will be played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore in September. Pakistan have hosted just one series after 2009 SL team bus attack.
