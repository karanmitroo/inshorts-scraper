Former Australian spinner Shane Warne has said that Australia captain Steve Smith is the best Test batsman in the world, ahead of India captain Virat Kohli. "The hole in Kohli's CV on the Test match stage is in England and the pressure is on [him] to carry over double-ton magic from home soil to that country," he added.
