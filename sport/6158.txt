Former Indian all-rounder Vinoo Mankad has a cricketing rule named after him in the Marylebone Cricket Club rule book. The Mankad rule, named following a dismissal involving the player, relates to a non-striker's run-out by a bowler before he delivers the ball. Mankad ran out Australia's Bill Brown while bowling during the second Test of India's 1947/8 tour to Australia.
