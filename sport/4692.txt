Former tennis star Boris Becker, who was recently declared bankrupt by a London court, had his Porsche Cayenne GTS and electric blue Maserati GHIBLI-S towed by authorities in London. Becker has been slapped with two parking tickets after he left his cars outside a South Kensington private member's club. Notably, Becker has failed to pay a long-standing debt since 2015.
