Former England and Chelsea football captain John Terry's picture has reappeared as a "statutory warning" on packs of cigarette brand Gold Flake in India. Terry posted a picture of the pack on Instagram stories, saying he was "disgusted" and he "hates" smoking. Earlier in 2012, Terry had taken legal action against the company for the same usage of his image.
