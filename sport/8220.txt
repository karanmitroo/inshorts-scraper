MS Dhoni was denied a six when the ball hit the spidercam during the Cuttack ODI against England on Thursday. Dhoni, batting at 93*, pulled the ball over mid-wicket which hit the spidercam and the umpire declared it a dead ball. On the next ball, Dhoni hit the ball over long-on that hit the top-most stand at the boundary.
