Brazil's Supreme Court on Tuesday named the Sport Recife team as the 1987 league title winners after a 30-year-long dispute with club Flamengo over Brazil's league winner. The teams had been crowned league winners in two separate leagues which were being run concurrently in 1987. The panel decided that Sport Recife beat Flamengo 3-1 to be crowned the league champions.
