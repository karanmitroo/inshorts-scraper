Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that the onus of conducting dope tests on Indian cricketers is on WADA, as ICC is registered with the agency and must comply with its rules. The BCCI had earlier said that NADA, the government anti-doping body, has no jurisdiction to conduct dopes tests on Indian cricketers.
