Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo produced an elastico nutmeg against an Espanyol defender in their La Liga encounter on Saturday. Cutting inside from the left byline, Ronaldo performed the zig-zag dribble to nutmeg the defender before attempting to set up a chance for teammate Alvaro Morata. The move ultimately resulted in nothing as the pass was intercepted by another defender.
