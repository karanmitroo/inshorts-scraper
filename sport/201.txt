South African pacer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who was banned from cricket for eight years over a match-fixing scandal in 2015, now works as a DJ. "People are shocked when they see me DJing at local pubs. They think I'm down and out but I'm not," Tsotsobe said. He is also a part of a company that supplies oil, petrol, and diesel.
