Windies' Chris Gayle is the only cricketer to hit the first ball of a Test match for a maximum. Gayle, who turned 38 on Thursday, achieved the feat by smashing Bangladesh debutant spinner Sohag Gazi for a six on the first ball of 2012's Mirpur Test, the 2,051st Test in history. Gayle has hit 442 sixes, second-most in international cricket.
