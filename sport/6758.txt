Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, who scored his third double century in Test cricket, became the first batsman to score over 2,000 runs in a single season of first-class cricket in India. After registering his 11th first-class double ton on Sunday, Pujara also became India's joint-highest double century-maker in first-class cricket alongside Vijay Merchant.
