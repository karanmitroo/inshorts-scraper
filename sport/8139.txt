Virat Kohli's fan Nikash Kanhar, who hails from Kandhamal district in Odisha, sold off his mother's jewellery to finance his travels and meet the cricketer. The 33-year old private bus conductor has met Kohli four times, the last being at the second ODI in Cuttack. "Kohli asks me about myself whenever he sees me," said Nikash.
