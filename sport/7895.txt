A study by European researchers has revealed some drugs improve players' chess-playing ability, showing a 13-15% improvement in results. Tests were conducted for two over-the-counter drugs on 39 male players, playing 15-minute games against a software. Presently, dope tests are conducted in chess for drugs that improve physical performance of players, with no mechanism to detect brain stimulants.
