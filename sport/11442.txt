As per reports, international football governing body FIFA has ended its association with French magazine L’Équipe in awarding the annual FIFA Ballon d’Or, the award for the world’s best footballer. The bodies came together in 2010 when the FIFA World Player of the Year award became defunct. Since then, Argentina’s Lionel Messi has won the award four times.
