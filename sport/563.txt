BCCI's official domain, bcci.tv, reportedly expired on Saturday and the website is still down even while the second India-South Africa ODI is taking place. BCCI has yet not renewed the domain, which is registered under the name of former BCCI Vice President Lalit Modi, according to website's registration details. The domain registrars have put up the website for public bidding.
