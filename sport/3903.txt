Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Shahryar Khan, who is set to leave office this month, has revealed that the biggest failure of his three-year tenure was the inability to restore India-Pakistan bilateral cricket. In 2014, PCB and BCCI signed a Memorandum of Understanding which stated that the two nations would play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.
