An Australian newspaper has claimed Virat Kohli hurled a bottle at an Australian team official and made a throat-slitting gesture towards batsman Peter Handscomb during the Bengaluru Test. The report also accuses Anil Kumble of storming into the umpires' room over Kohli's dismissal, calling him "one of the main instigators of the Monkeygate fiasco" and "the puppeteer behind the scenes".
