Pakistan's Hockey Federation is contemplating filing a case in the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the International Hockey Federation, following the country's ouster from the Junior Hockey World Cup. "PHF is clear that the FIH, which is headed by an Indian, has dealt unjustly with it," an official said. FIH withdrew their invite to Pakistan citing delay in confirmation.
