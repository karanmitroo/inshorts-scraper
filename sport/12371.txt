Athletes arriving for next monthâ€™s Rio Olympics are being greeted with condoms in every room of the Games Village. Reportedly, 4,50,000 condoms and 1,75,000 lubricant packets have been stocked at the Olympic Village for the 10,500 participating athletes. The count has risen three times from London 2012, due to fears of outbreak of the Zika virus.
