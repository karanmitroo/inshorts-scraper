BCCI's acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary has said the $400 million (nearly â‚¹2,500 crore) offer presented by the ICC before the board is "far less than what the country deserves". "The facts are that over 70% of cricket's revenue world over comes from the Indian market," Chaudhary added. The ICC had abolished the 'Big Three model' last week.
