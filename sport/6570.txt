Sunil Gavaskar has said that following Steve Smith's "brain fade" in the Bengaluru Test, Australia have got only one of 12 referrals right. "I think they got seven out of 16 spot on before the brain fade controversy," Gavaskar said. Smith had turned towards the dressing room before taking a review in Bengaluru, and later called it a "brain fade".
