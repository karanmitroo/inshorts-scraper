An advertisement featuring Bangladeshi cricketer Sabbir Rahman has been taken off air by Bangladesh Cricket, after social media labelled it as "too raunchy". The promo, of a non-alcoholic drink, shows Rahman being handcuffed by a woman police officer while drinking the beverage. "It does not fit with the image of Bangladesh Cricket," an official was quoted as saying.
