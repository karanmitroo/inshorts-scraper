Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has revealed that the England and Wales Cricket Board ignored his job application for the coach's post in 2014, as they thought someone else had emailed them. "I wrote an email, three weeks past and no reply...(I found out) the ECB thought it wasn't me despite me having one email all my life," he added.
