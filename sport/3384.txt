Indian opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan is set to miss the 5th ODI and the one-off T20I against Sri Lanka, as he will fly back to India to attend to his ailing mother. The 31-year-old has scored 190 runs in four ODIs against SL. Notably, BCCI has decided against sending a replacement for the final two fixtures of the tour.
