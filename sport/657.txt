After India defeated Pakistan in the U-19 World Cup semi-final, ex-Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja said Pakistan should consider giving charge of the youth team to someone like Indian coach Dravid. He added that Dravid deserved a lot of credit for "grooming India U-19 players so effectively". "In Pakistan, we need a total revamp of our youth cricket system," he stated.
