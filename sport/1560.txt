India's two-day practice match ahead of their three-match Test series against South Africa which was scheduled for December 30 and 31 at Boland Park in Paarl has been cancelled. The Indian team has instead opted for training sessions on those days. This was the only match before the first Test in Cape Town from January 5, 2018.
