American tennis player Serena Williams has praised world number one Andy Murray, after he corrected a reporter for making a "sexist" statement post his defeat to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon. "He's done so much for us on our tour, so we love Andy...There really shouldn't be a female athlete that is not totally supportive of Andy Murray," Serena said.
