Cricket Australia has written to ICC notifying them about referee Chris Broad, who was watching golf in the umpires' room during an ODI versus South Africa on September 30. The incident came to light after Broad tweeted a picture of himself watching golf with the pitch in the background, captioned "Cricket? What cricket? #bbcrydercup". ICC is yet to reply.
