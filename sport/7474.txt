Former Pakistani cricketer Rameez Raja trolled wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal over the latter dropping catches in matches. During a television segment at the Pakistan Super League in UAE, Rameez said Akmal's favourite pickup line would be, "Can I drop you somewhere?" Akmal has been trolled on Twitter for his dropped catches, once dropping four catches in one session of a Test.
