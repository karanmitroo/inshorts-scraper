Rising Pune Supergiant's MS Dhoni smashed one of the biggest sixes of the IPL 2017 off the bowling of Royal Challengers Bangalore's Yuzvendra Chahal on Sunday. Dhoni came down the pitch to hit the last ball of Chahal's first over, which got stuck on Chinnaswamy Stadium's roof. Interestingly, the six was both IPL 2017's and Dhoni's T20 career's 212th six.
