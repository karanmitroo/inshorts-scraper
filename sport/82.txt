The ICC removed Pakistan as a host of the 2011 World Cup after the Sri Lankan cricket team's bus was attacked by terrorists on March 3, 2009, on its way to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The attackers killed eight people and injured six Sri Lankan players. Notably, no international cricket match took place in Pakistan for the next six years.
