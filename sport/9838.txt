South African female cricketer Mignon du Preez produced a Jonty Rhodes-like effort to take a diving catch against Australia on Sunday. Australian opener Nicole Bolton attempted to cut an away going delivery but could not get past du Preez, who was fielding at the backward point. The teams were playing the second ODI of the ICC Women's Championship in Australia.
