Tennis player Novak Djokovic went live on Facebook while trekking in Serbia, showcasing the wall he would practice tennis on during the 1990s Yugoslav Wars. The wall, near a tennis club run by Djokovic's parents, was described by Djokovic as "bearing the marks of shots and bombings". He also played a few shots on the wall along with his wife.
