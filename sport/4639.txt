In a letter to the Indian sports ministry, suspended wrestler Narsingh Yadav has questioned Olympic medal-winning wrestler Sushil Kumar's appointment as a national observer, alleging a conflict of interest in Sushil's appointment. Narsingh alleges that in his role as the observer Sushil would favour wrestlers from Chhatrasal Stadium's akhada, which is run by Sushil's father-in-law Satpal Singh.
