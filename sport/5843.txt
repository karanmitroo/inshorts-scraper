Gujarat Lions' Brendon McCullum pulled off a juggling catch at the long-on boundary to dismiss Royal Challengers Bangalore's Sreenath Aravind off James Faulkner's bowling. McCullum lost momentum after taking the catch first time but managed to throw the ball up before stepping outside the boundary line. He then came back inside the fence and successfully completed the catch.
