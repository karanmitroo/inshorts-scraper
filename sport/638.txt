Bangladesh's total of 513/10 against Sri Lanka in the first Test on Thursday is the highest total in Test cricket history not including a bye or a leg-bye. This was also Bangladesh's fifth-highest total in Test cricket. The previous record for such a score was held by Australia who scored 494/7 against South Africa in 2014.
