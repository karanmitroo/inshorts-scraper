Devendra Jhajharia, who became the first Paralympian to be recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, said he should have been given the award in 2005. "I feel very happy to be awarded the Khel Ratna but I feel I should have been given the award 12 years ago when I won Gold at the 2004 Athens Paralympics," said Jhajharia.
