The organisers of the biathlon world championship in Austria played the wrong national anthem for Russia, following which the Russian gold medalists were forced to sing the correct version.  When fans began booing at the wrong national anthem, sports commentator Dmitry Guberniev rushed on stage and handed the microphone to Aleksei Volkov, Maksim Tsvetkov, Anton Shipulin and Anton Babikov.
