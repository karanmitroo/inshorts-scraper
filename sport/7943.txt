UFC champion Conor McGregor has taken an indefinite break from UFC and has said that he wants to next fight former boxing champion, Floyd Mayweather. "I've got this situation where people are truly doubting me like they doubted me at the very, very beginning, and that's motivating for me," said McGregor about the potential fight.
