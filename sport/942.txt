Hobart Hurricanes' Jofra Archer inflicted a run-out with a direct hit while lying down, having one stump in view to aim at, during a BBL match against Adelaide Strikers on Wednesday. Jofra was off balance when he produced the accurate throw while both batsmen were near the centre of the pitch. The run-out ended Hurricanes' first-wicket stand of 171 runs.
