The International Shooting Sport Federation has announced new rules to bring gender equality in shooting sports. To bring parity among both categories, the number of shots in all women's events have been increased, making them equal to men's events. Women's 10m Air Rifle and Air Pistol events will now have 60 shots instead of 40.
