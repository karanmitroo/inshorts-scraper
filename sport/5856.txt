Pakistani cricketers Umar Akmal and Junaid Khan publicly snapped at each other before a domestic match, following which the country's cricket board launched a probe. Junaid failed to turn up for the match after which Akmal, who was the team's captain, publicly said he had no idea why Junaid was absent. Junaid posted a video expressing disappointment at Akmal's statement.
