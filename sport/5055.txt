Sri Lanka chased down India's 321 on Thursday to record the highest successful chase in Champions Trophy history. This was also Sri Lanka's joint-highest successful chase in ODIs with them having chased 321 against England in 2006. Notably, this was the first time India failed to defend a 300-plus team total in an ICC tournament match.
