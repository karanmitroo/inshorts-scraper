India will overtake South Africa to become the top-ranked ODI team if they defeat Sri Lanka 3-0 in the three-match ODI series, which begins from Sunday. India, currently tied with SA with 120 rating points, will claim the top spot on winning the first ODI but will have to ensure a 3-0 whitewash to retain the top ranking.
