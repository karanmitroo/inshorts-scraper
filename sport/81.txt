For the first time in the nation's history, Saudi Arabia's women participated in an all-female marathon. The three-km-long marathon, held in the eastern province of al-Ahsa on Saturday, reportedly saw participation from 1,500 women across several categories. Earlier in January, Saudi Arabia allowed its women, for the first time, to spectate at a football match.
