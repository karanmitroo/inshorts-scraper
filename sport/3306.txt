FIFA has blocked the transfer of midfielder Adrien Silva to former Premier League champions Leicester City after the club missed the deadline to submit player registration documents by 14 seconds. This means that Leicester own the player but because the deal was not completed adequately, the club has to pay Silva's wages until he can be registered again in January.
