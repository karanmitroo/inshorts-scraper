Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has said that current skipper Virat Kohli is going to rewrite all cricket records after the 28-year-old scored his fourth double century against Bangladesh in Hyderabad on Friday. "He is on his way to becoming a legend," Gavaskar said in an interview. Notably, Kohli has scored 16 Test tons in 54 Tests so far.
