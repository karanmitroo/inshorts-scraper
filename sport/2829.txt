Ghulam Haider Abbas, a Pakistani bowler, tried to immolate himself by pouring petrol over himself during a first-class match in Lahore, after complaining of being constantly overlooked by the selectors. Abbas, who was pacified by onlookers, warned that if his plea goes unheard by Pakistan's cricket board, he would set himself on fire at the entrance of Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium.
