Cricket Association for the Blind in India's General Secretary John David has challenged Virat Kohli-led Team India to play a match blindfolded against India's visually impaired team. He said the match should be televised so people get to know about the level of difficulty that goes in playing cricket without eyesight. This comes after CABI requested for recognition from BCCI.
