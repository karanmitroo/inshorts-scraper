Demanding the return of Kevin Pietersen to the England cricket team, British journalist Piers Morgan tweeted, "England's definitely 'moved on' from Kevin Pietersen - from No1 in the world to global cricket laughing stock. #BringBackKP." Morgan also congratulated the Indian team for its series victory, adding, "All over. A 4-0 drubbing. Congrats @imVkohli & his brilliant India team."
