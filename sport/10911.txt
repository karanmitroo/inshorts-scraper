Former Indian cricketer, Virender Sehwag was trolled by his wife, Aarti Sehwag, after his tweet congratulating Ravichandran Ashwin mentioned the urgency of a married man going home early. Ashwin's wife responded with a tweet that claimed that she didn't do much, in response to which Sehwag's wife also tweeted, "Neither did I. Both in a hurry as always @ashwinravi99 @virendersehwag".
