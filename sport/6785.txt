Former Pakistani captain Javed Miandad has called for strong measures against match-fixing, suggesting death penalty for guilty players. "Why don't you take strong measures? You should give death penalty to such people. We must not tolerate such things, not at all," said Miandad. Five Pakistani players have been named in a spot-fixing scandal in the recently-concluded Pakistan Super League.
