Play was stopped during an ice hockey game in USA's National Hockey League on Monday, after a fan threw a dead catfish onto the rink as a good luck charm. The Nashville Predators fan was not arrested but barred from the arena, where the match was being played.  Notably, Predators' fans have been following the fish-throwing tradition since 2003.
