Former Indian cricketer and Sachin Tendulkar's childhood friend, Vinod Kambli claimed the two hugged and made up with each other during a book launch on Monday. "We want to tell people that we're back. It was mutual, and I'm very glad about it," Kambli said. In 2009, Kambli said Tendulkar could've done more to keep him in the Indian team.
