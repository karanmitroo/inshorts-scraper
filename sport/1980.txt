Windies all-rounder Kieron Pollard on Saturday became only the second player in history to hit 500 sixes in T20 cricket. Pollard achieved the feat after slamming three sixes for Dhaka Dynamites against Rajshahi Kings in a Bangladesh Premier League match. Pollard is only behind compatriot Chris Gayle, who has smashed 772 sixes in 303 T20 innings.
