Indian women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj has become the second woman player to cross 5,500 runs in ODIs, achieving the feat during India's women's World Cup qualifier against South Africa on Wednesday. The 34-year-old recently rose to the second spot in the women's ODI rankings, and is India's highest ODI run-getter, besides playing most 50-over matches for the country.
