Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo shared a video of one of the three goals scored by his son in a match. "So proud of my boy. hat trick," Ronaldo captioned the video. In the video, the goalkeeper is seen mishitting a shot which lands on Ronaldo Jr's feet, who then sends the ball into the top-right corner with his left foot.
