Government think-tank NITI Aayog has released a 20-point action plan for the 2024 Summer Olympics, which aims at the country winning at least 50 medals at the Games. The agency has recommended identifying 10 sports with high winning potential and focussing on them, besides categorising players based on their potential. India won two medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
