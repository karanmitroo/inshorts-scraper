Rising Pune Supergiant owner Sanjiv Goenka's brother Harsh compared the partnership of MS Dhoni and Steve Smith to Sholay's Jai-Veeru in a tweet before the IPL final. Harsh was earlier trolled on Twitter for praising Smith over Dhoni, when he tweeted that the new RPS captain overshadowed Dhoni. He had also said appointing Smith as captain was a "good move".
