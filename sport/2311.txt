German tennis player Alexander Zverev untied the chair umpire's shoelace during his Paris Masters Round-of-32 match after the latter asked him to hide his watch. The umpire had asked him to hide it due to sponsor issues, but Zverev argued that his contract required him to display it. Zverev then hid his watch and untied umpire's shoelace while changing sides.
