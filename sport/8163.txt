Former world number one John McEnroe, playing men's doubles in the Australian Open Legends event, faked an injury and collapsed, after which his opponent gave him mock CPR on court. McEnroe, playing alongside brother Patrick, faked a fall while returning a shot, when opponent Mansour Bahrami came running, checked his pulse, covered his face and gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
