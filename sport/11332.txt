Former cricketer Allan Border, who led Australia in the tied Test against India in Chennai in 1986, said that was the match which kicked off the India-Australia rivalry in cricket. "The rivalry between Australia and India has been phenomenal... There was also the VVS (Laxman) and (Rahul) Dravid match. Those are the things you don't see very often," said Border.
