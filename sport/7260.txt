Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday called for more sporting pitches to be prepared for the remaining three matches of the ongoing Test series. "If Australia's spinners keep bowling so accurately, India will be scared of preparing turning pitches," said Ganguly. "India's best chance would be to play on good pitches," added the former cricketer.
