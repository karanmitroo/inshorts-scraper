German tennis player Dustin Brown hit a diving volley, which is being widely called "the shot of the tournament", in his Wimbledon opening round match against Portugal's Joao Sousa on Monday. Following a rally, Brown approached the net and hit the volley winner after reaching a passing shot by diving full stretch towards his right.
