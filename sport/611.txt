A father of three victims of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar rushed towards Nassar during a sentencing hearing on Friday and tried to attack him. The intended attack came after the man had requested the judge to grant him "five minutes" alone with Nassar in a locked room. Two of the man's daughters had just addressed the court.
