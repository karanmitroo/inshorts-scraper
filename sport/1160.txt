Australia captain Steve Smith pulled off a one-handed diving catch to dismiss England's Dawid Malan on the second day of the fifth Ashes Test on Friday. Malan had edged a Mitchell Starc delivery in the 89th over of the match before Smith, fielding at second slip, dived to his left and caught the ball with his left hand completely stretched.
