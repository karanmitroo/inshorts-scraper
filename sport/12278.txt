The National Anti-Doping Agency on Monday gave a clean chit to wrestler Narsingh Yadav to participate in the Rio Olympics, after clearing him of doping charges. The agency stated that Yadav was a victim of sabotage done by a competitor. The wrestler had earlier been suspended by the agency after failing an out-of-competition dope test.
