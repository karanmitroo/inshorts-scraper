Adam Pengilly, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) member, was sent home following an incident involving a security officer at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. Pengilly, a former skeleton world silver medallist, was elected a member of the IOC in 2010. The 40-year-old later apologised to the security officer involved.
