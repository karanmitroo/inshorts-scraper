VB Chandrasekhar, CSK's former chief selector, has reportedly revealed that team owner N Srinivasan initially wanted to sign Virender Sehwag over MS Dhoni in 2008. Chandrasekhar said he told Srinivasan he wanted to sign Dhoni as "he can change the match situation on his own". Srinivasan then told Chandrasekhar he "would rather have Sehwag," but agreed on Dhoni.
