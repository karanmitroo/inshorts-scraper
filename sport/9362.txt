Opposition fans threw a firework at Manchester United keeper Sergio Romero during the team's Europa League match against Zorya Luhansk in Ukraine on Thursday. The firework landed in the penalty box a couple of feet away from Romero, with the referee temporarily halting the match. Meanwhile, laser pens were flashed at United centre-back Daley Blind, who complained about the incident.
