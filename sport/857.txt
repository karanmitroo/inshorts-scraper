Ramachandra Guha, who was a part of BCCI's Committee of Administrators, has said the BCCI officials worship Indian captain Virat Kohli even more than the cabinet worships PM Narendra Modi. Guha added that the officials deferred to Kohli even in matters that were not "within the Indian captain's ken" like Future Tours Programme and management of National Cricket Academy.
