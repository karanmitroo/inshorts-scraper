Indian pacer Mohammad Shami and all-rounder Yuvraj Singh have been left out of BCCI's annual contracts list. Shami, who had secured a Grade B contract last year and is a regular in the Test squad, was recently accused of extra-marital affair and assault by his wife. Meanwhile, Yuvraj Singh has been out of the Indian squad since July 2017.
