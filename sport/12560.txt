Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq celebrated his 10th Test century by doing ten pushups and a salute at Lord’s on Friday. Explaining the celebration, Misbah later said, “We did a camp in Abbottabad with the army guys where I had promised them, that if ever I score a hundred, I will definitely do that to remind them we were there."
