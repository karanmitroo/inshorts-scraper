A Greek bodybuilder slapped a judge at the 2016 IFBB Diamond Cup tournament after losing the title. The bodybuilder, who was participating in the 100 kg weight category at the event, later reportedly went nude to protest against the decision. Notably, Armando Marquez, the judge who was hit, is regarded as a 'true gentleman' in the sport.
