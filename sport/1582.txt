The BCCI on Monday confirmed that India will host the 2021 ICC Champions Trophy and 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup. This will be the first time that India will entirely host the World Cup, after having previously hosted the tournament partially in three editions. Notably, India were handed the two tournaments' hosting rights in 2013, during the ICC Annual Conference.
