Indian Sports Minister Vijay Goel has constituted a committee to suggest improvements in National Sports Development Code and functioning of Indian Sports Federations. The move has come after the ministry suspended the Indian Olympic Association for appointing Suresh Kalmadi and Abhay Chautala as life presidents. The committee is expected to submit its report within a month.
