French tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga recently tweeted about a thank you letter he received from a ball girl he helped during last year's Australian Open. Tsonga had escorted the girl off the court when he saw her crying after being struck by the ball. The girl also apologised for "not being able to perform duties as a ball kid".
