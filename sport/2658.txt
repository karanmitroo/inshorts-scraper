Indian fans queued outside the Australian cricket team's hotel in Guwahati to apologise for the rock-throwing incident on the Australian team bus, following India's loss in the 2nd T20I on Tuesday. The bus' glass panel was broken after which spinner Adam Zampa said, "It was a pretty scary incident. You never want those things to happen. It was disappointing."
