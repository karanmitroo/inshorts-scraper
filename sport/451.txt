French club Nice has alleged that their Italian player Mario Balotelli was shown a yellow card for complaining to the referee about racist chants. The incident occurred in the 72nd minute when the crowd began hurling abuses after Balotelli missed a scoring opportunity. The club's president said that they were "playing 11 against 12".
