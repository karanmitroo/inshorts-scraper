Bangladeshi cricketers Al-Amin Hossain and Sabbir Rahman were fined $15,000 for "off-field disciplinary breaches" during the Bangladesh Premier League after they reportedly brought female guests to their hotel rooms. Bangladesh Cricket Board said, "repetition of similar acts of indiscretion will result in harsher penalty." The fines are the highest imposed penalty for indiscipline in Bangladesh.
