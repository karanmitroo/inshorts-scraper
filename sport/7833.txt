The Hyderabad Cricket Association, which is hosting the India-Bangladesh Test starting February 9, will release a souvenir before the match to commemorate Bangladesh's first-ever Test in India. HCA would earlier publish a souvenir before every match in Hyderabad, but the practice was abolished in the 1990s. The proposed brochure will contain articles by former cricketers, besides caricatures.
