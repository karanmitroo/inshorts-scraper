Australia's David Warner and Cameron Bancroft broke an 87-year-old Test record for the all-time highest unbeaten opening partnership in a successful Test chase to help the Aussies win the first Ashes Test. With the win, Australia extended their unbeaten run at the Gabba to 29 Tests, a streak running since 1988, featuring only seven draws.
