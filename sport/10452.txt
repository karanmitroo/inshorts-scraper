The Pakistan hockey team congratulated India on their Asian Champions Trophy triumph tweeting, "Congratulations India for an amazing final match! It's always a pleasure to finish a tournament with @TheHockeyIndia! Well deserved". In a show of sportsmanship, India's Birender Lakra had gone up to the referee during the match to reverse his decision of not giving a penalty-corner to Pakistan.
