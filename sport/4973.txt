The Supreme Court-appointed BCCI's Committee of Administrators (CoA) chief Vinod Rai has said that Anil Kumble will continue as the Indian team's coach for the West Indies tour but it is subject to his acceptance. Kumble's initial tenure was supposed to end after the completion of the Champions Trophy 2017, where India have qualified for the semi-finals.
