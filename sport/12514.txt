The Supreme Court on Monday accepted the Lodha panel's recommendation of having no ministers or civil servants in the BCCI, along with having an age cap of 70 years for all office-bearers. The BCCI has been given six months to implement Lodha panel recommendations. Notably, the panel was set up in January 2014 after a match-fixing scandal hit the IPL.
