Brazilian goalkeeper Jakson Follmann, one of the six survivors from 2016's Chapecoense air crash, said he wants to compete in the Paralympics as a swimmer. The lower half of Follmann's right leg was amputated following the crash, which killed 19 of his Chapecoense teammates. Follmann said swimming could allow him to make a comeback and he's anxious to compete again.
