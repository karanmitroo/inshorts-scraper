An Everton fan hit French club Lyon's goalkeeper Anthony Lopes twice in the face while carrying a toddler during a Europa League match on Friday. The incident happened when players got into a mass brawl after Everton captain Ashley Williams pushed Lopes into the hoardings. The supporter was identified by the club and has been banned from attending Everton matches.
