Virender Sehwag got out on 195 while trying to hit Australia's Simon Katich for a six to complete his double hundred in the Boxing Day Test, 13 years ago. Interestingly, Sehwag had reached his  50, 100 and 150 with boundaries. Sehwag's dismissal triggered the collapse of the Indian innings, which ended at 366 from being 311/3 at one point.
