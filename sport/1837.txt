France defeated Belgium 3-2 to win Davis Cup, dubbed the World Cup of Tennis, for the first time in 16 years and 10th time overall on Sunday. Yannick Noah, the last Grand Slam-winning Frenchman, celebrated his third title as captain after 1991 and 1996 victories. France's tally is now level with Britain at third, behind USA (32) and Australia (28).
