The Supreme Court of India on Friday froze all financial transactions between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and all the state boards across the country. The Apex Court said that no money is to be provided by the BCCI to the state associations unless the Cricket Board decides to agree on implementing the Lodha reforms.
