A football originally onboard space shuttle Challenger, which crashed in 1986, has been sent back into space and is orbiting the Earth onboard the International Space Station. The signed football was presented by a school to late astronaut Ellison Onizuka, who died in the crash. Thirty-one years later, astronaut Shane Kimbrough carried the ball to the station as a tribute.
