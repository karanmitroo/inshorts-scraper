Qatar's football players warmed up for their World Cup qualifier against South Korea on Tuesday, wearing T-shirts with a picture of the country's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. This comes after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries cut ties with Qatar citing support for terrorism. The shirt was also waved by a Qatari player after he scored a goal.
