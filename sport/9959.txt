Indian Test captain Virat Kohli on Wednesday hailed the Centre's demonetisation move and said, "It's the greatest move I've seen in the history of Indian politics by far, hands down." Saying that he is "so impressed" by the "unbelievable" decision, Kohli added that he could now put his autograph on the old notes and distribute them to his fans.
