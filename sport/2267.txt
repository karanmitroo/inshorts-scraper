New Zealand's Colin Munro smashed an unbeaten 109(58) against India in the second T20I on Saturday, becoming the first batsman to smash two T20I hundreds in a calendar year. Munro, who hit his maiden T20I ton in January, also became only the fourth batsman to slam two T20I tons, joining compatriot Brendon McCullum and Windies' Chris Gayle and Evin Lewis.
