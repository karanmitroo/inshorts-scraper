Former skipper Sourav Ganguly on Wednesday cautioned England from getting whitewashed in the upcoming five-match Test series saying, "I am expecting another whitewash like the one against New Zealand. England should be worried." Former England captain Michael Vaughan had earlier said England is without top-class spin bowlers and need to 'park the bus' to survive against the Indian bowlers.
