Australia gave away five runs as penalty after a ball from Australia's Nathan Lyon hit the wicketkeeper's helmet on the final day of the fifth Test in Sydney on Monday. The ball slipped past wicketkeeper Tim Paine before rolling on to hit his helmet placed right behind him. At the point, Australia were one wicket away from the win.
