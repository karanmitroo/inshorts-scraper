Indian pacer Mohammed Shami hit Chris Woakes on the helmet with a short-pitched delivery, which dislodged the protective rear flaps of the helmet. The batsman was caught behind on the next ball, another bouncer by Shami. Adil Rashid top-edged another short ball by Shami in the same over and was caught at the boundary by Umesh Yadav.
