Ex-Australian spinner Brad Hogg has revealed he contemplated committing suicide after retiring from international cricket in 2008 to save his marriage. "I'd stare out at the sea and think, I could swim out to that groyne, and if I make it back, fine," Hogg wrote in his autobiography. He had taken up a post-retirement job and was into alcohol abuse.
