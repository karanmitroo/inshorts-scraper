Australian cricketers have lost over $1 million (â‚¹6 crore) in salaries in the first fortnight of going off-contract due to the ongoing pay dispute with Cricket Australia (CA). The funds, as declared by the sport's governing body earlier, have been pushed into the grassroots game. Notably, around 230 Australian cricketers became unemployed after their contracts expired on June 30.
