London's Lord's stadium has become UK's first cricket ground to run on 100% renewable energy. The stadium's new Warner Stand, which will be inaugurated in April, features photovoltaic panels for electricity generation, besides having a water collection and recycling unit. Lord's also met its 2020 emissions targets last year and reduced electricity use by 7% since 2010.
