BCCI withdrew the NOC given to cricketers Irfan Pathan and RP Singh to play an exhibition match in Bahrain, reportedly because the game also featured banned player S Sreesanth. Irfan was supposed to lead one side, which was eventually led by West Indies player Marlon Samuels. The game was organised by a relative of Pakistani cricketer Imran Nazir.
