Indian batsman Dinesh Karthik who failed to score a single run after facing 18 balls against Sri Lanka, set the record for the most number of balls faced by an Indian before getting dismissed for a duck in an ODI. Karthik, dismissed LBW by Suranga Lakmal, surpassed Eknath Solkar who faced 17 balls before getting dismissed against England in 1974.
