Harsh Goenka, brother of Rising Pune Supergiant owner Sanjiv Goenka, was trolled on Twitter for his earlier criticism of MS Dhoni, after the player hit 61*(34) against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Saturday. "Moment of silence for @hvgoenka. Dhoni 61* :) apply aloe vera to burnt area. Oh, also, don't bother apologizing," tweeted a user.
