The Uttar Pradesh government felicitated 14 sportspersons on National Sports Day on Tuesday, including weightlifter Sushila Panwar who had failed a dope test in April. Sushila, who was placed under provisional suspension after testing positive for a banned substance, could face a four-year suspension. The authorities later admitted their mistake and said they weren't aware of her dope test.
