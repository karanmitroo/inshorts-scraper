Premier League side Manchester City signed England international John Stones from Everton for £47.5 million ($61.7 million) on Tuesday. The central defender, who'd joined Everton from Barnsley in 2013 for $3.9 million, has signed a six-year contract with City, which will be managed by Pep Guardiola this season. Stones is now the world’s second-most expensive defender, after Brazil's David Luiz.
