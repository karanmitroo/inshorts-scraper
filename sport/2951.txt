England football club Southend United's striker Nile Ranger celebrated his first goal after returning from jail by imitating a gun celebration. Ranger converted a penalty and took off his shoe pretending it to be a gun and imitated shooting the crowd. The 26-year-old was released last month after serving 10 weeks in jail for online banking fraud.
