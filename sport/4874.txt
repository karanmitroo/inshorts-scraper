Sachin Tendulkar shared an old photograph of himself with his father Ramesh Tendulkar, on the occasion of Father's Day. "You held my hand...showed me the world and gave me the best advice. Happy father's day!" Sachin captioned the photograph. Notably, Sachin had scored a century against Kenya in the 1999 World Cup, a few days after his father passed away.
