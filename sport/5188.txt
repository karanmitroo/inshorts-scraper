The 2017 Champions Trophy will introduce chip-installed bats which will provide players and coaches data about stroke-play to improve the batsman's game. In 2016, the Ultra-Edge technology was introduced as a component of the Decision Review System to help the umpire judge the impact of ball with the bat. Meanwhile, LED stumps were introduced in 2014 to judge runouts.
