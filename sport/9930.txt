New Zealand fielded a record five substitutes, including a TV commentator, who was former captain Jeremy Coney, and a journalist in the Bangalore Test against India in 1988. Almost half of the team was struck down by a virus, which necessitated the substitutions. The match, which ended on November 17, 1988, ultimately finished with India's win by 172 runs.
