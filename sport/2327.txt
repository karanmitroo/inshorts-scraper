Mumbai's 17-year-old batsman Prithvi Shaw slammed his fourth first-class ton in his fifth match while playing in Ranji Trophy against Odisha in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday. Shaw has now scored three tons in Ranji and one in Duleep Trophy. The record for most first-class centuries before the age of 18 by an Indian batsman belongs to Sachin Tendulkar, who had seven.
