Reacting to former Pakistani skipper Shahid Afridi's 42-ball ton, a user tweeted, "Simply sensational hitting from @SAfridiOfficial, Be Afridi, be very Afridi when Boom Boom is in the mood." Another tweet read, "Hold on. Are there players on the field tonight who weren't born when Afridi was already playing International cricket?"
