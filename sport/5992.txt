Following his match-winning knock of 61*(34) against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Saturday, MS Dhoni said he does not consider any run rate high. "It boils down to how well the opposition bowlers execute their yorkers or length deliveries... 7, 8, 9 or 10 doesn't matter. What really matters is if you can put pressure on the opposition bowlers," said Dhoni.
