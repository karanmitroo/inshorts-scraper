After India finished sixth in the eight-team World Hockey League Semi-Final, Indian hockey team coach Roelant Oltmans said that beating Pakistan is not enough for the team. His comments came post India's 2-3 loss to Canada, the match which followed India's 6-1 win against arch-rivals Pakistan. "[U]ntil we can beat big teams like Holland... we will go nowhere," Oltmans added.
