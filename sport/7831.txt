Iran has barred American wrestlers from participating in the upcoming Freestyle World Cup being held in the country, following US President Donald Trump's immigration ban. The decision is Iran's first action in response to Trump's order banning visas for seven Muslim-majority countries. US freestyle wrestlers have competed in Iran since 1998, attending competitions in the country on 15 occasions.
