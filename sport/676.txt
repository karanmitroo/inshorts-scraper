Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has said India U-19 vice-captain Shubman Gill is "a bit like" cricket legend Brian Lara and current New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson. He further said that Gill is the best player in India's U-19 team, which has reached the final of the ongoing U-19 World Cup. Gill has hit six consecutive 50+ scores for India.
