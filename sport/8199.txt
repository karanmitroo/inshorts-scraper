Cricketer Yuvraj Singh, who scored a career-best 150 and his first ODI century in six years, against England on Thursday, has said he contemplated retiring after recovering from cancer in 2012. "The first 2-3 years were very hard...There was a time when I was wondering whether to continue or not to continue. Never giving up is my theory," said Yuvraj.
