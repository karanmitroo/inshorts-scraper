Former English captain Alastair Cook has become the first Englishman and the 11th cricketer in Test cricket's history to register 150 catches. Earlier in the first innings, English tail-ender Stuart Broad became the Englishman with most duck dismissals in Test cricket after registering his career's 23rd duck, going past James Anderson's tally of 22 duck dismissals.
