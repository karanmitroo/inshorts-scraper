Ex-Indian pacer Ashish Nehra has revealed he found the Yo-Yo test easy because he was fond of running as he was a fast bowler. Nehra added he achieved 18.5 score in the test in January which was way above the qualifying mark. "Some players find it difficult. Like Yuvraj's still stuck in there and yet to clear it," he added.
