India’s hockey and badminton teams have breached the Indian Olympic Association’s clothing sponsorship rules, after sporting rival logos on their team kits. The IOA signed a clothing sponsorship agreement with Chinese company Li-Ning, which allowed India’s Olympians to only feature Li-Ning's logo. The IOA has sent a warning to national federations of both the sports, to ensure compliance.
