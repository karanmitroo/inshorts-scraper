Former India captain and Cricket Association of Bengal President Sourav Ganguly on Thursday said that day-night Test cricket is inevitable in India and it has to happen someday. Ganguly's comments come after reports stated that he has pushed for day-night Tests, following poor ticket sales during the India-Sri Lanka Test match in Kolkata last month.
