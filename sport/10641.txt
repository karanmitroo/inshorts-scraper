England Test captain Alastair Cook, who recently became England's most capped player, has claimed he can break Sachin Tendulkar's 200 Test appearances record. "We play Tests so quickly nowadays so I could do…70-odd Tests now seems a long way away…you do question how long you can keep doing it for," said Cook, who is playing his 134th Test in Bangladesh.
