Agra's 12-year-old Shahan Ali Mohsin, on Sunday, became the first Indian to win the Asian karting championship, after recovering from an infection before the final. "It is yet to sink in but I was in seriously bad shape just two days back and couldnâ€™t even think of driving a kart, let alone fight for the Asian Championship title," Shahan said.
