Wishing Rahul Dravid on his 45th birthday, Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, "There might be many strong walls around us but the greatest yet is the one and only, Rahul Dravid. Happy birthday, Jammy!" "Friendship isn't about being inseparable but knowing and realising that inspite of not meeting regularly nothing will change," wrote VVS Laxman in his tweet wishing Dravid.
