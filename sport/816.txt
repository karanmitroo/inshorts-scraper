South African captain Faf du Plessis shouldered his arms to a Jasprit Bumrah delivery and was bowled out after the ball brushed his pads and hit the off-stump in the 42nd over in the third Test on Thursday. Du Plessis, dismissed for 8(19), was first of Bumrah's five wickets. Bumrah ended with figures of 18.5-2-54-5, his first Test five-wicket haul.
