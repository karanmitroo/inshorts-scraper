Following Chennai Super Kings' return to IPL after a two-year ban, MS Dhoni posted a photograph of him wearing a CSK jersey, with the Tamil word 'Thala', which translates to 'Leader', written on it. The club also posted the photograph on Twitter, with the caption that read, "Lions, start the whistles... Guess who's back! #whistlepodu #CSKReturns".
