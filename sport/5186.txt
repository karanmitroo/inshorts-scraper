Barcelona forward Lionel Messi will launch an amusement park themed around him in China in 2019. Known as the Messi Experience Park, the park will be built in collaboration with a Chinese broadcaster and a Spanish firm and will have over 20 attractions. Messi said the idea behind it was to encourage people to play football from an early age.
