Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble introduced the 'speed shotgun', a device used to measure bowling speed, during team practice in Hyderabad on Monday. The device, positioned behind the stumps facing the pitch, helps track the speed of the ball once it pitches on the wicket. The device was used to assess the bowling speed of spin bowlers as well.
