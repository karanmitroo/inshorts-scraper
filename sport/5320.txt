Batsman Rohit Sharma is reportedly set to be named vice-captain of the Indian team for the Champions Trophy. National selectors, who will travel with the team to England, have selected Rohit for the post and will make the announcement officially in case of an emergency. Ajinkya Rahane was previously made the vice-captain before the West Indies tour last year.
