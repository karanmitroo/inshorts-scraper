England-based researchers successfully taught bumblebees to roll a mini ball towards a target area, revealing learning abilities of the insect which were not known until now. The bees were found to solve the task in a different way than what was demonstrated, suggesting that observer bees did not simply copy what they saw, but improved on it, a researcher said.
