English fast bowler Tymal Mills, who was bought for â‚¹12 crore at the IPL auction, said he plans to buy a new house and enjoy a mortgage-free life with the money. The cricketer, however, added, "It's not real yet, not until it goes into my account and I get paid. I've had to make arrangements to receive that money."
