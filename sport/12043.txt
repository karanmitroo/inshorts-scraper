The BCCI has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking review of its verdict of implementing the reforms in the sports body recommended by the Lodha Committee, claiming the judgement was "unreasoned". In the July 19 verdict, the court had accepted major reforms recommended by the Lodha Committee, which included barring ministers and civil servants from becoming BCCI members.
