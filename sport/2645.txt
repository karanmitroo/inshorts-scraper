England's Bernard Bosanquet, the man credited with inventing the 'googly' in cricket, had first bowled it on a billiards table while playing 'Twisti-Twosti' in 1897. The aim of 'Twisti-Twosti' was to bounce a tennis ball on a table so that the opposite player couldn't catch it. With his first 'googly' in Australia in 1903-04, Bosanquet took out batsman's middle stump.
