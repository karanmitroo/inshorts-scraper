England's James Anderson has become the country's first cricketer since 1906 to score a 'king pair'. A 'king pair' refers to a batsman getting out on the first ball faced in both innings of a Test match. Anderson, who took 54 innings to score his first duck, has 21 Test ducks to his credit, the most for any England player.
