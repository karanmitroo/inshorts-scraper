Third umpire Richard Illingworth mistakenly pressed the out button to dismiss Pakistan's Azhar Ali, who was batting on 93, during the Boxing Day Test against Australia on Tuesday. Ali was involved in a run-out attempt which was referred to the third umpire. Replays showed Ali was safe, but the third umpire gave him out, only to reverse his decision later.
