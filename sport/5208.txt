Former Royal Challengers Bangalore coach Ray Jennings blamed captain Virat Kohli for his removal from the post after the 2013 season. Jennings called Kohli "a very talented kid who sometimes thinks he is better than the game." Commenting on the reports of a rift between Anil Kumble and Kohli, Jennings said a conflict between the two "was not surprising".
