Indian men's cricket team batting coach Sanjay Bangar has said that he hopes that the women's team could make up for the men's team's Champions Trophy loss by winning the World Cup. Bangar also congratulated the women's team and said, "We are getting inspired from them fully. They had already won three matches, but the tournament is very long."
