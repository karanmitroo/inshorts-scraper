West Indian legend, Brian Lara, who is celebrating his 48th birthday today, holds the record for having made the highest individual scores in both Test cricket and First-class cricket. Lara's unbeaten 400 scored against England in 2004 is Test cricket's highest individual score, while his unbeaten 501 for Warwickshire against Durham is First-class cricket's highest ever individual score.
