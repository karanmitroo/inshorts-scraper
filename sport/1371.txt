Nearly 20 Pakistani cricketers, including Saeed Ajmal, have been left stranded in Uganda over payment dispute with a T20 league organiser. Upon their arrival, the players found out the league was abandoned as the main sponsor had withdrawn. When they wanted to leave, their tickets were blocked by the travel agency, which claimed organisers had defaulted on other payments too.
