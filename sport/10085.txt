Rishabh Pant, who scored Ranji Trophy's fastest hundred in 48 balls, said that his only regret is not playing alongside ex-Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag. "I always used to watch bhaiya(Viru) playing...an absolute delight watching him bat. I wanted to bat alongside him," said the 18-year-old. Notably, the year Pant made his first-class debut for Delhi, Sehwag joined the Haryana team.
