Former Brazilian forward Pelé is the only player in football history to have won three World Cups. His hat-trick in semi-finals and a brace in the final helped Brazil win their first-ever World Cup in 1958. Pelé featured in only two matches in Brazil's 1962 World Cup win but won the Golden Ball to help Brazil win the 1970 tournament.
