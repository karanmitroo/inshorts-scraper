Applauding Kedar Jadhav for his performance, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Kedar Jadhav is the find of this series. Never thought he could prove to be such a power hitter. Gotta prove himself overseas now." "Winning and losing is a part of game. But giving your 100% is all we want and Kedar Jadhav you did that man.... Salute," added Sehwag.
