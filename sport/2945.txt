An Indian footballer, initially named in the India Under-17 squad for the upcoming FIFA Under-17 World Cup, has been dropped as he was reportedly found to be overage in the recent MRI tests. Notably, all the members of the initially announced squad had been cleared when the All India Football Federation conducted similar tests around six months back.
