Indian middle-order batsman Ajinkya Rahane got caught behind on 3 during the third South Africa Test on Wednesday but survived as replays showed the delivery was a no-ball. Rahane is making a comeback to the Indian playing XI after being dropped for the first two Test matches. However, he later got out for 9(27) off a Morne Morkel delivery.
