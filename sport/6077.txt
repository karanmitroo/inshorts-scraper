Brazilian football club Chapecoense won their first title since their squad was involved in a tragic plane crash in November 2016 that killed 71 people. Chapecoense defeated Joinville 2-0 to clinch the Sandro Pallaoro Cup. As many as 19 Chapecoense players and most of the club's staff had died when their chartered plane crashed into a hillside in Colombia.
