MS Dhoni became the second most successful captain in ODI history following India's six-wicket win over New Zealand in the first match of the series at Dharamshala on Sunday. Dhoni surpassed former Australian skipper Allan Border's 107 ODI wins to achieve the milestone. Ricky Ponting's 165-win mark is the current world record for the most ODI wins as a captain.
