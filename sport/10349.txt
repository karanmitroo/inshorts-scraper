Former South African player Jonty Rhodes recently said in an interview that there is no player like Virat Kohli when it comes to finishing matches. "Virat's conversion rate is amazing...Kohli is very difficult to dismiss once set," he added. Rhodes also mentioned that it would be difficult for Kohli to break Sachin's records because of the busy cricket schedule.
