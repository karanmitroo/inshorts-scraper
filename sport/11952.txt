Indian tennis player Sania Mirza became the sole world rank one in womenâ€™s doubles, after her win over former partner Martina Hingis' team at the Cincinnati Open final on Sunday. Sania, who earlier jointly held the number one ranking with Hingis before the duo announced their split earlier this month, has now teamed up with Czech Barbora Strycova.
