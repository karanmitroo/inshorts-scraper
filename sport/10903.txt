Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios was booed off the court at the Shanghai Masters on Wednesday, following a mid-match meltdown against German qualifier Mischa Zverev. The world number 14 later admitted that he did not put enough effort in the match and that he doesn't owe his fans anything. Krygios eventually lost the 48-minute long second round match 3-6, 1-6.
