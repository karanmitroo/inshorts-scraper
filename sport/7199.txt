The supporters of Crystal Palace Football Club vandalised their own team's bus thinking it belonged to rival club Middlesbrough prior to their Premier League clash. The fans smeared the bus with the club's name 'Crystal Palace FC' in red, white and blue paint across the sides. Crystal Palace secured a 1-0 win that lifted them out of the relegation zone.
