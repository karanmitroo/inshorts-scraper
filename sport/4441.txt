Sports Direct's Mike Ashley has denied promising £15 million (₹125 crore) to an investment banker, describing it as pub banter. "It was a drink-fuelled, fun night and it would have been obvious to...anyone...that whatever conversations took place...weren't serious," Ashley said. Notably, Jeffrey Blue is suing Ashley for not holding up his end of the bargain on an agreement between them.
