The 2016 Rio Olympics may not have been perfect but organisers exceeded expectations given the political and economic situation in Brazil, the International Olympic Committee said. Rio was the first ever South American city to host the Olympics. "Someone called them (Rio 2016) the most perfect imperfect Games," an IOC spokesman said, and added that it was a good characterisation.
