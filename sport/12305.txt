Russia's weightlifting team and federation have been banned from the Rio Olympics over doping offences. Following Russia's doping scandal, the IOC had asked sports federations to rule on Russians' eligibility for Rio. "The integrity of the weightlifting sport has been seriously damaged... by the Russians, therefore an appropriate sanction was applied" to preserve the sport's status, the IWF said.
