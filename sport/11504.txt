Zimbabwe's Harare-based players have refused to train over unpaid match fees, dating back to July 2015. Players were to begin training for their upcoming series but have instead insisted on a meeting with the Board. Reportedly, there is also a paucity of balls and nets at the camp, with players from outside not arriving due to lack of funds.
