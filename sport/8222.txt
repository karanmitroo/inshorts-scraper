Former Indian limited-overs captain MS Dhoni got bowled on a free-hit delivery from England's Liam Plunkett before the ball escaped the keeper's vicinity to the boundary for a four. The incident occurred in the 44th over of the Indian innings, with Dhoni batting on 103, his first century since October 2013.
