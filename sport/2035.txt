Virat Kohli registered the joint-most international ducks in a year by an Indian captain, after getting dismissed for zero for the fifth time in 2017 against Sri Lanka on Thursday. Kohli joined ex-captain Kapil Dev, who had registered five ducks in 1983. In October, Kohli had set the record for playing most T20I innings (47), before registering first T20I duck.
