Australia captain Steve Smith reached 6,000 runs in Test cricket in his 111th innings against England on Friday, becoming the 15th Australian and overall joint second-fastest to reach the landmark. Smith equalled the record of cricket legend Sir Garfield Sobers. Only Sir Donald Bradman has scored 6,000 runs in fewer innings (68) than Smith and Sobers.
