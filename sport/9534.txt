Australia's Brisbane cricket ground, called the Gabba, shared pictures of a pool deck being installed at the boundary for spectators. The pool deck, a life-sized swimming pool with umbrellas and deck chairs, will be introduced ahead of the day-night Test match against Pakistan, scheduled to start from December 15. The stadium will also have 'Sandy Point', a beach themed area.
