Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh slammed Twitter trolls who mocked him after he shared a picture of wife Geeta Basra celebrating Karwa Chauth. Singh retweeted several trolls' tweets, which claimed that fasting in Sikhism is prohibited and replied to them individually. "[D]harm ke naam par logo ko gumrah mat karo. phle acha insaan bano wohi sabse bada dharm hai," Harbhajan wrote.
