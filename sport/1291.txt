A spectator managed to catch a six in the stands without using his hands during the Big Bash League match between Sydney Sixers and Adelaide Strikers on Thursday. The fan was standing near the boundary when the ball hit by Sydney Sixers' Steve O'Keefe got stuck in between his wrists during the 16th over of the team's chase.
