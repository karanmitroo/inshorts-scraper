Lord's Cricket Ground will not allow fans to bring in as much of their own booze as they like, after a quarrel between guests emerged during the first England-South Africa Test. The members will only be allowed to bring two pints of beer if it is under 6% alcohol, or a single 750ml wine bottle if it is between 6-18%.
