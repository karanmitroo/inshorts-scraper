Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff fell over while attending the NatWest T20 Blast final match at Edgbaston dressed as American pop icon Elvis Presley. Flintoff was performing on a song near the sidelines where he failed to spot a speaker and tripped over it, losing his wig in the process. Flintoff's fellow commentator David Lloyd came dressed as Johnny Cash.
