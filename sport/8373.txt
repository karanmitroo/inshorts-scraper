England opener Jason Roy was saved from being dismissed leg-before-wicket after using the DRS review following the on-field umpire's decision of out in the first ODI against India on Sunday. Facing Umesh Yadav on the fourth ball of the second over, Roy was struck on the pads, when the ball was later seen to be missing the leg stump.
