Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has said South Africa should send their 'A' team to play the Buchi Babu tournament held annually in Chennai. Gavaskar said this will allow their batsmen to "get a much better idea of how to play spin". Notably, South Africa lost 16 of their 20 wickets to spinners in the last two ODIs against India.
