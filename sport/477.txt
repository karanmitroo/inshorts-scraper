South African captain Aiden Markram pulled off a one-handed leaping catch to dismiss India's Hardik Pandya in the 47th over of the fourth ODI on Saturday. Pandya tried to hit a Kagiso Rabada delivery over extra cover, where the 23-year-old leapt and completed the catch with his right hand. Pandya got out for 9 runs off 13 balls.
