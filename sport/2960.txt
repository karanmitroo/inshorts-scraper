The Indian cricket team's jersey has three stars above the BCCI logo on the left, depicting India's three World Cup wins. India won the ODI World Cup in 1983 and 2011, and the inaugural T20 World Cup on September 24, 2007. Nike, the official kit sponsor of the Indian team, introduced the three stars after India's 2011 World Cup win.
