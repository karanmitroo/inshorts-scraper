Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on Thursday became the 14th recipient of the 'ICC Cricketer of the Year' award. Rahul Dravid was the first winner when the award was introduced in 2004. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is the only player to have received it twice, in 2006 and 2007. Sachin Tendulkar was honoured with the award in 2010.
