The Brazilian government will hand out nine million condoms for free during August's Olympic Games. In addition to promoting safe sex, the exercise is also aimed at fostering sustainable use of Amazon Rainforests as the condoms are made with latex gathered from Amazonian rubber trees. About 450,000 of these condoms will be distributed to athletes and Olympic Village staff.
