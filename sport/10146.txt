Ex-Himachal Pradesh player Shakti Singh has claimed he had scored India's fastest first-class century, which was credited to Delhi batsman Rishabh Pant on Tuesday. Singh said he scored 100 off 42 balls against Haryana in the Ranji Trophy in 1990-91, which was not documented due to absence of official scorers. Pant made 100 off 48 balls against Jharkhand on Tuesday.
