The body of Brazil's two-time FIFA World Cup winner Garrincha is missing, 34 years after his death. The late footballer's cousin revealed that Garrincha's bones were removed from the burial site, to be placed in a niche, 10 years ago when a family member had to be buried in the same place. The mayor has proposed exhuming Garrincha's grave again.
