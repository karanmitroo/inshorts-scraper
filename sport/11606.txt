Andrei Fomochkin, a delegate from Belarus’ Paralympic contingent, has been stripped of his accreditation by the International Paralympic Committee, after he carried Russia’s flag at the Rio Paralympics' opening ceremony on Wednesday. Fomochkin, however, is being hailed as a hero in Russia for showing solidarity with the country, which has been banned from the Paralympics over doping allegations.
