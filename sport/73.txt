Five-time Major champion Phil Mickelson mistook Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma for media during the WGC-Mexico Championship. Shubhankar revealed he saw Mickelson on the practice green before Saturday's third round and approached him with his caddie. "(Mickelson) thought we were media and he said, 'Not right now, after the round'," added the 21-year-old, who is playing his first PGA Tour event.
