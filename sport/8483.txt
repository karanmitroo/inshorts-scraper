Rahul Dravid's father worked with jams-producing company Kissan and the cricketer was handed a bottle of jam whenever he went out playing, giving him the nickname 'Jammy'. Interestingly, Dravid even acted in a Kissan commercial later in which he puts on a range of disguises, including dressing up as a girl, a monk, and a vampire to get the jam.
