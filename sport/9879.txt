Lin Dan, two-time Olympic Badminton gold medallist, has apologised to his wife after his extra-marital affair was exposed online. The 33-year-old, who became a father two weeks ago, was dating model and actress Zhao Yaqi during his wife's pregnancy. Dan said, "As a man, I don't defend what I have done. My behaviour has hurt my family...I am sorry."
