Eight-time Olympic gold medalist and former sprinter Usain Bolt has revealed that he wants to begin his professional football career in 2018. Bolt said that a "lot of clubs" have reached out to him and he would start training next year after recovering fully from his hamstring injury, which he suffered during his career's last-ever race in August this year.
