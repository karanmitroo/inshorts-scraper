Britain's Andy Murray displaced Novak Djokovic to become the top-ranked men's singles player for the first time, after Milos Raonic withdrew from the Paris Masters semi-final against the former on Saturday. Murray is the first British singles player to hold the top spot since the ATP introduced computerised rankings in 1973. Djokovic held the number one rank for 122 weeks.
