Cricketer Khalid Latif, who has been accused of spot-fixing in the Pakistan Super League, allegedly used bat grips to indicate to bookies that he was participating in fixing. The Pakistan Cricket Board seized the grips from the player's kit, which were given to him by bookies. Khalid, who played for Islamabad United, reportedly passed on the grips to Sharjeel Khan.
