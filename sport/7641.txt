Bangladesh women's spin bowler Shaila Sharmin bowled using both her left and right arm in the same over against Pakistan in the ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier on Wednesday,  becoming international women's cricket's first ambidextrous bowler. Originally a right-arm off-spinner, Sharmin bowled with her left arm to the right-handed batsman while using her right arm to bowl to the left-hander.
