Called the "missing marathoner", Shizo Kanakuri took over 54 years to complete an Olympics marathon. Kanakuri was considered missing after he collapsed during the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, and "embarrassed" at his failure, he returned to Japan without informing the authorities. He was offered an opportunity to complete the marathon in 1967 after Swedish authorities discovered that he was alive.
