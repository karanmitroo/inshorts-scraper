Premier League Champions Leicester City have distributed over 30,000 Jamie Vardy masks to their fans, in a protest against the forward's three-match suspension. The fans will be seen wearing the masks in Leicester's Boxing Day match against Everton at King Power Stadium. The Football Association (FA) had rejected Leicester's appeal against the ban which club's chairman deemed "unfair".
