South African wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock edged three consecutive Mohammed Shami deliveries for four runs each before getting out off the fourth straight edge during the Centurion Test on Tuesday. Virat Kohli was heard telling Shami to bowl on the same spot as De Kock kept edging, before wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel effected a caught behind to dismiss him for 12(5).
