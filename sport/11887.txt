Former England batsman Percy Fender scored the fastest authentic first-class century in terms of time, on August 26, 1920 in Northampton, England. Batting for Surrey, Fender brought up his hundred in 35 minutes. The record was equalled in 1983 by Lancashire player Steve Oâ€™Shaughnessy, but its legitimacy has been questioned, since it was scored under "contrived circumstances".
