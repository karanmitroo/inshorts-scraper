Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara will play for county side Yorkshire in the 2018 English domestic cricket season. According to Yorkshire, the 30-year-old had signed the deal several weeks ago but the announcement was purposely delayed due to the IPL auction, where he went unsold. This will be Pujara's second stint with Yorkshire.
