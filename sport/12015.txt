Shooter Abhinav Bindra has claimed that systems aren't in place in India to consistently produce Olympic medalists. "Each medal costs the UK Â£5.5 million. That's the sort of investment needed. Let's not expect much until we put systems in place at home", Bindra tweeted. He also replied to several tweets that questioned India's performance at the Olympics.
