Everton co-owner Farhad Moshiri has claimed that Romelu Lukaku refused a new deal at the club after a voodoo message told him to join Chelsea. Moshiri said Lukaku received the message from "a pilgrimage to Africa". Lukaku rejected a contract worth £140,000-a-week at Everton as he wanted to rejoin Chelsea, but instead joined Manchester United for £75 million.
