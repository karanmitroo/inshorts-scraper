South African cricketer Kagiso Rabada was dropped twice by the Indian fielders off Ravichandran Ashwin's consecutive deliveries in the second Test on Sunday. In the 104th over, first captain Virat Kohli dropped Rabada in the slips, then confusion between rushing fielders Hardik Pandya and Mohammed Shami resulted in another dropped catch off the very next ball.
