Maharashtra captain Swapnil Gugale, who was involved in a Ranji Trophy record 594-run stand with Ankit Bawne, has said he wasn't aware they missed out on the world record by 30 runs. "If I had known, we would have gone for it," said Gugale. The all-time record is Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara's 624-run stand against South Africa in 2006.
