Lady Mariners, a group of around 30 female supporters of Kolkata-based football club Mohun Bagan, is India's first organised female-only supporters' club. The fan club, led by 80-year-old Shanti Chakraborty, was established in 2015 and became fully functional last year. Most of the club's members come from Bengali families who have been supporting the club for generations.
