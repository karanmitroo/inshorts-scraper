Legendary Australian spinner Shane Warne bowled a big leg-break as his first delivery in an Ashes Test to clean bowl England's Mike Gatting. The flighted delivery drifted in, then dipped and eventually hit Gatting's off-stump with a sharp turn and is commonly known as 'the ball of the century'. Shane Warne made his Test debut on January 2, 1992.
