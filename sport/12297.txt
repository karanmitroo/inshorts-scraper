The USA basketball team, reportedly the richest team at the Rio Olympics, will stay on the Silver Cloud cruise liner, instead of the Athletes’ Village, during the Games. As per USA basketball, the team is not staying in the village because they “don’t feel it’s the best way to prepare.” Suites on the cruise cost £10,000 ($13,200) a week.
