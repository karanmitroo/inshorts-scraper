West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle has said he wants to continue playing cricket till the age of 50. "Age is something, it's a number...I'd love my daughter to see me play...You have to keep in shape and start eating properly...Freshen up the body and make sure you can actually last longer," said Gayle.
