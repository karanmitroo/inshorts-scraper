Speaking to the media after landing in England for the Champions Trophy, Indian captain Virat Kohli said that there was too much pressure on former captain MS Dhoni to finish matches. Kohli added that the pressure restricted Dhoni from playing freely and that the inclusion of Kedar Jadhav and Hardik Pandya has added a balance to the squad.
