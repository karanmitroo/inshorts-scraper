Indian badminton coach Pullela Gopichand has said that India can win more Olympic medals only if sports culture is built in the country through nurturing talent at the grassroots​ level. "School sport is important. Unless we have a large pool of players playing different sports, it is tough to get more than an odd medal,” Gopichand added.
