Rio Paralympics gold-winner Devendra Jhajharia's wife, Manju Jhajharia was a state-level kabaddi player, having played kabaddi in the state championship. "When we had a daughter in 2009, we realised that both of us wouldn't be able to pursue our sporting careers... So I took charge of things and this gave him complete freedom to concentrate on his sport," said Manju.
