Netherlands' Dennis Bergkamp scored what is considered as one of the best goals in a World Cup match, in the quarterfinalâ€‹ against Argentina on July 4, 1998. Defender Frank de Boer sent a long ball to Bergkamp in the 90th minute who broke the deadlock, taking two touches to round a defender before scoring with an outside foot far-post finish.
