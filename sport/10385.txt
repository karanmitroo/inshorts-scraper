Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga set the record for the longest gap between two Test centuries since 1945, scoring his second Test ton 3,888 days after his first. Tharanga scored a century against Zimbabwe on Sunday, while his only other ton came against Bangladesh in 2006. The all-time record is of 5,093 days by Australia's Warren Bardsley from 1912 to 1926.
