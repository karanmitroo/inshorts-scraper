Indian judoka Avtar Singh lost his debut Olympic match to Refugee Olympic Team's Popole Misenga in the men's 90 kg elimination Round of 32, on Wednesday. Avtar Singh, though, still has a chance for a medal as he may go through the repechage round. Singh was the first Indian judoka to qualify for the Olympics since 2004.
