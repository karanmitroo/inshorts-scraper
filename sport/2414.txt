Indian batsman Shikhar Dhawan on Thursday shared a video of his son Zoravar looking for him on TV, as the camera panned across the team during the national anthem ahead of a match. "Dil bhar aaya video dekh ke, jis tareeke se zoraver mujhe dhoondh rha hai. Mera pyaar aur duyaaein hamesha mere bachon ke saath hain," the caption read.
