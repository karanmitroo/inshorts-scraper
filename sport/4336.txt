Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo's private yacht was stopped and searched by armed customs officers off the coast of Formentera near Ibiza on Tuesday. Ronaldo, who is on vacation, had reportedly rented the yacht and was onboard with his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez and other relatives. The inspection was apparently a routine check that is performed on vessels in the area.
