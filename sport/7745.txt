Darren Sharpe, an Australian mechanic, was called a national hero on social media after he live streamed a pay-per-view boxing bout on Facebook. Over one lakh people watched Sharpe's live stream of the event, which was priced at Australian $59.95 (â‚¹3,100) per viewer. He was however forced by the broadcasting company to stop the feed, while people supported him online.
