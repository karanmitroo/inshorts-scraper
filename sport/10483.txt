Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has claimed that Cristiano Ronaldo "clearly deserves the Ballon d'Or". Ronaldo won both the major European tournaments, Champions League with Real Madrid and the European Championship with Portugal last season. "Not just at an individual level, but above all on a collective level...he knows everything he is achieving is thanks to hard work," Zidane added.
