Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's father said in an interview that it was Ashwin's mother Chitra who advised him to switch from fast bowling to spin bowling as his long run-up did not look good. Ashwin, who has scored 545 Test runs in 2016 at an average of 45.41, was also advised by his mother to never ignore his batting.
