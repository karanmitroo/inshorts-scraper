Suresh Raina leapt to complete Eoin Morgan's catch at the mid-wicket boundary on the second ball of the 15th over of England's innings in the first T20I match at Kanpur. Raina was able to take the catch but as he was toppling back, he immediately tossed the ball back into play ensuring the ball does not go for six runs.
