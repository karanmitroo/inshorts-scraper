West Indian batsman Darren Bravo became the side's first-ever player to score a ton in a Day-Night Test match, after reaching the landmark figure on the fifth day of the first Test against Pakistan on Monday. Bravo is only the second player to have scored a ton in a Day-Night Test, following Azhar Ali's triple century in the same Test.
