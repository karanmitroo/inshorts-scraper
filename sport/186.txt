The International Olympic Committee has upheld its decision to not allow any athletes to march under the Russian flag during the closing ceremony at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The committee also stated that the ban on Russia will be lifted if there are no further doping violations from their athletes at the PyeongChang Winter Games.
