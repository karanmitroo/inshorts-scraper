Yuvraj Singh, who scored a career-best 150 against England on Thursday, visited a hospital in Cuttack on Friday to meet cancer patients. Yuvraj, who was diagnosed with a form of cancer in 2011 and recovered in the subsequent year, signed autographs and clicked pictures with the patients. Notably, Yuvraj runs a foundation called 'YouWeCan' which works for cancer patients.
