Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has said the 2003 World Cup final, played between India and Australia, would have been different if the T20 format existed. "If the same players are given an opportunity, we will approach the game differently...because of introduction of T20...In those days 359 looked a herculean task...today it will be closer than 2003," said Sachin.
