American bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who overcame a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win a Winter Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at the US Olympic Training Centre in New York on Saturday. Holcomb underwent a successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease and lead team USA to its first gold at the event since 1948.
