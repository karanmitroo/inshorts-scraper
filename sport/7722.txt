BCCI Vice President TC Mathew believes that pacer S Sreesanth, who is currently serving life ban imposed by BCCI, can still make a comeback into the Indian team. "If Ashish Nehra can return to the national side at 37, then Sreesanth too can make it. The 34-year-old Sreesanth is still a terrific bowler and is undergoing rigorous training", Mathew said.
