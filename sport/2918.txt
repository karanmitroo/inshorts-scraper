Spanish ace Rafael Nadal advised Roger Federer midway in the match "to be a bit more aggressive" against Nick Kyrgios on Sunday. The match, which Federer won 4-6, 7-6, 11-9, helped Team Europe lift the Laver Cup. "He is playing great... But we thought that he could be a bit more aggressive on the forehand and Roger agreed", Nadal added.
