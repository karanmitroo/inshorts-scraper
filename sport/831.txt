World number one Rafael Nadal retired due to an injury after his three hour and 47 minute-long five-setter Australian Open quarter-final against Croatia's Marin Cilic on Tuesday. The Spaniard, who was seen limping in the final set, had reached the final of the tournament last year. Despite his ouster, Nadal will remain the world number one tennis player.
