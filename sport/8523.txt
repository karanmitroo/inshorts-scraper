Cricketer Yuvraj Singh has said he and MS Dhoni can play "like in the old days", since the captaincy burden is off the former skipper. "It will be like the old days playing with him when we had started...Back then we were fearless when we used to play together. We can do the same this time," said Yuvraj.
