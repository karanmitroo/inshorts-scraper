Amazon Guyana Warriors' Chadwick Walton mocked Jamaica Tallawah's bowler Kesrick Williams with the latter's own 'notebook' celebration during his 84-run knock in Caribbean Premier League. Walton imitated Williams' celebration each time after hitting him for boundaries. Earlier in a match between the two teams, Williams had taken Walton's wicket and celebrated with his traditional 'notebook' style.
