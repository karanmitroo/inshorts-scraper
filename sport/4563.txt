Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah's grandfather Santokh Singh Bumrah reportedly drives an auto in Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, to earn a living. The 84-year-old reportedly moved to Udham Singh Nagar in 2006, five years after the death of Jasprit's father. Santokh had three factories which he sold to repay loans, after which he started driving autos to earn a living.
