Former Indian pacer Javagal Srinath, who turned 48 on Thursday, has the world's best bowling figures in a Test for a losing cause. He picked up 13 wickets for 132 runs against Pakistan in Kolkata in 1998-99, a match which Pakistan won by 46 runs. Srinath also has the joint-most number of wickets in World Cups by an Indian bowler.
