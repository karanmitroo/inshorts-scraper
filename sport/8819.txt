Pakistan Cricket Board is set to take legal action against BCCI for not honouring a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which has resulted in losses to the board. Under the MoU document, India and Pakistan were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2022. Notably, BCCI had earlier stated that India will not play Pakistan in the near future.
