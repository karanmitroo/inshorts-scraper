Inspired by a Nigerian inmate, Henry Oja Kelechi, inmates at Assam's Golaghat district jail have learned to play football. Kelechi, who has been in jail for the past six months, helped form eight teams consisting of seven players each. "I was upset about landing in jail. But everything changed after jail superintendent Dilip Saikia gave me a football," Kelechi said.
