Retired American basketball player Dennis Rodman will reportedly arrive in North Korea as a 'private citizen' on Tuesday, marking his fifth visit to the reclusive nation. Rodman was criticised for calling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un his "friend for life" on previous trips and failing to raise human rights issues for a US missionary who was detained there.
