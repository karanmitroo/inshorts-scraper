Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh, while appearing at a chat show, said he would like to see actor Akshay Kumar play the lead role if a biopic is made on him. The cricketer, however, said he was not keen on having a biopic made on him as it is "very personal." Yuvraj added Aditya Roy Kapoor could also play the role.
