German police have arrested a man who reportedly attacked football team Dortmund's bus to make the team's share prices fall. The 28-year-old market trader had bought options to short-sell stock and would have profited from the team's falling share prices after the attack. Earlier, a letter was found at the attack site suggesting Islamist links, reportedly to mislead the police.
