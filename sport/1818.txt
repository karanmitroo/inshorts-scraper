Ravichandran Ashwin on Monday became the fastest player to pick 300 Test wickets, bettering the previous record of 56 matches, set by Australian legend Dennis Lillee on November 27, 1981. Ashwin, who took 54 Tests to reach 300 scalps, also became only the third bowler after Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan to pick 50+ Test wickets for three straight years.
