Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting said that his "arch nemesis" while playing against India was Harbhajan Singh and he still gets nightmares about the off-spinner. The off-spinner dismissed Ponting on 10 occasions in Tests, more than any other bowler. Notably, Harbhajan's 300th career Test wicket was the former Australian captain.
