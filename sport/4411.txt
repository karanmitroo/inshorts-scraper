Member of BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) Sourav Ganguly has said that the announcement of India's next coach, which was scheduled for July 10, has been put on hold as the committee needs to consult captain Virat Kohli. Ganguly added that the process is complete and they need more time to decide so that everyone is on the same page.
