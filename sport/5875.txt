Kolkata Knight Riders wicketkeeper Robin Uthappa equalled MS Dhoni's record of most stumpings in an IPL match, effecting three dismissals against the Rising Pune Supergiant on Wednesday. Ajinkya Rahane was the first to fall, being beaten by a Sunil Narine delivery after scoring 46(41). MS Dhoni and Manoj Tiwary were later stumped in a single over by Kuldeep Yadav.
