The Indian cricket team's new kit was unveiled by BCCI's CEO Rahul Johri on Thursday. The new jersey has the same layout as the previous one, with a dark blue shade on the sides and along the arms, and a lighter hue on the chest and the back. Notably, OPPO has replaced Star India as the official team sponsor.
