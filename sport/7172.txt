Addressing former cricketer Virender Sehwag for his alleged tweet on the controversy over DU student Gurmehar Kaur, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor posted, "Your seemingly witty counter to her is not only wrong, it also trivialises a serious issue concerning war." "Do not let cynics exploit the power of your words to silence a young woman's idealism," Tharoor added.
