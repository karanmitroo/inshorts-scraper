Indian wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, who has earned a Test recall after eight years, has said he was positive about his chances in the team. "It was going to be a long season...I was always amongst the runs and keeping well in domestic cricket...I kept speaking to the selectors and they kept saying, 'keep doing what you are doing'," added Patel.
