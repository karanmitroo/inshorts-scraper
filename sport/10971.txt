Belgian forward Christian Benteke scored the fastest goal recorded in competitive internationals, scoring after only 8.1 seconds in Belgium's 6-0 win over Gibraltar in their World Cup qualifier match on Monday. The forward stole the ball after a miscalculated pass from an opponent after the match's kickoff, and rounded a defender before scoring past the goalkeeper.
