Pakistan's Hanif Mohammad was batting on 498 in a domestic match with two balls left in day's play when the scoreboard showed him on 496, on January 11, 1959. Hanif, trying to get back on strike for the final ball, got run-out while attempting the second run and failed to be the first batsman to reach 500 in first-class cricket.
