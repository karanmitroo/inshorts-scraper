Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has expressed disappointment over the arrest of an Assamese man for wearing the cricketer's jersey. "Such incidents highlight intolerance...If there are fans of Pakistan players in India, the same is the case in Pakistan where there are fans of Indian players," said Afridi. He added that he would appeal to PM Narendra Modi to intervene.
