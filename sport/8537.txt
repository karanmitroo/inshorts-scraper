After a UAE-based news website Emirates 24|7 used Sushant Singh Rajput's image in place of MS Dhoni, Virender Sehwag confused the Emirates airline with the website in his tweet. Posting a picture of his look-alike, the former cricketer tweeted, "@Emirates247 I am flying with you in a while, hope you don't allow him to board instead of me."
