The inaugural women's cricket World Cup was held in 1973, two years before the first-ever men's World Cup. The maiden women's World Cup, which was played in a 60-over round-robin format, was won by hosts England. Australia, who are the current defending champions, are aiming to lift their record seventh title at the tournament's 2017 edition, which began on Saturday.
