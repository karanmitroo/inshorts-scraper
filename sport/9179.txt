Former Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee walked out to bat with an aluminum bat in an Ashes Test, on December 14, 1979. England claimed the bat damaged the ball, besides producing the abnormal clanging sound. Lillee was asked to change the bat, and the following year the laws were changed to state that the "bat shall be made of wood".
