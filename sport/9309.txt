Real Madrid set a new club record of 35 matches unbeaten run in all competitions, following Sergio Ramos' injury-time header in Madrid's 3-2 win over Deportivo on Saturday. Alvaro Morata's 50th-minute strike gave Madrid the lead, before Joselu's brace in the 63rd and 65th minute. Ramos scored his second injury-time goal in two league matches to complete the 3-2 scoreline.
