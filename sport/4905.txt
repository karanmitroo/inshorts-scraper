The coach of a Spanish youth team was sacked for "not respecting his opponents" after his team defeated a rival side 25-0. "We believe in encouraging respect for your opponents. After the result, we decided that the manager should leave," an official from the club's management said. The losing team ended the league with zero points and 247 goals conceded.
