The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Tuesday that it wanted the upcoming Under-19 Asia Cup to be moved out of India to a neutral venue due to security concerns. India is scheduled to host the tournament in November in Bangalore. The PCB had earlier said that it would sue BCCI for not respecting a MoU signed between them.
