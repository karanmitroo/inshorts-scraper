The Thailand Football Association is seeking to move the home World Cup qualifier against Australia on November 15 out of the country amid mourning following the passing away of the Thai monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej. A number of domestic sports competitions have been canceled out of respect for the monarch who died on Thursday in Bangkok at the age of 88.
