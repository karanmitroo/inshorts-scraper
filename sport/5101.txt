Ravichandran Ashwin has said Virender Sehwag had a "demoralising" effect on him as a bowler. "Every ball I bowled, Sehwag cut me...He once told me, 'I don't think off-spinners are bowlers. They do not trouble me at all.' I said to myself either I am just not good enough or this guy is just way too good," said Ashwin.
