 Luv Kumar Soni, a 27-year-old national-level bodybuilder, died of electrocution after he accidentally touched a high-tension wire at the terrace of his home. Kumar was rushed to a hospital where he died during treatment. Kumar's family members and neighbours blamed Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) for alleged negligence and went on to stage a protest by blocking a road.
