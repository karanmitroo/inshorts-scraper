Pacer Mohammed Shami, who dismissed two Sri Lankan batsmen in SL's first innings in the  Delhi Test, on being asked about the smog said, "The pollution is not that much as shown, or maybe we are habituated to it." In India's first innings, SL players wore masks with two of their pacers walking off the field mid-over due to smog.
