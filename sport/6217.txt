Benfica midfielder Andreas Samaris punched a player from a rival team during a match, but did not get booked as the referee did not see it. Benfica was 1-0 up in injury time when Samaris committed a foul outside the box for which he was given a yellow card. A scuffle then broke out wherein Samaris discreetly punched the player.
