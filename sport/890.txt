Hobart Hurricanes' Jofra Archer hit the stumps directly from a boundary line throw to run-out Perth Scorchers' captain Adam Voges in the BBL on Saturday. Voges pulled the ball towards deep midwicket and attempted a second run as Archer's throw hit the stumps at the striker's end. Voges was caught outside the crease, getting out for 11(8).
