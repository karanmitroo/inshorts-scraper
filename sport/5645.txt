BCCI plans to implement former president Jagmohan Dalmiya's proposed model to make up for the nearly ₹1,000-crore loss due to ICC's new financial model, according to reports. The Champions League T20 used to be held in September and the board will organise a bilateral series during that window to generate around ₹200 crore annually for the next five years.
