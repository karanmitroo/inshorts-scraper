Indian pacer Mohammed Shami was trolled on social media after he posted pictures of his wife during their daughter's second birthday celebrations. The cricketer was trolled with many users commenting that his wife committed a "sin" by not wearing a hijab. Shami was subjected to similar treatment last year after he posted his wife's picture in a sleeveless dress.
