Bengaluru FC's midfielder Erik Paartalu has revealed the team's players deleted memes on North Korea before flying to Pyongyang for an AFC Cup match. "A few North Korea memes had been sent around...poking fun at Kim Jong-un...we told everyone to delete the messages...I was hoping they didn't have Twitter, I had joked about meeting Kim for a drink," said Erik.
