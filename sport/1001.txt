Defending La Liga champions Real Madrid were stunned by Villarreal at home ground Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday after suffering a 0-1 defeat. The 87th-minute winner gave Villarreal its first league victory at Bernabeu in 18 attempts. Real, with just one win in last five league matches, might go 19 points behind table-toppers Barcelona if Barcelona beat Real Sociedad on Sunday.
