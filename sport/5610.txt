Pakistani-British boxing champion Amir Khan has said, "[Vijender Singh] hasn't won a major title, or even half a major title, which will make people regard him as a good fighter." Vijender had earlier called for a match with Amir, who feels that people will not want to watch the bout. Amir is set to launch a boxing league in India.
