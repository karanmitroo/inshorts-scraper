Delhi Daredevils player Rishabh Pant was run out after forgetting to ground his bat following an LBW appeal against Gujarat Lions on Wednesday. The ball bounced off Pant's pad and went to Suresh Raina at slip, who directly broke the stumps. Pant was out of the crease without grounding his bat, while refusing a run to the non-striker.
