Kapil Dev was the first Indian to score an ODI hundred, after he hit 175*(138) against Zimbabwe during the 1983 World Cup, which India went on to win. Dev, who turned 58 on Friday, achieved the feat in what was India's 45th ODI. The highest individual score by an Indian before that match was Kris Srikkanth's 95, scored in 1982.
