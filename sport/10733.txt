Indian spinner Anil Kumble started off as a medium-pace bowler, but eventually switched over to leg spin when he was in school. Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not known to be a big turner of the ball and relied on accuracy for his wickets. Kumble, who is India's most successful bowler with 956 wickets across formats, turned 46 on Monday.
