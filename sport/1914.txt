A man proposed to his girlfriend in the pool deck at the Gabba, Brisbane, during the second day of the ongoing first Test between England and Australia. The duo later posed for a photograph in the pool with the woman showing off her ring. The pool deck was inaugurated in December last year, during Australia's day-night Test against Pakistan.
