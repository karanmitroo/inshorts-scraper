A video has emerged which shows a golden retriever dog trying to play fetch with a police officer on an ice hockey rink before a National Hockey League game in Washington recently. The dog tries to run on the rink trying to catch the puck but struggles to keep his balance. The video was posted by NHL's official Twitter handle.
