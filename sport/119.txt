All-rounder Ben Stokes picked up two wickets and slammed 63*(74) to help England defeat New Zealand by six wickets in the second ODI on Wednesday. Stokes was out of the England squad for nearly five months over his involvement in a brawl outside a nightclub in Bristol in September last year.  With the victory, England levelled the five-match series 1-1.
