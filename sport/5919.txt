Sachin Tendulkar was presented a bottle of champagne after he scored his first international century, but was not allowed to drink it since he was underage. In August 1990, 17-year-old Sachin hit his first century at Old Trafford, Manchester, against England, and was named Man of the Match. He finally opened the bottle at his daughter's first birthday in 1998.
