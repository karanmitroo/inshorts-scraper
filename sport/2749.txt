Brazilian police on Thursday arrested the country's Olympic committee head Carlos Nuzman on suspicion of corruption, money laundering and criminal association over his alleged buying of votes to secure Rio's hosting of the 2016 Games. Authorities alleged that ex-Rio Governor SÃ©rgio Cabral, who is serving a 14-year prison term for bribery and money laundering, was the mastermind of the plot.
