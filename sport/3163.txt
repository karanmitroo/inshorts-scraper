Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle took a dig at World XI claiming that the "best thing" about such teams is that they attract a lot of attention but "always lose". Bhogle's remark came after World XI lost against Pakistan in Lahore on Tuesday. Bhogle added the series was not about who was in World XI but about playing cricket in Pakistan.
