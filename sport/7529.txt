Batsman Usman Khawaja was given out after a chair, placed instead of a fielder, 'took a catch' during an Australian team practice match in Dubai recently. Coach Darren Lehmann adjudged Khawaja out after an appeal by the opposition, when the ball landed at short leg where the chair was placed. Khawaja was dismissed for 39 after hitting six boundaries.
