Brisbane Heat's Chris Lynn smashed 11 sixes during his match-winning knock of 98*(48) against Perth Scorchers on Thursday in the Big Bash League, equalling the record for most sixes hit in a BBL innings. West Indian Chris Gayle (2011) and Australian Craig Simmons (2014) are the other two batsmen to have achieved the feat.
