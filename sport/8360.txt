MS Dhoni stumped England opener Jason Roy off a Ravindra Jadeja delivery during the first ODI at Pune on Sunday. Roy, batting on 73, stepped ahead too early with Dhoni collecting the ball and knocking off the bails. Earlier, Roy was given out on 18 but survived after a DRS review and was later dropped by Umesh Yadav at 66.
