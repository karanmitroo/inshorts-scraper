Swiss tennis ace and 19-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer suffered his first loss in Grand Slams in 2017 on Thursday, after having won the Australian Open and Wimbledon earlier this year. Federer's loss, against Argentina's Juan Mart√≠n del Potro, also means that he won't face Rafael Nadal in semis, which could have been their first-ever meeting at the tournament.
