Virat Kohli has said his estimated brand value of over $120 million (₹773 crore) is "just numbers" for him. "It's not something I strive for or work towards, it's just a by-product of whatever I'm doing in my professional career," said Kohli. The cricketer signed an eight-year ₹110 crore deal with Puma in February, besides an undisclosed MRF deal.
