The first cricket academy in Jammu and Kashmir was inaugurated on Tuesday, with an U-16 camp being held for budding cricketers. The academy, which has been housed in Srinagar's Bakshi Stadium, is still in development mode and will feature state-of-the-art facilities along with cemented turfs. Mubashir Hassan, a BCCI-licensed coach and former first-class cricketer, is the director of the academy.
