New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor, who is suffering from a recurring eye ailment, will be consulting an eye specialist on Monday to determine his fitness for the second Test against Pakistan. A preliminary eye examination had revealed a growth in Taylor's left eye. Taylor had suffered a similar eye condition a year ago, which reportedly has worsened since.
