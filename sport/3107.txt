Three spectators were injured and another 200 were moved, after a temporary stand partially collapsed during the England-Windies T20I at  Chester-le-Street, England, on Saturday. The incident took place midway during England's innings in the north-east corner of the ground. Windies defeated England by 21 runs in the match, which saw Gayle becoming the first cricketer to hit 100 T20I sixes.
