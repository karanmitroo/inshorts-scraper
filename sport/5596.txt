The English Football Association has banned several members of the England Supporters Travel Club for their "unacceptable behaviour" in Germany during the two sides' international friendly match in March. Some of the away fans booed the German national anthem and sang chants referencing the World War II during the English team's 0-1 loss in Dortmund.
