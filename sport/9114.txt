Formula One driver Michael Schumacher's family has launched a new initiative, titled 'Keep Fighting', which will work towards inspiring those in difficult circumstances. The initiative will be managed by a team on behalf of Schumacher's family and work towards "spreading the belief that giving up is not an option". Schumacher has been recuperating after suffering a skiing accident in 2013.
