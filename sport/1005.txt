Tony Chapron, a referee in France's Ligue 1, kicked Nantes' Diego Carlos before sending him off by showing a second yellow during PSG's 1-0 win on Sunday. While running towards the defensive area, Carlos accidentally clipped Chapron following which Chapron appeared to swing a leg towards Carlos. PSG are now 11 points clear at top of the Ligue 1 table.
