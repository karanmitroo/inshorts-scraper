England's debutant opener Keaton Jennings, who scored a century in the first innings against India, was out on his first ball of the second innings in Mumbai on Sunday. Jennings was trapped leg before by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, after making 112 in the first innings. He is now the fourth batsman to score a century and a duck on Test debut.
