England was beaten at home for the first time by Australia in 1882, following which a newspaper declared English cricket to be dead, saying, "The body will be burnt and ashes taken to Australia." England received the ashes of burnt bails after completing an away series victory over Australia on January 30, 1883, next season, giving the series its name.
