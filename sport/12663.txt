La Liga President Javier Tebas has said he is worried about Barcelona star Lionel Messi leaving the club and the league, after being convicted of tax evasion. “Of course I fear that [Messi] could leave…but from La Liga we believe he isn't guilty,” said Tebas. Earlier, Messi and his father were sentenced to 21 months in prison for tax fraud.
