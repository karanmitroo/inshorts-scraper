A 16-year-old Muslim schoolgirl in the US was barred from competing in the regional basketball finals, despite playing a full season of the games, because of her hijab. "We've never been informed of this rule," her coach said. The Muslim community has called for the revocation of the rule which prohibits players from wearing distracting headwear on the court.
