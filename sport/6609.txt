UP-born Kuldeep Yadav, who made his international debut on Saturday against Australia, is the first Chinaman bowler to represent the men's team. The 22-year-old left-arm unorthodox spinner, who represents Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL, was part of the Indian team at 2014 ICC U-19 World Cup, where he became the first Indian to take a hat-trick in the tournament's history.
