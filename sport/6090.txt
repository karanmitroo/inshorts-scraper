KKR's Nathan Coulter-Nile's last delivery of his spell against DD on Monday denied him a fourth wicket despite the ball hitting the stumps. Coulter-Nile bowled an off-cutter to Pat Cummins who missed the ball, which went onto hit the outside of the leg-stump. The snickometer confirmed the ball had hit the stump but Cummins survived as the bails didn't dislodge.
