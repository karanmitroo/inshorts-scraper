Tony Chapron, the French league referee who swung a leg towards Nantes player Diego Carlos in Sunday's match against PSG after being accidentally tripped, has been handed a provisional suspension. Chapron, who gave Carlos a second yellow card for tripping him, will be summoned before the French league's disciplinary committee over the incident.
