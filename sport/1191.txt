Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar was the first batsman in cricket history to be given out by a third umpire. Sachin was adjudged run-out by TV umpire Karl Liebenberg in the first Test during India's tour of South Africa in 1992. Jonty Rhodes threw the ball towards the stumps as Sachin attempted a single but was sent back by Ravi Shastri.
