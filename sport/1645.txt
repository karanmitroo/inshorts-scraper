Fielding coach Jonty Rhodes has parted ways with three-time Indian Premier League champions Mumbai Indians after nine seasons together. Rhodes' decision to move on comes after he wanted to spend more time on personal business ventures, according to a statement from the franchise. Rhodes will be replaced by New Zealand's James Pamment, who coached Northern Districts in 2014 CLT20.
