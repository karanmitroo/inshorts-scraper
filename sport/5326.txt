India captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble have reportedly demanded a fast bowling coach for the team, putting their request forward at their meeting with BCCI's Committee of Administrators on Sunday. India have not had a fast bowling coach since Anil Kumble took over as coach. Former cricketer Bharat Arun coached pacers when Ravi Shastri was team director.
