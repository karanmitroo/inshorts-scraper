The leading wicket-taker in the ongoing Indian Premier League Bhuvneshwar Kumar has termed Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner as a "bowler's captain". "It has never happened that I have asked him for a particular field and he has not given it to me. He knows it is about believing in us and does so all the time," Kumar added.
