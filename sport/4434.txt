Former India captain Sourav Ganguly tweeted to ex-BCCI President Anurag Thakur that Indian cricket "needs him back", in response to Thakur's birthday wish for him. Thakur was removed from the BCCI President post by the Supreme Court in January on perjury charges, in connection with the implementation of Lodha panel reforms in cricket administration in India.
