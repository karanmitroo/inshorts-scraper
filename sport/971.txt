Indian wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik is set to return to the Indian Test team for the first time since 2010, as he will replace injured keeper Wriddhiman Saha. Karthik will join the squad ahead of the third Test in Johannesburg. Saha, who suffered an upper left hamstring tendon injury during training, was replaced by Parthiv Patel for the second Test.
