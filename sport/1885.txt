A building made of the darkest known man-made substance, Vantablack, will be unveiled at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Although colourless, the building will appear to be the darkest black to the human eye. The substance, Vantablack, is made of millions of tubes of carbon, which absorb 99.96% of the light that hits its surface.
