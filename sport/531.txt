Portuguese football club Boavista conceded an alleged offside goal after the VAR (Video Assistant Referee) camera was blocked out by its fan waving a giant flag. Boavista were trailing 0-2 when Aves' Vitor Gomes scored from an apparent offside position before it was referred to the VAR official. The goal eventually stood as replays were inconclusive due to the flag.
