Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has claimed that he found current Indian captain Virat Kohli's support for his predecessor MS Dhoni and his way of looking out for other players 'remarkable'. "A champion player (Dhoni) who's probably on his last leg of his career and Virat coming and saying he's my man and I want him to play," Ganguly said.
