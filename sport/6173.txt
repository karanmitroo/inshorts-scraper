Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has said he is "not too sure" if ex-skipper MS Dhoni is a good T20 player. "He is a champion ODI player but when it comes to Twenty20 cricket, in 10 years, he has got one fifty...that's not the best record," said Ganguly. Dhoni has scored 28 runs in three IPL matches this year.
