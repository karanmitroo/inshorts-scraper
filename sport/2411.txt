New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor took to Instagram to share a picture of a Tenpin bowling scorecard, wherein his name was misspelt as 'Taler'. Earlier, Virender Sehwag, while wishing Taylor on birthday, had called him a 'Darji'. "Started with Taylor, then I was 'Darji' which in Hindi means 'Tailor'...now I'm Taler...wonder how else my name can be spelt," wrote Taylor.
