Kings XI Punjab captain Glenn Maxwell got angry at a journalist before walking out of the press conference after Kings XI's loss on Saturday. Maxwell was asked about his performance against spin, to which he replied, "Do you understand in the last three games I've hit leg spinners for six repeatedly?". Maxwell termed it 'a shit question' before walking out.
