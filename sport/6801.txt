Former Aussie captain Michael Clarke has said Indian skipper Virat Kohli has "Australian in him". "He has that fight inside him that every Australian player wants, and generally has, when he's playing for the country," said Clarke. He had earlier said that he had "the utmost respect" for Kohli, after the latter attended Phillip Hughes' funeral.
