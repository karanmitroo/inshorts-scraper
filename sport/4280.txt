Team India coach Ravi Shastri will reportedly receive an annual compensation of ₹7 crore, less than the ₹9 crore that was demanded by former coach Anil Kumble. A four-member panel appointed by the Committee of Administrators will however decide the final pay. Kumble had reportedly asked for an amount at par with Grade A players, which BCCI considered "too high".
