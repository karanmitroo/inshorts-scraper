England's Liverpool Ladies football club forgot to carry their own kit for their match against Yeovil Town Ladies and played the match wearing the latter's away kit, which sported the names of Yeovil players. While Yeovil wore their home green and white jerseys, Liverpool Ladies sported the former's yellow and green away kit, with the name of the Yeovil sponsors.
