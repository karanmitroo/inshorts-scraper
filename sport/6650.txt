Indian skipper Virat Kohli has said he will only play the Dharamsala Test starting Saturday if he is "100% fit". Kohli, who suffered a shoulder injury in Ranchi, said, "I have not done anything in the series so far. Still team won...I am no different from anyone. Being 100% fit is the only condition that I will take the field."
