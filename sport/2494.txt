Virender Sehwag trolled New Zealand's Ross Taylor in his tweet congratulating the latter on his knock in the first ODI by calling him 'Darji ji'. Sehwag joked that Taylor played a great knock after "handling the pressure of Diwali orders". "[A]gli Baar Apna order time pe Bhej dena so Mai Apko agli Diwali ke pehle deliver kardunga," Taylor replied.
