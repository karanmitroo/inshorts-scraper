Former Indian hockey captain Sardar Singh was on Monday called for questioning by the UK police in connection with a year-old sexual assault case. The summon came after India's 7-1 win over Pakistan in the ongoing Hockey World League Semi-Finals in London. The team management slammed the move of calling a player for questioning during an international tournament.
