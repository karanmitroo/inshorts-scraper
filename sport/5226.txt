A man standing on a drone delivered the ball to the referee during the Portuguese Cup final between Benfica and Vitória de Guimarães on Sunday. The man rode the spider-like drone for 70 metres in rain before landing near the halfway line and handing the ball. The match was won by Benfica, who celebrated their victory by riding a moped.
