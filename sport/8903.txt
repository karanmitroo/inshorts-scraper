The Uttar Pradesh franchise in the upcoming Pro Wrestling League 2 has been named 'UP Dangal', after the recent Aamir Khan-starring film. Notably, the UP franchise features wrestlers Geeta and Babita Phogat, on whose lives 'Dangal' is based. "The movie is a source of inspiration for me and Babita to do well in the league," Geeta said.
