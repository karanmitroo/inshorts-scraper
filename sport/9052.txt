Speaking at the post-match press conference, Indian Test captain Virat Kohli said the team had a great 2016, apart from two setbacks, the one-day series in Australia and the World T20. Earlier in the year, India lost the ODI series in Australia by 4-1, while they were eliminated from the T20I World Cup by West Indies in the semi-final.
