Former England captain Paul Collingwood became the oldest cricketer, at the age of 41 years and 65 days, to score a century in T20 cricket. Collingwood scored 108* off 60 balls to achieve the feat, while playing for Durham against Worcestershire in England's NatWest T20 Blast on Sunday. The century was Collingwood's first in his 132-match T20 career.
