Russia's Ekaterinburg Arena, which will host four World Cup 2018 matches, has erected two temporary stands outside the stadium to fulfil FIFA's minimum capacity criteria. The change will see the stadium's original 27,000-seating capacity reach 45,000 for the duration of the month-long tournament. FIFA rules require World Cup stadiums to have a minimum capacity of 35,000.
