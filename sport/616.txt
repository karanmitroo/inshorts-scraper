Indian middle-order batsman Ajinkya Rahane slammed 79(86) against South Africa in the first ODI on Thursday, becoming the fourth Indian to hit five consecutive 50+ scores in ODIs. India captain Virat Kohli had achieved the feat twice (2012 and 2013), while former batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid scored five consecutive 50+ scores in 1994 and 2004-05 respectively.
