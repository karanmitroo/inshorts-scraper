Vinod Rai, head of BCCI's Committee of Administrators has said Anil Kumble was absolutely "impeccable" in his role as Team India coach. "He has done very well as a coach. We will go in for a equally good professional to ensure that whether it is the captain or manager, there should be cohesion in the team," said Rai.
