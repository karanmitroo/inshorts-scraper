Premier League club West Ham United's fans have been calling the UK's emergency number 999 after losing to Watford on Sunday. Some supporters chanted "sack the board" during the match as the team remained 18th in the league table. "Ringing 999 because @WestHamUtd have lost again and you aren't sure what to do is not acceptable!", tweeted Essex Police.
