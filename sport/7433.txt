Making his return to the Sri Lanka side, pacer Lasith Malinga uprooted Australian Prime Minister's XI batsman D'Arcy Short's middle stump with an inswinging yorker. Malinga, who was out of action for almost a year owing to an injury, took the wicket on the fourth ball of his first over when the Australian side's score was still zero.
