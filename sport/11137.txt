Harbhajan Singh has accused Ravichandran Ashwin, who recently became the fastest Indian to claim 200 Test wickets, of being assisted by pitch curators. "Skill should be the deciding factor and not the conditionsâ€¦ Alas, had we bowled on such wickets," said Harbhajan. Ashwin reacted by saying that it wasn't the players or the coach who decide the nature of wickets.
