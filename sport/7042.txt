Sweden's women's football team players have swapped their names for inspirational quotes on their jerseys, as part of a campaign ahead of International Women's Day. The quotes, in English and Swedish, are those of the players, their friends and female leaders. The campaign, branded 'In your name', is backed by Adidas, which is selling limited edition versions of the jerseys.
