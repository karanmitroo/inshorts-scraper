Lala Amarnath scored India's first-ever Test century on December 17, 1933, while playing in his debut match against England. Amarnath, who scored 118, was also independent India's first cricket captain. Later in 1976, Amarnath's son Surinder scored a century on Test debut against New Zealand, making them the only father-son duo to score tons on international debut.
