Virat Kohli on Friday shared a picture of himself sitting on the chair he sat on during his international debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka on August 18, 2008, at Dambulla. "It all started on this very chair, this very date and this very ground. 9 years today with Indian cricket team! So grateful," Kohli captioned the picture.
