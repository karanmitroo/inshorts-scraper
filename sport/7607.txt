Indian captain Virat Kohli has hit only one six in the four double centuries he made. The six came during Kohli's highest Test knock of 235 against England at the Wankhede Stadium and was hit when he had crossed the 200-run mark. "He has made a conscious effort to not hit sixes in Test cricket," Kohli's mentor Rajkumar Sharma said.
