Virat Kohli became the first Indian Test skipper to be out hit wicket since Lala Amarnath in 1949 after his foot disturbed the stumps in the ongoing Rajkot Test against England. Batting on 40, Kohli went well inside the crease to pull a short ball from spinner Adil Rashid when he dislodged the bails with his foot and got out.
