India has reportedly agreed to play against Pakistan in the upcoming women's Asia T20 Cup in Thailand. According to a PCB official, India would not be playing Pakistan in any bilateral series but would "play in ICC events". This comes after BCCI President Anurag Thakur's statement that he would ask the ICC not to schedule India-Pakistan matches in its events.
