A part of cricketer Ravindra Jadeja's restaurant 'Jaddu's Food Field' in Rajkot was demolished by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation during a drive against illegal construction in the city on Thursday. A store room and a kitchen constructed illegally as part of the restaurant were pulled down after the corporation had earlier issued notices to those with illegal constructions.
