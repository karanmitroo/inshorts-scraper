England cricketer Alex Hales was mocked on Twitter by his teammates, after English all-rounder Moeen Ali tweeted a picture of Hales’ expression while taking a catch during the Lord’s Test on Saturday. “Misbah was unfortunate!! Great effort catching the ball looking in different directions!! @AlexHales1”, wrote Ali. Jos Buttler tweeted, “HAHAHAAHA!! How did he even get there running in quicksand.”
