English spinner Jim Laker registered the world’s first 10-for and the best bowling figures in an innings, taking 10/53 against Australia at Old Trafford on July 31, 1956. Laker’s overall figures of 19/90 are also the best bowling figures in a Test. Former Indian captain Anil Kumble is the only other player to take all 10 wickets in an innings.
