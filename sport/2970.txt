Speaking about the weather conditions during the 2nd India-Australia ODI match in Kolkata, Australian pacer Pat Cummins said, "It was the hottest one-day game anyone said they've played." "I think the 50 overs felt like it was about 200 overs out there", Cummins said about the conditions. The temperatures reportedly reached as high as 42Â°C at Eden Gardens on Thursday.
