Tennis player Rohan Bopanna reportedly refused to represent India in the ongoing Davis Cup tie against New Zealand, after Saketh Myneni opted out citing injury. The All India Tennis Association contacted Bopanna to replace Saketh when the former refused, reportedly because he was ignored by AITA during selection earlier. Leander Paes then contacted player Vishnu Vardhan, who agreed to play.
