Brisbane Heat, while chasing Melbourne Renegades' 199/5, began the final over of their run-chase with 18 runs to win. The first two legitimate balls of the over were hit for six but the batting side lost three wickets in the final four balls. Heat eventually fell short by one run despite the bowler bowling three wides in the over.
