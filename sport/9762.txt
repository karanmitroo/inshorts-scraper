South African captain Faf du Plessis, who was charged 100% match fees for ball tampering during the Hobart Test against Australia, has said he did nothing wrong. "For me (ball-tampering) is picking the ball, scratching the ball. Shining it, I think all cricketers would say, is not in the same place...I think it's opened a can of worms," he said.
