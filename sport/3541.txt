Australia's silver-winning Olympic medalist Jack Bobridge was arrested in Perth on charges of selling and supplying MDMA, a recreational drug. The 28-year-old cyclist was arrested after the police raided his home during an undercover operation. Bobridge had retired prematurely from cycling due to rheumatoid arthritis, at the end of last season, after winning his second Olympic silver.
