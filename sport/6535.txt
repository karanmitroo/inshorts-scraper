Bosnia's sixteen-year-old European taekwondo champion, Kerim Ahmetspahic, broke 111 concrete slabs in 35 seconds to set a new world record. Ahmetspahic performed somersaults, pivoting around the 16 piles using his head, breaking the concrete blocks in the process. Upon completing the challenge in record time, the sixteen-year-old black-belt holder said, "I still have more power."
