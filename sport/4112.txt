Opener Shikhar Dhawan, who scored his Test career's fifth century in the first Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, has hit the three fastest Test tons by Indians in the last four years. Shikhar scored an 85-ball hundred against Australia in 2013, followed by a 101-ball ton versus Bangladesh in 2015. His century against SL today came off 110 balls.
