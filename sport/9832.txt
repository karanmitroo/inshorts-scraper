Reacting to Real forward Cristiano Ronaldo's 'crouched' celebration against Atletico Madrid on Saturday, a user tweeted, "Only Ronaldo can unlock a new celebration and a meme at the same time," while another tweet read, "Mannequin Challenge celebration." Users also posted photoshopped images of the celebration, including Ronaldo sitting over Messi, and the striker posing on the top of a building.
