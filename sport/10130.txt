Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed that no one can be the next 'him'. The 31-year-old acknowledged the fact that there are a lot of promising young players but felt that none of them will succeed him. "There are no doubles in football. The next will be what he has to be, but never the same," added Ronaldo.
