Sreesanth has written to Vinod Rai, who heads the Supreme Court-appointed panel which administers BCCI, asking for his life ban to be revoked. Sreesanth had announced that he would return to professional cricket with the Scotland Cricket League but was denied NOC by the board. Sreesanth was banned for life after being accused of spot-fixing in the IPL 2013.
