The English and Spanish football teams did the Mannequin challenge on Tuesday, when they played their WC 2018 qualifier match. The English team performed the act after Jamie Vardy ended his scoring drought and gave England a two-goal lead. The Spanish team, who salvaged a late draw, did the challenge in their dressing room after the end of the match.
