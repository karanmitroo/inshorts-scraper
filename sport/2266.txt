India's World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has said banned cricketer Sreesanth should give reasons to back his claim that BCCI was biased against him. "Every person feels he should be playing for the country but...only eleven players are going to play," Dev added. Sreesanth had recently alleged that several players who were involved in IPL spot-fixing scandal were still playing.
