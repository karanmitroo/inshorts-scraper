New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden, while officiating in a domestic T20 league, changed his mind mid-decision while adjudicating a caught-behind appeal. The umpire seemed to raise his hand to declare the batsman out but ended up adjusting his hat instead. The Kiwi official is known for his unique umpiring style, including the crooked finger to give an out decision.
