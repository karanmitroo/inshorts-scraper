England's Jonny Bairstow was caught on a no-ball, and then took DRS to score a half-century during the Kolkata ODI against India on Sunday. Bairstow, batting on 28, was caught by Ravichandran Ashwin, but the umpire called a no-ball. In the 38th over, Bairstow, then on 46, was given caught behind, which he reviewed and the decision was overturned.
