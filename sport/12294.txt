Australian batsmen Peter Nevill and Steve O’Keefe's four-run partnership off 178 balls against Sri Lanka was the slowest Test partnership with at least 100 deliveries. Scoring at a rate of 0.13 run per over, the Australian duo surpassed South Africa’s Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers' 27-run partnership off 253 balls against India in 2015.
