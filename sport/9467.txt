A Dundee United football club fan, who had one of his legs amputated, scored a goal in a half-time competition by chipping the ball over the goalkeeper. The man took his kick from the edge of the box after running up the pitch on his crutches. The goal has been shortlisted for Scottish Professional Football League's goal of the month.
