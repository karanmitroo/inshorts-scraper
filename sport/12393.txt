Former Australian captain Ian Chappell pointed out errors in Indian Test captain Virat Kohli's catching technique. In an article, Chappell claimed that Kohli's failure to turn the foot outwards while attempting a catch, towards the direction of the ball's movement was the reason behind his failure as a slip fielder. Chappell mentioned Gary Sobers to be the best slip fielder.
