Former Indian wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani, who played the 1983 World Cup-winning campaign, pledged to donate his eyes on Saturday, only to retract the pledge later citing religious values. "I am an emotional and sentimental person... However, I might not be able to honour my commitment due to some religious values. And not everyone in India honours their pledge," he said.
