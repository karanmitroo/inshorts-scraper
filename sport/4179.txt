A portrait of Australian batsman David Warner, named 'Pocket Rocket' and painted by artist James Brennan, has won the 2017 Bald Archy competition. The competition for Australian artists focuses on spoof artwork and is judged by a sulphur-crested cockatoo bird. "My painting is a celebration of the most explosive batsman...with a tiny dig at his vertically challenged stature," said Brennan.
