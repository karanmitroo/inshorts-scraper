Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar, who finished fourth at Rio Olympics, has opted out of this year's Commonwealth Games to avoid any further risk to an injury she suffered last year. The 24-year-old said her next target is the Asian Games, which will take place in August. Dipa had undergone an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery in April last year.
