All football competitions in Greece have been suspended after a suspected arson attack by fans on the home of a refereeing official. The government has enlisted anti-terrorism police to investigate the attack and has said it "will not accept mafia-style gangs". The Sports Minister added the government was prepared to pull clubs out of European competitions unless "normality" was restored.
