Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq became the sixth Test batsman to remain stranded on 99*, as the rest of his team was dismissed against West Indies on Monday. It was the first such instance in 14 years and the first involving a Pakistani. He is also only the second player to get stranded on 99* and get out on 99 in Tests.
