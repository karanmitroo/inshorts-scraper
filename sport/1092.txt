Hobart Hurricanes' Jofra Archer jumped to pull off a one-handed reflex catch off his own bowling to dismiss Brisbane Heat's Ben Cutting in the Big Bash League on Wednesday. Archer bowled a 147-kmph delivery which was hit straight by Cutting and caught in no time by the bowler in his follow-through. Archer celebrated the catch by staring at Cutting.
