The Indian Cricket Team celebrated Virat Kohli's birthday on Saturday in Rajkot, ahead of the first Test against England. A cake-cutting was organised at the team hotel which was attended by the players, coach Anil Kumble and other support staff. The players smeared cake over Kohli's face, with Cheteshwar Pujara, Umesh Yadav and Hardik Pandya posting selfies with him later.
