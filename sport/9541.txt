BCCI selected seven overage players for the Youth Asia Cup, after getting the age limit wrong for the tournament. While the cut-off birth year for the players was 1998, the Board told the selectors that the year was 1997. The error came to light a day before the preparatory camp, with the Board changing the team on its website.
