Reacting to striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic announcing his transfer to Manchester United, a user tweeted, “Usually no players announce their moves before United announce it... Every player except Zlatan of course. Does what he wants! #DareToZlatan.” Other tweets read, “Clubs don't announce Zlatan. Zlatan announces clubs” and “If you're not really excited right now it's because Zlatan didn't pick you.”
