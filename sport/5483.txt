Indian women's cricket team's 19-year-old all-rounder Deepti Sharma hit 188 against Ireland to register women's ODI cricket's second highest individual score behind Belinda Clark's unbeaten 229. Deepti's 160-ball 188 had 27 fours, which is the most fours ever hit in an innings in women's ODIs. The teenager is now cricket's youngest to score over 175 runs in an ODI innings.
