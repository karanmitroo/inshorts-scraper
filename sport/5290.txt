Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is set to make her return to tennis at the French Open, five months after she was stabbed by an intruder at her home. The 27-year-old Czech will face Julia Boserup of the United States in the first-round of the tournament. Kvitova required four hours of hand surgery in December following the knife attack.
