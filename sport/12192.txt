Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States from 1861 to 1865, was also a wrestler. While he still used to work at a general store, Lincoln was challenged to wrestle by the leader of a group of ruffians. Being 6-feet and 4-inches tall, Lincoln won the match. Notably, in the 19th century, politicians were expected to demonstrate bravery.
