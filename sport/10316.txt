Play was called off in the Bengal-Gujarat and Tripura-Hyderabad Ranji Trophy games in Delhi on Saturday following heavy smog. Bengal coach Sairaj Bahutule said the players were complaining of breathing problems and burning sensations in their eyes. "This is the first time something like this happened in my career...During warm-up, we felt it's not happening," said Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary.
