Brijesh Yadav, a 17-year-old gymnast, died almost two months after he broke his neck during a practice session in Agra. Yadav got injured and went into a coma while practising a double front flip for the nationals, in which he had previously won a silver. Private organisations and his coaches were raising money for Yadav, who underwent two surgeries.
