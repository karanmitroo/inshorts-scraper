Wrestler Sushil Kumar will not join WWE after the company's Vice President Canyon Ceman said, "it was hard to convince him". "It was hard to tell him 'you leave this amazing life in India and come and risk it all in America where we are not sure of anything'," said Ceman. Sushil was approached by WWE in October last year.
