Former Windies cricketer Brian Lara suffered leg injuries after falling 10 feet down a staircase at his home. Lara shared a video of himself lying on a bed with a bandaged knee and captioned it, "Nothing is broken, Thank God! Me my TV control, fruits, cellphone and pillows will be spending some time together. #bmobilelifeison #strongbones #injurymanagement #golf."
