Indian commentator Aakash Chopra was trolled on Twitter after he posted a picture of an Indian man claiming him to be a lookalike of David Warner. Reacting to Aakash's post, a user tweeted, "From which angle?" "Looks nothing like him, but if u shared someone's pic here in  UK or in west without permission u could get sued!!" tweeted another.
