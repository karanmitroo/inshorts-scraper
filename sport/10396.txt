BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke has sent letters to all five Test centres scheduled to host the India-England Tests, asking if they can afford to hold the matches. The move comes after the Supreme Court barred BCCI from giving funds to state associations. The five-Test series begins on November 9, with Rajkot, Visakhapatnam, Mohali, Mumbai and Chennai scheduled to host matches.
