A spectator took down a drone filming the stands using a roll of toilet paper during a football match in Argentina on Sunday. The incident occurred during the third tier promotion play-off game between Gimnasia de Mendoza and Mitre. The roll hit the drone and caused it to spiral out of the air and crash into the stands.
