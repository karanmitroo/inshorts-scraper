Spanish football club FC Barcelona has announced that it will be closed on Tuesday as part of a country-wide strike over Catalonian independence referendum violence. This comes after over 840 people were injured in clashes between police and voters during the Catalan independence vote on Sunday. The club also played its league match on Sunday behind closed doors.
