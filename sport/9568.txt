Pakistan will host its first Davis Cup tie in 13 years on home soil against Iran in February next year. Pakistan Tennis Federation said the visiting team will be provided the same level of security as visiting foreign leaders. Notably, international cricket teams have refused to play in Pakistan after an attack on the Sri Lankan team in 2009.
