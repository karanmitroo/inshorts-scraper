Wrestling coach Mahavir Phogat has responded to Javed Akhtar's tweet on Virender Sehwag and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, wherein the lyricist calls the cricketer a "hardly literate player". Phogat took a dig at Akhtar through a two-line rhyme, talking about the sacrifices a player makes to win a medal. Akhtar had ridiculed the athletes for tweeting on the Gurmehar Kaur issue.
