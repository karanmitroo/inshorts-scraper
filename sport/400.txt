India claimed their first ever ODI series win in South Africa by taking an unassailable 4-1 lead in the six-match series at Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. The win has also cemented India's spot as the number one side in the ODI rankings. Notably, India have now won nine consecutive bilateral ODI series, having last lost a series in January 2016.
