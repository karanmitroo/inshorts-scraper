Five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant, who won an Oscar for his animated short film 'Dear Basketball' today, said the Oscar win felt better than winning the NBA championship. "To be here right now and to have a sense of validation is crazy," Bryant added. 'Dear Basketball' is based on Bryant's retirement poem which he wrote in 2015.
