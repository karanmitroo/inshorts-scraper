The storyline of movie Dangal has factual inconsistencies with Akhada, the authorised biography of wrestler Mahavir Phogat. Unlike the movie, the chief national coach, PR Sondhi, was the one who invited Mahavir to the pre-CWG camp in Patiala. The book says Mahavir was banned from the training camp as his extra training could have led to injuries to his daughters.
