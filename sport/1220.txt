Real Madrid's Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo shared a photo on Twitter, posing alongside 15 trophies, which comprised his individual awards, in his hometown of Madeira. Part of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's photo's caption read, "When played on the streets of Madeira and dreamed of getting to the top, didn't think that they would be taking a picture like that."
