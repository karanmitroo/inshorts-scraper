Indian spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who registered 4/68 on his debut on Saturday, said that the flipper variation taught to him by Australian legend Shane Warne got him David Warner's wicket, his international career's first wicket. Kuldeep was taken to Warne by coach Anil Kumble for a session. Later, Australia's Matthew Wade said that Yadav's variations were hard to pick up.
