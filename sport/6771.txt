Former Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room in Jamaica on March 18, 2007, just a day after Pakistan was knocked out of the World Cup by minnows Ireland. Suspecting it to be murder, the local authorities had launched an investigation into the death but later declared that Woolmer died of natural causes.
