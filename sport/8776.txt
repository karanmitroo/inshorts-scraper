The Supreme Court on Monday removed BJP MP Anurag Thakur from the post of BCCI President. The court also sacked BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke. The officials were removed as they did not comply with the apex court's earlier order, SC said. The court ordered that BCCI's senior-most Vice President will act as the President in the interim period.
