Australian cricketers shared "alternate punishments" on Twitter following former Kiwi player Brendon McCullum's one-match suspension in the Big Bash League for slow over-rate. All-rounder Glenn Maxwell tweeted, "brendan Mccullum must bat with an eye patch...#bazrules," and, "No. 76: not allowed to speak during the whole fielding innings. Must communicate by sign language at all times #bazrules."
