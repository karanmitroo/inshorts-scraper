Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir expressed his disappointment after failing to make it to the Indian Test squad for the upcoming Test series against New Zealand, despite scoring four consecutive half-centuries in the Duleep Trophy. "I'm disappointed but not defeated; I'm cornered but not a coward. Grit my partner, courage my pride...for, I must fight, I must fight", tweeted Gambhir.
