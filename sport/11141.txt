US President Barack Obama joked about Michael Phelps' now-famous 'Phelps Face' during the US Olympians' visit to the White House on Thursday. Obama, who was addressing America's Paralympians and Olympians, said, "If I keep on going longer, I'm gonna get, like, Phelps face from you guys."  Later, gymnast Simone Biles presented Obama and wife Michelle with a surfboard.
