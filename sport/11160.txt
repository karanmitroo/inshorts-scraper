World heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury has tested positive for cocaine, as reported by ESPN. A letter sent by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency to Fury and the British Boxing Board of Control said the boxer's 'A' sample taken on September 22 contained traces of cocaine. Fury pulled out of a rematch with Wladimir Klitschko last week, citing mental health issues.
