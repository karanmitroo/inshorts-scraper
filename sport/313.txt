After England failed to reach the final of the Trans-Tasman T20I Tri-Series featuring Australia and New Zealand, England coach Trevor Bayliss said T20Is should be abolished over concerns of burnout among players. Meanwhile, New Zealand coach Mike Hesson defended international T20 cricket and rejected Bayliss' claim, saying "every international you play is incredibly meaningful".
