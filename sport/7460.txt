South African pacer Morne Morkel, who has been out of cricket since June 2016 due to a back injury has revealed that he was told by specialists that he would never be able to play cricket again. Morkel, however, ignored that prognosis and sought other doctors' advice and underwent a lengthy rehabilitation programme to recover fully from the injury.
