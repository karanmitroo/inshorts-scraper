Indian captain Virat Kohli trolled his Australian counterpart Steve Smith over a failed review in the first ODI on Sunday. Sitting in the dressing room, Kohli raised his finger after the review against Bhuvneshwar Kumar was deemed unsuccessful. Kohli and Smith were involved in a controversy after the latter tried to take DRS assistance from dressing room in March.
