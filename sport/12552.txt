Indian limited-overs captain MS Dhoni has allegedly been duped of over ₹20 crore by Australia-based sports’ gear company, Spartan Sports. The company has apparently regularly defaulted in payments, paying only four instalments in the three-year bat and sponsorship deal it struck with the cricketer in December 2013. Dhoni’s management company is contemplating legal action against the company.
