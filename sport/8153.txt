Paris Saint-Germain's Marco Verratti was booked for heading the ball back to his goalkeeper, despite the latter not handling the ball. The rules of the game forbid players to use tricks, such as kneeling and pushing the ball with the head, to make a pass to the goalkeeper. It makes no difference whether or not the goalkeeper handles the ball.
