Australia retained the number one rank in ICC ODI rankings despite losing 0-2 to New Zealand in a three-match ODI series. With the series loss, Australia have dropped from 120 to 118 rating, level with South Africa but ahead with more points. The Proteas can become the number one side if they complete a 5-0 clean sweep of Sri Lanka.
