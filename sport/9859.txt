Murali Vijay was dismissed by Stuart Broad using the DRS in the Visakhapatnam Test. The batsman was given not out by the on-field umpire after the ball was caught at slips following a deflection from his pads. On review, the Ultra-edge technology showed the ball had touched the bat's inside edge before hitting the pads, thus overturning the original decision.
