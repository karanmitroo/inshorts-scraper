The personal care brand 'Dove' and YouTube channel 'Blush' have launched   '#ChangeTheRhyme' campaign by releasing the video 'Is That You?' The video features Indian sportswomen as the nursery rhyme 'Chubby cheeks, dimpled chin' plays in the background. In the campaign, Dove aims to challenge conventional perceptions of beauty by reiterating the message, "There is more than one kind of beautiful".
