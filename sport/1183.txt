The Supreme Court has directed the BCCI to allow Bihar to participate in Ranji Trophy and other domestic cricket tournaments. Bihar, who last played Ranji Trophy in 2003-04, were omitted after Jharkhand won the right to play in India's premier domestic tournament. The SC order comes in the wake of a plea by Cricket Association of Bihar Secretary, Aditya Verma.
