Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga has been slammed for hinting the 2011 World Cup final between India and Sri Lanka was fixed. "I am surprised by Arjuna Ranatunga's allegations. These are serious comments by a very respectable voice in international cricket. I think to clear the air, he should back his claims with proofs," said Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir.
