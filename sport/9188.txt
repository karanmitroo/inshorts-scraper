The first-ever Test in India, which was also the first in Asia, was played at the Bombay Gymkhana between India and England from December 15, 1933. Lala Amarnath became the first-ever Indian to score a Test century, making 118. It was India's second Test overall, after the team's debut Test at the Lord's in June 1932, also against England.
