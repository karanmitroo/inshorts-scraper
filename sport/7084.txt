Liverpool rose to third place after drubbing Arsenal 3-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. Arsenal, starting without their season top-scorer Alexis Sánchez, conceded a goal ten minutes after kickoff with a far-post finish by Roberto Firmino, before Sadio Mané got his 12th of the season with a grounded strike. Danny Welbeck was the lone scorer for the Gunners.
