Ajinkya Rahane has been selected for the one-off Test against Bangladesh starting on Thursday. He will replace batsman Karun Nair, who scored a triple century against England. "Karun did well but we cannot ignore what Jinx (Ajinkya Rahane) has done over the past two years. He has put in lots of hard work and has performed," said Virat Kohli.
