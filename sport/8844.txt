Perth Scorchers' Ashton Agar smashed the last ball of the BBL match for a six to give his team a four-wicket win over Melbourne Renegades. Renegades' Aaron Finch, bowling the last over to defend nine runs, was able to dismiss two batsmen in the first three balls but Agar went on to score 10 off the last three deliveries.
