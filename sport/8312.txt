Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has reportedly announced his retirement from football citing family reasons. The 65-year-old former Netherlands coach was sacked by Manchester United in May last year and has not taken up any assignments since then. He reportedly received a Â£44 million offer from an Asian club for three seasons, but declined it.
