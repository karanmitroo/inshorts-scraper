New Zealand registered its first ODI win over India on Indian soil in 13 years, after a six-run win in the second ODI in Delhi on Thursday. Batting first, the Kiwis posted 242/9, driven by Kane Williamson's 118(128). In reply, India failed to chase down the target despite a fighting 49-run 9th-wicket partnership between Umesh Yadav and Hardik Pandya.
