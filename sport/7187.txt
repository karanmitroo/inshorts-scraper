The second Test between India and Australia in Bengaluru will have a 'sporting' pitch which will be fair to both the sides, the organisers claim. Karnataka State Cricket Association's secretary Sudhakar Rao said that they had not received any suggestion about the pitch from the Indian team. India's 333-run loss in the first Test was widely attributed to the pitch.
