The mascots for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics selected by elementary school kids were unveiled on Wednesday. The Olympics mascot is a blue-checked, doe-eyed character with pointy ears and "special powers", while the Paralympics mascot sports pink checks and can "talk with stones and the wind". A total of 6.5 million children cast their vote to select the mascots.
