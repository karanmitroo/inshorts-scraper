Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh hit six sixes in an over off England pacer Stuart Broad in the inaugural World T20's group match on September 19, 2007. The feat helped Yuvraj reach his half-century in 12 balls, the fastest ever half-century in international cricket. Yuvraj is only the second batsman, after Herschelle Gibbs to have achieved the feat in international cricket.
