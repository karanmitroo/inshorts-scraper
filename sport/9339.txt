'Mankad' is a rare form of dismissal in which a bowler runs out the non-striker as he leaves the crease before the ball is delivered. The dismissal is named after former Indian cricketer Vinoo Mankad, who first affected the dismissal against Australia in 1947. A controversy was caused when Kapil Dev 'mankaded' South Africa's Peter Kirsten on December 9, 1992.
