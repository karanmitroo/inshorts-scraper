A female football fan was hit in the face during a Portuguese top league football match between Porto and Feirense. Porto's midfielder Ruben Neves tried a long shot which missed the goal and went sailing into the crowd hitting the fan sitting behind the goal, who was looking elsewhere, directly in the face.
