Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag on Monday took to Twitter to share pictures of himself with his sisters Anju and Manju on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. Anju and Manju can be seen tying Rakhi to Sehwag in the pictures. Sehwag further wished everyone a Happy Rakshabandhan and called himself 'half Ganju (bald)' to rhyme the last line of the tweet.
