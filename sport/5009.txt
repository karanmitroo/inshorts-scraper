Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova pulled out of the Wimbledon qualification round due to a muscle tear that she sustained during last month's Italian Open. Sharapova was looking to make a return to Grand Slam tennis after returning from a 15-month ban for taking the banned drug meldonium. Sharapova had been denied a wild card entry at 2017 French Open.
