Sri Lankan tail-ender Lahiru Kumara got clean bowled by South African pacer Vernon Philander in the ongoing Cape Town Test. Kumara misjudged the line of the ball and attempted to leave an inswinger, which eventually crashed into the leg stump. Sri Lanka got bowled out for 110 in their first innings as Philander claimed four wickets.
