In his soon-to-be-released autobiography, South African captain AB de Villiers has said Virender Sehwag's 319 against South Africa in Chennai in 2008 remains the "best Test innings" he's seen. He said, "It was just magnificentâ€¦ Viru kept stepping away to leg and hitting inside out through the covers for four. You don't do that in Test cricket, but Viru did."
