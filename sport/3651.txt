Germany's top tier football club Hamburg's Nicolai Muller injured his right knee while celebrating his goal against Augsburg in the opening match of the Bundesliga season on Saturday. Muller scored with a near-post finish before running towards the corner flag where he jumped and spun in celebration, landing awkwardly to injure himself. Muller was later substituted by his side.
