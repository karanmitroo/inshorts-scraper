Following her 7th Wimbledon singles title and 22nd Grand Slam overall, world number one Serena Williams has featured in a video reciting late American poet Maya Angelou's "Still I Rise". After her Wimbledon final victory, the 34-year-old had said, "I didn't come from any money or anything, but I did have a dream and... hope. That's really all you need".
