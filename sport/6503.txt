Former Australian cricketer Brad Hodge has shared an apology note on Twitter, after commenting earlier that Virat Kohli skipped the Dharamsala Test against Australia to save himself for the IPL, which starts next week. Hodge, who coaches the Rajkot IPL franchise Gujarat Lions, was slammed on Twitter for his remarks, with Amitabh Bachchan also tweeting against him.
