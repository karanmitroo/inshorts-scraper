Jasprit Bumrah bowled three beamers against England in the first ODI but he was not punished for it. According to rules, if a bowler bowls two dangerous waist-high full tosses in an innings, he should be taken off the attack but in case of Bumrah, the beamers were not considered dangerous by the umpires and hence he was not warned.
