Former Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More became the first and only wicketkeeper in Test cricket history to effect five stumpings in an innings, achieving the feat in a Test against West Indies on January 15, 1988. Notably, in the same match, India's Narendra Hirwani registered Test cricket's best-ever debut bowling figures of 16/136.
