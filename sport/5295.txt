Barcelona forward Lionel Messi's 21-month jail sentence for tax fraud has been confirmed by Spain's Supreme Court. Messi and his father were sentenced last year, the appeal for which has now been turned down. However, the two are unlikely to go to jail, since Spanish law allows sentences under two years to be served under probation.
