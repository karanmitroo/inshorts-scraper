Former Indian fast bowler Ashish Nehra, who is commentating in the ongoing India-Sri Lanka Test at Kolkata, said the Indian cricket team members laughed when they saw him in a suit. "It's a different experience and job with long hours. I'm getting used to it," Nehra said about his new role. Nehra had retired from international cricket on November 1.
