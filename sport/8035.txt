Shuttler Jwala Gutta has questioned the selection process for Padma awards after being overlooked for the honour. In a Facebook post, Jwala wrote, "I have been playing for this country for more than 15 years now..and have won so many prestigious tournaments...but I guess it's never enough..why cos I am outspoken...you need recommendations, recommendations that you deserve an award."
