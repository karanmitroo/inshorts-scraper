Indian pacer Mohammed Shami troubled Joe Root through the 87th over before dismissing him on the final ball. Shami bowled a mixture of in-swingers and out-swingers to beat Root multiple times in the over. Root was trapped on the pads on the last ball and was adjudged out by the on-field umpire, as well as the TV umpire on review.
