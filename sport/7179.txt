Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has said Virat Kohli is "human and had to fail one day". "He failed in both innings in Pune...In the second innings, I think the game was already over. A 441-run target was a humongous task. Kohli will come back because he is a class act. His record against Australia is unreal," said Ganguly.
