Athletics Federation of India officials borrowed high definition footage from a Japanese team member to check false starts during the 100-metre event at the Asian Athletics Championships in Odisha. AFI officials alleged the equipment employed was fail-proof but following a complaint by Malaysia's Khairul Hafiz, the Japanese footage was checked. Two athletes were disqualified for false starts.
