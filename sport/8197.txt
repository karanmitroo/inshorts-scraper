ESPN commentator Doug Adler has been dropped after he allegedly called US tennis player Venus Williams a 'gorilla' during the Australian Open on Wednesday. Adler apologised, claiming he used the word 'guerilla' instead of 'gorilla' for Williams. "Because the words gorilla and guerilla are pronounced similarly, it's impossible to say for certain which word Adler spoke," said ESPN.
