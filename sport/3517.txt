After Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor's 'Fight of the Millennium', a Twitter user created a meme showing the duo in a still from the movie 'Titanic', captioning it, "They're both kings of the world." Another user posted a picture of the fighters, captioned, "When you realise you've made more money in one night than most people make in a lifetime."
