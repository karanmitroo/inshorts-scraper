Indian tennis player Sania Mirza's attire on the court has been branded as 'sexual' and unIslamic by a religious cleric on the national television. "If a sport requires women to drop their burqas, then women should not take part in the sport," said the cleric. The cleric even said, "Women are not meant to wrestle," during the debate.
