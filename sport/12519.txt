Actor Salman Khan launched tennis player Sania Mirza’s autobiography ‘Ace Against Odds’ in Mumbai on Sunday. Talking about Sania, Salman said, ”I think it is new and different. People do not achieve what she has achieved even if they have to be born in three lifetimes.” Shah Rukh Khan had earlier launched the book on July 13 in Hyderabad.
