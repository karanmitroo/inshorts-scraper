Tokyo's Kasumigaseki Country Club, which is due to host the golf event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has agreed to give women full membership after it was accused of sexism. The International Olympic Committee had asked the Organising Committee to look for another venue if the course continued its "discriminatory policy", which was against the Olympic Charter.
