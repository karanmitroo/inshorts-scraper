Retired Women's NBA champion Candice Wiggins has claimed that 98% of the players in the league are homosexuals and she was harassed during her eight-year-long WNBA career for being heterosexual. "At the end of the day, it made me stronger. If I had not had this experience, I wouldn't be as tough as I am", Wiggins said about the experience.
