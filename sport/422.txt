India fielding coach R Sridhar has said MS Dhoni's wicketkeeping style should be researched. Adding that Dhoni is the best glovesman as far as keeping for spinners is concerned, he added, "His hands work at the speed of lightning for stumpings." "He is unique in his own way and that is exactly how cricketers should be," he further said.
