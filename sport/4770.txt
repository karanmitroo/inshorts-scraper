Former cricketer Ravi Shastri has reportedly said he will apply for the post of Indian cricket team's head coach only if he is guaranteed selection. This comes after Shastri underwent the selection process last year, but did not get the job. BCCI has invited more applications for the coach's post after Anil Kumble refused to extend his tenure.
