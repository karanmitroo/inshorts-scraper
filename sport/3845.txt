Former England captain Kevin Pietersen revealed that his exit from the national side after the Ashes 2013-14 helped him save his marriage. Pietersen, who captained England in three Tests and 12 ODIs in 2008, also said the tenure was the 'worst year of his life'. Pietersen said that he is now happy spending time with his wife and kids.
