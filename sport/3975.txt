India ended the first day of the Colombo Test at 344/3, driven by Cheteshwar Pujara's 13th and Ajinkya Rahane's ninth Test century. Earlier in the day, Lokesh Rahul scored his sixth consecutive Test fifty, equalling the record of most straight Test 50s by an Indian. Pujara, who crossed 4,000 Test runs, became the joint third-fastest Indian to achieve the feat.
