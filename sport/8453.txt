Perth Scorchers' Ashton Agar sprinted back from inside the 30-yard circle to take a catch inches before the boundary rope dismissing Brisbane Heat's Joe Burns in the Big Bash League. Burns had mistimed a short ball off Andrew Tye which went flying towards the long-on and was caught by Agar who balanced his run well not to cross the boundary.
