Lionel Messi's Argentina teammate Angel Di Maria revealed he saw a psychologist to cope with the hurt caused by "jokes and memes" sent to the team. His comments come in reference to Argentina reaching three consecutive major finals but failing to win any. "Thanks to (the psychologist) I learned it is easy to laugh behind a computer," he added.
