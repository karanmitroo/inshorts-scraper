Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker has said that Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova has paid her dues and deserves a second chance when she returns to tennis at the end of her 15-month doping ban. Five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova is set to return to tennis in April in Stuttgart, where she has won a title on three occasions.
