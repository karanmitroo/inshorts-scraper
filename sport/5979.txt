Cristiano Ronaldo's six-year-old son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr, scored a free kick in a junior football match in Spain, the video of which was shared by the Real Madrid winger on Instagram. Ronaldo Jr won the foul and took a stance similar to his father's before taking the kick and scoring. "So proud of my little man...what a goal," wrote Ronaldo.
