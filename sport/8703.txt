Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar posted a message for MS Dhoni on Twitter, saying it's a day to celebrate the latter's successful captaincy, shortly after he stepped down as India's limited-overs captain. Sachin, who played under Dhoni's captaincy during India's 2011 World Cup triumph, had earlier rated Dhoni as the best captain he had played under during his 22-year career.
