Two England supporters have received lifetime bans for making Nazi gestures during a friendly against Germany in Dortmund in March, the Football Association has revealed. One fan did a Nazi salute, while the other mimicked an Adolf Hitler moustache with his finger, making a cut-throat gesture towards Germany. Few England fans also sang songs about the two World Wars.
