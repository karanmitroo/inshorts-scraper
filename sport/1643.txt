England's Ben Stokes and Alex Hales have been named in England's squad for the upcoming ODI series against Australia, months after being suspended for his involvement in a brawl outside a pub in Bristol. A video had emerged showing Stokes punching a man outside a Bristol pub, following which he was provisionally suspended, effectively becoming unavailable for the ongoing Ashes.
