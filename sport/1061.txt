Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's son Arjun, in a recent interview in Australia, stated that England all-rounder Ben Stokes and Australian pacer Mitchell Starc are his role models. The 18-year-old left-arm pacer further revealed that he loved bowling fast from his childhood and took up fast bowling as there "aren't many fast bowlers in India".
