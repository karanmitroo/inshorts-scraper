Former Pakistani player Javed Miandad has blamed the Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal on the comeback of fixing-accused player Mohammad Amir. "In a population of 20 million people, PCB insisted on recalling Mohammad Amir...When you set such examples what do you expect from others," said Miandad. Two players were provisionally suspended for  spot fixing in PSL on Friday.
