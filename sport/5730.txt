The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked BCCI to select the Indian cricket team for the ICC Champions Trophy, which begins from June 1. The deadline for the selection was April 25 but BCCI did not announce its squad to protest against ICC's decision to implement a new financial model which would result in revenue loss for BCCI.
