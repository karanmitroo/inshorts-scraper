For the first time in IPL history, a team's all 10 wickets were out caught during Delhi Daredevils' match against Rising Pune Supergiant in Pune on Tuesday. Of all 10 Pune dismissals, three were caught behind, while other catches were claimed by outfielders. This was also the 10th such instance in T20s, while it has never happened in T20 internationals.
