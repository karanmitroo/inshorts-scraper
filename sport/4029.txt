The Oval, which is hosting its 100th Test match, once had an elephant brought onto the grounds on the day Ganesh Chaturthi was being celebrated during India's 1971 tour of England. Then India captain Ajit Wadekar, who called sighting the elephant a good omen, went into the pavilion and prayed to Lord Ganesha for India's win.
