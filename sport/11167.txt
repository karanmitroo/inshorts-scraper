Reacting to Shikhar Dhawan's early dismissal in the second Test, a user tweeted, "Thank you Shikhar Dhawan, because of you even our number 3 batsmen can become competent openers." Another tweet read, "A biopic on Shikhar Dhawan will just be a montage of him wearing pads, going to the field and coming back immediately, played in a loop."
