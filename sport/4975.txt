Golden State Warriors have been crowned NBA Champions for the fifth time after defeating LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in the best-of-seven NBA Finals on Tuesday. Kevin Durant, playing his first season as a Warrior, was named the Finals' Most Valuable Player. Notably, this was the first-ever instance in NBA history that the same teams reached Finals for three straight seasons.
