In a first, three jetmen Yves Rossy, Vincent Reffet and Fred Fugen, flew in formation with eight of the Patrouille de France (PAF) Alpha Jets aerobatic display team. The trio, flying a set of rigid jet-propelled wings weighing 150 kg each, jumped from a helicopter before swooping alongside the eight jets and was able to keep pace with the jets.
