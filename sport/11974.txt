The fourth Test between England and Pakistan, Test cricket's first ever forfeited match, finished on August 20, 2006. Umpire Darrell Hair docked five runs and changed the ball after claiming that Pakistan had tampered with it, following which Pakistan refused to resume play. By the time Pakistan decided to resume, the umpires had awarded the match to England.
