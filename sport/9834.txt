Andy and Jamie Murray became the first brothers to hold the top ranks in singles and doubles simultaneously. Andy ended as 2016's top-ranked player after his World Tour Finals' title, while Jamie and Bruno Soares ended as the year's top-ranked pair. Jamie was assured the top-rank following the year-end tournament's top-seeded pair Nicholas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert's round-robin stage exit.
