India women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj snapped at a reporter who asked her who her favourite male cricketer was at a pre-Women's World Cup event in London on Thursday. "Do you ask the same question to a male cricketer? Do you ask them who their favourite female cricketer is... You should ask them that," Mithali said.
