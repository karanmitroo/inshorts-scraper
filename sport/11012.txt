The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has asked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to set up an independent body for testing athletes, and also promised 'substantial additional powers' to WADA. A meeting of world sports leaders was held at the IOC headquarters in Switzerland on Saturday, calling for a "more robust, more efficient, more transparent and more harmonised" anti-doping system.
