Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova has blamed the International Tennis Federation for not warning her that a drug she had been taking had been banned. "Why didn't someone come up to me and have a private conversation...just an official to an athlete," said Sharapova. Following a positive dope test at the 2016 Australian Open, Sharapova was banned for 15 months.
