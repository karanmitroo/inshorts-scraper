Reacting to Sri Lankan night-watchman Malinda Pushpakumara getting bowled while playing a reverse sweep, commentator Sunil Gavaskar recalled a Hindi saying, "Apni aukaat bhool gaye". Gavaskar explained that he believes top-order batsmen can attempt such a shot, but when one is a night-watchman and cannot play the traditional sweep shot, he must not attempt a shot like this.
