Germany's Foreign Office issued a travel advisory to its citizens living in Canada on Twitter, asking them to be "nice" to the Canadians and "give hugs". This comes after Germany's ice hockey team defeated nine-time Winter Olympics champions Canada 4-3 in the men's semi-finals. "Just imagine how you'd feel if Canada beat us in soccer," read part of the tweet.
