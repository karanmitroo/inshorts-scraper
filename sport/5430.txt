Harbhajan Singh has written a letter to Anil Kumble, asking for his intervention in increasing the match fees of Ranji Trophy cricketers. A Ranji player is paid ₹1.5 lakh for a first-class game, whereas a Test player gets ₹15 lakh. Kumble will make a presentation to the Committee of Administrators on May 21 for a pay hike for BCCI-contracted cricketers.
