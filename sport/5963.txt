Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale scored two same own goals against Norwich in England's second-tier football league, the Championship, on Friday, as his team lost 0-2 and failed to secure the title. Both goals came in the first half, with shots rebounding off the post and then Stockdale to find the net. Brighton need one win to seal the Championship title.
