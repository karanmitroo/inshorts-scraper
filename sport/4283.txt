As many as 54,250 fluorescent-yellow tennis balls are used at the Wimbledon Championships every year. The balls, which are made of materials from 11 countries and four continents, are manufactured in Bataan in the Philippines. The yellow balls were introduced by the ITF (International Tennis Federation) in 1972 but up until 1986, Wimbledon continued to use the traditional white ball.
