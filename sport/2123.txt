Reacting to former Indian pacer Ajit Agarkar's comments that he should be replaced in the Indian T20I squad, Mahendra Singh Dhoni said, "Everybody has views in life and it should be respected." The 36-year-old added that what keeps him motivated is representing the national team. Dhoni has scored 169 runs in 10 T20I matches this year.
