Senior BCCI official Rajeev Shukla has said the Board is considering launching a mini edition of the IPL in Dubai. "We have seen that there is huge attraction for IPL overseas. Earlier, we used to stage our Champions League T20 abroad and that slot is still vacant. We are thinking of a mini edition in that slot," said Shukla.
