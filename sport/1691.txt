England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow was gifted wicketkeeping gloves signed by his late father David Bairstow by a fan named Andrew Johns ahead of the third day of the Ashes Test in Adelaide. David, who was also a wicketkeeper, had given the gloves to Johns 39 years ago after the latter won a quiz during England's tour of Australia.
