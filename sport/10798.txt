The coronial inquest investigating cricketer Phil Hughes' death has been asked to clarify the definition of "unfair bowling" from cricket's lawmakers, following an analysis by ICC umpires' training manager Simon Taufel. Taufel revealed 20 of 23 short balls bowled on the day of Hughes' death were directed at the cricketer, but didn't meet the definition of a "fast short-pitched delivery".
