Inzamam-ul-Haq got out obstructing the field during an ODI against India on February 6, 2006, and later claimed that he did not know the exact rule. Haq was given out after India appealed following him blocking a Suresh Raina throw at the striker's end. Haq became the second Pakistani batsman to get out obstructing the field in an ODI.
