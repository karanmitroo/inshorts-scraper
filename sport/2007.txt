Australian wicketkeeper Tim Paine has been recalled to the national side after seven years, after being included in the 13-man squad for the first two Ashes Tests against England. Paine said he would visit his parents' house to fetch his Australian team cap, the 'Baggy Green', which he would have to "dust off". Paine last played a Test in 2010.
