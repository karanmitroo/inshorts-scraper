Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather defended US President Donald Trump for his 'grab them by the p****' remarks, saying that is how "real men" speak. Mayweather further said that the comments made by Trump were an example of locker room talk. Trump had made the comments in a 2005 interview but the recording had resurfaced during his election campaign in 2016.
