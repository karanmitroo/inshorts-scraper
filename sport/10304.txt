Indian Test captain Virat Kohli became the only bowler to take a wicket on 'zeroth' delivery of his T20I career by dismissing England's Kevin Pietersen with a wide ball in 2011. Pietersen was stumped by Dhoni after Kohli, who was bowling for the first time in T20Is, bowled a wide down the leg stump.
