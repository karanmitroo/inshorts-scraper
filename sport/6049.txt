Following their 122-run stand against Gujarat Lions on Tuesday, Royal Challengers Bangalore openers Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle became the first pair to register ten century partnerships in T20 cricket. The duo achieved the feat batting together for the 60th time in the format. The highest partnership the pair achieved was an unbeaten 204-run stand against Delhi Daredevils in 2012.
