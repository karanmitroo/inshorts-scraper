Pacer S Sreesanth has filed a petition in the Kerala High Court to revoke the life ban imposed on him by BCCI for the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. BCCI is yet to lift the ban, despite a Delhi court giving him a clean chit in 2015. Recently, he was denied an NOC by BCCI to play in Scotland and Kerala.
