In a unique coincidence, Switzerland's Roger Federer, who was born on August 8, won a record 8th Wimbledon title with his 8th ace of the final, in which he lost only 8 games. It was Federer's 11th career Wimbledon final, where he registered his 1,111th career win, beating Croatia's Marin Cilic, who himself was playing in his 11th Wimbledon tournament.
