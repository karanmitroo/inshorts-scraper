Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has been appointed as the new Wales manager replacing Chris Coleman, who led Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals but resigned in November to coach English club Sunderland. Giggs ended his 24-year-long playing career in 2014, having played 963 matches for Manchester United and winning 13 Premier League and two Champions League titles.
