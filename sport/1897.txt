South Africa's Supreme Court on Friday increased the murder sentence of former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius to 13 years and five months after the state argued that his original sentence of six years was "shockingly lenient". The athlete was imprisoned in July last year after being found guilty of murdering his girlfriend and model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013.
