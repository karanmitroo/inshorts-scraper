South African pacer Dale Steyn trolled Indian captain Virat Kohli over his Instagram post about doing single-handed push-ups. "Impressive bud! But how many no hand push-ups can you do...? Haha," Steyn commented on Kohli's post. "Rest day is a cheat day, never stop working hard," Kohli had captioned an earlier photo on Instagram which showed him in a gym.
