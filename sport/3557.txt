Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Najam Sethi on Thursday announced the World XI squad that will tour Pakistan for three T20 matches in September. The 14-member strong team does not include any Indian as the BCCI had not given clearance. Faf du Plessis will lead the World XI, which includes five players from South Africa, including Hashim Amla.
