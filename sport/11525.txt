International Cricket Council's chief executive David Richardson has said that the governing body does not wish to get involved in the ongoing tussle between the Lodha Committee and the BCCI. Richardson claims that BCCI chief Anurag Thakur had earlier requested ICC to shield BCCI from applying the Lodha Committee recommendations, which have been forced upon it by the Supreme Court.
