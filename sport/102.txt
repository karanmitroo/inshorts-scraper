Around 35 female football fans were arrested for trying to attend a football match between Esteghlal and Persepolis in Iran's capital Tehran on Thursday. Women are barred from attending football matches in Iran since 1979. The detained women reportedly wanted to draw attention of FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Sports Minister Masoud Soltanifar, who were present there.
