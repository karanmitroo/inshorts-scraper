Australian captain Steve Smith, currently on a break in the USA, posted an Instagram video of his baseball net session. Almost a year ago, Smith had taken batting tips from MLB side Boston Red Sox's star Dustin Pedroia. "[Smith] looked good, anytime you can come out and hit balls like that, without doing it, it's pretty impressive," Pedroia said.
