Legendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled by Australian umpire Darrell Hair seven times in three overs for chucking the ball, on December 26, 1995. Muralitharan, however, was allowed to bowl by the other umpire when he changed ends. Muralitharan was no-balled again by another Australian umpire in 1999, after which play was delayed due to protests by Sri Lankan players.
