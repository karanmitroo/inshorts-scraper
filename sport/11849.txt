FIFA President Gianni Infantino has revealed his annual salary will be less than $2 million, almost half of what ex-Chief Sepp Blatter earned. Blatter, who was suspended on corruption charges, reportedly earned $3.6 million in 2015. Infantino, who took over as Chief in February, is yet to finalise the terms. He described FIFA compensation committee as "insulting and completely arbitrary".
