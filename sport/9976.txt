Japanese baseball player Shohei Otani hit the ball through the roof of the Tokyo Dome during a match on Sunday. Japan was playing the Netherlands in an exhibition match when the 22-year-old pierced the 60m high ceiling of the stadium with the baseball. The same feat was achieved in 2002 as well by another Japanese player.
