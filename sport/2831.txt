Welsh rugby international Scott Baldwin's hand was bitten by a lion during a pre-match visit to a game park recently in South Africa. The 29-year-old, who got bitten while trying to pet a lion, was called "stupid" by his coach. "Should've known he wouldn't be impressed with me stroking his lioness before introducing myself to him," Baldwin tweeted.
