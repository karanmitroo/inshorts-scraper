As per reports, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has claimed losing $100 million since 2007, due to India's refusal to play bilateral cricket. The Board has also accused India of not honouring its commitment to play six series between 2015 and 2022, for which it signed an MoU with the PCB. India last played a Test in Pakistan in 2006.
