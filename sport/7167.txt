Spectators jeered batsman Saurabh Tiwary during Jharkhand's Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Services in Kalyani on Tuesday, since they wanted to see his teammate MS Dhoni bat. Saurabh, who scored 102*, was subjected to chants of 'Saurabh Tiwary haye haye' since he was not getting out. "We must understand that they're emotional as Mahi bhai never played here," said Saurabh.
