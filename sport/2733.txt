PM Narendra Modi ended up felicitating former footballer Magan Singh when former Indian goalkeeper Bhaskar Ganguly's name was called during the ceremony ahead of India's FIFA U-17 World Cup opener on Friday. The announcer kept on addressing Singh as 'Bhaskar da' while Singh was presented with a shawl and a memento. Bhaskar was later felicitated privately during the half-time break.
