Russian athlete Darya Klishina was branded a 'traitor' for agreeing to compete under a neutral flag in the upcoming Rio Olympics. The International Association of Athletics Federation has not allowed 67 others who sought exemptions after the ban on Russia’s athletics team for “state-sponsored” doping. Klishina could be the only Russian track-and-field athlete to compete in this year's Olympics.
