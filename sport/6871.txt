Reacting to Aakash Chopra's prediction of India winning the third Test, former Australian cricketer Dean Jones tweeted, "Already you guys are a little spooked! The team and the Indian media reactions in the last Test show it! #beafraid #wearecoming #indvaust." Chopra responded to Jones, posting, "Can I ask for some help from the dressing room to review this one please?"
