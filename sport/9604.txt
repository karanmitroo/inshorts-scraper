International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has launched an online portal which will allow people to submit evidence or suspicion of doping. It will also allow people to report knowledge of coaches who encourage cheating, trafficking of banned substances and new doping products. The portal is available on IAAF's homepage in six languages and allows anonymous submission of data.
