Ex-world number five Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard took to Instagram to share a picture of herself with a cricket bat gifted to her by BBL side Hobart Hurricanes. "Proud new owner of a cricket bat! Have no idea what to do with it, as per the confusion on my face," wrote Bouchard, who is in Hobart for a tournament.
