Speaking at the post-match press conference, Virat Kohli said he was surprised to hear the cheer by England players when they won the toss. "You still have to go out and win the game. We got motivated by that actually," Kohli added. Winning the toss and batting on the opening day is considered as a big advantage in Indian conditions.
