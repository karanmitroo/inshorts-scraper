England defeated Pakistan by 44 runs (Duckworth-Lewis method), to register their ninth victory in the last ten matches against Pakistan, in the rain-hit first ODI on Wednesday. Chasing a target of 260, England had scored 194/3 in the 35th over, before rain interrupted play. The match was later called off, with England 44 runs ahead of the revised D/L target.
