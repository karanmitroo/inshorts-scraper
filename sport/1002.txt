Australia's Bernard Tomic on being asked about his failure to qualify for the Australian Open 2018, said, "I just count money, that's all I do. I count my millions." Last year, Tomic had admitted that he has no love for the game, instead, it is like a job and he feels "trapped". Tomic was ranked world number 17 in 2016.
