Italy's Serie A club Genoa's assistant coach Marco Pellegri broke down into tears in the dugout after watching his 16-year-old son Pietro become the league's youngest brace scorer following his goals against Lazio. "The day Pietro steps out at Marassi wearing a Genoa shirt I can go ahead and die," Marco had said about witnessing his son play for Genoa.
