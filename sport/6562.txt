Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was saved by India's DRS review on the first ball of the day on Monday. Jadeja, continuing his innings at 16, was given out for getting caught behind off a Pat Cummins delivery before he decided to take a review. The review showed that the ball did not have any contact with Jadeja's bat.
