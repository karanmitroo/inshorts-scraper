Brazilian authorities are investigating possibilities of a terror threat to the Rio Olympics, after an unknown Brazilian Islamist group pledged allegiance to ISIS. Security was upped after the terror attack in Nice, with increased checks and cordoning. About 85,000 soldiers and security personnel are being deployed for the Games, which is more than twice the number at the London Olympics.
