Indian-origin wrestler Jinder Mahal, assisted by The Great Khali, defeated Randy Orton in WWE's third Punjabi Prison match on Sunday to retain the WWE Championship title. This was the third successful title defence for Jinder Mahal after winning the championship in May this year. The Punjabi Prison, started by Khali, involves the wrestlers being trapped in two bamboo cages.
