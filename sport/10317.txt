Iran's football federation has been fined £37,000 (nearly ₹30 lakh) by FIFA after fans were asked to wear black and sing religious chants during a World Cup qualifier match. The match was played a day before Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram. Football's international governing body said the fine was imposed due to "several religious manifestations" during the match.
