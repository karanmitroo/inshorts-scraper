England devised the 'bodyline' bowling tactic to counter Don Bradman's batting, during their Australia tour for the 1932-33 Ashes. The tour, which started on December 2, 1932, came to be known as the Bodyline series for its controversial bowling tactics. Bodyline involved bowling a short, fast-pitched delivery on the line of leg stump, which was physically threatening for the batsmen.
