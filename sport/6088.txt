Delhi Daredevils' Sanju Samson saved a shot by Kolkata Knight Riders' Manish Pandey from going over the long-on boundary during their IPL match on Monday. Samson pulled off a mid-air catch and flicked the ball back before falling outside the boundary line, saving four runs for DD as KKR could just take two runs due to his effort.
