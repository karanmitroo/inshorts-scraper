Kay and Joe O’Regan, both 80 years old, ran a 42-km marathon in Ireland on the occasion of their 57th wedding anniversary. While it was Kay’s 113th marathon, Joe ran his 29th, with this one being the couple’s last. The couple started running marathons when both of them turned 50 and debuted at the London Marathon 30 years ago.
