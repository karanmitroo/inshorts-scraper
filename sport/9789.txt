Indian pacer Mohammed Shami has explained how he set up Alastair Cook and Joe Root's dismissals in the Vizag Test. "I kept swinging the ball away from Cook consistently and got one to in-swing and take him by surprise...With Root, I wanted to bluff him by showing the field for a bouncer and make him play a drive," said Shami.
