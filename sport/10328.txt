World football's governing body FIFA is set to cut off cash flow to the national football associations (FAs) which are unable to meet the basic standards of transparency. FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated that the body is strictly monitoring the 211 member associations so that they use the money properly. Currently, FIFA has blocked funding to 23 associations.
