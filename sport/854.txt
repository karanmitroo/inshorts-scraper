New Zealand's Colin Munro, the world's top-ranked T20I batsman, was stranded on 49* in the seven-wicket win over Pakistan on Monday. He missed equalling Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum's world record of scoring 50+ scores in four consecutive T20Is. Munro, who hit three fours and two sixes, was adjudged Man of the Match for the T20I.
