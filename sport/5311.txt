Omar Hegazy, a 26-year-old Egyptian banker, has become the first amputee to swim from Egypt to Jordan. He crossed a 20-kilometre stretch in Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba in under nine hours recently to raise awareness about people enduring mental and physical disabilities. Hegazy lost his left leg two years ago in a motorcycle accident.
