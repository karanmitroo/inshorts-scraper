Base jumper Quentin Lucon held a burger in his mouth while jumping off a mountain in the Valais region of Chamoson, Switzerland. Lucon, who has done over 350 base jumps, was dared by his friend to eat a burger while jumping. Notably, at one point the burger's bun gave away, leaving lettuce and bread flying through the air.
