Kings XI Punjab's Sandeep Sharma pulled off a one-handed catch to dismiss Delhi Daredevils' Shreyas Iyer off his own bowling in the IPL on Sunday. The 23-year-old pacer stayed low in his follow-through and dived to his left to complete the catch with his left hand. Sharma went on to take 4/20 to record his T20 career's best bowling figures.
