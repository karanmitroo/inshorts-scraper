The record for the best-ever bowling figures in Tests, set by late England off-spinner Jim Laker, on July 31, 1956, has been unbroken for 61 years. Laker registered the first-ever 10-wicket haul and best bowling figures in a Test innings, taking 10/53 against Australia. His figures of 19/90, recorded in the same match, are the best bowling figures in Tests.
