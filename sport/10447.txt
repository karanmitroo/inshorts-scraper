Cricketer Liam Thomas continued fielding after losing his artificial leg while playing for England against Pakistan in the ICC Academy Dubai Invitational Twenty20 final. Fielding at deep-backward square-leg, Thomas dived to stop a sweep going for four but his artificial leg came loose. Thomas got back up and hopped over to the ball, ignoring the assistance of a team-mate.
