Australian batsmen faced spin bowling in the nets without their front pads on, in preparation for their first Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka starting Sunday. All-rounder Glenn Maxwell revealed former batsman Justin Langer had promoted the method during his stint as Australia's batting coach five years ago. The practice was widely used by former Indian captain Rahul Dravid as well.
