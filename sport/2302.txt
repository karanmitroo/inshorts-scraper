Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has shared a Facebook post dedicated to former Indian pacer Ashish Nehra, who played his last international match on Wednesday. Commending Nehra's honesty, Yuvraj wrote that only a holy book is more honest than the 38-year-old. He further revealed that Nehra used to "shamelessly" use words like 'legendary' to describe his batting skills.
