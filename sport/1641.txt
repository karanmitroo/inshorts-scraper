India Under-19 cricket team's coach Rahul Dravid has said that he has told the Under-19 players that they should aspire to match the level of India's senior team captain Virat Kohli's consistency. "He has already got six double hundreds so far. It's incredible and phenomenal the way Kohli has been playing. He is brilliant in all forms," Dravid added.
