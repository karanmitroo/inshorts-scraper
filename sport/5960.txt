Cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said one can say that Delhi people abuse more than others by looking at him and Virat Kohli. "It just comes naturally...it's the culture and the way we have been brought up...there is a competitive edge and there is nothing wrong with it, as long as it is kept on the field," said Gambhir.
