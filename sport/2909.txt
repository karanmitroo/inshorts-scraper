Several National Football League (NFL) players kneeled during the US national anthem in protest after President Donald Trump criticised players who kneel during the anthem to draw attention to racial injustice. "If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast," Trump tweeted about boycotting the NFL.
