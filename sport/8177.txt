The 1987 World Cup winning Australian cricketers will receive their medals during the innings break of Sunday's ODI match between Australia and Pakistan, almost 30 years after winning the tournament. The side was only awarded the trophy after the tournament as the ICC was not directly involved and the host members were responsible for organising the quadrennial event.
