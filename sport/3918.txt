Indian batsman CK Nayudu once hit a six against Warwickshire in a tour match that reportedly landed in another England county, during India's tour of England in 1932. Nayudu's six came during his innings of 162 on August 5, 1932, and cleared the River Rea which runs by Edgbaston Cricket Ground, and is the border between Warwickshire and Worcestershire counties.
