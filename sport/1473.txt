Sobers Joban, the alleged fixer who made claims about being able to rig elements of the third 2017 Ashes Test, was first red-flagged by the BCCI in 2015. The board's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) had received complaints from domestic cricketers who were allegedly duped by Joban after being promised slots in IPL and Ranji teams in exchange for money.
