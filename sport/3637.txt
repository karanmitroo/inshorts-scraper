American junior welterweight boxer Terence Crawford, fighting in the 63.5 kg division, knocked out Namibia's Julius Indongo on Saturday to become only the second male boxer in history to unify all four major sanctioning organization titles. Crawford, who holds a 32-0 record, defended his WBO and WBC titles while clinching the IBF and WBA titles by knocking out the Namibian.
