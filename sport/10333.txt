Steve Smith was given out LBW by the on-field umpire against South Africa after he was struck on pads while advancing down the wicket. On reviewing, the ball was seen to be clipping leg stump, which was enough to stick with the on-field decision. Interestingly, "Snick-O" meter suggested ball had hit the bat, while "ultra-edge" showed there was no contact.
