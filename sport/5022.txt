Indian middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh hit the winning six after the crowd in the Oval chanted 'we want six' against South Africa on Sunday. Facing JP Duminy in the 38th over, Yuvraj smashed the ball over midwicket to help India reach the semifinals of the Champions Trophy. India have never lost to South Africa in the ICC Champions Trophy.
