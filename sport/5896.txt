Following former world number one Ilie Nastase's comments about the colour of her unborn baby, Serena Williams has shared a post on Instagram calling Nastase's comments racist and backing International Tennis Federation's (ITF) investigation. Nastase, who is being investigated by the ITF, had said, "Let's see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?", at a press conference in Romania.
