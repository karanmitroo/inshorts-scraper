Batsman Cheteshwar Pujara's LBW dismissal in India's second innings on Sunday of the Rajkot Test against England would have been overturned if the player had opted for a DRS review. Pujara was given out on 18 (36) off an Adil Rashid delivery by on-field umpire Kumar Dharmasena, but the ball tracker replays showed the ball pitching outside leg stump.
