Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela declared Wednesday a national holiday, after the country qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in history. Panama defeated Costa Rica 2-1 at home, to secure their spot at Russia 2018. "It is a historic day for the country. Tomorrow will be free for the public and private sector workers," tweeted Varela.
