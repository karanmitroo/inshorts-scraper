Reacting to Portuguese captain Cristiano Ronaldo winning his career's fourth Ballon d'Or award on Monday, a user tweeted, "Ronaldo or Messi would have 9 Ballon D'or if it weren't for the other. Gods amongst men." Another tweet read, "Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or is his 4th has come 8 years after his 1st. Reminds you how long he's been this good."
