Following his removal from the BCCI President post by Supreme Court, Anurag Thakur said that he respects the apex court as any citizen should. "If SC feels BCCI would do better under retired judges then I wish them all the best," added Thakur. Thakur further stated it was not a personal battle for him but for the autonomy of BCCI.
