Ex-India captain and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) President Sourav Ganguly will have a stand named after him at Kolkata's Eden Gardens stadium. The announcement was made after the CAB authorities received permission from the Army, who is the custodian of the property where the stadium is located. A stand will also be named after late BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya.
