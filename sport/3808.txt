Afghanistan hosted its first-ever officially recognised cricket match on Thursday in the form of a One Day between Band-e-Amir and Speenghar, which commenced the Ghazi Amanullah Khan Regional One Day Cup. It was the first match to be played since Afghanistan received the first-class and List A status in February 2017. Notably, Afghanistan was granted Test status in June.
