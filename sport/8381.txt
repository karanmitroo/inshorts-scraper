Gujarat pacer RP Singh was seen snatching and throwing a fan's mobile phone on the ground after he was asked for a selfie on the fourth day of the Ranji final. The fan had extended his arm through the barricades when Singh grabbed the phone. The pacer had reportedly shown the middle finger to a fan earlier in the match.
