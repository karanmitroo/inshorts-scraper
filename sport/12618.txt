Serena Williams' Wimbledon prize money got reduced by $380,000 due to the devaluation of British Pound following 'Brexit'. The prize money is Â£2 million, which was equivalent to $2.97 million on the eve of the referendum, but is now worth $2.59 million. Interestingly, Serena received more dollars for her 2015 Wimbledon title, even when money in pounds was lesser.
