Jamaican sprinter, Usain Bolt has been stripped of his 4x100m gold medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics after his teammate Nesta Carter tested positive for banned substances on re-analysis. The 30-year-old will have to hand back one of his nine Olympic gold medals, losing the record for the triple-triple gold haul, won across three consecutive Olympic events.
