Canadian boxer Brandon Cook defeated his opponent by technical knockout in Montreal recently, but was himself knocked out when a fan threw an ice bucket at him. The referee had declared Cook the winner in the seventh round, following which fans started throwing objects in the ring. The bucket hit Cook when he went to shake hands with his opponent.
