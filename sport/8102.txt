The Supreme Court has asked the BCCI and Centre to propose names for an interim administrative committee for BCCI. This comes after SC, which was supposed to name the administrators on Tuesday, earlier rejected nine names suggested by amicus curiae since they were above 70 years of age. The BCCI President and Secretary were sacked by SC earlier this month.
