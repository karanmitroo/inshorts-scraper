Members of a local team wore the Pakistan cricket team's jersey and played the country's national anthem during a domestic match in central Kashmir's Ganderbal district recently. The Baba Darya Ud Din team stood with their hands on their chest when the anthem played, while an announcement was made for people to stand prior to the anthem.
