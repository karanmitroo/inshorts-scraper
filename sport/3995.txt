India head coach Ravi Shastri has said Virat Kohli will match former skipper MS Dhoni's record as captain. "The way Virat is progressing, he may well catch up with Dhoni. I have been involved with cricket for 35 years as player, commentator and coach. Apart from Sachin Tendulkar, I have never seen anyone break records like Kohli," said Shastri.
