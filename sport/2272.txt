Banned cricketer S Sreesanth has alleged that several players who were involved in the IPL spot-fixing scandal are still playing in the league and international cricket. Sreesanth further claimed that he was made a scapegoat and added, "Teams like CSK and Rajasthan Royals were banned only for two years... Why weren't players from CSK questioned?"
