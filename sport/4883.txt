Delhi batsman Gautam Gambhir, who had an altercation with Delhi coach Bhaskar Pillai during the 2016/17 Vijay Hazare Trophy in Bhubaneswar, has been handed a four-match ban from domestic cricket. Gambhir had alleged that Bhaskar was making youngsters like Nitish Rana, Unmukt Chand and Pawan Negi "insecure" and was "playing with their careers".
