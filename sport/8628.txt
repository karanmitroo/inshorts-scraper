Pakistan lost the Sydney Test against Australia on Saturday to suffer a 0-3 whitewash, their fourth straight in Australia since 1999, and seventh overall in Tests. This was Pakistan's 12th consecutive defeat in the country, the worst-ever performance by a visiting side in Tests. With the loss, their sixth in a row, Pakistan also registered their longest Test losing streak.
