Britain's 22-year-old Adam Peaty broke his own world record for the 50m breaststroke to set a new one at the World Aquatics Championships on Tuesday. Peaty swam the 50m in 26.10 seconds, eclipsing the 26.42 seconds he produced at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. Notably, Peaty also won Britain a gold in the 100 metres breaststroke.
