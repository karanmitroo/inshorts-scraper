After India coach Ravi Shastri shared a picture of himself with Cheteshwar Pujara and a leopard statue, a user wrote, "Make this leopard run after Pujara, his running will automatically improve." Other tweets read, "Ghumne gaye ho ya match jeetne, We lost the series like tracer bullet," and, "Ask Hardik Pandya to ground his bat in. This is basic coaching."
