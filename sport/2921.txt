A young girl was hit by a baseball travelling at 169 kmph while in attendance at the New York Yankees' home game against the Minnesota Twins last week. The girl was struck by a ball hit by Yankees' Todd Frazier, causing play to be delayed. The youngster received treatment before being transported from the stands and taken to a hospital.
