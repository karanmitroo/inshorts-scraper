Veteran Indian pacer Ashish Nehra, who is retiring from cricket on November 1, has said that he would not play in the IPL as he would not be representing the national team. "People say that I can still play in IPL, but I always trained to play for India. If I am leaving, I will leave completely," Nehra added.
