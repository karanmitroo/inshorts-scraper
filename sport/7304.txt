Umar Akmal claims he can match Indian captain Virat Kohli if only he is promoted to bat at the same position as Kohli in the Pakistani team. Akmal, who has often been accused of not playing to his potential, made the claim after a match-winning performance in Pakistan Super League. Notably, Akmal averages 34.59 in ODIs, while Kohli averages 53.40.
