Former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson, who has played alongside Virat Kohli for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, has said that the Indian skipper's captaincy is like an iron-fisted dictatorship. Watson also said that he admires the way Kohli rallies behind his troops on the field and how he expects the best from the team just like he does from himself.
