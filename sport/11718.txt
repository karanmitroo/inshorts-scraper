Australian cricketers, who are currently playing a five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, interacted with 40 children, who were affected by floods and landslides in the country in May. The event was a part of 'Cricket Cares', Cricket Australiaâ€™s initiative which aims to use the game as an agent of change in society through community work.
