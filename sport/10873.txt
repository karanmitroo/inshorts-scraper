The family members of late Australian batsman Phillip Hughes are unhappy with the testimony given by Alex Kountouris, the physiotherapist of Cricket Australia, during the inquest into the death of the batsman. Kountouris said that Hughes' ignorance of the bowling tactics was partly responsible for the fatal blow during the Sheffield Shield match.
