Reacting to India captain Virat Kohli giving opener Shikhar Dhawan a head massage in the dressing room during the third India-South Africa T20I, a user tweeted, "Kohli transferring his skills to Dhawan. What a captain." Other users wrote, "Kohli giving free massage... and people say he is too arrogant," and, "Kohli apologising to Dhawan for run-out in 1st ODI."
