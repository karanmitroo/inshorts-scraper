Former boxing champion USA's Floyd Mayweather posed with a Republic of Ireland flag to mock his Irish opponent, Conor McGregor. The Irish UFC fighter in response snatched Mayweather's backpack and revealed it had only one wad of cash in it, guessing it was around $5,000. The duo is currently on a four-city tour to promote their upcoming boxing match.
