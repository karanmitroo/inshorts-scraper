India's batting coach Sanjay Bangar has said there is a "void" in the team after coach Anil Kumble's resignation, but the team is "coping well". "We are professionals and such things are part and parcel of any organisation where changes happen. The support staff and the players have shown a lot of professionalism in compartmentalising the issues," said Bangar.
