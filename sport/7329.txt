The sports editor of a major newspaper in Belarus kept the promise of eating his own words after incorrectly predicting the future of an ice hockey team. Vyacheslav Fedorenkov ate the Pressball newspaper with soup after wrongly predicting Dinamo Minsk would not reach the Kontinental Hockey League playoffs. He later said, "I would do anything for my favourite team."
