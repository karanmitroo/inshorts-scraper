The death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes was a "tragic accident" and not a result of a failure to enforce the rules of the game or inadequate safety equipment, an Australian court ruled on Friday. An official said no evidence was found to support the view of Hughes' family that he had died in a "very unsafe workplace".
