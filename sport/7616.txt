Speaking after scoring a double century against Bangladesh, Indian captain Virat Kohli said, "I definitely don't get satisfied when I get a Test hundred, which used to be the case." "I have worked on my fitness as well over the years. I feel like I can go on for longer periods now. I don't feel tired easily," added Kohli.
