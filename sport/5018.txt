BCCI has released a statement that dismisses Indian Express' report claiming that Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman had demanded remuneration for their services as members of BCCI's coach selection committee. The report claimed that the trio, appointed by BCCI's Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, had demanded that their services should not be considered honorary.
