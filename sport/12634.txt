Portugal defeated France 1-0 to win their first ever EURO championship on Sunday. Substitute Eder scored the winner for Portugal in extra time. This was the first ever EURO final to end scoreless at the end of 90 minutes. Notably, Portugal had a tearful Cristiano Ronaldo stretchered off in the first half due to an injury.
