During an interview with Michael Vaughan, Virat Kohli said he left wheat, cold drinks, and desserts  to improve his fitness post a poor IPL in 2012. Stating that he was 11-12 kg heavier than he is now, Kohli added, "My training was horrible, I ate so bad, I was up until late, I was having a drink or two regularly."
