Tyson Fury has voluntarily vacated his WBO and WBA titles to fully focus on his medical treatment and recovery. The professional boxer has not fought since beating Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015 to win his two titles and has admitted taking cocaine to battle depression. The 28-year-old had twice called off his fight against Klitschko in July due to injury.
