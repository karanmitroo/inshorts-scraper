A seven-year-old girl from Atlanta, US, found a stolen Olympic gold medal in trash, belonging to Joe Jacobi, the men's canoe double slalom champion at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The girl later returned the medal to the Olympian, who visited the girl's school. Jacobi had posted about his medal being stolen from his car in June on social media.
