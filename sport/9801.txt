Reacting to James Anderson getting out for a 'king pair' in Vizag, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Jimmy Anderson made me pay tribute to Aryabhatta by getting me out for a King pair in 2011. Today, he too got a King pair. #KarmaBites." A 'king pair' refers to a batsman getting out on his first delivery in both innings of a Test.
