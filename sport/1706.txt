India's first-ever batsman to hit a six in international cricket, Amar Singh, who was born on December 4, 1910, also scored India's first half-century in international cricket. The all-rounder achieved both the feats in India's first-ever Test match in 1932 against England. Notably, Singh was also the first cricketer to take 100 wickets in the Ranji Trophy.
