England's Mason Crane and India's Jasprit Bumrah on Friday became the second and third bowlers in the past two weeks to be denied maiden Test wickets due to overstepping no-balls. After England's Tom Curran did it against David Warner in the MCG Test, Bumrah and Crane missed dismissing Faf du Plessis and Usman Khawaja respectively in their team's respective Tests.
