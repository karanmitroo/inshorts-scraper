A British cycling magazine included a photo caption that described Hannah Noel, a female cyclist, as a "token attractive woman". Noel, who is a member of Hinckley Cycle Racing Club from Leicestershire, said that she was "absolutely gutted and disappointed". The magazine's editor later apologised for the gaffe, blaming a subeditor for adding the caption.
