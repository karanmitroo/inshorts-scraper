India head coach Ravi Shastri, during the post-series press conference, told reporters to "buy the latest Oxford dictionary" to improve vocabulary for describing Virat Kohli's form. "It's not just about averages, it is the way you get runs...and impact those runs have on what the team does. I'd simply say he is the best batsman," Shastri added.
