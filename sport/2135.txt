During the first Test between South Africa and Australia at Cape Town, on 11/11/11 at 11:11, South Africa needed 111 runs to win. The spectators and umpire Ian Gould stood on one leg for the duration of that minute, commemorating "the Nelson of all Nelsons". Interestingly, earlier in the Test, number 11 batsman top-scored for Australia in the second innings.
