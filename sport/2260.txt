Debutant Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj broke down in tears after the national anthem got over ahead of the start of Rajkot T20I against New Zealand on Saturday. The 23-year-old was picked in the playing XI in place of Ashish Nehra, who retired from cricket on November 1. Siraj was handed his debut cap by Indian head coach Ravi Shastri.
