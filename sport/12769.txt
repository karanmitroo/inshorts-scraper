A billboard has been placed in Manchester's city centre which reads, "Manchester, Welcome to Zlatan", after Manchester United's signing of Zlatan Ibrahimović. "I have thoroughly enjoyed my career so far and have some great memories. I am now ready to create more special memories in England", Ibrahimović said after signing for the Red Devils.
