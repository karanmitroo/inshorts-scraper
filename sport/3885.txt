American sprinter Justin Gatlin, who emerged as the champion in Usain Bolt's last race, bowed down in front of the Jamaican after their 100-metre sprint at the IAAF World Championships on Saturday. "I have nothing but respect... Even with me being older than Bolt, he's such an inspiration," said 35-year-old Gatlin. Bolt finished his last solo race with a bronze.
