English batsman Dawid Malan has claimed a Pakistani fan entered the dressing room during the Pakistan Super League final in Lahore last week. The fan, in his mid-teens, was dressed in a "green Pakistani suit" with the Pakistan flag painted on his face, and was requesting for pictures. Over 10,000 security personnel were deployed for the match, with three-layered security.
