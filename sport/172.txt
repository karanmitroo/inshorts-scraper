German side Duisburg's goalkeeper Mark Flekken went inside the goal to drink water and conceded a goal against Ingolstadt. Flekken was going towards the goal after celebrating his team's goal in the 17th minute, which was ruled offside. Unaware of the proceedings, Flekken was still inside the goal when Ingolstadt netted after their keeper re-started the game with a long-ball.
