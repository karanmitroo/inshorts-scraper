Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar said that the Indian team's run of consecutive Test wins under Virat Kohli is amazing and that the team is realising his unfulfilled dream. Speaking about his unfinished dreams, Gavaskar said that he always wanted to get West Indies' batsmen Rohan Kanhai and Garry Sobers out on back-to-back deliveries.
