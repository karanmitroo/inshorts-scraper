Sobers Joban, one of the two alleged match-fixers in the Ashes match-fixing expose by a British tabloid, has played junior level cricket for Delhi. Before Delhi, Joban played for his home state Himachal Pradesh in U-17, U-19 and U-22 age-group. The 31-year-old has claimed that he once played on the same team as current Indian captain Virat Kohli.
