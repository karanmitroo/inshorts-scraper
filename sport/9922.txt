Former Australian cricketers Shane Warne, Michael Slater, and England cricketer Kevin Pietersen are being investigated for not having worn seat-belts while seated inside a moving car. Warne posted a video online in which the trio was seen driving in Hobart. The Tasmanian Police said the matter is "under investigation" and no special treatment will be given to the cricketers.
