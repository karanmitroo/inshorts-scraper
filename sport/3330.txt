Responding to shuttler Saina Nehwal's decision to train with him almost three years after their split, coach Pullela Gopichand said it is nice that she has decided to "come back home". "She's India's top player and someone whom I've trained for 10 years," Gopichand added. The 27-year-old had left Gopichand's academy and moved to Bengaluru to train under Vimal Kumar.
