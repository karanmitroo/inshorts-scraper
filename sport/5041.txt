Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has been fined £30,000 (nearly ₹25 lakh) by the Football Association for his "slap" comments made towards a female reporter in March. Moyes was unhappy with the reporter's question and reportedly told her, "You were just getting a wee bit naughty...just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you’re a woman."
