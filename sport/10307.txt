India's death-overs bowler Jasprit Bumrah said, “You cannot be successful by just bowling yorkers. Nobody can bowl six out of six yorkers...You have to bowl bouncers, mix up the pace”. Speaking about his inspiration for bowling yorkers, Bumrah added, "As I played a lot of tennis ball cricket, I used to watch Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis a lot."
