Former Indian cricketer Chetan Chauhan has said MS Dhoni made a "great sacrifice" for Virat Kohli, stepping down as captain. "He is an elegant and calculative captain. He was fit enough to play for India till the next 50-overs World Cup. Well, now that he has quit, Dhoni has set the platform for Virat Kohli to take over," added Chauhan.
