NBA side Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry did push-ups on a transparent glass floor 37 storeys above the ground at the headquarters of CGTN, China's state broadcaster in Beijing. Curry could manage only three push-ups before rolling away from the glass floor. "Took me 5 mins to gain confidence to walk across this thing," Curry's Instagram video was captioned.
