Former Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has said he feels Indian bowler Ravichandran Ashwin, who was briefly ranked world number one last year, is the best Test spinner in the world. Muralitharan also praised Australia's Nathan Lyon, saying, “He bowls in different conditions which are not very helpful for spin but on the turning wickets, he has taken some wickets.”
