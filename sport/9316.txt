Responding to former Indian cricketer Dilip Vengsarkar's criticism regarding his selection in the ODI squad, India's limited-overs captain MS Dhoni has said that he is keeping himself in shape. Dhoni said, "I've been training and gymming in Ranchi." "Dhoni has retired from Test cricket...also doesn't play Ranji games...how does he keep himself match-fit," Dilip Vengsarkar had earlier said.
