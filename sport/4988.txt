USA captain Michael Bradley scored with a chip from 40 yards out to help the United States earn a 1-1 draw against Mexico in Sunday's World Cup qualifier. Bradley knocked the ball toward Mexico's goal, sprinted to catch up and lofted a right-footed chip from around 40 yards over goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa's outstretched arm and under the crossbar.
