Ajay Reddy, the captain of India's Blind World Cup-winning cricket team said, "Sachin (Tendulkar) sir and PM Narendra Modi are tweeting congratulations, but no one comes out and offers support. We don't need tweets." Reddy pointed out that unlike India, the Pakistani blind cricket team gets regular salaries and is supported by the country's cricket board.
