The Olympic Task Force, set up to prepare an action plan for the next three Olympics, has recommended an emergency quota for athletes and their coaches for train, bus or air tickets. The panel recommended issuing a 'Pradhan Mantri Gold Card' for athletes and their coaches on account of them being "national assets". The recommendation was applicable to para-athletes also.
