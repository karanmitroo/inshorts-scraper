Former Windies captain Darren Sammy has said that leading West Indies cricketers will prefer playing in foreign T20 leagues instead of representing West Indies. "I can't tell a player not to play in a league when it could make them financially stable to look after their family," Sammy said. West Indies only select players if they feature in domestic competitions.
