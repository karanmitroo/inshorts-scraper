Manchester City forward Kelechi Iheanacho, who has scored every 96 minutes so far, has the best goals-to-minutes ratio of any player in Premier League history after his strike in Manchester City's 3-0 win at Hull City on Boxing Day. The 20-year-old has netted 12 English Premier League goals from just 19 shots on target.
