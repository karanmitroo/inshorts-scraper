After American curler Matt Hamilton participated in the mixed doubles event at the Winter Olympics, Twitter users compared his resemblance to video game character 'Mario' and made memes on it. "Every time he throws the stone he should yell ‘WAHOO'," a user wrote. "He should’ve been the flag bearer...it doesn’t get anymore American than this, folks," another tweet read.
