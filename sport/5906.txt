Ukrainian club Dynamo Kiev's fans wore outfits of white supremacist group, Ku Klux Klan, and masks bearing swastikas to welcome a visiting UEFA inspector in their home match against Shakhtar Donetsk on Friday. Earlier, organisers had requested supporters to not cause provocations because the UEFA inspector was surveying the venue's readiness to host the 2018 Champions League final.
