Barcelona forward Neymar crashed his 	£240,000 (₹2 crore) Ferrari 458 Spider on Sunday on the way to Barcelona training ground before their La Liga match against Real Sociedad. Neymar, who escaped unhurt from the accident, reportedly lost control on the road that was wet from overnight rain. He later managed to assist Barcelona's only goal in their draw at Sociedad.
