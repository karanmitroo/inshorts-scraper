The BCCI selection committee Chairman MSK Prasad claimed that MS Dhoni was not pressurised to step down as the limited-overs captain. "It was his personal decision. He informed me during the Ranji Trophy semi-final between Jharkhand and Gujarat," added Prasad. This comes after Cricket Association of Bihar Secretary claimed Dhoni was pressurised to quit by BCCI Joint Secretary Amitabh Choudhary.
