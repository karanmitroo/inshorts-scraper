Former BCCI President N Srinivasan cannot represent the Indian cricket board at the ICC meeting next week as he has been held guilty of conflict of interest, the Supreme Court said on Monday. The Supreme Court allowed BCCI's Acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary to represent the board at the meeting while being accompanied by BCCI CEO Rahul Johri.
