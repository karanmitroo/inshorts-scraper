Khushi, a 13-year-old girl, set a yoga world record in Mysuru recently, performing the Niraalamba Poorna Chakrasana 15 times within a minute. Khushi started doing yoga around three years ago, winning two golds and two silvers at an international event in Vietnam in 2016. Khushi was earlier suffering from respiratory problems, which were cured after she started yoga.
