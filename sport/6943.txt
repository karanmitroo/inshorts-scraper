Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, serving a life ban for spot-fixing, has appealed to the cricket authorities to have his case revisited by the inquiry tribunal set-up to probe into the allegations against Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif. Kaneria said his case was decided in the UK and he remained unsatisfied with the way the hearings were heard.
