Former England captain Kevin Pietersen attempted Ravi Shastri's 'Tracer Bullet Challenge' while commentating in the IPL recently. The league's official Twitter handle shared a video of Pietersen attempting the challenge, with the cricketer retweeting the video. "Morning @RaviShastriOfc. Hope you got back to Mumbai ok last night. My driver drove, 'like a tracer bullet'," he captioned the video.
