After winning his 20th Grand Slam title, world number two Roger Federer said he doesn't think he can win 24 Grand Slam titles. While Federer is the only man to win 20 Grand Slam titles, he trails Steffi Graf (22), Serena Williams (23) and Margaret Court (24) overall. "I didn't think 20 was ever possible to be honest," he added.
