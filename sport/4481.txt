Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who turned 36 on Friday, sported streaked long locks during his early days in Team India. Right after winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup title, Dhoni went completely bald, reportedly because of a "mannat". In 2013, while playing for Chennai Super Kings in the Champions League T20, Dhoni had sported a mohawk.
