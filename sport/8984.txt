Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova on Friday said that she would do everything possible to return to tennis after suffering a hand injury in a knife attack at her home. Kvitova underwent a surgery on her left hand and might take around six months to recover. "I have no choice but to look ahead, and not back," added Kvitova.
