Lionel Messi's 41st career hat-trick helped FC Barcelona register a 4-0 win over Pep Guardiola-led Manchester City on Wednesday. Both sides were reduced to ten-men after City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo's 53rd-minute sending-off for handling the ball outside the goalkeeper area and Jeremy Mathieu's 73rd-minute red card. Barcelona lead Group C with nine points, five ahead of second-placed City.
