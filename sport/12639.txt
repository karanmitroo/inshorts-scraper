Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has said that he wants to enter politics to “serve people”. “I wish to enter politics, however, some well-wishers have advised me against it. In my eyes, a politician is a servant of the people and he should serve people,” said Afridi. The cricketer has retired from Tests and ODIs but continues to play T20s.
