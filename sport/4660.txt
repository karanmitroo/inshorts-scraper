Former world champion Mike Tyson once bit part of opponent Evander Holyfield's ear during a professional boxing match contested on June 28, 1997, for the WBA Heavyweight Championship. The move from Tyson led to his disqualification from the match and suspension from boxing. Notably, in 1986, Tyson had become the youngest heavyweight champion in history.
