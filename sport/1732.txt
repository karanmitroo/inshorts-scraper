Australian batsman Shaun Marsh smashed his first Ashes hundred on Sunday, joining his father Geoff Marsh to become the first father-son pair to hit tons in Ashes. Shaun scored 126* to help Australia declare at 442/8 in the first-ever day-night Ashes Test. Geoff had hit two Ashes centuries in his career, one in 1986 and the other in 1989.
