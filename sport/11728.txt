Former cricketer Virender Sehwag recently took to Twitter to say that he denied television journalist Arnab Goswami's offer asking him to express his views on Britain's Piers Morgan on his news channel. Giving the reason for his denial, Sehwag said, "[T]hat man (Morgan) doesn't deserve any airtime." Notably, Morgan had trolled Indians online for 'wildly' celebrating two Rio Olympics' medals.
