US Open champion Angelique Kerber officially became the oldest woman to debut at number one in the WTA rankings, ending Serena Williamsâ€™ record-tying run of 186 consecutive weeks in the top spot. The 28-year-old is also the first woman from Germany to be ranked number one since Steffi Graf, who has been a mentor for Kerber.
