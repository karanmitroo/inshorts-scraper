Babulal, who set himself on fire after Indian captain Virat Kohli got out for just 5 runs in the first innings of the first South Africa Test, succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday. Babulal was watching the first Test alone in his room when Kohli got dismissed on five runs after which he allegedly poured kerosene and burned himself.
