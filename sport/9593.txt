Colombian club Atletico Nacional, who were to face Brazil's Chapecoense in the Copa Sudamericana final, have requested Chapecoense be named as the tournament's champions after several members of the team died in Monday's plane crash. The Brazilian Football Association has been requested that Chapecoense be exempt from relegation for three years and be allowed free loan signings next season.
