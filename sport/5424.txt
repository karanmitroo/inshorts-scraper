Mumbai Indians have released a video showing fast bowler Kulwant Khejroliya's journey from being a waiter in Goa to be a part of the IPL franchise. Khejroliya had started playing cricket about a year ago. "I didn't tell my family that I was playing cricket. I wasn't good at studies," said the left-arm pacer.
