ICC has announced that the 2020 women's World T20 will be held separately from the men's tournament for the first time. The proposal was put forward by Cricket Australia, hosts for the edition, and accepted at the ICC meeting in Cape Town on Friday. The move is intended to promote the tournament "away from the shadow of the men's game".
