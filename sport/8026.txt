In a rare instance, a bowler named Aled Carey produced the 'perfect over' by taking six wickets in six balls while playing club cricket in Australia. His first wicket was caught at slip, followed by a caught-behind, an LBW and three consecutive clean bowls thereafter. Carey ended the innings with figures of 9 overs for 20 runs, taking 6 wickets.
