Boxer Tyson Fury's license was suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control, following investigation of anti-doping and medical issues. Fury, who surrendered his two world titles on the same day, was accused of cocaine intake after a letter from the Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency was leaked. He had announced his decision to retire last week but reversed it hours later.
