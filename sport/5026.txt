Mercedes' British F1 driver Lewis Hamilton equalled Brazilian legend Ayrton Senna's record of registering 65 career pole positions after grabbing the pole at the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday. Hamilton, who now trails behind Michael Schumacher's tally of 68 pole starts, was presented with a helmet worn by Senna, who died in a crash during an F1 race in 1994.
