Paralympic silver medalist Deepa Malik tweeted and lodged a formal complaint against Air Vistara, for "poor handling" of wheelchair-bound passengers and "ill-mannered" crew. Deepa, a paraplegic, said the airline staff was not trained to shift a person from a seat to a cabin chair and allegedly said "Sweetheart, chill" to her when she was on a call before the flight.
