Ravindra Jadeja went on to appeal for LBW after bowling out Sri Lanka's Suranga Lakmal as the former did not realise the ball had hit the stumps. The incident happened in the final over of the fourth day with the spinner's delivery rattling stumps after hitting Lakmal's bat. Jadeja realised Lakmal was bowled after fielders pointed at the uprooted stump.
