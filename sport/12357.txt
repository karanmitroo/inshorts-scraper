Former Olympian PT Usha on Monday joined running and fitness app Fitso as an advisory head coach. Usha will overview all the training activities on the platform. "I always felt that health and fitness awareness was missing from Indian culture," said Usha. Launched in January, Fitso tracks users' fitness, and helps them to lose weight and reach their fitness goals.
