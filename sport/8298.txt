The Indian and English cricket teams were forced to overstay in Pune due to unavailability of hotel rooms in Cuttack, the venue of the second ODI on Thursday. Reportedly, the teams' hotel was overbooked for a wedding, following which they will arrive in the city on Wednesday. Odisha Cricket Association secretary Ashirbad Behera said such things "couldn't really be helped".
