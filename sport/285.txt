Indian spinner Kuldeep Yadav has claimed that his Instagram account was hacked, after a picture of a half-naked woman was posted on the account. Kuldeep deleted the image a minute after it was uploaded and took to Twitter to apologise for the "unsolicited post". "Iâ€™ll take steps to improve my password protection. Thanks for understanding," he further wrote.
