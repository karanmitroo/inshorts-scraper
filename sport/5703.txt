Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, an RSS affiliate, has written to Sports Minister Vijay Goel demanding the annulment of BCCI's contract with Chinese firm OPPO for sponsoring the Indian cricket team. The organisation, which has launched a campaign to push for indigenous production and consumption of goods, stated, "This would not only misguide our youth in blindly going for buying Chinese brands."
