Former New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming demonstrated his home country's traditional Haka dance to the Indian kabaddi players. He also played kabaddi with Indian player Rakesh Kumar. The Haka, which is done in a group with vigorous movements and rhythmical shouts, is usually performed by New Zealand's national sports teams, with the tradition beginning from the 1888-89 native rugby team.
