Sachin Tendulkar was bowled for 15 in his debut match for India by Waqar Younis, who was also playing his first Test match. While Tendulkar failed to leave an impression, Waqar left with four wickets in the match. Tendulkar, who was wearing a grille-less helmet, was even hit on the face by a bouncer from Waqar later in the series.
