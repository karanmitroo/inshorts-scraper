Iran will issue visas for the US wrestling team to attend the Freestyle World Cup scheduled for February 16-17, reversing an earlier decision to ban the team over President Donald Trump's immigration ban, reports said. This comes after a US federal judge lifted Trump's immigration ban on Friday and allowed people with valid visas to enter the country.
