There is only one instance in cricket history of a team winning a Test off the match's last ball. The winners England, playing against South Africa on December 20, 1948, needed eight from the last over with two wickets remaining. With the scores level, the final ball missed the bat but the single was completed, handing the Englishmen the victory.
