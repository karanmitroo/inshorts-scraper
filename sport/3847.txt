Indian cricketer Abhinav Mukund slammed people who discriminate on the basis of skin colour in a post on Twitter. Abhinav revealed he was subjected to name-calling based on the colour of his skin, saying it was a "mystery" to him why people were "obsessed" with his skin colour. The 27-year-old opener urged people to be comfortable in their own skin.
