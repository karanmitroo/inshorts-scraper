Around 230 Australian cricketers, including national team players, are unemployed after their contracts with Cricket Australia expired on Friday. This comes after Australian Cricketers' Association rejected new contracts being offered by CA, over removal of a clause which guaranteed them a revenue percentage. The players' union will now discuss the boycott of the Australia A tour of South Africa.
