The ball in blind cricket is bigger than the standard ball and is filled with ball-bearings to create sound for the players to detect it. The bowler has to bowl underarm and shout 'Play!' before every delivery. The team is composed of a minimum of four totally blind, minimum of three partially blind and maximum of four partially sighted players.
