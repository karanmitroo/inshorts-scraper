Tottenham striker Harry Kane dressed up as the character Bane from Christopher Nolan-directed Batman: The Dark Knight Rises, for a fancy dress party. The 23-year-old English footballer posted a picture of himself captioned, "Some good guesses and some terrible ones! I'm Bane from Batman - could give Tom Hardy a run for his money!".
