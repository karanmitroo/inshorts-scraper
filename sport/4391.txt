Indian women's doubles player Sania Mirza crashed out of Wimbledon after a 2-6, 4-6 loss against her former partner Martina Hingis and Yung-Jan Chan in the third round. Mirza, playing alongside Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens, had won the Wimbledon women's doubles title in 2015 with Hingis. The Indo-Swiss duo won three Grand Slams and 14 titles before parting ways last year.
