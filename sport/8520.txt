Former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin will run for the post of Hyderabad Cricket Association President. Azhar filed his nomination for the post on Tuesday after the current President became ineligible as per the Lodha reforms. "My basic intention is to see that cricket in Hyderabad flourishes. We cannot run the HCA on the whims and fancies of individuals," said Azhar.
