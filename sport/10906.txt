New South Wales' bowler Sean Abbott, whose short-pitched delivery struck late Australian batsman Phillip Hughes fatally in the neck, has revealed details about the tragedy. Abbott said he tried to comfort Hughes by holding his head's right side after being struck by the ball. Abbott also claimed that he felt tired, dazed and confused for days after the incident.
