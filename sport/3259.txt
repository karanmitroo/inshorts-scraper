England pacer James Anderson has become the third pacer and sixth bowler overall in Test history to take 500 wickets. Anderson achieved the feat after taking his first wicket in Windies' second innings in the third Test at Lord's on Friday. Windies' pacer Courtney Walsh was the first fast bowler to achieve the feat, followed by Australia's Glenn McGrath.
