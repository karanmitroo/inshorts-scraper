Following India's nine-wicket win over Australia in the rain-curtailed first T20I, Indian captain Virat Kohli said that he doesn't really understand the Duckworth-Lewis method. "After getting them down to 118, we thought it would only be 40 or something. 48 was tricky," Kohli said about the revised target India got after the rain delay.
