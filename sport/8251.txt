India's 10-member contingent won six medals finishing third at the Nations Cup in Serbia, despite missing their luggage and being stranded at the airport for 24 hours. The women boxers' flights got cancelled following snowstorms across Europe. They reached the destination a night before the competition, while their luggage, which contained their medical books, came later.
