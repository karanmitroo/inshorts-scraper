Virat Kohli dismissed England's Kevin Pietersen with a wide in a T20I in 2011, becoming the only bowler to take a wicket on 'zeroth' delivery of his T20I career. Bowling for the first time in T20Is in his fifth match, Kohli bowled a wide following which Dhoni stumped Pietersen. Kohli's bowling figures read 0.0-0-1-1 before he bowled a legitimate delivery.
