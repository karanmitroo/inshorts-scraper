Australian captain Steve Smith has become the only player to score 1,000-plus Test runs in the last three calendar years, achieving the feat while bringing up his hundred against Pakistan on Thursday. Smith is now the fourth player in Test cricket to cross the 1,000-run mark for three consecutive years, joining Brian Lara, Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen.
