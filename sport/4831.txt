Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Amir's brother has said that the pacer has made up for his wrongdoing with his performance against India in the Champions Trophy final. "After the spot-fixing scandal happened, we were so ashamed and felt bad about facing people," he said. Amir claimed three wickets in the final, helping Pakistan win their first Champions Trophy title.
