Australia is the only team to lose a Test after forcing the opposition to follow-on, suffering a defeat in this manner on three occasions. The first loss came against England on December 20, 1894, and again against the same opposition in July 1981. The last such instance was the Aussies' 171-run defeat against India in Kolkata in March 2001.
