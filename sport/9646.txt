Mercedes F1 driver Lewis Hamilton reportedly defied team orders during the later stages of Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He was asked by his team Mercedes to drive faster to let teammate Rosberg secure the title, but he refused saying, "I'm losing the...championship so right now I don't...care whether I win(or lose)." Hamilton may face punishment for flouting team orders.
