Afghan cricketer Mohammad Shahzad hit an unorthodox helicopter shot off Mohammad Saifuddin's bowling, which went for a six over deep mid-wicket, giving his Bangladesh Premier League side Rangpur Riders a win over Comilla Victorians. The six also brought up Shahzad's fifty, his second in the tournament. Rangpur Riders are currently 3rd in the BPL points table.
