Barcelona's Neymar is set to miss the El Clasico fixture against Real Madrid on April 23 after being handed a three-match ban for mocking the referee after his red card in Barcelona's 0-2 loss to Malaga. The referee's match report stated that Neymar had 'sarcastically applauded' the fourth official while walking off into the tunnel.
