Eighteen-year-old Australian leg-spinner Lloyd Pope took eight wickets for 35 runs against England on Tuesday to register the best-ever figures in an Under-19 World Cup. Pope helped Australia defend 127 runs as England were dismissed for 96 from being 47/0 at one time in the quarter-final. Pope's 8/35 are the second-best figures in all U-19 ODIs, behind Irfan Pathan's 9/16.
