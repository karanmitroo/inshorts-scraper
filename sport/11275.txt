Shooter Abhinav Bindra, India's only individual Olympic gold medalist, has said the medal "has no life". "A medal is satisfying, but it's a mere outcome. The process and journey stays," he said. "The Beijing medal is in a room in my house. Since 2008, I would have looked at it five-seven times. I'm not connected to it", Bindra added.
