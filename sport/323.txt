On being asked how he will rate his century against South Africa in the sixth ODI, India captain Virat Kohli said it's not his job to say anything about what he does and he is not doing anyone a favour. "This is a job for me. If I make a mistake, I'll accept it...I'm never one to...praise myself," Kohli added.
