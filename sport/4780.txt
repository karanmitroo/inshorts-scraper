Argentina's Diego Maradona scored the 'Hand of God' goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals on June 22. In the same game, he went past five English players on a 10-second 55-metre run to score what is widely regarded as the 'Goal of the Century'. Argentina won the match 2-1 and went on to win the World Cup.
