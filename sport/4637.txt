Boxer Vijender Singh has called his next opponent China's Zulpikar Maimaitiali's face a "good target". "His face is so big, so it will be a good target for me. That is the first thing I noticed when I met him," said Vijender. Zulpikar and Vijender, both undefeated pro boxers, will compete for two titles in Mumbai on August 5.
