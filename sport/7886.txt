West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell has been banned from cricket for one year by the Independent Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel for breaching the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code. Russell had missed three dope tests within a span of 12 months, which is considered to be one failed dope test. Russell was legally charged by Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission in March 2016.
