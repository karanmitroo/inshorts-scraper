India conceded an ODI against Pakistan on November 3, 1978 in protest against short-pitched bowling tactics of Pakistan. India needed 23 runs from 3 overs when Pakistani bowler Sarfraz Nawaz bowled four consecutive bouncers over batsman's head, which were not called wide. The then captain Bishan Singh Bedi called back the Indian batsmen and the match was awarded to Pakistan.
