Former England captain Alastair Cook said that he started questioning his tactical as well as leadership decisions as England captain. Cook, who is England's most-capped and successful Test captain with 24 victories and 13 draws in 59 Tests, resigned from the role in February after the England side's 4-0 series loss in India.
