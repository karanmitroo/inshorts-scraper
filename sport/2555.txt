Australian batsman David Warner has said that he wanted Indian batsman Rohit Sharma to swear at him in English during India's tour of Australia in 2015 so everyone else could understand what he was saying. Warner claimed that he wasn't being racist and added he would have been penalised if he said the same thing in English.
