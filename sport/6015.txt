Indian batsman KL Rahul is likely to miss the ICC Champions Trophy in June after undergoing a shoulder surgery. Rahul said his chances of playing the tournament were "very, very slim" since his recovery is expected to take 2-3 months. Rahul had injured his shoulder while batting in the Pune Test against England, and is sitting out of the IPL.
