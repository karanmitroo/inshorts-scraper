At least 33 people were injured in a bombing at an amateur boxing match in central Philippines, the government announced on Thursday. No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but an 81 mm mortar cartridge and a cellphone have been recovered from the spot. This is the second attack on a public place in Philippines in a week.
