Australian batsman David Warner, who is celebrating his 30th birthday on Thursday, is the only player since 1877 to play international cricket before playing any first-class match. Warner made his debut against South Africa in a T20I match at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2009, in which he played a match-winning knock of 89(43) and was adjudged Man of the Match.
