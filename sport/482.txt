Ice cricket is played on a frozen lake, with players wearing traditional gear along with normal sports shoes instead of spikes. The thick ice can withstand over 200 tons weight to support pavilion and grandstands. Virender Sehwag, Shahid Afridi, and other former cricketers recently played a match on Switzerland's Lake St Moritz, which has been hosting a tournament since 1988.
