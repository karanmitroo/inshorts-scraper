Pakistani cricketer Salman Butt, who has served jail time and a five-year ban for spot-fixing, says the ICC should consider punishing those who "corrupt the minds of cricketers". "I have paid heavily for it...It is human nature...to fall into the trap of greed. Steps are also required to punish individuals who trap players," said Butt.
