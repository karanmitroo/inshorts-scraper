After the ball slipped out of Bhuvneshwar Kumar's hand and landed on the adjacent pitch during his last over in the third ODI, umpire Chettithody Shamshuddin called it a dead ball. However, umpire at the square leg Marais Erasmus signalled the deliver as a no-ball. Both the umpires then got together and confirmed that the delivery was a dead ball.
