Former Chelsea player, Frank Lampard scored his first career hat-trick in Major League Soccer (MLS), and the first in New York City FC history, during the 5-1 rout of the Colorado Rapids on Sunday. Chelsea's all-time leading goalscorer first scored with a close range tap-in and a curling right-footed shot, followed by a spot kick.
