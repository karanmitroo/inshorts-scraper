Gareth Bale on Wednesday scored a volley against Legia Warsaw, which was compared to Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane's strike in the Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002. The goal, which was scored in the 57th second, also became Real Madrid's quickest Champions League goal. Bale netted the left-footed volley from outside the box following Cristiano Ronaldo's header.
