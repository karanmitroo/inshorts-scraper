Female UFC fighter Norway's Celine Haga rendered her opponent Amy Montenegro unconscious with a choke but went on to lose the bout via a unanimous decision. The referee did not stop the fight despite Montenegro going unconscious, and it was ruled that she became unconscious after the bell rang, meaning the fight would go to the judges' decision.
