Talking about being subjected to lewd comments on social media, Indian shuttler Jwala Gutta has said people should not think of her as someone who's 'easy to get'. "I'm someone who likes to look presentable...If I look a certain way, it doesn't mean I'm 'fast' or 'active'...It's a personal choice. How does that make me 'easy to get'," said Jwala.
