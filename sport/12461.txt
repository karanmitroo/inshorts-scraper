England all-rounder Ben Stokes has hailed Pakistan's Yasir Shah as the best leg-spinner since Shane Warne. In a recently concluded Test that saw Pakistan beat England at Lord's, Shah picked up 10 wickets to rise to the top of the ICC Test bowlers rankings. He also became the first bowler to take 86 wickets in the first 13 Tests.
