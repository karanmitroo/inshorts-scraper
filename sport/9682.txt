Rotherham striker Peter Odemwingie apologised on Twitter to his fans and supporters for his 29th-minute sending off while the team's match against Leeds was still going on. "I didn't mean to but caught the player and accept the referee had no choice", a part of Odemwingie's tweet read. Rotherham went on to lose the match 2-1.
