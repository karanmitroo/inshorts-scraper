Pakistani batsman, Fakhar Zaman has revealed that former Indian captain MS Dhoni 'did not show much reaction' to his maiden century in the ICC Champions Trophy final against India. The century-scorer also revealed that he saw Indian captain Virat Kohli looking downwards but 'graciously' clapping. Zaman said his reprieve off Jasprit Bumrah's no-ball felt like 'a new life'.
