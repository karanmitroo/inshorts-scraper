Indian team's chief selector MSK Prasad has said all-rounder Yuvraj Singh was overlooked for selection for India's limited-overs squad as he has not played "a lot of competitive cricket lately". This comes after Yuvraj passed the mandatory Yo-Yo test. "Let him have a good match time. We will definitely see him in the times to come," Prasad added.
