A streaker, with 'Peace + Love' written across his chest, crashed into the Olympic skating rink wearing only a pink tutu at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The incident occurred right after the men's 1,000-metre speed skating event on Friday. The streaker, who used a monkey pouch to cover his genitals, later fell face forward on the ice.
