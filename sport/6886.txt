Brazilian second-division football club Boa Esporte has signed goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza who was convicted of murdering his girlfriend and having her body fed to his dogs. Three sponsors have withdrawn their support from the team in order to protest against the decision. Bruno has served less than a third of the 22-year sentence given for his crimes.
