Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov defeated IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue in a six-game series on February 17, 1996. The computer's development began in 1985 under a project at the Carnegie Mellon University. Following the loss to Kasparov, Deep Blue was updated by IBM and managed to defeat the Russian in a six-game rematch series in May 1997.
