Gujarat Lions' batsman Aaron Finch was forced to sit out of the match against Mumbai Indians on Sunday after the Australian misplaced his kit bag which failed to arrive on time in Mumbai. Finch reportedly left his kit bag in Rajkot, where Gujarat Lions played their last match. Gujarat replaced Finch with England batsman Jason Roy.
