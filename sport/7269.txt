Tennis player Novak Djokovic was scolded by his wife while broadcasting a training session live on Facebook. After the end of the training session, Djokovic seemed to be grabbing the camera from his wife when she said, "Where are your manners, huh?" Realizing that they were still live on the social network, Djokovic's wife ended the session.
