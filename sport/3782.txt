Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who will be running his career's last race in the form of 4x100m relay final today, said that he enjoys relays more than anything. "The energy and vibe is wonderful, it's just brilliant. There's no words to explain the energy the crowd gives me," said the 30-year-old, who won bronze in his career's last solo race.
