WWE sent their event tickets to Jesse Fullerton, an 11-year-old Australian fan suffering from Down's Syndrome, after his wrestling figurines were stolen. The local police got in touch with the wrestling entertainment firm, who supplied the boy with more figurines and tickets to an NXT event on Gold Coast. According to Jesse's mother, he physically wrestles with the figurines.
