Indian cricket team is using coloured rubber balls for their practice net sessions against spin bowling, with each colour being used for a specific purpose. The red ball would be bowled fuller for a front-foot defensive shot while the green ball would be pitched slightly shorter for the batsman to advance down the wicket and play a lofted shot.
