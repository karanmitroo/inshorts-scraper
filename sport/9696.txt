PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has said they could take legal recourse and seek compensation from the BCCI over its refusal to play against Pakistan. The PCB chief added that the BCCI could not show any evidence to the ICC to back their claim that they could not play Pakistan in a bilateral series due to government advice.
