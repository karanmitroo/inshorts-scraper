Malaysia Airlines misplaced Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal and HS Prannoy's luggage, as the duo landed in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the Indonesia Super Series Premier that begins on Monday. Saina tweeted a picture of herself and Prannoy, with the caption, "Arrived for #IndonesiaSSP but luggage is missing #Malaysia airlines." The airline is yet to respond to the tweet.
