Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios responded to a fan's request on Twitter, practising with him on the sidelines of an ATP tournament in Canada on Tuesday. The fan posted on Twitter, "I know this is a long shot but could we hit for 5 minutes if you're practicing?" Kyrgios agreed, also asking other fans if they wanted to practise.
