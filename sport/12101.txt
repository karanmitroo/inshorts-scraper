World number one pair of Sania Mirza and Martina Hingis have confirmed they would not play together for the remainder of the season. The Indo-Swiss duo, which won three Grand Slams, will reunite to defend their WTA Finals title in October. In a Facebook post, Mirza wrote this will not "affect the wonderful personal relationship that we continue to share."
