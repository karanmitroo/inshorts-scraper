On the occasion of former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's 35th birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Happy Birthday Brendon McCullum. After ur retirement, bowlers have got Malham. Naam tha Baz, but kabhi nahi aaye Baaz." McCullum, nicknamed Baz, hit the fastest Test century of all time, taking 54 balls to reach a hundred against Australia earlier this year.
