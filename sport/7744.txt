Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has landed in Uttarakhand's hill station Mussoorie to celebrate his daughter Ziva's birthday, who turns two years old on Monday. Dhoni's wife Sakshi posted pictures of their vacation along with friends on Instagram. Notably, Dhoni and Sakshi had tied the knot nearly seven years ago at a place near Uttarakhand's Dehradun.
