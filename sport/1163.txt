Two-time IPL champions Chennai Super Kings have appointed former player Michael Hussey as their batting coach for the upcoming edition of the tournament. The 42-year-old Australian had represented CSK as a player from 2008 to 2013 and then in 2015. CSK, who are returning to IPL after a two-year suspension, earlier retained MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
