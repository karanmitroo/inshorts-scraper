British duo Andy Castell and Charlie Morley set a new Guinness world record for most headers of a swiss ball in 30 seconds, hitting the ball 57 times in the given time frame. The previous record was of 32 headers in half a minute set by Dutch footballer Patrick Kluivert and British tennis player Heather Watson in 2015.
