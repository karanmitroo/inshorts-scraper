The touring Indian cricket team and hosts Australia led by Sir Don Bradman observed a minute's silence in Melbourne after the death of Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi following his assassination on January 30, 1948. "None of us could get any sleep last night... Some of us wept at the news," India's then-manager Pankaj Gupta had said about the news.
