Royal Challengers Bangalore sported a green-coloured kit, which was made with waste plastic bottles collected from the Chinnaswamy stadium, during their match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday. Since IPL 2011, RCB has been wearing the green kit in one home game to spread awareness about environment conservation. RCB has also initiated a waste management program at the Chinnaswamy stadium.
