Wishing former Indian spinner Bishan Singh Bedi on his 70th birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Hpy B'day to a man who did not bowl, but did poetry instead. A man who cheated batsmen with a cherry in hand." In reply, Bedi tweeted, "Thx Veeru..but just to clarify..I might've deceived batsmen in air or off wkt..but I never 'cheated' on Crkt ground..Cheers!"
