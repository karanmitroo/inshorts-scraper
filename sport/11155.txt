BCCI missed its first deadline to implement the Lodha Panel recommendations, after it had to postpone its Special General Meeting on Friday. The Friday deadline had required the Board to adopt a new Memorandum of Association and Rules. The meeting has now been put off until Saturday, since some member units turned up without requisite letters of authorisation.
