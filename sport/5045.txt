Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's son Arjun was spotted doing net practice at the Lord's Cricket Ground in London recently. Arjun, who is primarily a left-arm pacer and bats left-handed, was seen practising against the spinners. Arjun, who has been practising at Lord's in the summer for the past few years, was selected in West Zone's U-16 squad last year.
