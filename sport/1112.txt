Belarusian tennis star, Victoria Azarenka, who is a two-time Australian Open champion, has withdrawn from the 2018 edition of the Grand Slam amid an on-going custody battle with her former partner over their son Leo. The US-based Belarusian has not played since Wimbledon as she cannot leave California with her son until the custody dispute is resolved.
