Pakistan's 17-year-old left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi bagged 8 for 39 in 15 overs in the second innings of his debut match to record the best-ever figures by a Pakistani on first-class debut. Afridi, who plays for Khan RL, broke a 43-year-old record set by former cricketer Nadeem Malik, who had taken 8 for 58 on his debut.
