Seventeen-year-old Indian golfer Rayhan Thomas equalled the record of registering nine consecutive birdies, while defending his title at the Dubai Creek Open, an official World Golf Ranking event. The record was earlier held by American golfer Mark Calcavecchia who achieved the feat in the 2009 Canadian Open. A birdie is a score of 1-under par on an individual golf hole.
