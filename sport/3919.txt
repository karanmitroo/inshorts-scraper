The national selectors have reportedly requested the BCCI to revise their salaries, demanding a 100% hike in pay. Currently, the senior team selectors get ₹60 lakh per season and one of the proposals has demanded pay of ₹1.2 crore for the chairman of the senior committee. This comes after BCCI revealed it is working on increasing pay of domestic cricketers.
