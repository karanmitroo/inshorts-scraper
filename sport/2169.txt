Anil Kumble, in a chat with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, took a dig at being referred to as a 'headmaster' when he was coaching India. Kumble attributed his approach to a disciplined upbringing that got him 'headmaster' tag. "Self-belief comes from values you inculcate...my grandfather was a headmaster. That term kept coming back to me later in life," he added.
