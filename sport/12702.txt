A two-minute YouTube video traces the life of 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius, who was sentenced to six years in jail today for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, whose legs were amputated even before he learnt to walk, won several Paralympics medals before going on to compete against able-bodied runners at the 2012 London Olympics.
