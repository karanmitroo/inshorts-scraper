Former Australian cricketer Shane Watson said that his performance against fast bowling started to "really dive" post Phil Hughes' death after being hit by a ball in 2014. Adding that fast bowling was his strength, Watson said, "[It] wasn't until that moment that fear came into my game massively." Watson added that "innocence of cricket" went immediately after Hughes' death.
