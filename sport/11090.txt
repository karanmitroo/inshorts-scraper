The Court of Arbitration for Sport has reduced tennis player Maria Sharapova's two-year dope ban to 15 months on appeal. The Russian was handed a ban in June this year, after testing positive for a banned performance enhancer, meldonium, during the 2016 Australian Open in January. Sharapova's ban will now end in April 2017, indicating a likely French Open return.
