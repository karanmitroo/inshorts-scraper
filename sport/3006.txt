Indian Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who became the first Indian spinner to take a hat-trick in ODIs on Thursday, is the only bowler to have taken a hat-trick in both Under-19 youth ODIs and senior ODIs. Before his hat-trick against Australia in the second ODI, Yadav had taken a hat-trick against Scotland in the Under-19 World Cup 2014.
