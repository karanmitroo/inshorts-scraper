Following reports of a rift between India captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble, former skipper Sourav Ganguly has advised the team to "just keep quiet and play the game". "Just deal with it. You're a name, you're captain of India, you're coach of India... Professionals find a way. Look at Cristiano Ronaldo. He's in controversies every week," said Ganguly.
