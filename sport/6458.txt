A swarm of bees overtook a baseball field, sending players, umpires, and coaches ducking and lying down on the field during the Major League Baseball match between the Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres on Thursday. The bees were also seen to be making a hive on a microphone placed near the edge of the playing field.
