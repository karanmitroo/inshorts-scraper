Chris Gayle, who became the first batsman to score 10,000 runs in T20 cricket on Tuesday, celebrated his fifty against Gujarat Lions by doing a 'salt bae' celebration. Gayle smashed a six off Shivil Kaushik's ball to score his first fifty of IPL 2017 and went down on his knees before doing the viral salt sprinkling gesture on his bat.
