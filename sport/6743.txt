England cricketer Kevin Pietersen on Sunday replied to a Twitter user using the 'middle finger emoji' when asked about the possibility of a return to Test cricket a year ago. Following India's 210-over innings in the Ranchi Test, Pietersen had tweeted, "Aussies field for 210 overs. And people ask me if given the chance I'd play Test Cricket again."
