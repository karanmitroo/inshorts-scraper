Following India's first-ever 3-0 away whitewash in Tests against Sri Lanka, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said that the current Sri Lankan side would even struggle against any Ranji side. "To be frank, you can't call this a Test match. The Indian team hasn't been tested at all," added Gavaskar. Notably, Sri Lanka have lost two consecutive Tests by an innings.
