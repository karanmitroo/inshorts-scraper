Indian Test captain Virat Kohli said he "laughed" at the ball tampering allegations levelled at him. "This is just to take focus away from the series. It didn't come up in Rajkot. No mention of it till (India's) Vizag victory...I don't read newspapers....I don't pay attention to these things. A newspaper article doesn't matter over ICC's decision," Kohli said.
