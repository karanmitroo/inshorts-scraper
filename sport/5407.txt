Rising Pune Supergiant's 17-year-old spinner Washington Sundar was named by his father after his godfather, an ex-army man, PD Washington. PD bought uniform for Washington's father, paid his school fee, got him books and took him to the cricket ground on his cycle. "[PD] was the happiest man when I made it to the Ranji probables," Washington's father said.
