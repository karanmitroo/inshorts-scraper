Former India captain MS Dhoni has said he will not go back to his old long-haired look in the future. "I will never grow my hair again," Dhoni said when asked if he will change his hairstyle now that he is relieved of the leadership burden. The former skipper sported long, brown hair when he debuted in 2004.
