Former England wicketkeeper Alfred Lyttelton removed his gloves to bowl against Australia in an Ashes Test in 1884. Lyttelton, born on February 7, 1857, bowled underarm lobs, with his pads still on, picking up four wickets for 19 runs in four overs. Lyttelton was the first wicketkeeper to take a Test wicket as all 11 English players bowled.
