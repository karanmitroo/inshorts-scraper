World number two Roger Federer recorded the joint second-most number of men's singles titles in the Open Era, registering his 94th with a win against Rafael Nadal in the Shanghai Open. Federer, who equalled Ivan Lendl's record, now lies only behind Jimmy Connors' record of 109 career titles. The Shanghai title was Federer's sixth this year.
