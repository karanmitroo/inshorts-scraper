Iran's Reza Parastesh, who bears a resemblance to Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, had his car impounded and was taken to a police station for disrupting traffic in the Iranian city of Hamadan. Parastesh, who was pressured by his father into posing in Messi's jersey, has landed modelling contracts due to his resemblance with the Argentine.
