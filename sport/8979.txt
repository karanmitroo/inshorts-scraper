US President-elect Donald Trump took a break from preparing to take office and played golf with 14-time major champion Tiger Woods at Trump's golf course in Florida on Friday. Interestingly, Trump had slammed Barack Obama in May for playing golf tweeting, "While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government."
