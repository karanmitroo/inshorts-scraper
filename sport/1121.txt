Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho has become the world's second-most expensive footballer, following his transfer from Liverpool to Barcelona for £142 million (₹1,220 crore). The fee is only eclipsed by the ₹1,680 crore PSG paid Barcelona for Neymar in August last year. Coutinho was signed for only £8.5 million by Liverpool from Inter Milan five years ago.
