The record for the highest last-wicket partnership in Test cricket was set on July 12 by England's James Anderson and Joe Root while facing India in 2014. The duo added 198 runs for the final wicket, as it became the only Test match to feature two century 10th-wicket partnerships. Notably, Anderson's 81-run innings is his Test career's only 50+ score.
