Mali Richards, son of West Indies' legend Viv Richards, drew a painting of Indian Test captain Virat Kohli and gifted it to him, commemorating his maiden Test double hundred. Mali was accompanied by his father while presenting Kohli with the painting. “We prepared the entire painting in just one day and came here to present it to him,” Mali said.
