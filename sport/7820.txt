Queensland fast bowler Michael Neser produced a late inswinger to clean bowl Tasmania's opener Jake Hancock during the Sheffield Shield match on Thursday. Hancock tried to play a front foot defensive shot but was unable to read the ball which swung late and went on to hit the stumps. Hancock was dismissed for a duck.
