Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade got involved in an altercation on Day 3 of the Dharamsala Test. Being provoked by Wade, Jadeja responded by saying,  "I don't understand why the Australian selectors pick you for Test." "Is that right? I don't understand why they pick you outside India," the Aussie wicketkeeper replied.
