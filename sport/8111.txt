Indian captain Virat Kohli wasted a DRS referral against England after he asked for it despite MS Dhoni suggesting against it. Reacting to the incident, a user tweeted, "Dear Virat Kohli, When Indian DRS (#Dhoni Review System) Says It's Not Out, It's Not Out. 1 Review Wasted," while another tweet read, "Dhoni & DRS love story in this series continues!"
