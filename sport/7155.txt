Ousted BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke has alleged "pitch fixing" in the Pune Test against Australia, which India lost within three days, and has demanded a CBI inquiry. "Pune has historically prepared seaming wickets, so what suddenly went wrong? It (doctoring pitches) has plagued Indian cricket and it is high time we get to the root of this mess," said Shirke.
