Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum has said that Virat Kohli is an absolute superstar who has changed the game with his impact on Indian cricket through his professionalism and his fitness. "He's (Kohli) a freak...he plays it hard on the field but he never really crosses the line...And it's just effortless as well," McCullum added.
