The Antigua Test between West Indies and England at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was abandoned after just ten balls on February 13, 2009. The match was called-off because of poor field conditions as the bowlers failed to get any solid footholds during their run-up. The second shortest Test was also played between West Indies and England, in 1998.
