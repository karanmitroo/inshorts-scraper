Mara, a Turin-based woman found an Olympic gold medal among a heap of garbage outside a train station in Turin on Saturday. The medal, belonging to Rio Olympics fencing gold medallist Daniele Garozzo, was stolen during his train journey last month. Garozzo stated he owed Mara "a huge thanks" and couldn't wait to have the medal back.
