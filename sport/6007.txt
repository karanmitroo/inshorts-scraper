Former sprinter PT Usha has disallowed two of her trainees from competing at an international event in Bahamas after delay in getting travel permits. Sprinters Tintu Lukka and Jisna Mathew, who train at Usha's academy, were selected in the women's relay team, which was being coached by Usha. She asked the trainees to prepare for the Asian Grand Prix instead.
