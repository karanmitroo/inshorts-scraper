A three-minute video describes the evolution of Formula One car steering wheels from the 1950s to the present day. It highlights the transition from traditional wood and aluminium wheels to the modern angular, carbon-fibre 'controller' with hand-clutch and gear-shifting, programmable switches and LCD display. Wheels used by F1 legends Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher have also been featured.
