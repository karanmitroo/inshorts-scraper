Four-time Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters made a male fan wear a skirt and play tennis alongside her during a Wimbledon invitational women's doubles match. Clijsters had asked the audience the kind of service they'd like to see, to which the male fan responded with, "Body serve." Clijsters offered him a skirt and called him up to play alongside her.
