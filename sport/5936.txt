Malikaa Marathe, a 13-year-old national tennis champion who almost lost sight in her right eye when she was four, has become India's top-ranked player in the All India Tennis Association's (AITA) Under-14 category. Marathe wore an eye patch on her good eye for four years so as to force the defected eye to start functioning again.
