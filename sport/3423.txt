Sri Lanka's World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has urged the nation's cricket supporters "to not behave like Indian fans". Ranatunga's comments come after the fans disrupted the third India-Sri Lanka ODI by hurling bottles at the players in Pallekele. Notably, Ranatunga was the captain when Indian fans disrupted the 1996 World Cup semi-final, which was then awarded to Sri Lanka.
