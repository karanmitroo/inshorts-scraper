Indian para-cyclist and silver medallist at the Asian Para games 2013, Aditya Mehta was forced to remove his prosthetic leg at the Bengaluru airport on Tuesday. The process led to bleeding from his leg. This comes two months after a similar incident where the Hyderabad-based cyclist was strip-searched twice within the span of days at the Delhi and Bangalore airports.
