Karun Nair has become the fourth player in cricket history to miss a Test after scoring a triple century in his previous match. Karun, who became India's second Test triple centurion in the Chennai Test against England in December, was replaced by Ajinkya Rahane, who returned from an injury. Inzamam-ul-Haq was the last triple centurion to be dropped, in 2002.
