Virat Kohli almost hit England's Liam Dawson on the head while fielding, during the Chennai Test on Saturday. Dawson played spinner Amit Mishra towards the leg side when Kohli, who was fielding at first slip, fielded the ball and threw it towards the striker's end, almost hitting Dawson. Kohli raised his hands in apology, with Dawson throwing him a glance.
