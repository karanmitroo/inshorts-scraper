Expressing disappointment on his Rio Olympics exit, Indian shooter Jitu Rai said, "I let my country down. There was wind but I don't want to make any excuses." Jitu, who is a 2014 Commonwealth Games shooting gold medallist, had earlier crashed out of the men's 50-metre air pistol event on Wednesday, after finishing eighth in the 10-metre air pistol final.
