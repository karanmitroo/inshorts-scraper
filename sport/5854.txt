FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that video assistant referees (VAR) will be used at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The technology will be used only for decisions involving goals, penalty kicks, red cards and mistaken identity. Video assistance was introduced for the first time in a FIFA competition at the Club World Cup in Japan last December.
