Former cricketer Ravi Shastri has confirmed he is applying for the post of India head coach, after the BCCI extended the deadline for applications. Shastri has dismissed allegations that he is applying after getting a selection guarantee, calling the reports "bull crap". Shastri was Team India director from 2014-2016, and was not given an extension despite appearing for an interview.
