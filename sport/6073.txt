Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli passively adopted 15 disabled dogs from a rescue and rehabilitation centre in Bengaluru. "While most people go for the cutesy ones, Virat chose to specifically take care of the crippled and blind ones", the rehabilitation centre's founder said. Kohli's visit was reportedly supposed to last 15 minutes but he stayed for almost an hour.
