Pakistan's Shahid Afridi failed to identify 'leg before wicket' from gestures while appearing on a Pakistani television show. Afridi was wearing headphones while the show hosts made signs and gestures to help him identify 'LBW'. Afridi, who could only figure out 'leg before', later asked what 'leg before wicket' meant and said he was hearing it for the first time.
