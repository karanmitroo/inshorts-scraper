Brazilian footballer Neymar will feature in a charity match for the club Chapecoense, whose 19 players died in a plane crash last month. The game, which is being organised by former Brazil player Zico, will also include former Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron. More than 20,000 tickets have already been sold, with proceedings going to the deceased players' families.
