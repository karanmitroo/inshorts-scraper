Paris Saint-Germain drew 2-2 with Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday to go to the top of Group A. PSG forward Edinson Cavani opened the scoring with an 18th-minute goal, before a penalty from Olivier Giroud made it even. An own goal by Marco Verratti in the 60th minute gave Arsenal a brief lead, which Lucas Moura neutralised.
