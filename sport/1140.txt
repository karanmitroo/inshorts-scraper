A video has emerged online showing a snowboarder causing an avalanche, and continuing to board to successfully outrun it and making it back safely. The avalanche, which occurred in the European mountain range of Pyrenees, got triggered after the snowboarder cracked a snow plate during a jump. The snowboarder and the camera crew were there to reportedly film a documentary.
