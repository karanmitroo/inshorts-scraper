Indian wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha threw himself over four feet in the air to complete a one-handed catch to dismiss Steve O'Keefe off Umesh Yadav's bowling on the Day 1 of the Pune Test. O'Keefe edged Yadav's delivery while trying to cut it before Saha flew to his right and plucked the catch in no time.
