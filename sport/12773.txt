Australian batsman Adam Voges has backed the idea of allowing substitutions for players who may have suffered a concussion caused by a head injury on the field. His comments came after a head injury he suffered during a County Championship match in May. After the injury, the 36-year-old admitted he felt like he had a "hangover" for 10 days.
