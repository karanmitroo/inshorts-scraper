The International Paralympic Committee has confirmed a blanket ban on Russia in the Paralympics Games. "The Russian Paralympic Committee are unable to ensure compliance and enforcement of the IPC anti-doping code and the world anti-doping code within their own national jurisdiction," said IPC's chief. "The anti-doping system in Russia is broken, corrupted and entirely compromised," he added.
