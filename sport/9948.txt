Seventeen-year-old Tejaswin Shankar, who broke a 12-year-old senior high jump national record last Thursday, was not given a gold medal as the organisers of the Junior National Championship ran out of medals. There was a shortage of 29 gold medals, 27 silver medals and as many bronze medals. Shankar had won a silver in his maiden senior meet in Guwahati.
