Ex-India captain Bishan Singh Bedi has said one should not "narrow down the meaning of patriotism" by politicising bilateral cricketing relationship with Pakistan. "Why politicise cricket? Have you been able to wipe off terrorism by not playing cricket? Cricket is a platform to come closer," Bedi added. He further said Indian team should wear national logo instead of BCCI logo.
