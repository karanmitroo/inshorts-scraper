Businessman Vijay Mallya is reportedly looking to drop the word 'India' from the name of his Formula One team, Force India. Six new companies were registered under the 'Force One' brand with Mallya's address and a Force India director was listed as the director of the new companies. The name change would need to be approved by Formula One authorities.
