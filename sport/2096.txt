The Honduras football team has accused the Australian team of using a drone to spy on their preparations, ahead of the teams' do-or-die World Cup playoff second leg clash on Wednesday. The official Twitter account of the Honduran football federation posted footage of a spy drone, filming the team's training in Sydney, which it claims belongs to the Australians.
