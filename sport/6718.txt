Former England captain Michael Vaughan took a dig at Australia's performance in the ongoing Ranchi Test against India, through a tweet on Sunday. Vaughan tweeted how his weekend was not going well but there was "always Aussie cricket to brighten it up". Under Vaughan's captaincy, England regained the Ashes in 2005, 18 years after they had last won it.
