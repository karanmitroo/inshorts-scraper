A 17-year-old Bangladeshi boy died in a hospital in Dhaka after being hit in the chest by a ball during a cricket match on Friday. The boy was umpiring in the match at the Balur Math ground in Bangladesh's capital. The boy came from a poor family with his father being a rickshaw-puller and mother a housemaid, the police said.
