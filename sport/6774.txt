Former Pakistan spinner Abdul Qadir said that the Pakistan Super League (PSL) spot-fixing scandal would not have happened had former players including Wasim Akram, and Inzamam-ul-Haq, suspected of being involved in match-fixing been hanged. "The way of our country is to nab the smaller culprit and let the bigger one go," added Qadir.
