Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has said that he was misquoted and taken out of context regarding a comparison he made between Chennai Super Kings' return to the IPL and Manchester United's 1958 Munich air disaster. Ashwin had said that the two-year hiatus for CSK will increase its value just like it did for United when the crash happened.
