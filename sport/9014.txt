Indian pacer Mohammed Shami is set to miss the ODI and T20I series against England as he is recovering from a knee injury he suffered during the third Test against England. Earlier, Shami had his left knee operated on after the 2015 ICC World Cup in Australia and was out of action for almost a year.
