Former England captain Kevin Pietersen took to Instagram to share a video of himself bottle-feeding milk to his adopted baby leopard in Raipur. "Happiness in this! How beautiful is this baby Leopard," the caption read. Pietersen, who is an animal activist and has been campaigning against the killings of rhinos, had revealed he would retire from professional cricket in March.
