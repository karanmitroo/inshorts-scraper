British athlete Germaine Mason, who won a high jump silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, died in a motorcycle crash in Jamaica on Thursday. The 34-year-old was riding back after a night out with a few athletes, which included eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt. Mason was reportedly at the front of the convoy when the accident occurred.
