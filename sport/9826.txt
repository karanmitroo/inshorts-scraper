England cricketers are still awaiting their daily allowance from the BCCI as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering the payment is yet to be signed by the boards. Supreme Court had sanctioned ₹58.6 lakh per match for organising the first three Tests, which does not include the daily allowances. Each English player is supposed to be paid ₹4,200 per day.
