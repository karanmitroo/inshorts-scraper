Following reports that the India-New Zealand ongoing series might be cancelled after the Lodha Panel asked banks to freeze BCCI's accounts on Monday, BCCI President Anurag Thakur said, "there can't be any tournament without money." "We don't take money from the government. We are not allowed to make payments. I can't say anything about the India-New Zealand series," Thakur added.
