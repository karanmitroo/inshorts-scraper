Michel Bach, a 70-year-old Paris-based runner, ran the 2016 Dublin Marathon wearing a three-metre tall Eiffel Tower costume. The 42-km marathon, which took place on Sunday, saw almost 20,000 runners participate for the grand prize, reportedly making it the fourth-largest marathon in Europe. According to a friend, Bach has participated in over 200 marathons in the last 30 years.
