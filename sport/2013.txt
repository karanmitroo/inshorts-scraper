India's Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav has revealed Sachin Tendulkar called him after his Test debut and told him that his aim should be to take 500 Test wickets. Yadav further said he couldn't believe that Tendulkar had called him. "I thought if the 'God' of cricket is expecting so much of me, there must be something to it," he added.
