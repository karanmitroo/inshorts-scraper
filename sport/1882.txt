Indian shooter Heena Sidhu took to Twitter to slam people who do not stand up for the national anthem and instead 'carry on eating popcorns, chit-chatting, talking loudly on phone'. Part of Sidhu's tweet read, "Sometimes I feel so blessed 2 b a sportsperson...We cant even imagine this! Getting a medal wouldnt be half as gud without d Anthem".
