Pakistan fans trolled Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah after his lookalike was spotted outside Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium during the recently concluded Independence Cup. "Thank you Jasprit Bumrah for [coming to] Pakistan to watch Pakistan vs World XI matches. You always support Pakistan in Big Events," tweeted a user, referring to Bumrah's no-ball during Pakistan's win in the Champions Trophy final.
