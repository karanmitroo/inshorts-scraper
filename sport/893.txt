Swiss tennis star and 19-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer says that he does not want his two sets of twins to follow his footsteps and play tennis. On being asked about his support as a parent, Federer said, "I have no idea where they're going to go. All I know is I'll be incredibly supportive of them."
