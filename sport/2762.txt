Brazilian football team was pictured breathing from oxygen tanks after its 0-0 draw against Bolivia in La Paz's Hernando Siles stadium, which stands at over 11,900 feet altitude. The stadium was once banned from hosting internationals by FIFA as per its policy on high-altitude football. Brazilian forward Neymar said, "Inhumane to play in such conditions, field, altitude, ball...everything bad."
