Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja has said that Pakistan Cricket Board should consider appointing a coach like Rahul Dravid for the country's Under-19 team. Adding that India Under-19 team will benefit from the presence of "role model" Rahul Dravid, Raja added, "I don't think winning is as important as recognising individuals who are talented and then educating and grooming them."
