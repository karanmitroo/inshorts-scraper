Moninda Marube, a long-distance runner from Kenya, claims he outran two bears while training in a forest in Maine, USA, on Wednesday. Marube claimed the bears were about 18 metres away from him, while a house was the same distance away in the opposite direction. Marube ran towards the house, with the bears closing to within nine metres of him.
