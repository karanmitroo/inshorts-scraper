Reacting to England pacer James Anderson's comments about pitches hiding Virat Kohli's technical weaknesses, the Indian Test captain said he doesn't believe in playing "sarcastic mind games". "I am no one to question someone else's technique or faults. They should understand it themselves...I want to focus on good cricket and that is exactly what we have done," said Kohli.
