Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has said that he considers ex-Australian captain Steve Waugh and ex-Indian skipper MS Dhoni as the perfect captains. Gilchrist added that Dhoni's greatest quality is his calmness under pressure. "Such is the passion for cricket in [India] that exuberance can spill out of control...but [Dhoni] is able to bring consistency in emotion," he further said.
