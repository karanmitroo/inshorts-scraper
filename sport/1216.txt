Indian Premier League side Royal Challengers Bangalore have added India's former World Cup-winning coach Gary Kirsten and ex-Indian pacer Ashish Nehra to their coaching staff. This will be Kirsten's second stint in the IPL, with the South African having coached Delhi Daredevils earlier. Meanwhile, this is Nehra's first coaching assignment since his retirement last year.
