Indian women's junior hockey team goalkeeper Khushboo Khan has requested Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan for a toilet to be constructed at her home. The toilet was destroyed by the management of a hospital which owns the land. Khushboo, who has been living in tin shed for over 17 years, added she can't focus on hockey due to the conditions.
