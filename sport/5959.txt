Top-ranked T20I all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been appointed captain of Bangladesh's T20I team, following a meeting of the Bangladesh Cricket Board on Saturday. Shakib replaces Mashrafe Mortaza, who retired from the format last month. Shakib previously captained Bangladesh in four T20Is back in 2009 and 2010, with the country losing all of them.
