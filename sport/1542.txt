The Delhi High Court has rejected Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir's plea seeking to restrain a Delhi-based restobar chain from using his name in connection with its pubs. The chain had contended that it used the tagline 'By Gautam Gambhir' as it was also the owner's name. Gambhir claimed in his plea that the usage will cause "irreparable loss" to him.
