The Independence Cup kicked off in Lahore on Tuesday, marking the return of international cricket to Pakistan with a World XI team taking on the hosts. Pakistan had last hosted an international match in 2015 when Zimbabwe toured the country. No country except Zimbabwe had agreed to tour Pakistan, after the attack on the Sri Lankan team in 2009.
