A new report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has revealed that Russia's sports ministry “planned and operated” a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015. The government reportedly oversaw the manipulation of urine samples through the period, which included the London 2012 and Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Russia’s track-and-field athletes are currently banned from competing in Rio.
