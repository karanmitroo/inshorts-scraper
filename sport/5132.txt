Former India captain MS Dhoni said that the quickest bowler he has faced in his career is former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar. "[H]e was quick, he was fast, he could bowl a yorker, he could bowl a bouncer but you never expected a beamer, he was a bit unpredictable, he was fun to play against," Dhoni said about Akhtar.
