Cricket South Africa on Wednesday mistakenly used Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's picture while congratulating Cheteshwar Pujara for scoring 50 in the first innings of the third Test. Pujara, who scored his first run off the 54th ball he faced, reached 50 off his 173rd delivery before getting out for 50(179). "Use some specs or check before tweeting," a user reacted.
