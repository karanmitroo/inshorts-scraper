Former Australian pacer Dirk Nannes has revealed spot-fixing practices in the Bangladesh Premier League, which included owners dictating play. Nannes said that team managers used to ask the owners about what they should do next during the match. He further said that spot-fixers with microphones and mobiles were noticeable in the crowd, but even security could not do anything.
