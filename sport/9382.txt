Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal has urged Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to hear him out and ask the Pakistan national selectors to consider his "case on merit". "I strongly feel...I am being ignored even after so many good performances in domestic cricket", Akmal said. He added, "I want the selectors to consider me purely as a batsman".
