Nolito's 72nd-minute goal salvaged a point for table-toppers Manchester City after they had gone behind with Romelu Lukaku's 64th-minute strike for Everton. Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg saved two penalties, one from Kevin De Bruyne in the first half while the other from Sergio Aguero in the 70th minute. With the draw, City are still the table toppers with 19 points.
