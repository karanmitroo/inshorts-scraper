Bosnia & Herzegovina forward Edin Dzeko was sent off in Sunday's WC 2018 qualifier clash against Greece for pulling down the shorts of Greek defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos. Dzeko initially went down following a challenge from Papadopoulos just outside the Greece penalty area. Papadopoulos was given a straight red, while Dzeko was handed a second yellow for the act.
