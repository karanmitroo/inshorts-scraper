Toronto Blue Jays' batter Josh Donaldson lost grip of his baseball bat which hit the first umpire Chris Segal on the head. Segal, who had not worn the protective gear at the time, went down to the ground before the medical staff rushed to his attention. Notably, Segal continued to officiate the match and was later seen laughing.
