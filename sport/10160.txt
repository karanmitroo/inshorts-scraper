Former Indian football captain and the current AIFF Technical Committee head, Bhaichung Bhutia claims that India's Under-17 football team is at par with their Brazilian counterparts. “We saw the Indian U-17 World Cup team play against Brazil and some of the Indian players were on the same page as the Brazilian players, if not better than them,” said Bhutia.
