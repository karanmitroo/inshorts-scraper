Mominul Haque became Bangladesh's first cricketer to score centuries in both innings of a Test after going past the landmark figure in both the innings of the first Test against Sri Lanka. Haque converted all five of his 50+ scores in Tests at Chittagong into hundreds, the most number of Test centuries at a venue without scoring a fifty.
