India's Anukul Roy, the joint-highest wicket-taker in this year's U-19 World Cup, has been accused of participating in the event despite being over-aged. A petitioner in the IPL spot-fixing scam alleged Roy had failed BCCI's age verification test in 2017 and was selected due to BCCI's acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary's influence. Meanwhile, Roy has claimed he "clearly passed the test".
