Indian captain Virat Kohli has been fined 25% of his match fee for showing dissent during the second Test against South Africa in Centurion. The 29-year-old has also been handed one ICC demerit point as he continually complained to umpire Michael Gough about the ball being affected by a damp outfield following a rain delay on Monday.
