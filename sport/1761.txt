Windies' Sunil Ambris on Friday became the first-ever batsman to be dismissed hit-wicket on the first ball of his Test career. The debutant stood on his stumps after playing a short ball off New Zealand's Neil Wagner to be dismissed for a golden duck in 30th over. Ambris became the eleventh player overall to get out hit-wicket on Test debut.
