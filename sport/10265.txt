Football matches across Uruguay have been suspended this weekend, following the death of a fan who was shot by rival supporters in September, according to the country's football association. Penarol's 21-year-old fan, Hernan Fioritto, and two others were hit by rival Nacional supporters, who wanted to steal their club scarves. Fifteen men are being held in prison following the incident.
