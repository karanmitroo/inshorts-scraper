Michael Schumacher's son Mick drove a lap before the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday to mark the 25th anniversary of his father's first Formula One race win in 1992. Mick drove the Benetton B194 car which Michael drove in 1994 to win his first of seven F1 world championships. "For me to be able to do...this is emotional," said Mick.
