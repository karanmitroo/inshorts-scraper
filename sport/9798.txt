With a win over England at Vizag on Monday, India extended its unbeaten streak in home Tests to 16, which is the joint second-longest for the team. India's current unbeaten home run started in December 2012, in which they have won 13 Tests and drawn three. The previous run of 16 unbeaten Tests was from January 1960 to February 1964.
