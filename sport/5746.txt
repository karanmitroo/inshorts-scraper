Gujarat Lions captain Suresh Raina walked up to Delhi Daredevils' player Rishabh Pant and consoled him after the latter missed out on his maiden IPL century by three runs on Thursday. Pant stood at the crease after being caught behind at 97(43), when Raina went to him and held his head. Bowler Basil Thampi also consoled Pant after dismissing him.
