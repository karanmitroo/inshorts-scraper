Following Mahesh Bhupathi leaking a Whatsapp conversation between him and Leander Paes, the latter has said Bhupathi's conduct is "unbecoming of a Davis Cup captain". "I can give a detailed rebuttal pointing out how one-sided and convoluted his arguments are. Fans just have to examine who won what for our country. Talk is cheap, history books don't lie," he said.
