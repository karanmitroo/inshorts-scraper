American footballer John Urschel, who played for the Baltimore Ravens, has retired from football to complete his doctoral degree in applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Urschel's decision comes after a research involving brains of 111 former NFL players found that 99% of them suffered from a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
