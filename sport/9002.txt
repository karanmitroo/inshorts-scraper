Golfer SSP Chawrasia has said he will "think twice before representing India at the Olympics", after alleging "servant-like treatment" by the Indian Olympic Association at the Rio Games. "There was no proper arrangement...They behaved as if they were 'maalik' and we were 'naukars'," said Chawrasia. He added the government failed to reimburse the earmarked amount of â‚¹30 lakh for training.
