The New Zealand-Zimbabwe Test, which started on September 18, 1997, became the first to feature three pairs of brothers in one team. Andy and Grant Flower, Bryan and Paul Strang, and Gavin and John Rennie represented Zimbabwe in the match. Moreover, Zimbabwe's 12th man Andy Whittall was a cousin of Guy Whittall, who was also in the playing XI.
