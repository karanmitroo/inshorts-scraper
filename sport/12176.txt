Two-time Iranian World Judo champion, Arash Miresmaeili was disqualified in 2004 Athens Olympics because of being overweight. Miresmaeili, who was supposed to face an Israeli in the first round, later revealed that he over-ate in a bid to bow out of the fight. Miresmaeili reportedly said this was to protest against the inclusion of Israel in the Olympic games.
