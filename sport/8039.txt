Sixteen-time world billiards and snooker champion Pankaj Advani tweeted to Sports Minister Vijay Goel on Wednesday, asking "what more he needed to do" to be considered for Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian honour. Goel had congratulated Advani on his 24th national title when Advani expressed displeasure at being ignored for the award. Advani is a two-time Asian Games gold medalist.
