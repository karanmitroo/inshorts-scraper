Expressing his excitement to play in the Pakistan Super League, former Australian cricketer Shane Watson tweeted, "Only just over a week until I am back with my mates at @IsbUnited. It is always an exciting time of the year.@OfficialPSL." The cricketer, however, mistakenly tagged a South African football tournament, called Premier Soccer League, instead of the cricket league.
