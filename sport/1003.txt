Mohammad Shami has become the third quickest Indian fast bowler to reach 100 wickets in Test cricket. Playing his 29th Test, the 27-year-old achieved the feat by taking the wicket of South Africa's Keshav Maharaj on Sunday. Only Kapil Dev (25) and Irfan Pathan (28) have achieved the landmark in fewer Test matches among Indian pacers.
