Virender Sehwag sang Kishore Kumar's songs while scoring a career-best 219 against West Indies in an ODI in 2011, Suresh Raina, who was at the non-striker's end had revealed after the match. Sehwag's 219, the then-highest individual ODI score, included 25 boundaries and seven sixes. Sehwag is the only player to score a double century as captain in ODIs.
