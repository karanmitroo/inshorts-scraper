Indian broadcaster Doordarshan has lost the only remaining videotapes of the 1987 India-Pakistan Test, in which Sunil Gavaskar became the first cricketer in Test history to go past the 10,000-run mark. The unavailability was found out after an RTI was filed, asking about the tapes. Gavaskar, who termed the incident 'unfortunate', hoped that "they [Doordarshan] archive the stuff properly".
