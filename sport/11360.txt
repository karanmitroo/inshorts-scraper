Olympic gymnast Dipa Karmakar’s coach Bishweshwar Nandi, who has been coaching her for 16 years, recently said that he used to attack her emotionally to make her perform better. “At times she would break down and was so hurt that she would plead, ‘don’t tell me like this, it’s more painful than getting caned’, but that’s my technique,” said Nandi.
