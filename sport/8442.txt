The spidercam will be used for the first time in a Premier League match in the Liverpool-Manchester United game at Old Trafford on Sunday. The movable camera, suspended above the pitch by four wires fixed at each corner of the ground, gives a birds-eye view of the pitch. It is already in use in the Champions League.
