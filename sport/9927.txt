Oceans 12, a Tamil refugee cricket team in Australia, won a national semi-pro T20 tournament on Wednesday. Most players in the team had been in immigration detention centres in Australia, having left Sri Lanka due to war and ethnic violence. One of the players said the team had been "through a lot" and cricket helped them feel "accepted".
