The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) has made a lotus 'mala' offering at the Koodalmanikyam Temple to avoid a washout in the final India-New Zealand T20I in Thiruvananthapuram. KCA's secretary revealed the offering was made after someone suggested that it can bring respite from rain. Thiruvananthapuram is hosting an international match for the first time after 29 years.
