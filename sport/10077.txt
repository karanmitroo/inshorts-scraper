Ex-New Zealand cricketer Lou Vincent, who is serving 11 concurrent life bans after confessing to match-fixing, has claimed that he contemplated suicide as he was "so ashamed and depressed". He also stated that he had no control over his mind and felt constantly guilty following the ban. "I loved cricket...but...gave it away and lost respect for it," added the 38-year-old.
