Pacer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who appeared in five Tests and 61 One Day Internationals for South Africa, has been charged with match-fixing by the nation's cricket board. The charges are related to South Africa's domestic Twenty20 series held in 2015. Six other players have already been banned for trying to fix the outcome of matches in the T20 league.
