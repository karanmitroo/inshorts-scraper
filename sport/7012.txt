A video of former Pakistan captain Imran Khan calling foreign players who featured in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) final in Lahore 'phatichar' (disreputable) has gone viral. "I don't even know the names of these foreign players. It seems they just caught players from anywhere...They caught some from Africa and called them foreign players," he is heard saying.
