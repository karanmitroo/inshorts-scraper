Sri Lankan cricketers have been instructed by the Sri Lankan government to get fit in three months or face the prospect of being booted out of the national side. The instruction has come after the team members were found to be unfit for the series against Zimbabwe which starts on Friday. Notably, Lasith Malinga has officially been put under observation.
