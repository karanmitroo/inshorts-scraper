Athlete Jithin Paul became the first Indian athlete to be banned by the National Anti-Doping Agency for possession of a prohibited substance. NADA has handed Paul a 4-year-ban for possession of a banned substance called 'Meldonium'. The anti-doping authority also said that Paul had no justification for possession of the substance.
