Opener Smriti Mandhana slammed a 129-ball 135 against South Africa at Kimberley on Wednesday to become the first Indian woman cricketer to smash ODI hundreds in three away countries. Mandhana had earlier slammed a ton each in Australia and England. The century was also the first by an Indian woman against South Africa in South Africa.
