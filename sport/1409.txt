Reacting to former Pakistan cricket team captain Waqar Younis suggesting to mix T10 format with Test cricket, a user tweeted, "Let cricket remain cricket. Don't make it a circus." Other tweets read, "You should sleep...Looks like you been awake for too long," and, "Not to offend you sir, but Test match is called Test match for a reason."
