Charles Dayot, mayor of a French town, followed through on his promise to eat a rodent after losing a bet on a Champions League 2017's football match between Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona. Following Barcelona's 4-0 first leg loss to PSG, Dayot said, "If Barca qualifies, I'll eat a rat and I'll vote for [left-wing presidential candidate Jean-Luc] Melenchon".
