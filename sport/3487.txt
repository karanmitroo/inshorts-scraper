At least two athletes were bitten by stray dogs while they were running in the 8th Nainital Monsoon Mountain Marathon on Sunday. Arun Adhikari and Lakshman Singh were only three kilometres from the finish line when the dogs attacked them. Meanwhile, another athlete, Pramod Patni, received several scratches after being attacked by a monkey during the marathon.
