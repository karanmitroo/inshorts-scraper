Rising Pune Supergiant's MS Dhoni and Manoj Tiwary got stranded at the striker's end on the last ball of the second-last over against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Saturday. Dhoni, playing on 27 from 19 balls, ran the first run before calling out Tiwary to abort the second run. Tiwary reached the same end as Dhoni's before Bhuvneshwar Kumar ran him out.
