South Africa's JP Duminy slammed five sixes in seven balls, with bowler Eddie Leie conceding 37 runs in a single over during a domestic one-day match in South Africa. The analysis for the over read 6-6-6-6-2-5nb-6. The 37-run over is the second-most expensive in List A cricket history, after the 39-run over bowled by Bangladesh's Alauddin Babu in 2013.
