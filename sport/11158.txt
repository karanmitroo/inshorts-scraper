New Zealand's Matt Henry took a diving catch to dismiss Mohammed Shami, during the second Test against India at Eden Gardens on Saturday. Playing a shot off a Trent Boult bouncer, Shami scooped the ball towards the fine leg boundary, which was caught by Henry, fielding at long leg. The fielder was congratulated by both teams for his effort.
