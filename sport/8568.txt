Bollywood actor Aamir Khan's next movie may be based on the story of Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar and her coach Bisheshwar Nandi, according to reports. Representatives from Aamir Khan's production house reportedly visited Tripura last week to study the places where the gymnast grew up. Notably, sports-based movies 'Dangal' and 'Sultan' were two of the top-earning movies of 2016.
