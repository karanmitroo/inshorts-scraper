Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal missed a run-out opportunity in his first over as non-striker Jason Roy was stranded near the batsman's end. Chahal threw the ball to MS Dhoni rather than dislodge the bails at his own end. The same over saw a six from Jason Roy, a wicket by Chahal, and a comical piece of fielding by Amit Mishra.
