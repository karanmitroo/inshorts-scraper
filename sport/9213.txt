Tanzania's Super Middleweight Intercontinental Champion Francis Cheka, who will be facing Vijender Singh for the WBO Super Middleweight Asia-Pacific title on 17 December, has claimed he felt sorry that India picked Vijender Singh to fight him. "Vijender's Olympic medal is nothing...Vijender looks scared already. India will be ashamed on Saturday," added Cheka.
