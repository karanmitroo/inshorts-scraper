Australian Open quarter-finalist Tennys Sandgren has apologised for his 2012 tweet wherein he stated that a visit to a gay club "left his eyes bleeding". This comes after the 26-year-old was slammed for his political beliefs over his Twitter activity. Later, Sandgren deleted almost all of his tweets and accused the media of "demonising" and "propaganda".
