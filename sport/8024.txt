Manchester United lost 1-2 to Hull City in the second leg of their League Cup semi-final on Thursday, but won 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final of the tournament. Hull ended United's 17-match unbeaten run with goals from Tom Huddlestone and Oumar Niasse. However, Paul Pogba's 66th-minute strike was sufficient to set up the final for United against Southampton.
