Howard Lam, an activist in Hong Kong has alleged he was beaten, "stapled" and dumped on a beach by Chinese agents over his plan to send a Lionel Messi-signed photograph to deceased Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo's wife. China jailed Xiaobo over a pro-democracy manifesto which called for an end to one-party rule and improvements in human rights in China.
