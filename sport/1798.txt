Two French wingsuit flyers managed to land inside a moving plane after jumping from the Jungfrau mountain in Switzerland's Bernese Alps. Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet sped through the air at over 130 kmph after jumping from over 13,000 feet before managing to glide into the aircraft. The duo had completed over 100 test flights in preparation for the stunt.
