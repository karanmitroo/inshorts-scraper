Following India's loss in the second T20I against New Zealand, former cricketer VVS Laxman said MS Dhoni should make way for youngsters in T20Is. In regard to Dhoni's 37-ball 49 in the match, Laxman said, "That's not good enough when India were chasing a mammoth total." However, Laxman later added, "Dhoni is definitely an integral part of ODI cricket."
