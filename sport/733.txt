India have retained the ICC Test Championship mace and won a $1-million award after defeating South Africa by 63 runs in the third Test in Johannesburg. Top-ranked India lost the Test series 1-2 but the win ensured that South Africa cannot move ahead of them before the cut-off date of April 3. Kohli will be presented with the mace later.
