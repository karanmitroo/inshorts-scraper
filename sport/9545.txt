Malaysia has cancelled two friendly under-22 football matches with Myanmar, in protest against Myanmar Army's alleged crackdown on ethnic Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, Malaysian officials said on Thursday. Further, Malaysia's Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said that Myanmar's membership of the 10-nation ASEAN group should be reviewed because of the "cruelty" imposed on Rohingya Muslims.
