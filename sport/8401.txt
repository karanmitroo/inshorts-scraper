In his first conference after resigning as India's limited-overs captain, MS Dhoni said Virat Kohli will win more matches than he did. "Virat and his team will win more games than me in all formats. It will be the most successful Indian team ever," he said. Dhoni captained India in 199 ODIs, winning 110, the most in Indian cricket history.
