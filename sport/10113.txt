Striker Neymar scored his 50th international goal during Brazil's 3-0 victory over Argentina in a 2018 World Cup qualifier on Thursday. Neymar converted a Gabriel Jesus pass on the stroke of the half time to bring up the landmark goal. The 24-year-old is the fourth highest goalscorer for Brazil and needs 28 more to top the list.
