Former Australian captain Steve Waugh's son Austin Waugh hit an overhead bouncer for a six playing it like a forehand crosscourt shot. The 17-year-old was playing for 'Ponting XII'  against 'Gilchrist XII' in a curtain-raiser match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday, which was organised to showcase Australia's best underage talent.
