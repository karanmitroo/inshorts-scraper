Virat Kohli has become the only player to score four double centuries in four consecutive Test series, hitting his career's fourth 200 against Bangladesh on Friday. With the double ton, Kohli also equalled Don Bradman and Rahul Dravid's record of three 200s in one season. Kohli was given out LBW at 180, but the decision was reversed after a review.
