Former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson revealed that former teammate Shane Watson stuck his head in a toilet during their time together at the Cricket Australia academy in 2000. As a part of daily wrestling bouts at the academy, Johnson was dragged before having his head pushed into a toilet, which resulted in both players pointing raised fists at each other.
