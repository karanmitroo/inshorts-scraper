Former Indian captain MS Dhoni's daughter Ziva was invited to Kerala's Ambalappuzha Temple as a special guest after the two-year-old's Instagram account posted a video of her singing a Malayalam song. Ziva, who is seen singing a song from the Malayalam film 'Adhwaytham' in the video, learned the song from her nanny who hails from Kerala.
