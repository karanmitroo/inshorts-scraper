England pacer James Anderson, who became the sixth bowler to register 500 Test wickets last week, has dismissed Sachin Tendulkar nine times in 14 Tests, the most times a bowler has taken his wicket in Test cricket. The Englishman has also claimed Michael Clarke's wicket nine times and dismissed South African legend Jacques Kallis seven times in his career.
