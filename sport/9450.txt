Virender Sehwag took to twitter to wish Indian batsman Shikhar Dhawan on his 31st birthday. He tweeted, "Happy Birthday @SDhawan25. May you do Bhoomi Poojan in dressing room and Naagin Dance on pitch for at least 2 hours every time while batting." Dhawan is currently out of the Indian Test squad and is playing Ranji matches to earn a berth.
