BVB Dortmund's defender Marc Bartra revealed in an Instagram post that Tuesday's attack on the team bus, which left him with an arm injury, were the longest and hardest 15 minutes of his life. Three explosions had gone off as the Dortmund team bus made its way to the stadium shortly before their Champions League clash with AS Monaco.
