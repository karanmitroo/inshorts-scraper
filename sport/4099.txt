Swimmer Michael Phelps, who was supposed to swim 100 metres alongside a great white shark, said it is "not his fault" that people thought he would be racing the real animal. Phelps, who was slammed for competing against a computer simulation, said he had clarified earlier he would not be in the water at the same time as the shark.
