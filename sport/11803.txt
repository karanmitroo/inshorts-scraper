South Africa defeated New Zealand by 204 runs to win the second Test, and the series 1-0 on Tuesday. Chasing a 400-run target, New Zealand were dismissed for 195, courtesy Dale Steyn's 26th five-for. Steyn, who became the first bowler since 1982 to dismiss both openers for golden ducks, climbed to the 10th-spot on the all-time highest Test wicket-takers' list.
