Shooter Jitu Rai, who finished eighth in men's 10-metre air pistol at the Rio Olympics, has said "Olympics aren't the end of the world". "I've got everything I asked for in preparation from the Army. It was not my day in Rio, you give your best and it doesn't show...The disappointment is huge, but I couldn't sit crying," said Jitu.
