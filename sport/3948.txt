BCCI's acting president CK Khanna on Thursday said that the board is working on a plan to ensure that domestic cricketers of all age-groups get a minimum 50% pay hike. This comes after former cricketers, including Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly, had proposed an increment for domestic players. The percentage pay for domestic players was last revised in 2007.
