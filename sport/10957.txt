NZ began their first innings at 5/0, as India were handed a five-run penalty after Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja repeatedly ran over the pitch's protected area. The Law 42 of the MCC states that if a batsman damages the pitch's protected area, a five-run penalty is awarded to the batting side along with returning the batsmen to their original ends.
