Ex-Indian captain Rahul Dravid was involved in two of ODI cricket's top three partnerships. Dravid's 331-run stand with Sachin Tendulkar against New Zealand on November 8, 1999, was ODIs' highest-ever partnership for over 15 years. The stand had come six months after Dravid and Sourav Ganguly smashed the then-highest partnership of 318 against Sri Lanka in the 1999 World Cup.
