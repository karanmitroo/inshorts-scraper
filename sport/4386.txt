Former cricketer Ravi Shastri has been named the new coach of Team India on a two-year contract, after BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee interviewed five candidates on Monday. This will be Shastri's second stint with the team, after being the director from 2014 to 2016. Shastri applied for the post after BCCI extended the deadline for applications, following Anil Kumble's exit.
