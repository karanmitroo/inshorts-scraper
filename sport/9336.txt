Australian captain Steven Smith, while fielding at the second slip, took a one-handed catch to dismiss Trent Boult off the bowling of Pat Cummins. Smith stretched and timed his jump to snatch the ball going towards the third man. The catch also brought Australia's victory in the final match of the series, which Australia won 3-0.
