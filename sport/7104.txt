The longest recorded cricket match was the 'timeless' Test between England and South Africa which started on March 3, 1939 in Durban. The match was abandoned after ten playing days (eighth day was rained off) because the ship taking the England team home was due to leave. A record Test match aggregate of 1,981 runs was scored in the match.
