England's Sam Billings pulled off a catch after jumping from over the boundary to dismiss James Faulkner during a T20 tour match on Friday. Billings first caught Faulkner inside the boundary and tossed the ball before crossing the boundary after losing balance. Billings then jumped from outside the rope and caught it while still in the air.
