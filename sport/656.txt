Hyderabad captain Ambati Rayudu has been banned by BCCI for two matches for leading on-field protests against umpires during a domestic T20 match against Karnataka on January 11. Hyderabad had lost the match by two runs after officials added two runs to Karnataka's total after their innings. Rayudu had led protests demanding a super over, delaying the second match scheduled.
