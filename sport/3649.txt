Adi Dave, a 15-year-old boy of Indian origin, came on as a substitute fielder in a three-day match between Steve Smith XI and David Warner XI in Australia on Thursday. Dave was placed at short leg, playing for Australian captain Steve Smith's side. He is a left-arm orthodox spinner, who played in Cricket Australia's Under-17 National Championships last year.
