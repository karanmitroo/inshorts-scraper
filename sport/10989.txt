Playing for the Victorian Bushrangers in the Matador Cup at Perth on Saturday, Glenn Maxwell reacted by taking a diving catch on the boundary. Western Australia's batsman, D'Arcy Short hit a lofted shot towards the long-off boundary, where Maxwell waited for the ball, saved a six, and set up the catch for teammate Rob Quiney.
