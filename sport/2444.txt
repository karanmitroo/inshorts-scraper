Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola blamed the ball used in the Carabao Cup match against Wolverhampton after the team failed to find the back of the net in 120 minutes. "It is too light... moves all over the place, it is not a good ball", Guardiola said. City eventually progressed to the next round after winning in the penalty shootout.
