NBA legend Michael Jordan, who turns 55 today, once scored 38 points in Game 5 of 1997 NBA Finals for Chicago Bulls against Utah Jazz, despite having 103-degree fever. The game, which Bulls won 90-88, came to be known as the "flu game". In 2013, Jordan's sneakers that he wore during that game were sold at an auction for $104,765.
