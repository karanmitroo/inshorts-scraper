Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium pitch curator Pandurang Salgaoncar has been suspended after a sting operation found him offering to tamper the pitch on the eve of the second ODI between India and New Zealand in Pune. Salgaoncar also allowed the disguised reporters to inspect the pitch in person, which is a major violation of BCCI and ICC rules.
