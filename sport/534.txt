Former South Africa coach Ray Jennings alleged that South African team management tried to 'doctor pitches' during the Test series against India, and claimed the tactic almost backfired as they nearly lost the series. Jennings further said, "Such pitches won't help because India have a great pace attack. Even the spinners will get assistance from seam friendly juiced up pitches".
