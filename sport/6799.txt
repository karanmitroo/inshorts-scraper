India's lone individual Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra on Friday said the country should forget about 2020 Olympics as the time to make significant changes to the system is too short. "[We] should start working for 2024 Olympics and beyond...That requires the systems, that requires long term investment, that requires patience. We need to set systems in order," added Bindra.
