A fan ran onto the pitch and touched former Indian captain MS Dhoni's feet when he was at the crease, during Jharkhand's Vijay Hazare Trophy quarter-final match against Vidarbha in Delhi on Wednesday. Dhoni obliged the fan with an autograph before the latter left the field. Throughout the match, the crowd chanted Dhoni's name at the fall of every wicket.
