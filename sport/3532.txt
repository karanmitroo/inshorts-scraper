Japanese boxer Shinsuke Yamanaka's promoters have said that the boxer will retire from the sport if he is denied a rematch with WBC bantamweight champion Luis Nery, the man who took his title on August 15. The promoters also claim that the 34-year-old would not fight another opponent in case Nery is stripped off the title.
