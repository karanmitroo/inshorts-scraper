Tennis player Nick Kyrgios will play a celebrity NBA game in February, after his contract with an ATP event in Netherlands was cancelled. "It doesn't make sense to have him if he's not 100% motivated," the tournament director said. The ATP banned Kyrgios earlier this week following "perceived lack of effort" in the Shanghai Masters tournament.
