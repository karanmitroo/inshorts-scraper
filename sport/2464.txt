Former Test cricket umpire Darrell Hair, who no-balled Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for 'chucking' in 1995, has pleaded guilty to charges of embezzling and stealing money from a liquor store where he worked. Hair, who officiated in 78 Tests from 1992 to 2008, has been handed an 18-month good behaviour bond by an Australian court.
