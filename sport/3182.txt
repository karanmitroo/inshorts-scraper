Playing cricket has been banned in parks of Bolzano, a city in northern Italy, after a ball hit a two-year-old in the head. The boy, who was about 100 metres away from the game when the ball hit him, suffered a concussion. Cricket will now be restricted to tennis courts and a baseball field in the city, according to officials.
