Following India's win over Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, skipper Virat Kohli has said he does not consider Australian cricketers his friends anymore. "I thought that was the case but it has changed for sure...in the heat of the battle, you want to be competitive but I have been proven wrong...you won't hear me say that ever again," Kohli said.
