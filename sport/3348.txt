Wales forward Gareth Bale performed a back-heel to nutmeg two opponents who were trying to wrestle away the ball from him during a World Cup qualifier match against Austria. Bale was near the corner flag with his back to the defenders when he did the back-heel move. Notably, Bale once made a back-heel assist for Cristiano Ronaldo against Borussia Dortmund.
