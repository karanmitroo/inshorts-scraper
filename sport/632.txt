Tony Chapron, the French referee who kicked out at a footballer before sending him off during a Ligue 1 game, was handed a three-month ban with a further three months suspended ban by the Ligue 1. Chapron had apologised for his actions the following day of the incident and called his own reaction "clumsy" and "inappropriate".
