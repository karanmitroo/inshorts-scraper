Pakistan's World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan has ignored an invitation from PCB chairman, Najam Sethi, to attend a Pakistan-World XI match in Lahore. Sethi announced he invited 17 former players for the series including Javed Miandad. This will be the first international series in Pakistan after Zimbabwe's one-off tour in 2015 following the 2009 terror attack on Sri Lanka.
