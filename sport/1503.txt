A minimum of 98 overs will be bowled on each day of four-day Tests as compared to 90 overs in five-day Tests. To accommodate additional eight overs in four-day Tests, the play will be extended for 30 minutes per day. In four-day Tests, 150-run first-innings lead will be enough to enforce the follow-on as compared to 200 in five-day Tests.
