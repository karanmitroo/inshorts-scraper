Harbhajan Singh has said he hopes Ravichandran Ashwin and other Indian spinners "break all records". Earlier, Harbhajan had said that spinners were being assisted and performing well because of "tailor-made pitches". "We have all capable spinners in the team who can take wickets on any sort of track. What you need to do is just be more patient," he said.
