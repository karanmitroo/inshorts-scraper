Former Indian cricketer Dilip Doshi was once given run out after he left his crease to complain about the shadow of a tree on the pitch. The incident happened on December 9, 1979, during the Delhi Test against Pakistan. The batsman, however, was able to resume his innings after Pakistan captain Majid Khan withdrew the appeal.
