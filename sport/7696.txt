Indian rower Dattu Bhokanal, who finished 13th in men's single sculls at the Rio Olympics, has not received monetary assistance from the Maharashtra government, which had promised cash awards for each state athlete going to Rio. Bhokanal, who has two brothers to look after, said, "There's no help from the government... I've just stopped talking to any of these officials".
