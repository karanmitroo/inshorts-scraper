Former Indian captain MS Dhoni has said that he doesn't want youngsters to play helicopter shots as they can get injured. "It is difficult. In tennis ball cricket even it's hit from the toe of the bat the ball still travels...in normal cricket it has to be the middle part, so it requires a lot of work," said Dhoni.
