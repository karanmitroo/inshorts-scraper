An angry West Ham United fan confronted Chelsea's players after they scored during the teams' Premier League match at the London Stadium on Monday. Chelsea's Eden Hazard opened the scoring in the 25th minute and as the players were celebrating, a Hammers fan invaded the pitch and screamed at the players. He was intercepted by security, who took him away.
