Several Barcelona fans chanted "Neymar muérete" (Neymar die) during the team's friendly match against crash-struck club Chapecoense at Camp Nou on Monday. This comes after Neymar's €222 million move to PSG last week, making him the world's most expensive footballer. Chapecoense plane crash survivor Alan Ruschel featured in the match and exchanged his jersey with Lionel Messi.
