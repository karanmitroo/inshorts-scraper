Police forces in England took a dig at Arsenal, who are currently 16th in the Premier League standings, while urging fans "to not use mobile phones while driving" on the transfer deadline day. "Using your mobile for #DeadlineDay updates? You'll have twice as many points as Arsenal if we catch you doing it at the wheel.#DontRiskIt," read Dorset Police's tweet.
