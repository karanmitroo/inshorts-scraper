Retweeting a tweet about his comeback into the Indian cricket team, Yuvraj Singh on Friday posted,  "Yeah baby... tra laaa laa laaaa." The left-hander, however, deleted the tweet after some time. Yuvraj was selected for the national side for the ODI and T20I series after his performance in the Ranji Trophy where he scored 672 runs in five matches.
