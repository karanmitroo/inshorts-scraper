Indian pacer Umesh Yadav's reverse swinging full-length delivery, on the third ball of the 79th over of the English innings, dislodged Jonny Bairstow's leg stump to end his 53-run innings. Bairstow and Ben Stokes had put together 110 runs for the sixth wicket, before Yadav's reverse swinging yorker hit Bairstow's pad first and then dislodged his leg stump.
