Australian skipper Steve Smith has been ruled out of the three-match T20I series against India and is returning home to take care of his shoulder injury. The Australian captain picked up the injury during the fifth ODI in Nagpur after he landed awkwardly on his right shoulder. In Smith's absence, David Warner will be leading the T20I side.
