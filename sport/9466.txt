German football player Lukas Podolski's song ‘Liebe deine Stadt’ (‘Love Your City’) has become the most downloaded song in Germany over the past seven days. The 31-year-old, who currently plays for Galatasaray, teamed up with rappers Mo-Torres and the band Cat Ballou, to create the song. "I want to thank you for your support of the song", said Podolski.
