The official Twitter and Facebook accounts of FC Barcelona were hacked on Wednesday, with the hackers posting fake news of the club acquiring former Real Madrid and current PSG player Ángel Di María. The hack's responsibility was claimed by OurMine group, which had previously hacked Twitter accounts of Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and recently, Game of Thrones and HBO.
