A Bangladeshi website has blamed the curator of the pitch at Wellington for the team's seven-wicket loss to New Zealand on Monday. The website accused the curator of watering the reserve pitch under the instructions of New Zealand coach Mike Hesson, who was talking to the curator before the incident. Watering the reserve pitch is illegal as per ICC rules.
