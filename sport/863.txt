Karnataka captain Vinay Kumar produced a Jonty Rhodes-style run-out to dismiss Punjab's Gurkeerat Mann in a domestic T20 match on Sunday. Kumar, while fielding at mid-off, grabbed a throw before running towards the stumps and flying to uproot the stumps. Former South African cricketer Rhodes had dismissed former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq in the 1992 World Cup through a similar effort.
