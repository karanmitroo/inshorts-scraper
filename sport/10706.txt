The one-millionth run in Test cricket history was scored by Australia against India on October 19, 1986, nearly 109 years after the first Test was played in 1877. The two-millionth Test run, however, was scored only 26 years later in 2012 by Sri Lanka against England. The second million took 985 Tests, while the first required 1,054 matches.
