Video replays were tested for the first time in an international football match during Franceâ€™s 3-1 win over Italy in a friendly match on Thursday. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said that "football history" was made. He hopes the technology will be used at the 2018 World Cup, with tests scheduled in six countries, including Germany, in the next two years.
