Wellesley Bolt, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's father, has said he hoped his son would have put off retirement for another two years. "At 31, I think he could probably do another two years, but we cannot get him to do it, we have to just accept it," said Wellesley. Bolt retires after the IAAF World Championships in London next month.
