Veteran Sri Lanka pacer Lasith Malinga was used as a net bowler at a special practice session with new Sri Lanka coach Chandika Hathurusingha in Colombo. Malinga, who is not part of the preliminary pool of 23 players for the upcoming triangular series in Bangladesh, said he was "still waiting" for the reason why he was not picked.
