England pacer James Anderson is set to return to the England squad ahead of the first Test against India 
at Rajkot. Anderson was not selected in the initial 17-man squad as he was recovering from a shoulder injury. Anderson has reportedly made a quicker than expected recovery and would be in contention to play in the second Test at Visakhapatnam.
