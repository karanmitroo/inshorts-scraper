The SC-appointed BCCI Committee of Administrators has decided to switch to online financial transactions to make direct payments to its cricketers at all levels. The current procedure wherein BCCI sends players' fees to state associations, which then hand over the cheques, will end. This decision comes after some officials at state boards were found to be involved in corruption.
