US President-elect Donald Trump was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 and has made six appearances at WrestleMania. In the 2007 edition of the event, Trump had a bet with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon following their 'Battle of the Billionaires'. Trump got into an off-ring bout and shaved McMahon's head after the latter lost the bet.
