Boxer Vijender Singh, who defeated Tanzania's Francis Cheka to retain his WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title on Saturday, dedicated his win to Army jawans. "I got the news that three of our soldiers died today. I got a little emotional when I was getting ready...Lot of soldiers have sacrificed their lives and this win is for them," said Vijender.
