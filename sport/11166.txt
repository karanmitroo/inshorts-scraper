Kolkata's Eden Gardens, which is currently hosting India's 250th home Test, is the second-largest cricket ground by capacity. The ground, with a capacity of 66,000, is second only to Australia's Melbourne Cricket Ground which can seat almost 90,000 people. However, prior to the Eden Gardens' renovation in 2011, it was the largest cricket ground, with a capacity of around 1,20,000.
