Si-am Juntakereket, a British boy, has become the fastest child to cycle across Australia after completing the almost 4,500-kilometre-long journey from Sydney to Perth in just 29 days. Juntakereket, who began the journey as a 13-year-old, cycled around 160 kilometres a day and slept in a tent as he went. Notably, Juntakereket is raising funds for learning disability charities.
