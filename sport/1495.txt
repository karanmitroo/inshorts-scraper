Australia needed one run off two balls with one wicket remaining when Windies' Joe Solomon's direct hit resulted in the first-ever tied Test. The match's last over, consisting of eight balls, involved a leg-bye, bye, caught behind, dropped catch, and two run-outs. The first-ever tied TestÂ ended on December 14, 1960, almost 84 years since the first Test in 1877.
