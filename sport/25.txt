New Zealand chased down England's 335 in the fourth ODI on Wednesday despite losing their openers for ducks to level the five-match series 2-2. New Zealand were driven by Ross Taylor who slammed his career-best 181, the third highest score by a Kiwi batsman and the fourth-highest overall in a run chase. The series decider will take place on Saturday.
