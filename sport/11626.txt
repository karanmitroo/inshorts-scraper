ICC has withdrawn its two-tier Test system proposal, following opposition from BCCI, with support from Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, West Indies and Bangladesh. The proposal suggested dividing Test-playing nations in two leagues, with teams being promoted or relegated on basis of performance. A Federation of International Cricketers' Association survey had revealed 72% players were in favour of division.
