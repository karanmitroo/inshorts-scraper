On October 11, 1956, Australia and Pakistan scored 95 runs combined on day one of their one-off Test, to record the fewest runs scored in a full day's play. Australia were dismissed for 80 in their innings, while Pakistan ended the day at 15/2. It remains the only instance in Tests that an uninterrupted day witnessed fewer than 100 runs.
