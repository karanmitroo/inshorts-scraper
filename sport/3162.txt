Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik trolled teammate Ahmad Shahzad after the latter wished him for becoming the highest run-getter for Pakistan in T20Is on Wednesday. Replying to one of Malik's tweet, Shahzad congratulated Malik and called him "great" to which Malik replied, "Thank you bro kabhi mujhe bhi mauqa de apko great bolne ka."
