Mohammad Azharuddin's nomination for the Hyderabad Cricket Association President has been rejected. Former HCA President Arshad Ayub said Azharuddin is ineligible for the post as per the association's constitution, which requires a nominee to have served as executive council member and office-bearer. Azhar also requires clearance from the BCCI following his life ban.
