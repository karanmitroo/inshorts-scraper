Two men have been charged after fake eyeballs were thrown onto the pitch during a Scottish Championship match on January 2, which involved a player with one eye. Falkirk fans threw plastic eyeballs at Dunfermline midfielder Dean Shiels, who had his right eye removed in 2006. Falkirk apologised to Shiels for the "abhorrent behaviour of a small number of individuals".
