A Brondby fan threw four dead rats at Copenhagen players during the closing stages of the derby match between the football teams on Monday. The dead rats were directed at Copenhagen's Benjamin Verbic and Ludwig Augustinsson as they readied to take a corner. Both the players tried to kick the rats away before ground officials came to tackle the situation.
