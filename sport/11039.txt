The Institute of National Anti-Doping Organisations (iNADO) has said that the International Olympics Committee must redeem itself at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games after having “failed the clean athletes” at the Rio Olympics in August. The IOC had resisted calls for a blanket ban on Russians competing in Rio and had left the decision to ban athletes on sporting associations.
