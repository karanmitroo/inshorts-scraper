Over 60 members from various NASCAR teams came together to attend a five-year-old kid named Jake's funeral after his mother had requested on TV if the NASCAR community could attend it. The NASCAR members were seen in their uniforms as per the request. Jake, who was suffering from leukemia, was a NASCAR fan and his favourite driver was Richard Petty.
