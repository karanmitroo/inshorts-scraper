UFC champion Conor McGregor posted a photo on Instagram of him reading a newspaper upside down while sitting in a jet. The photo, which was captioned "Don't read the paper. MAKE THE PAPER.", featured a news story about Conor with the headline, 'Can Conor live happily ever after?' McGregor had posted a similar photo last year too.
