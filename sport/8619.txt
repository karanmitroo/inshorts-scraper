African Footballer of the Year nominee Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had to attend the black-tie Confederation of African Football Awards in a t-shirt, jeans and baseball cap. Borussia Dortmund and Gabon forward Aubameyang had his luggage lost by Lufthansa Airlines and had reached Nigeria just an hour before the ceremony, forcing him to attend the event in casual wear.
