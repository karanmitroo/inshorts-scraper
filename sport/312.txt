Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan tied the knot for the third time on Sunday. Khan's wife, Bushra Wattoo, is a 'spiritual adviser', also known as 'Pinki Pir'. The 65-year-old first married in 1995 to Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of a British billionaire, before separating in 2004. He later married TV anchor Reham Khan in 2015 but parted ways 10 months later.
