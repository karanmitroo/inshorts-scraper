The 2017 edition of the San Isidro's bullfighting fair began in Spain. In 2013, Spain's tradition of bullfights was named part of the country's cultural heritage. Fights in the festival include novillos (young bulls) and rejones (bullfights on horseback). In 2016, a 29-year-old matador died after being gored by a bull, which led to the immediate suspension of the festival.
