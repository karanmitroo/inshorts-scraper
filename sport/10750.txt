Pakistan defeated West Indies by 56 runs in the side's 400th Test match on Monday. Chasing a total of 346 on the final day, the West Indies side was spurred on by Darren Bravo's 249-ball 116, which proved to be insufficient. Pakistan's Azhar Ali was adjudged the Man of the Match for his triple-ton in the first innings.
