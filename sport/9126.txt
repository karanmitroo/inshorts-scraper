The police reportedly detained young Mumbai cricketer Pranav Dhanawade, famous for his 1009-run innings in school cricket, for not being able to vacate the Subhash Maidan in time. Police had asked the youngsters training there to vacate as a politician's chopper had to land. The 16-year-old was abused by a senior police officer in the police station, his father claimed.
