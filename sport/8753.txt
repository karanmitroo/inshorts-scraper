The ongoing All India Police Equestrian Championship and Mounted Police Duty Meet has been named after the deceased police horse Shaktiman. The decision was taken by the host, National Police Academy (Hyderabad). Shaktiman was injured in an attack by BJP MLA Ganesh Joshi in Dehradun. The horse's left leg had to be amputated, but he later succumbed to his injuries.
