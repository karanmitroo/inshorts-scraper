New Zealand's Jake Robertson proposed to his girlfriend and fellow runner Magdalyne Masai after finishing second at the 21-kilometre-long Great North Run on Sunday. Masai, who finished fourth among women, met Robertson on the finish line where he proposed to her. Robertson finished only six seconds behind British legend Mo Farah, who won the race for record fourth consecutive time.
