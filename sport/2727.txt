Major League Baseball (MLB) has fined Arizona Diamondbacks coach Ariel Prieto for wearing his Apple Watch during a game against the Colorado Rockies earlier this week. Investigators pointed out there was "no evidence" of cheating, but the mere presence of the smartwatch was enough. The fine imposed by MLB will be donated to Hurricane Maria relief in Puerto Rico.
