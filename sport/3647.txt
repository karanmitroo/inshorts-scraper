FC Barcelona's players will wear special shirts with 'Barcelona' written on the back instead of their names as a tribute to the victims of Thursday's terror attack in the city. "#TOTSSOMBARCELONA" ("We are all Barcelona") will be embroidered on the front of the shirts. The players will also wear black armbands during the team's opening league game of the season.
