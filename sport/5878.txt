Matias Dituro, the goalkeeper for the Bolivian side Bolivar, scored from inside his own penalty area against Club San Jose on Sunday. After Club San Jose's goalkeeper came up the pitch for a corner late in the game, Dituro collected the loose ball and struck it the full length of the pitch and into the unguarded net.
