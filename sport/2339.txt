India have been assured of a medal in the Asian Women's Boxing Championships even before the start of the tournament, as boxer Seema Punia was drawn in the semi-finals. Punia's +81kg weight category had just four boxers in the draw and the two losing semi-finalists will get a bronze medal each. Punia will face Uzbekistan's Guzal Ismatova on November 7.
