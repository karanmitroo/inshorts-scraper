Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that it was his mother who started the "Sachin Sachin" chant. "I used to go play downstairs and to call me back home, my mother would say 'Sachin Sachin upar aa jao'...never thought 'Sachin Sachin' would continue beyond my playing days," the cricketer said at the launch of the "Sachin" anthem from his biopic.
