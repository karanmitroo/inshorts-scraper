Australian Test captain Steven Smith has said that success in the upcoming four-match Test series against India can make his Australian side "one of the all-time-greats". "A lot of people have written us off...We just need to get our processes right," added Smith. Notably, Australian team last won a Test series in India nearly 13 years ago.
