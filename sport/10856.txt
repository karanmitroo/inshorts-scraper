The family of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes walked out of an inquest into his death on Friday, after a submission from the lawyer for Cricket Australia that the batsman hadn't been subjected to threatening language. Hughes died two days after being hit on the back of the neck by a rising delivery in a domestic match on November 25, 2014.
