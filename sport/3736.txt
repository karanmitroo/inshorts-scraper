Long-distance runner Mo Farah has announced he wants to be known as Mohamed upon his foray into road racing. "My road name is Mohamed. I just feel like Mo is done. I need to forget about what I've achieved and what I've done," he said. Farah bagged a silver at the World Championships in his last track race on Saturday.
