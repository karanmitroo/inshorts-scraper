Mumbai-based swimmer Mohammad Shams Alam Shaikh set the longest open-sea swimming record by covering 8 kilometres in a span of four hours and four minutes. Shaikh, who swam in Goa's open seas, had a tumour in his spine, which rendered his lower body completely paralysed. Shaikh will apply for the record to be included in the Guinness World Records.
