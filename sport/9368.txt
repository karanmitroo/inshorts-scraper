The first double-century in men's ODIs was scored by Sachin Tendulkar in 2010, almost 39 years after the introduction of ODIs. The next double-ton came within two years as Virender Sehwag smashed 219 on December 8, 2011, while the sixth and the latest one was made by Martin Guptill in 2015. Rohit Sharma and Chris Gayle have also scored double-tons.
