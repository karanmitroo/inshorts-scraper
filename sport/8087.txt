The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has denied former Indian cricketer S Sreesanth a No Objection Certificate (NOC), which he required to play in the Scotland Cricket League. The Kerala pacer has been banned for life by the BCCI for being involved in the spot-fixing scandal which hit the Indian Premier League in 2013.
