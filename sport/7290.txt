Indians fielders dropped Australian captain Steve Smith three times on Day 2 of the Pune Test while Matt Renshaw was also given a respite. The Australian skipper was first dropped by Murali Vijay at leg slip while he was batting on 23, followed by two unsuccessful catch attempts by substitute Abhinav Mukund. Renshaw's drop also cost the team four runs.
