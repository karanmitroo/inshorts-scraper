Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin put to rest the rift with fellow spinner Harbhajan Singh by calling Harbhajan the inspiration behind him starting to bowl off-spin. The 30-year-old spinner also condemned the "unhealthy" banter going on in social media. Harbhajan had earlier stated that he would have had more wickets if he had played on turning tracks like Indore among others.
