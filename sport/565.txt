Former Argentine player Diego Maradona has been denied entry to the US because he insulted President Donald Trump, his lawyer has claimed. This comes after Maradona called the US President a "puppet" during a TV interview. He was to fly to Miami to face trial in a court case involving his ex-wife Claudia Villafane.
