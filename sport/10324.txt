South African pacer Dale Steyn has been ruled out for six months after fracturing a bone in his right shoulder on the second day of the first Test against Australia. Steyn was seen clutching his shoulder after bowling the fourth delivery of his 13th over. Steyn would be returning to SA after the WACA Test to see a shoulder specialist.
