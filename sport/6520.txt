Swiss skier Andri Ragettli landed the world's first quad cork 1800, a stunt which entails doing five rotations while simultaneously dipping one's head under the body four times, at the Suzuki Nine Royals in Italy. The 18-year-old managed to achieve the trick while flying 35 metres over a snow feature. Ragettli said that he hadn't planned on doing the trick.
