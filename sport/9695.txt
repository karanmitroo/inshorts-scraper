Shuttler Saina Nehwal has said a player is heavily criticised in India if he/she suffers a defeat. "Successful athletes are under huge pressure to keep winning...The Indian public gets very attached to you when you accomplish something great, but if you lose, they are going to criticise you in a bad way," said Saina.
