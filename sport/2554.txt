Sachin Tendulkar tweeted a birthday wish for Virender Sehwag, written in inverted English alphabets. Sachin tweeted that since Sehwag always did "ulta" (reverse) of what Tendulkar asked him to do, the wish was inverted. "Thank you Godji. Uparwala sab dekh raha hai, yeh to suna tha, par aaj samajh aaya, woh neeche waalon ke liye likhta kaise hai," replied Sehwag.
