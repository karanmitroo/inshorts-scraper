West Indies cricket legend Brian Lara, while delivering the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture said that he is embarrassed by the team's tactics used to dominate the sport in the 1980s and 1990s. Lara said that the tactics employed by the West Indies sides resulted in them "playing the game in a way it should never, ever be played."
