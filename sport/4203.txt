Sri Lanka's Sports Minister has given his support for an official probe into the national side's loss in the final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. The Sri Lanka cricket team lost the World Cup final by six wickets at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. It is alleged that four last-minute squad changes were made, without the minister's customary approval.
