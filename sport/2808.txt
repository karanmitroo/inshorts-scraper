Eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt and USA's Justin Gatlin, who beat Bolt to claim gold at the World Championships, have been excluded from the list of nominees for IAAF's World Athlete of the Year awards. It is the first time since 2004 that a world or Olympic 100m champion has not been shortlisted for the title.
