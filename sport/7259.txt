Suspended Pakistan cricketer Sharjeel Khan has claimed his innocence over spot-fixing charges and has said that he was tricked into meeting a bookie by fellow player Nasir Jamshed. Khan said that Jamshed insisted Sharjeel and Khalid Latif meet a fan, who later turned out to be the bookie. "We got up and left the moment we realised," he added.
