Cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said that he endorses the opinion of cutting all ties with Pakistan until cross-border terrorism stops. "I totally endorse that until the time we don't secure our own Indians, our own countrymen, all other things can be kept asideâ€¦we should not have any relationship with Pakistan until cross-border terrorism is over," said Gambhir.
