Jharkhand player Ishan Kishan has revealed skipper MS Dhoni sent a text message to all team members asking them to keep calm during a major fire in their hotel on Friday morning. "Even Mahi bhai was unable to come out...We really did not know what to do...Everything was dark. We had to leave all our gear behind," said Ishan.
