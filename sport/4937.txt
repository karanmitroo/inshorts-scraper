Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag jokingly termed Bangladesh "India's grandson" and Pakistan "India's son", in his tweet appreciating Bangladesh's effort to reach Champions Trophy semis. India beat Bangladesh on Thursday to set up Champions Trophy 2017 final clash against Pakistan, to which Sehwag reacted, "Father's Day par Bete ke saath final hai." The final will take place on June 18.
