A rescue pup doing ball boy duties at an exhibition tennis match in the Brasil Open in SÃ£o Paulo last week pooped on court while fetching the ball. Dogs were appointed as ball boys to promote two shelters, with four animals wearing orange ribbons, being especially trained for the job. Dogs did the duties at the same tournament last year.
