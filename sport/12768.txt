Hundreds of fans of former Argentine captain Lionel Messi held a protest march in Buenos Aires on Saturday to urge the player to come out of his retirement. Fans gathered around the Obelisco, a monument in the country’s capital where people traditionally celebrate sporting victories. "There's a saying that there's a Messi every 500 million years,” a fan said.
