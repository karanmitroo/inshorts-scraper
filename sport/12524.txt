A six-year-old Bengaluru boy skated under 35 cars parked next to each other on Sunday to set the Guinness World Record for farthest distance limbo-skating under cars. The boy, Om Swaroop Gowda, held his body parallel to the ground and covered a distance of 65 metres under the cars to shatter the previous record of 48.21 metres set in 2012.
