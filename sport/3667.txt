Thierry Henry, Arsenal's highest goal-scorer of all time, has said the Premier League trophy should be renamed after former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who won it a record 13 times. "When I met him for the first time, I called him Mr. Premier League. Thirteen. This is ridiculous...Im not a Man United fan. Thirteen times...is too much," said Henry.
