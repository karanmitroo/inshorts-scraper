Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal has decided to donate ₹6 lakh, ₹50,000 each, to the families of the 12 Central Reserve Police Force jawans killed in an attack in Chhattisgarh last week. Saina, who turned 27 on Friday, said she is pained by what happened in Chhattisgarh and this is a small contribution to the families who have suffered irreparable loss.
