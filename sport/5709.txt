The BCCI is reportedly upset with Indian team coach Anil Kumble as he is in support of the team's participation in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy. BCCI has been planning to boycott the tournament after ICC revised its revenue-sharing and governance model. Notably, the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators has ordered BCCI to select the squad for the tournament.
