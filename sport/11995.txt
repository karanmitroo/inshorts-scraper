Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt said he has proven to the world that "[He's] the greatest," and deserves to be counted amongst sport's all-time greats. â€œI am trying to be one of the greatest. Be among Ali and Pele," said Bolt after his 200-metre win. The eight-time Olympic gold medallist holds a total of 19 Olympic and world titles so far.
