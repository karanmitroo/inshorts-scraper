Following India's win over Australia in the Dharamsala Test, former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson said Ajinkya Rahane should continue as India captain instead of Virat Kohli. "Rahane should stay captain! It was a tough series but I believe it should stay on the field with the players," Johnson tweeted in response to an article shared by Cricket Australia regarding Kohli.
