Chelsea defender David Luiz showed magic tricks to Chelsea's team doctor Paco Biosca after one of Chelsea's recent matches. Luiz asked the doctor to pick a card from a pack of playing cards and show the card to teammates Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. Luiz then shuffled the deck before bringing the chosen card to the top of the pack.
