Australian opening batsman David Warner was dismissed on 99, only to score a century off the next ball after the dismissal was found to be off a no-ball, resulting due to the bowler's overstepping. Warner was caught trying to pull debutant Tom Curran's ball on the first day of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne on Tuesday.
