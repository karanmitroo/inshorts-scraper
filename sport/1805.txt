A new mixed gender team competition is set to be introduced at the European Games in 2019 in Minsk. The new event, called Dynamic New Athletics (DNA), will feature Europe's top 30 countries competing across 10 events in two hours, culminating in a staggered pursuit relay called the 'Hunt'. Each team will feature nine women, eight men, and six reserves.
