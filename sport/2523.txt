Tony Kemp, a comatose football fan whose life support machine was to be switched off, reportedly woke up after his family played his team's favourite crowd chants at his bedside. The 59-year-old, who suffered a mini-stroke caused by an aneurysm in the frontal lobe, heard Plymouth Argyle's chants 'Pride of the West Country' and 'Janners' before opening his eyes.
