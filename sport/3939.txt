A fox interrupted play during a domestic T20 match between Middlesex and Hampshire at the Lord's Cricket Ground on Thursday. The fox made its appearance, scampering across the outfield, during the 14th over of the Hampshire innings and was quickly chased from the field. Hampshire went on to chase the target of 136, winning the match by six wickets.
