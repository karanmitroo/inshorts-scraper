Hockey legend Dhyan Chand, in the 1936 Berlin Olympics final, asked his players to 'teach a lesson in ball control' to the Germans, after he lost a tooth in collision with the German goalkeeper. Indians would take the ball into German circle, and return without scoring. India went on to win 8-1, and registered their third successive Olympic gold medal.
