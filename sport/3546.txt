MS Dhoni survived getting bowled out after Sri Lankan pacer Vishwa Fernando's ball hit the stumps but failed to dislodge the bails during the second ODI. The incident took place in the 35th over when Dhoni was batting on 29. Dhoni went on to score 45* and share a 100-run partnership with Bhuvneshwar Kumar to give India a three-wicket win.
