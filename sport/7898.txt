The head of the Supreme Court-appointed interim BCCI panel Vinod Rai has said that he wants to clean cricket and his role would be akin to a 'nightwatchman' in cricket. "I've no BCCI exposure, but I'm very fond of cricket and am very interested in ensuring the game runs in the right direction," said Rai.
