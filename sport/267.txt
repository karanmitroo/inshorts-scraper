South African cricketer Lungi Ngidi, who made his international debut against India in January, has revealed he chose fast bowling as his parents couldn't afford a batting kit during his childhood. Ngidi, who also used to play rugby, said he decided to pursue cricket in grade 10. "Through cricket I've been able to improve my parents' lives," the 21-year-old added.
