Floyd Mayweather reportedly tried placing a â‚¹2.5-crore bet on him winning the bout against Conor McGregor in 9.5 rounds, few hours before the fight. Mayweather was barred from placing it as he was betting on something other than a straight win. He then tried to make a bet on a knockout but left the sportsbook as he had to wait.
