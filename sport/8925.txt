Commentator Bill Lawry made fun of former Australian cricketer Shane Warne over a dropped catch in 1999 that denied Australian pacer Damien Fleming his career's second hat-trick. Facing India, Fleming bowled a rising delivery which Javagal Srinath edged towards the first slip, where Warne dropped the catch before dropping down on the ground with disappointment.
