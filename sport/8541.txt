Australian spinner Adam Zampa said Ravichandran Ashwin did not reveal his set of variations to Steve Smith when they played together for Rising Pune Supergiants in IPL 2016. "I think there was one net session to Smithy where he just bowled leggies for an hour. I don't think he wants to give too much away," said Zampa.
