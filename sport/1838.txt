Calling for resumption of cricketing ties between India and Pakistan, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, "PM went to Lahore and participated in a wedding ceremony, a birthday party...so if all that could happen, why can't we play cricket." Tharoor added, "Why should sport, and cricket in particular...have to bear the burden if diplomacy cannot change the nature of Pakistani state."
