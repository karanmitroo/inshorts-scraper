There have been only three instances in Test history of a team suffering an innings defeat after scoring 400 in their first innings. England, who lost to India by an innings on Monday, earlier suffered an innings defeat after making 405 against Australia in 1930. Sri Lanka lost by an innings to England in 2011, after scoring 400.
