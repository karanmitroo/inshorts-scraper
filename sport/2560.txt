India coach Ravi Shastri is the world's highest paid cricket coach, a survey by an ESPN magazine has revealed. Shastri's salary is around $1.17 million (â‚¹7.61 crore) per year, which is only less than what a top player from Australia, England and India earns. Australia's Darren Lehmann is second, while now-ousted South Africa's Russell Domingo is last on the list.
