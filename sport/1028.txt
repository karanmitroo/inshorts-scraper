Indian cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar's son Arjun Tendulkar says that his father wants him to be a 'fearless' cricketer. The all-rounder grabbed four wickets and scored a 27-ball 48 while playing for the Cricket Club of India at Bradman Oval recently. Speaking about Sachin's advice to him, Arjun said, "[He says] be a team man and give everything you've got."
