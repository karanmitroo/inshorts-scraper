Indian captain MS Dhoni is likely to play his first international match in over two months without any official match practice. The first ODI against England, scheduled for January 15, is expected to be Dhoni's first match since October 29. He is reportedly training with Jharkhand but is not playing in Ranji as he has retired from the longer format.
