Jesús Tomillero, who is Spain’s first openly gay football referee, has received homophobic death threats following his return to the game months after quitting in the wake of abuse. The 21-year-old, refereeing in a second-division match between CD Lasalle and Atlético Zabal, was told to "get off the pitch for being gay", after he awarded a penalty to Atlético Zabal.
