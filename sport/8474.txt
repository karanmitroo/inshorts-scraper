Tennis player Andy Murray will be referred to as 'Sir' by local broadcasters of the Australian Open after being knighted in Britain's New Year Honours list. The 29-year-old had earlier admitted he had reservations about accepting knighthood since he would get distracted. He added he asked fellow players to continue calling him 'Andy' when asked how he should be addressed.
