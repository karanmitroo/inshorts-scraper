Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag tweaked a famous dialogue of Bollywood film 'Gangs of Wasseypur' to describe pacer Mohammad Shami's batting. After Shami slammed a six each off South African pacers Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel on Friday, Sehwag tweeted, "Morkel ko 6, Rabada ko 6. Vijay ka, Rahul ka, Pujara ka, Sabka badla lega re tera Shami."
