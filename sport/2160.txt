Indian shuttler Kidambi Srikanth, who recently climbed to the second spot in the men's singles world rankings, is set to miss the China Open Super Series due to a leg injury. The 24-year-old will be back in action after a week's rest at the Hong Kong Super Series, where he will have the chance to become the world number one.
