Fans were asked by religious leaders to mourn at Iran's FIFA World Cup qualifier against South Korea on Tuesday, since the game coincided with the festival of mourning, Ashura. Clerics warned that the spirit at the game "be one of Ashura and Karbala", with the stadium being covered in black and 'Ya Hussein' be chanted, instead of clapping.
