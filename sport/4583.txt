Following his knock of 78*(79) against Windies on Friday, former Indian captain MS Dhoni compared himself to wine. Dhoni, who won a man of the match award after nearly two years, was asked his thoughts on getting better with age, to which he replied, "It's like wine." During the match, Dhoni became the second highest ODI run-scorer as a wicketkeeper.
