Reacting to Pakistani pacer Wahab Riaz's moustache inspired by former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson, a user tweeted, "Garibon ka Mitchell Johnson." Other tweets read, "Mooch rakhnay se koi Johnson nahin ban jaata," "So is Wahab Riaz vying for a post retirement career in Tamil movies," and, "When you order something online and you receive a third copy of the product."
