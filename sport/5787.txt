Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma, who celebrated his 30th birthday on Sunday, is the only player to have scored two double hundreds in One Day International cricket. Sharma's 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014 is One Day International cricket's highest individual score. Rohit also jointly holds the record of hitting most number of sixes in an ODI innings.
