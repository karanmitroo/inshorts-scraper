Former Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist became the first player in history to hit 100 sixes in Test cricket on November 17, 2007, almost 130 years after the first Test was played, in Melbourne in 1877. During his unbeaten 67 against Sri Lanka at Hobart, Gilchrist hit his 99th and 100th six over midwicket off consecutive deliveries from Muttiah Muralitharan.
