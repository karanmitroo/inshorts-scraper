MS Dhoni and current Test skipper Virat Kohli have identical captaincy records after 20 Tests. Kohli, who became Test captain in December 2014, has 12 wins, two losses and six draws, which is similar to Dhoni's record after 20 games. Kohli registered a streak of 16 unbeaten Tests after the Mohali win, which is the third-longest for an Indian captain.
