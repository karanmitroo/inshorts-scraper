FIFA on Tuesday announced that penalty shootouts will be used to decide drawn matches between teams in the group stages of the FIFA World Cup, which shall feature 48 teams from the 2026 edition onwards. The move is aimed at minimising the risk of teams colluding in their final group games to eliminate others from the tournament.
