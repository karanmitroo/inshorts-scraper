Members of the Indian cricket team have reportedly not been paid their match fees, besides the BCCI-announced â‚¹1 crore bonus, for the past six months. While players were unaware of the reason for the delay, a BCCI official said it was because of "various issues," including the stand-off between the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators and the BCCI.
