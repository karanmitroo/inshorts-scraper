Reacting to footballer Cristiano Ronaldo's new statue, which was unveiled at Portugal's Madeira airport on Wednesday, a user tweeted, "I hope now, after this, Ronaldo doesn't become the 'BUST' of all jokes." Other tweets read, "You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about #RonaldoBust #Ronaldo," and, "Looks like a #Messi fan designed this master piece."
