Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar, who finished fourth in Rio, has said that she cannot even think of returning the BMW car that was presented to her by Sachin Tendulkar. Due to unavailability of BMW service centres in Tripura, Dipa's coach asked Hyderabad Badminton Association members to give her cash price for buying a car whose service is available in Tripura.
