Former players Shane Warne, Ramiz Raja and Mike Atherton got together to pick two dream teams, one from the 90s, while another from the current players. Ex-Pakistan captain Wasim Akram led the former team, which included Sachin Tendulkar and Warne himself. The currently active team was led by Indian Test captain Virat Kohli and also featured spinner Ravichandran Ashwin.
