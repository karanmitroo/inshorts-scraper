In order to revive Test cricket and attract large crowds towards it, former Australian cricketer Dean Jones has stated that there should be a Test World Cup. Jones said that currently the way Test cricket is played means nothing and it only affects the rankings. Jones further suggested that the length of a Test should be trimmed to four days.
