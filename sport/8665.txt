Australian batsman David Warner reached his fifty in 23 balls, the second fastest in Test cricket, against Pakistan on Friday. Looking for quick runs to set Pakistan a big target, Warner smashed 20 runs off four consecutive deliveries of spinner Yasir Shah. The record for the fastest fifty is held by Misbah-ul-Haq, who had reached the score in 21 balls.
