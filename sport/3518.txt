Cricketer Gautam Gambhir on Saturday condemned the violence in the wake of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's conviction, calling the events 'a classic case of religion marketing'. Former cricketer Virender Sehwag also requested people to "maintain calm and peace" after the violence by Dera Sacha Sauda followers took lives of over 30 people and injured over 250.
