Playing only his second ODI, Pakistani fast bowler Usman Khan picked up five wickets in 21 balls against Sri Lanka in the fifth ODI, to claim the third-quickest five-wicket haul in ODIs since 2001. The 23-year-old left-arm pacer dismissed three of the Sri Lankan batsmen for a duck, reducing Sri Lanka to 20/5 in 6.3 overs.
