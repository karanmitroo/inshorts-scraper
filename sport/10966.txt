New South Wales Coroner's inquest into the death of Phillip Hughes has been opened, almost two years after the Australian cricketer passed away after getting struck by a ball during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The inquest took into account the short-bowling tactics and allegations of sledging by the opposition, which could have led to the incident.
