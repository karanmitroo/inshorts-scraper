Former cricketer Virender Sehwag, known for his funny tweets, said, "I am very much politically correct in my humour. If you look at my twitter wall, you won’t find a single tweet that has hurt anyone". "I just believe in wishing my colleagues and other celebrities in a manner that brings my wit out”, added Sehwag about his birthday wishes.
