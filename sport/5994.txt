A pool cue measuring 17 feet 7.4 inches, which was used by Florian Kohler from France, is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the 'world's longest usable pool cue'. The stick, made using the same materials as a regular-sized cue, was used to pot seven subsequent balls. The record was set in Las Vegas, United States in March 2017.
