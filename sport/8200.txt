After the Amicus Curiae in the BCCI-Lodha case submitted names of potential BCCI administrators to the Supreme Court, the court asked why the list included those aged over 70 years. As per Lodha recommendations, people aged over 70 are ineligible to hold posts in BCCI or state associations. SC had earlier entitled the Amicus Curiae to propose six administrators.
