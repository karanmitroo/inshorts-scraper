A police constable opened fire at two kabaddi players, Lakhwinder Singh and Varinder Singh, in Moga, Punjab, on Tuesday, following a personal feud. The players, who received three bullets each, are now out of danger. While Lakhwinder has played for the Punjab Thunder team in the World Kabaddi League last year, Varinder has played in several national tournaments.
