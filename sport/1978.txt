India were not awarded five runs despite Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal breaking the 'fake fielding' law during India's innings in the first Test on Saturday. Chandimal pretended to throw the ball even though it was nowhere near him, but the umpires did not signal the penalty. Virat Kohli was seen gesturing for a five-run penalty from the dressing room.
