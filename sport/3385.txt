Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand will return to the FIDE World Cup after 15 years, leading a seven-member Indian team at the 128-player knock out tournament in Georgia. Anand never needed to play at the World Cup ever since winning the World Championships in 2007. Anand will take on 18-year-old Malaysian Li Tian Yeoh in the opening round on Sunday.
