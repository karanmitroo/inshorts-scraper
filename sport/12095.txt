British police authorities are investigating the allegations that Britain's 18-year-old tennis player Gabriella Taylor was deliberately poisoned, after she was forced to pull out from this yearâ€™s Wimbledon junior tournament's quarterfinals. The 18-year-old spent several days in intensive care after suffering from a disorder diagnosed as leptospirosis, a bacterial disease spread by animals.
