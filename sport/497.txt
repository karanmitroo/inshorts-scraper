As many as 432 balloons were released in the air from the stadium when Kapil Dev took his 432nd wicket and became the then world's leading Test wicket-taker on February 8, 1994. Dev surpassed Richard Hadlee's record of 431 wickets after dismissing Sri Lanka's Hashan Tillakaratne in Ahmedabad. Dev is the only Indian pacer to take 400-plus wickets in Tests.
