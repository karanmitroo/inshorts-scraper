The ban on Italian Serie A side Pescara's Ghanaian midfielder Sulley Muntari has been rescinded by the Italian football federation. Muntari, who was handed a one-match ban, had left the field after being booked during Pescara's Serie A fixture for complaining about the racist abuse from the stands. "I was being treated like a criminal," Muntari said about the incident.
