Norwegian skier Therese Johaug's ban has been extended by five months to 18 months in a doping case involving a steroid in lip balm. The ban will keep Johaug out of Winter Olympics in February 2018. The skier had failed a drug test after she ingested the steroid through a lip cream which was given to her to treat burns.
