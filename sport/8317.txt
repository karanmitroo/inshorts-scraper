Former Indian captain Anil Kumble became only the third cricketer in history and first in Indian cricket to reach the 600-wickets mark in Tests on January 17, 2008. He achieved this feat when he picked up Andrew Symonds' wicket during a Test against Australia at Perth. Kumble finished his career as India's highest wicket-taker in Tests (619) and ODIs (337).
