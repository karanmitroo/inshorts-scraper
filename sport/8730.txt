Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi says that the biggest regret of his career was Pakistan's defeat at the hands of the Indian cricket team in the semifinal of the 2011 World Cup. “Not winning it (World Cup 2011) as a captain is regretful. I think it was Pakistan’s best ever performance in a WC in a very long time,” Afridi said.
