A government women's college cricket team won an inter-university cricket championship in J&K playing in burqas and hijabs. According to their coach, the girls' parents gave their consent only if the girls were allowed to wear hijabs or burqas while playing. "The journey hasn't been smooth. When I walked in my tracks with bat, people would complain," said a player.
