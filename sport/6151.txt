Kolkata Knight Riders' captain Gautam Gambhir took a fumbling catch on his 4th attempt in KKR's IPL 2017 match against Kings XI Punjab on Thursday. Kings XI's Varun Aaron hit a lofted shot off Chris Woakes' bowling in the innings' final over before Gambhir's effort, which materialised after him turning almost 360-degrees due to his fumbles.
