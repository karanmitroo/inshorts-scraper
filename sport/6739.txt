Former Australian batsman Dean Jones has said Aussie fans dislike Virat Kohli as much as ex-England captain Douglas Jardine, who started the Bodyline series in 1932-33. "Kohli is now Australia's No. 1 enemy or the 'head of the snake', as Nathan Lyon put it...If Kohli gets under your skin...offer the cheeky smile that Sir Donald Bradman offered Jardine," said Jones.
