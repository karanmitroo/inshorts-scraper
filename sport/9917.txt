The Belgium national football team performed the mannequin challenge featuring Premier League players Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, among others. The team, after its 8-1 thrashing of Estonia, did the 'freezing' act in the team hotel, striking various poses in the lobby, while working out at the gym, and eating at the dining table.
