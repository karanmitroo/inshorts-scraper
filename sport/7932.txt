England captain Eoin Morgan expressed disappointment about the quality of umpiring in the second T20I against India on Sunday, saying they will submit their feedback to the match referee. England's Joe Root was adjudged LBW by the umpire in the final over despite cameras showing an inside edge. "I don't see why we can't have DRS in T20s," said Morgan.
