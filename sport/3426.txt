Reacting to Sachin Tendulkar's tweet calling Bangladesh's Test victory over Australia  an 'upset', a user tweeted, "How have u regarded it as upset? It's a Test match of five days. More importantly, 15 sessions. We outplayed 'em." "Upsets for England & Australia who misread West Indies & Bangladesh as UNDERDOG respectively," wrote another user.
