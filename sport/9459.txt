Commenting on BCCI's opposition to Lodha recommendations, former cricketer Kirti Azad said that BCCI is like a "spoilt child who is crying after his toys have been taken away". "Cricket isn't anybody's property. The current officials feel that BCCI is their personal fiefdom," he added. Azad further said these recommendations should be applied in all sports federations to eradicate corruption.
