The Sri Lankan cricket team's physio and trainer have banned players from eating biscuits in the dressing room, ahead of the limited-overs series against India. Reports had earlier stated that Sri Lankan cricketers had broken crockery in the dressing room to protest the ban, but manager Asanka Gurusinha denied the news. The players have reportedly backed the rule.
