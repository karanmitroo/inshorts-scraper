Indian cricketer Suresh Raina has cleared the mandatory Yo-Yo test for Team India selection at the National Cricket Academy, Bengaluru, days ahead of India's tour of South Africa. Raina, who last played for India in a T20I in February, had failed the test earlier this year, missing out on a place in Indian side for the Sri Lanka limited-over series.
