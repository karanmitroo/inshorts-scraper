Thirty-two-year-old Australian ultra-marathon swimmer Chloe McCardel will become the first person to attempt a non-stop quadruple crossing of the English Channel this month. McCardel, who is one of the four people to complete a triple crossing of the icy channel, will take 45 hours for the 136-kilometre swim. The water body contains a lot of flesh-eating sea fleas and sharks.
