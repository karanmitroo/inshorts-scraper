Singapore's Joseph Schooling, who defeated Michael Phelps at the Rio Olympics, has apologised to Malaysians for saying he was going to teach their swimmers a lesson at the South East Asian Games. The 22-year-old, who won Singapore's first Olympic gold in the 100 metres butterfly in Rio, won nine golds at the last SEA Games in Singapore two years ago.
