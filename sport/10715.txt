Indian offspinner Harbhajan Singh trolled Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba with a picture he tweeted after the midfielder's match against Liverpool on Monday. The spinner's tweet claimed that Pogba should copy the hairstyle as seen in the photo he posted, which will help the French midfielder be 'visible on the pitch'.
