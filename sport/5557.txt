Former Kings XI Punjab player Ravi Bopara made fun of a Kings XI Punjab supporter by sharing an Instagram video in which the supporter appears to be looking at team owner Preity Zinta while sitting behind her in the stands. Bopara, who is not a part of IPL this season, captioned the video, "Check the guy out behind P.Zinta #naughtynaughty".
