Stating that Alastair Cook has the best chance of surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's records in Test cricket, former all-rounder Ian Botham said, "Cooky is the one player who has any realistic chance of challenging Sachin Tendulkar's run-scoring feats." Notably, the 32-year-old reached the 11,000-run mark in Tests recently in the series against India and is trailing Tendulkar by 4,864 runs.
