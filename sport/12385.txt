Brazilian graffiti artist Eduardo Kobra is attempting the world’s largest mural by a single artist, in Rio ahead of the Olympics. Kobra’s mural, which is 190-metres and 15.5-metres tall, depicts faces of five people from five continents. About 1600 litres of paint and 3500 cans of spray paint were used in the mural, which will be unveiled on July 30.
