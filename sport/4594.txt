Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Saturday said that the Champions Trophy final between India and Pakistan appeared to be "fixed" and demanded an inquiry into the matter. "How could [Indian] cricketers, who played so well in the entire tournament, did not perform in the final ?" he added. Pakistan defeated India by 180 runs in the final on June 18.
