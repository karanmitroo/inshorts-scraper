Former cricketer and MP Sachin Tendulkar has sanctioned ₹2 crore from his Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme fund for revamp of rail foot overbridges in Mumbai. This comes after 23 people died in the stampede on a foot overbridge in September. Every year, MPs are allotted ₹5 crore to take up development projects in their constituencies.
