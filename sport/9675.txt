Australian and South African cricketers were seen wearing black armbands to mark the second death anniversary of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes on the fourth day of the third Test at Adelaide. Hughes passed away on November 27, 2014, in a hospital in Sydney, two days after being struck on the head by a Sean Abbott bouncer in a domestic match.
