A lawsuit filed in US-based Baylor University alleges that more than 30 football players were responsible for at least 52 rapes over a four-year period. The lawsuit was filed by a former Baylor University student who says she was raped by two football players in 2013. The school faces at least five lawsuits from women who allege they were attacked.
