There have only been two instances of three English batsmen scoring a century each, in the same innings of a Test in Asia. Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes scored centuries in the ongoing first Test against India at Rajkot. The other instance is of 1961 when Geoff Pullar, Ken Barrington and Ted Dexter each made hundreds in Kanpur.
