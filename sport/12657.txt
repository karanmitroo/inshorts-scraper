Actor Aamir Khan has sent handwritten letters to Rio-bound wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Babita Kumari, wishing them luck ahead of the event. The move comes after Aamir met the two during the shooting of his upcoming movie ‘Dangal’, in which he plays the role of former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, who is Babita's father and Vinesh’s uncle.
