Sachin Tendulkar has said the third umpire should intervene in controversial dismissals even if the batsman doesn't ask for a DRS review. "DRS is all about getting decisions right...all three umpires should be working as a team," said Sachin. He spoke in reference to Cheteshwar Pujara not taking a review despite being not out in the second innings at Rajkot.
