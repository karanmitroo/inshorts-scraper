Former Australian captain Steve Waugh has picked his teammate Adam Gilchrist as the greatest cricketer of the post-2000 era. "I was lucky enough to be Gilchrist's captain. He definitely changed how wicket keepers are perceived nowâ€¦He's put a lot more pressure on them because they've got to be great batsmen now, so they probably all hate him," said Waugh.
