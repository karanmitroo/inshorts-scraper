The Supreme Court on Thursday quashed a criminal case against ex-India captain MS Dhoni in the Andhra Pradesh High Court for hurting religious sentiments. The complaint was filed by a social activist after Dhoni was depicted as Lord Vishnu on a magazine cover, holding a shoe in his hand. SC concluded Dhoni had no malicious intent while dismissing the case.
