Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman took Ravi Shastri's 'Tracer Bullet Challenge', which requires the players to imitate Shastri's style of commentary and include "like a tracer bullet" in their imitations. The challenge was also taken by commentators during the Vizag Test, and has now been thrown open to the public, with people tweeting their #TracerBullet videos to Shastri.
