Former India captain Rahul Dravid has said he is "more a failure than a success". "I'm actually quite qualified to speak about failure. I played 604 matches for India. I didn't cross fifty 410 out of those 604 times. If you just do the math, I was more a failure," he added. He said taking failure well is "really important".
