WBO champion Manny Pacquiao says he is willing to fight UFC Champion Conor McGregor if the latter's bout with Floyd Mayweather does not happen. "I don't know if they are taking it seriously... In boxing (would fight McGregor) but not in UFC, just boxing," said Pacquiao. Mayweather offered McGregor $15 million to fight, while McGregor asked for $100 million.
