MÃ¡laga played out a goalless draw against Barcelona after being reduced to nine men following two red cards in the second half of their La Liga fixture at Camp Nou on Saturday. Barcelona were playing without Lionel Messi after the forward felt sick prior to the match. Barcelona are currently second in La Liga, four points behind Real Madrid.
