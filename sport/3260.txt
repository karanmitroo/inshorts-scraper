England's top tier football club Tottenham Hotspur has unveiled the world's first-ever dividing retractable pitch at its new stadium. The retractable grass football pitch will sit on top of an artificial pitch which will be used by American football league NFL. The football pitch will be rolled up using rails and three trays, taking around 25 minutes to switch surfaces.
