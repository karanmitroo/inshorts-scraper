Ex-Australian spinner Shane Warne has claimed Herschelle Gibbs' controversial dropped catch off Steve Waugh's batting in the 1999 WC was legit. Waugh was batting on 56 when Gibbs, who had taken the catch, immediately dropped the ball while throwing it up in celebration. Waugh told Gibbs that he had dropped the World Cup, and went on to make match-winning 120*(110).
