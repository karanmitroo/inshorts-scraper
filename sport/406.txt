Biathlon, a Nordic winter sport, which is also a part of the ongoing Winter Olympics, is a mix of cross country skiing and precision rifle target shooting. In a biathlon, competitors race around a closed course carrying .22 caliber rifles which weigh over 3.5 kg on their backs, and stop at designated spots to shoot targets over 50 metres away.
