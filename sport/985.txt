India's 2011 World Cup-winning coach Gary Kirsten suffered a cracked jaw after getting struck by a drive during a Big Bash League practice session. Kirsten was giving throwdowns when the incident happened and required dental work to fix up chipped teeth. The 50-year-old Hobart Hurricanes' coach didn't require surgery and was seen in the dugout in the BBL on Monday.
