MS Dhoni signalled to take a DRS review even before the umpire could completely raise his finger to declare Jasprit Bumrah out in the first ODI against Sri Lanka. Dhoni took the call from the non-striker's end after the Sri Lankan team appealed for LBW. The review found that the ball had pitched outside off-stump, resulting in the decision's reversal.
