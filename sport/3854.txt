Indian cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara has said he is learning to sledge on the field, which he would not do earlier. "I wouldn't sledge earlier but now I'm learning... It's a crucial part of the game and you need to learn a little bit of that, but it should not be personal," said Pujara, during an interaction with Ajinkya Rahane.
