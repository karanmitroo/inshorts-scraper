The first-ever forfeit in Tests, in an England-Pakistan match in England on August 20, 2006, happened after 1,813 Tests and 129 years of international cricket. Pakistan, captained by Inzamam-ul-Haq, refused to come out on the pitch after tea on Day Four, since England were awarded five penalty runs for alleged ball tampering. The match was awarded to England in 2009.
