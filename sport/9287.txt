Former England captain Nasser Hussain got Sachin Tendulkar stumped out for the only time ever in Test cricket by asking spinner Ashley Giles to bowl outside the leg stump. The strategy was employed to make use of the rough, as well as to control the run flow. Sachin got stumped when he missed the ball while advancing down the wicket.
