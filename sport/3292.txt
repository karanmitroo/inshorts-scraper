After India completed a 9-0 all-round whitewash over Sri Lanka, the team's coach Nic Pothas compared the Virat Kohli-led Indian team to New Zealand's All Blacks rugby squad. "There is a lot of respect for the opposition, they are very ruthless in the way they go about their work...They are what a lot of teams aspire to be," said Pothas.
