Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene trolled a fan on Twitter, who had wished him on the International Women's Day on March 8. The fan's tweet read, "Happy women's day to the best Sri Lankan cricketer," to which Jayawardene replied with, "You should know the difference of Mahela and Mahila?"
