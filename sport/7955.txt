Citing Sachin Tendulkar's example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly address 'Mann ki Baat' on Sunday urged students to learn from the life of cricket legend in order to compete and improve. "[Sachin] kept breaking his own records... and got better... with each passing day. The secret of his success was self-competition and not competition with others," Modi added.
