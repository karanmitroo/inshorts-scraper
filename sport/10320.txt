Australian player Mitchell Starc dropped a sitter at mid off, during the ongoing Australia-South Africa Test at Perth on Saturday. SA opener Dean Elgar, who was batting on 81*, hit a scoop shot off spinner Nathan Lyon's bowling towards mid-off where Starc was fielding. The Australian attempted the catch but stumbled in the process, with the ball landing beside him.
