In his recently-released autobiography, South Africa captain AB de Villiers has said losing the 2015 World Cup semi-final to New Zealand was his career's "greatest disappointment". De Villiers suggested racial factors influenced the selection, with "player of colour" Vernon Philander being selected ahead of Kyle Abbott. He has further stated winning a World Cup with SA is his "burning ambition".
