England pacer James Anderson has not been included in the initial 16 man squad for the five-match Test series against India, as he is recovering from a shoulder injury. The injury forced Anderson out of the ongoing series against Bangladesh as well. According to reports, Anderson could be back in the side after the third Test match at Mohali.
