The Sydney Test between India and Australia, infamous for the 'Monkeygate' scandal and a series of umpiring errors, ended on January 6, 2008. Harbhajan Singh was accused by the Australian team of racially abusing Andrew Symonds, following which India threatened to boycott the tour. Harbhajan was fined 50% of the match fees but declared innocent on the racial vilification charges.
