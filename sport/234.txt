Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and his wife Anastasia Bryzgalova have been stripped of their Winter Olympics bronze medals after Alexander admitted to a doping violation. Alexander, who tested positive for the banned substance meldonium, was one of 168 Russians permitted to compete at PyeongChang Olympics as neutrals after Russia was banned over state-sponsored doping at 2014 Sochi Games.
