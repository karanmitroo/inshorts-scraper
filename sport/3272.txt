Team India head coach Ravi Shastri has urged the BCCI to provide the Indian cricket team adequate break between series in the future to avoid player burnout. Notably, Australia will visit India for a limited-overs tour in September, four days after which India will host New Zealand. The team will then be given a week-long break before hosting Sri Lanka.
