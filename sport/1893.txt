Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) will be renamed and restructured to make it more "lean and professional". Rathore added that the word 'authority' will be removed from the organisation's name as the word has no place in sports. The government is also aiming to bring down SAI's strength by 50% by 2022.
