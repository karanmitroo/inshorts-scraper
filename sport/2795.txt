In a casual interview conducted by Rohit Sharma for BCCI, Indian spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav revealed they both are "shy" when talking to girls. "I go mum when there is a girl in front of me," said Chahal. Yadav said he was also like Chahal and hasn't interacted much with girls, as his focus was more on practice.
