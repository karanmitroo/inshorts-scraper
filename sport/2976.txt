The Vijay Balla (Victory Bat), a giant concrete bat, was erected near the Holkar Stadium in Indore to commemorate India's first away Test series victories over England and West Indies in 1971. The bat has inscriptions of all the players involved in the two series including Bishan Singh Bedi, Bhagwath Chandrasekhar, Ajit Wadekar and Sunil Gavaskar.
