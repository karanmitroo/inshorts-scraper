Mumbai Indians' Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga met a man who looked similar to him after his team's match against Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League on Saturday. Malinga's former teammate Mahela Jayawardene tweeted the photo of the two, with the caption that read, "Lasith found his long lost brother in Rajkot".
