Ivorian sprinter Murielle Ahoure celebrated with an Irish flag after failing to find her nation's flag following her gold medal in the 60m race at the world indoor championships in Birmingham on Friday. Ahoure took the Irish flag and reversed it to make it look like Ivory Coast's national flag. Ahoure's compatriot Marie-Josee Ta Lou finished second in the race.
