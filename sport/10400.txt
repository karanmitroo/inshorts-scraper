The base used for the cleanup of the Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant will be made a training camp for the country's soccer team by April 2019, ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. The base, which was converted after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown, had been opened in 1997 as a soccer training camp with 11 pitches and a 1,200 square-meter gymnasium.
