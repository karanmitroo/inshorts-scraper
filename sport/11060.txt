Shradha Vaishnav, an 18-year-old speech and hearing impaired girl, has become the first Indian disabled woman cricketer to be selected in a regular team. Vaishnav, a leg-break bowler who started off as a medium pacer, was named in Chhattisgarh's 15-member women's state team last week. The cricketer was born with an incurable 90% speech and hearing impairment.
