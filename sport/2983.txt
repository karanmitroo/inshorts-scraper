Accepting Sachin Tendulkar's suggestion after eight years, the Cricket Club of India renamed its gate after former BCCI President Raj Singh Dungarpur. In 2009, at Dungarpur's condolence meet, Sachin had suggested renaming the gate after the former chairman of selectors, CCI and BCCI chief. Sachin inaugurated the renamed gate at the Brabourne Stadium, which houses CCI, on Friday.
