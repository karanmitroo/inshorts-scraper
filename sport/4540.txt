Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic faked injury to get a time-out in his first round match at Wimbledon as he felt "bad" and "bored". The 24-year-old, who lost to Mischa Zverev, confessed that tennis did not satisfy him any more and he is aiming to play the sport for another decade so that he won't have to work again.
