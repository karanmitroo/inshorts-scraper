Wasim Jaffer, who contributed in Vidarbha's maiden Ranji Trophy title win this season, did not charge his fee for the season as he was not able to compete for the side last season due to injury. Jaffer said he wanted to return the favour after Vidarbha Cricket Association honoured the contract and paid him despite being out of action.
