India U-19 team coach Rahul Dravid has said that BCCI’s decision to allow players to participate in only one U-19 World Cup, will reduce age-fudging. “Being allowed to play only one U-19 World Cup will mean people are less motivated to alter age. U-19 cricket should be more about exposure and less about results,” said Dravid.
