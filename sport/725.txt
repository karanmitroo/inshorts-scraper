As many as 31 players went unsold out of the 109 players auctioned on day one of the IPL auction on Saturday, including world number one T20I bowler Ish Sodhi. Chris Gayle, who has hit the most sixes in IPL, also went unsold. Further, Joe Root, Hashim Amla, Mitchell Johnson, Murali Vijay and Lasith Malinga did not find any takers.
