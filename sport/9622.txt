Former South African cricket captain Johan Botha, who was recently granted an Australian citizenship, is keen to play for the Australian national cricket team. “They will say I’m too old but I still feel that in the shorter form I can play another two, three or four years,” the 34-year-old said about his wish to play for Australia in T20s.
