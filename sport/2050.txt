Ex-Pakistani pacer Waqar Younis was known as the banana swing bowler due to his technique of swinging the ball in the air at a very high speed. The banana swing delivery swings substantially from the moment it leaves the bowler's hand and follows C-shaped path similar to a banana. Younis, who turned 46 on Thursday, was also nicknamed 'Burewala Express'.
