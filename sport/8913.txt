English umpire David Shepherd would hop and skip on the cricket field every time the scoreboard read 111, 222, 333 and so on. Such a score, called a Nelson in cricket, is considered unlucky and it is believed that having no part of the body in contact with ground brings better luck. Shepherd was born on December 27, 1940.
