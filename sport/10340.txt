Former England spinner Graeme Swann has claimed that England don't stand a chance against India in the upcoming five-match Test series. The 37-year old blamed England for not taking spin seriously and treating their spinners as ‘third-class citizens’. The former spinner believed that England will struggle on subcontinental pitches unless this attitude is changed.
