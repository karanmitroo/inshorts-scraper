Speaking on the third death anniversary of Australian cricketer Phil Hughes, former Australian captain Michael Clarke said that he still thinks about him every day. "I try to on a daily basis think about the times we celebrated, we partied, we sat on the couch, we went for coffee or had breakfast", Clarke said about Hughes.
