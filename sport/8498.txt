Australia batsman David Warner will reportedly use a heavier bat to counter the conditions during his team's India tour. Warner will lower the sweet spot of his bat and have a heavier blade to tackle the lower bounce and sharp turn generated by the Indian spinners. Warner uses 1.23-kilogram bat in Australia but will use 1.28-kilogram bat in India.
