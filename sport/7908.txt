Pakistan's then stand-in captain Shahid Afridi bit the ball in an ODI between Pakistan and Australia on January 31, 2010. A video re-examination found Afridi guilty of ball-tampering, an offence for which he was banned for two T20s. Notably, Pakistan went on to lose the match, thereby suffering a 0-5 series whitewash against Australia.
