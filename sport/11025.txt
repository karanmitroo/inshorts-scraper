Ex-Pakistani skipper Aamir Sohail has said there is "no sense in an international retirement game for Shahid Afridi". "Afridi has announced his intention to retire on a number of occasions which doesn't help his case," said Sohail, adding players prefer to play retirement matches at home, which is unlikely in Afridi's case because of Pakistan's inability to host international matches.
