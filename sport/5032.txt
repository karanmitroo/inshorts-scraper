West Indies player Denesh Ramdin celebrated his second Test century, scored against England at Birmingham on June 10, 2012, holding out a note which read "Yea Viv talk nah". Ramdin, who had not scored a century for three years, held out the note in response to Sir Viv Richards' criticism of his batting. He was later fined for the protest.
