Speaking about the relations with Pakistan, India's Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel said that until Pakistan stops supporting terrorism, India will not have any bilateral sporting ties with it. Goel's statement came after India denied visas to Pakistan's squash and wrestling teams, which were scheduled to participate in the Asian Championships in India.
