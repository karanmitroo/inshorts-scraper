Italian Serie A side Lazio's midfielder Marco Parolo scored four goals, including a hat-trick of headers, as Lazio thumped Italian league's bottom side Pescara 6-2 on Sunday. The forward nodded home crosses from Felipe Anderson and Lucas Biglia, before nodding another from a rebound. The midfielder's hat-trick of headers was the first in a Serie A game in four years.
