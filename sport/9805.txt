Virat Kohli dropped England's Joe Root off Ravichandran Ashwin's bowling, on the final day of the Vizag Test on Monday. Root edged the ball at leg slip towards Kohli, who attempted to catch it single-handedly with his right hand but fumbled in the process. Root, who was at 9* that time, was later dismissed by Mohammed Shami at 25(107).
