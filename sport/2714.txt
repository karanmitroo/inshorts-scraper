A kangaroo hopping onto the race track caused the Bathurst 1000 V8 Supercars race in Australia to be briefly halted. After noticing the marsupial on the track, the yellow flag was waved and the safety car was sent out to slow down the racing cars. In 2004, a race car suffered extreme damage after hitting a large kangaroo.
