Rating points in rankings, which signify a batsman's moving average, are calculated by combining his weighted performance in the latest match with his previous rating. The factors that influence the points include runs scored, ratings of opposing bowling attack, level of scoring and match result, among others. If a batsman achieves over 900 points, it is considered a 'supreme achievement'.
