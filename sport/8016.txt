BBL team Melbourne Stars batsman Kevin Pietersen has responded to Darren Lehmann's tweet in which he asked the franchise to sack the English cricketer. "What a bummer that one is, I can only do my best for the Stars and I think I've done pretty well," said Pietersen. The 36-year-old finished the season as the leading run-scorer for his team.
