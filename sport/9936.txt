A fan of American baseball team Chicago Cubs got his tooth pulled out after the club won its first World Series since 1908. The fan had made a bet with his friends that they could pull out his tooth if Cubs won the tournament. Honouring the bet, he tied his tooth to a rugby ball which pulled his tooth out.
