Following India's biggest away Test win against Sri Lanka, former skipper Sourav Ganguly said that Virat Kohli has not been tested as captain yet and his real test would be how India performs in Tests outside Asia. Ganguly further said that Sri Lanka would not pose a threat to India as they are not the strongest side at the moment.
