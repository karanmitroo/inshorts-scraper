Prime Minister Narendra Modi will informally interact and wish luck to sportspersons representing India at the Rio Olympics, at an interaction organised by the Sports Ministry in New Delhi on Monday. However, with several players currently training abroad, the number of attendees for the event is not fixed. India is sending its largest-ever contingent to the Olympics this year.
