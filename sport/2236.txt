Wishing Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli on the occasion of his 29th birthday on Sunday, former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, "A young, passionate cricketer is now the leader of a world beating team. U've come a long way, wish you tons of success." Kohli, with 32 tons, is only behind Sachin Tendulkar on most ODI hundreds list.
