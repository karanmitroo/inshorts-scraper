Manchester United striker Alexis Sanchez has been handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence in Spain for tax fraud of over $1 million during his Barcelona tenure. However, Sanchez is unlikely to go to jail as Spanish law allows the first sentence of under two years to be served under probation. He was fined around $725,000, besides the amount including interest.
