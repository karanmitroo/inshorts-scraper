Former captain Mohammad Azharuddin expressed shock at Ravi Shastri omitting Sourav Ganguly from his list of best Indian captains. "It was such a stupid thing to say. Can't he see statistics?  [H]is personal bias shouldn't be used to insult those who have contributed more to Indian cricket," Azharuddin said. Shastri had praised Dhoni, calling him the 'dada of all captains'.
