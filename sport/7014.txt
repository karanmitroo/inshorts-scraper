Speaking about Australian captain Steve Smith consulting the dressing room for help before taking DRS, Indian captain Virat Kohli said, "There's a word for that but I don't want to mention that word". When a journalist asked Kohli if that word was "cheating" Kohli just smiled and said, "I didn't say that, you did."
