Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden tweeted an emoji of the wrong flag while wishing India on Republic Day. Hayden called India "a magnificent country" and used an emoji of African country Ivory Coast's flag, which features the same colours as India's. The cricketer later deleted the tweet and posted another one with the correct flag after being checked by followers.
