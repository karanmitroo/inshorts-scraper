Speaking about the recent controversy on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming movie 'Padmavati', 2012 Olympics bronze medalist Yogeshwar Dutt tweeted that literature and history are separate things and there is a difference between 'Paro' and queen 'Padmavati'. Terming 'Padmavati' as a symbol of sacrifice and courage, the wrestler added that caution should be exercised while dealing with such issues.
