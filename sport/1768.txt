Five-time world champion Mary Kom has resigned as the national observer for Indian boxing after Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore said that active sportspersons will not be considered for the position. "I had been requested to take up the position, it was not something I had asked for," she said. She added that she had inquired about the rule before accepting.
