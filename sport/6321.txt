Sunrisers Hyderabad player Ben Cutting ran out RCB's Kedhar Jadhav with a full-toss direct throw from the boundary during the opening match of the IPL on Wednesday. Jadhav went low on a Moises Henriques delivery to play a sweep shot towards long leg. Cutting collected the ball and hit the striker's end, knocking off the stumps from the deep.
