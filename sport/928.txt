Sachin Tendulkar took to Twitter to share two old pictures of himself with Vinod Kambli on the occasion of the latter's 46th birthday. In the first picture, the duo can be seen posing on a bench while the second picture shows Tendulkar grabbing Kambli's neck from behind. "Tum jiyo hazaaron saal aur saal ke din ho hazaar," Sachin wrote.
