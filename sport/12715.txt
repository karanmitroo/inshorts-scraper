Lionel Messi and his father were sentenced to 21 months in prison, and fined approximately $3.9 million for tax fraud by a Spanish court. During the trial, Messi had claimed he "knew nothing" about the management of his finances, saying he was "playing football". They are, however, unlikely to go to jail as the sentence can be served under probation.
