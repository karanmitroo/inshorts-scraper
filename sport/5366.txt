A video showing actor-dancer Prabhudeva teaching former Indian captain MS Dhoni how to dance in a lungi has surfaced online. Dhoni was learning the dance sequence for a two-wheeler company advertisement, wearing a white dhoti or 'veshti' and a shirt. Dhoni is seen emulating Prabhudeva's moves before the two of them complete the sequence together.
