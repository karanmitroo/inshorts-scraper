Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic, who faked injury during his Wimbledon first round match to take a time-out, has been fined $15,000 (nearly â‚¹10 lakh) for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. The 24-year-old confessed that he faked injury as he was feeling "bad" and "bored". Tomic, who crashed out in the first round, added that tennis did not satisfy him any more.
