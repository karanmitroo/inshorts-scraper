In the early days of organised cricket, there were only two stumps with a long bail on top. In a local match played in England on May 23, 1775, bowler 'Lumpy' Stevens bowled three deliveries that beat the batsman and passed through the stumps, without disturbing them or the bail. The third stump was then added to avoid such scenarios.
