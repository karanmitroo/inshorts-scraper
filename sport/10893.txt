Australia have become the first world champions to be whitewashed in two formats of the game. Reigning ODI world cup champions, Australia were number one in ODIs before suffering their first ever 0-5 ODI whitewash by South Africa on Wednesday. They also held the ICC Test Championship Mace before suffering a test series whitewash by Sri Lanka earlier this year.
