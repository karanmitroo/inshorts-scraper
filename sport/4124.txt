El Salvador defender Henry Romero bit US player Jozy Altidore and twisted his nipple during a corner in the second half of the teams' Gold Cup quarterfinal match last week. Romero's teammate Darwin Ceren was also caught biting US defender Omar Gonzalez. Romero has been suspended for six games and Ceren for three for their "anti-sporting" behaviour.
