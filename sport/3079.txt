World's costliest footballer PSG's Neymar had an argument with teammate Edinson Cavani over a penalty on Sunday. Neymar was seen seemingly asking Cavani if he could take it but the latter ignored his request. Earlier in the game, there was a dispute over a direct free kick when Dani Alves took the ball from Cavani and gave it to Neymar.
