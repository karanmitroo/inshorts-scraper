French tennis player Caroline Garcia hit a curling around-the-net shot while playing in the Australian Open 2017's women's doubles quarterfinal match alongside Kristina Mladenovic. Reaching towards an obliquely hit ball, Garcia chased it down before unleashing a curling forehand winner that went from around the net, near the umpire's seat, into the corner of the court.
