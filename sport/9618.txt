Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag revealed that selectors wanted to drop the then out-of-form Virat Kohli from the Test team in the 2012 Perth Test and replace him with Rohit Sharma. Sehwag added that it was him and captain MS Dhoni who decided to back Kohli despite him having scored just 43 runs in 4 innings until the Perth Test.
