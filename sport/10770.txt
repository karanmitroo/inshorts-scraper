On the occasion of former South African cricketer Jacques Kallis' 41st birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Happy Birthday Jhakkas Kallis. @jacqueskallis75 . Feel like asking: Array Oh Kallis, Kitne saal ke ho gaye! #LegendKallis." Kallis, with 13,289 runs, is the third highest run-getter of all time in Tests, behind Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting.
