Barcelona's Luis Su√°rez recently featured in a video by the F2Freestylers, a freestyle football YouTube channel, showing off his first touch skills. The Uruguayan striker, who was asked to control a ball that was thrown from a height of 35 metres, managed to control the ball down dead in his second attempt, with his Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi watching on.
