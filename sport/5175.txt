American baseball team New York Mets' mascot Mr Met showed fans the middle finger after the team's loss in MLB on Wednesday. Mr Met, whose head is an oversized baseball, was walking back to the tunnel when he made the gesture. According to a fan, Mr Met was being heckled by fans, who were saying derogatory things about his mother.
