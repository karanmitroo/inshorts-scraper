Australia's Chris Rogers has admitted his fear of death after being hit on the head during the 2014 Test against India. The incident, which occurred weeks after Phil Hughes' death, involved Rohit Sharma's sweep hitting Rogers on the back of the helmet while fielding at short-leg. Australia's team doctor claimed that Rogers later said that he didn't want to die.
