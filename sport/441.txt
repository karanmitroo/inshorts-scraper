Reacting to Yuzvendra Chahal getting David Miller clean bowled off a no-ball in the Pink ODI, a user tweeted, "Ek no ball ki keemat tum kya jaano Chahal babu!! T20 WC, CT and now, India-SA." Other tweets read, "Spinner bowling no-ball is a crime," and, "When someone says love hurts...Chahal says 'kabhi no-ball pe kisi ko bowled kia hai?'"
