Indian opener Murali Vijay has refused to blame the Pune pitch for India's 333-run loss to Australia in the first Test. "I won't say the Pune wicket was a poor wicket. It was a challenging wicket from ball one...We need to play on such wickets to test our ability," said Vijay. ICC has given the pitch a "poor" rating.
