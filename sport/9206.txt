Cristiano Ronaldo, who won his fourth Ballon d'Or award on Monday, claims that he would have won more awards than rival Lionel Messi if both of them were teammates. "I think great players should play together. So if we were in the same team, I think I would have more than him, but he wouldn’t be far off”, Ronaldo said.
