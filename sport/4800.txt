News channel Times Now was slammed on Twitter for calling Indian cricketers "Ornamental Patriots" for allegedly failing to condemn attacks on the Indian Army. The channel quoted the example of the hockey team, who wore black armbands in support of the Army during their match against Pakistan on Sunday. The channel questioned why the cricketers could not do the same.
