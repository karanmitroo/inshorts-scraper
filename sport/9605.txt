Around fifty athletes participated in the Antarctic Ice Marathon last week, following a marked course of 26.2 miles at the Union Glacier. Organisers have called the marathon the "southernmost marathon on earth" as the South Pole is a few hundred miles away. Gary Thornton and Joanna Medras won the men's and women's race in 3:37 and 6:01 hours respectively.
