Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist congratulated former Indian captain MS Dhoni after he surpassed the Aussie to become the second highest ODI run-scorer as a wicketkeeper while playing against the Windies in the 3rd ODI. Gilchrist posted a photograph of the two with the caption, "Congrats on passing me young fella. Was always a matter of time. #msd #2ndhighest #keepers".
