Spinner Harbhajan Singh, who failed to make it to India's Champions Trophy squad, clarified on Twitter that his comments on MS Dhoni getting special privileges in selection were taken out of context. "MSD is a dear friend &a great player, I never doubted his selection so please don't quote me on things which I never said against him", Harbhajan wrote.
