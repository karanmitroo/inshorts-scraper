Umpire Rod Tucker asked a drunk fan to stop shouting and giving tips to Sri Lankan batsmen during the third day of the second India-Sri Lanka Test at Colombo. The fan was heard telling Kusal Mendis to bat defensively and save his wicket for the next day. Despite Tucker's warnings, the fan continued shouting until the end of the day.
