Indian skipper MS Dhoni pulled off a "no-look" run-out during India's fourth ODI against New Zealand on Wednesday. New Zealand were 222/5 in the 46th over, when Ross Taylor's flick reached the fine leg boundary. Dhawal Kulkarni collected the ball and threw it towards Dhoni, who directed it onto the stumps with his back facing the stumps.
