Pakistan's 18-member contingent for the Rio Olympics includes 11 officials and only 7 players, with their national hockey team failing to qualify for the event. The squad consists of two swimmers, a judoka, two shooters and two sprinters, with all athletes coming through wildcards. Meanwhile, India is sending its largest-ever Olympic contingent this year, with 103 qualified athletes so far.
