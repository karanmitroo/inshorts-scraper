Pakistan pacer Wahab Riaz ran backward from mid-off to take a diving catch against West Indies on Day one of the Kingston Test. Roston Chase tried to hit the ball down the ground but ended up miscuing it high in the air. Riaz managed to stop himself inside the boundary line as his motion took him further towards the ropes.
