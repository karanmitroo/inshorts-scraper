Commentating during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, former freestyle skier and five-time Olympian Jacqui Cooper said, "Very Chinese. They all look the same. They're very hard to tell who's who." Cooper made the comments following a jump by Chinese aerial skier Yan Ting during a qualifying run at the event. The former freestyle skier later wrote a clarification tweet.
