Fourteen-time Grand Slam winner Rafael Nadal's coach and uncle Toni Nadal has said that he will not accompany Rafael on the ATP tour from next season, complaining that he had been left out of the decision-making. Toni, however, maintained that there is no rift between the two. Toni further said that he will be focusing solely on their tennis academy.
