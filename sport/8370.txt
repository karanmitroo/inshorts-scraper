India and England have produced several absorbing ODIs since 2000, including the 2002 NatWest Trophy final, famous for Sourav Ganguly removing his shirt in the Lord's balcony. The two sides were involved in a tied encounter in the 2011 World Cup, while India managed to beat England in the final of the 2013 Champions Trophy in a tight finish.
