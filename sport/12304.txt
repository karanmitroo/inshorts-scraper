Sri Lanka defeated Australia in a Test for only the second time ever, after registering a 106-run victory on Saturday. Sri Lanka's first ever Test victory against the Aussies came in 1999, which helped them clinch the three-match series. Out of the 27 Tests played between the two teams, Australia has won 17 times, winning 10 of the 11 series.
