The doping case pertaining to cricketer Yusuf Pathan, who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning squad, is still pending with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Pathan was given a five-month back-dated suspension by the BCCI on Tuesday, which will end on January 14. As per WADA's doping code of 2015, a first-time offence automatically invokes a four-year suspension.
