ICC has approved the trial of four-day Test matches, which will run through until the 2019 Cricket World Cup. This comes after South Africa had sought permission to host Zimbabwe in a four-day Test later this year. "Members will schedule four-day games by bilateral agreement and a set of standardised playing conditions will now be finalised," said ICC.
