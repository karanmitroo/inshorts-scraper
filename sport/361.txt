New Zealand's Martin Guptill, who went unsold at the IPL 2018 auction, slammed a 49-ball ton against Australia to register the fastest T20I ton for his nation. Guptill, who bettered former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's 50-ball record, also went past the former captain's record of 2,140 runs to become the highest run-scorer in T20I cricket.
