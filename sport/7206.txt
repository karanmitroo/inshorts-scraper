Criticising social media users for dragging his name into the National Anthem controversy, Indian spinner Parvez Rasool said, "Let cricketers play...and don't involve them into politics unnecessarily. I try to keep my focus on the game and don't let these controversies affect me." Rasool was criticised after he was seen chewing gum while the National Anthem was being played.
