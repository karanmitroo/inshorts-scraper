Self-styled critic Kamaal R Khan took a dig at former cricketer Sourav Ganguly on Twitter over Team India's coach selection, but got trolled back by followers. Khan alleged Ganguly took money to reveal the coach's name at which a user posted, "review ke time pe aap maal discuss karte ho kya." Another tweet read, "Tujhse 2 rupees kam liye."
