American Don Budge was the first tennis player to complete the Grand Slam by winning all four majors namely Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open, in a calendar year. On September 24, 1938, Budge won the US Open, his fourth major of the year. Interestingly, only Rod Laver apart from Budge has achieved the feat in men's singles.
