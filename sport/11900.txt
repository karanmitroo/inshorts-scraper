Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has claimed that junior officials from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and NADA are responsible for the four-year ban on wrestler Narsingh Yadav. He added that some SAI officials ensured Yadav was found guilty, by spiking his food/drinks and sending letters to NADA to conduct consecutive dope tests.
