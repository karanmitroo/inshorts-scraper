After India drew the fourth Test against West Indies on Monday, Pakistan topped the ICC Test rankings for the first time since the ranking system's introduction in 2003. With the 2-2 Test series draw against England last week, Pakistan had moved onto rank two, their previous best ranking. Notably, Pakistan is only the fifth team to top the Test rankings.
