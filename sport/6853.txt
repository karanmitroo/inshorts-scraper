The margin of victory was same in the first-ever Test in 1877 and the match played to celebrate Test cricket's centenary in 1977. Australia beat England by 45 runs in the first-ever Test played, and also won the special match against England 100 years later by the same margin. Both the matches were played in Australia's Melbourne.
