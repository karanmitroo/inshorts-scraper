Windies' all-rounder Chris Gayle returned to ODI cricket after a gap of 913 days after taking the field in the first England-Windies ODI on Tuesday. Gayle's last ODI match was against New Zealand in the ICC World Cup 2015 quarter-final. The 37-year-old had been out of the national team due to a contract dispute between the board and the cricketers.
