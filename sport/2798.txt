The senior national selectors have named two India A squads for the five-match one-day series against New Zealand A, following coach Rahul Dravid's suggestion of not pulling players out of Ranji Trophy. The players would have missed at least two rounds of Ranji if a single team was picked for the 'A' matches and the warm-up matches against New Zealand.
