A minute-long video shows a Portugal-supporting kid consoling a France football fan who was in tears after France's loss to Portugal in the Euro 2016 final on Sunday. The video shows the Portugal supporter patting the France fan on the back before embracing him. This was France's first defeat in a major tournament at home in 56 years.
