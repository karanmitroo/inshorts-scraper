ICC's Chief Executive Committee has proposed the idea of a two-year, two-tier Test league and a three-year, 13-team ODI league. The nine top-ranked Test sides will play bilateral series, with a play-off between the top two teams at the end. In the ODI league, the teams will play bilateral series, with the top seven teams qualifying for the World Cup.
