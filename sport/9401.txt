Former footballer David Beckham featured in a video for UNICEF, where his tattoos get animated to show different instances of violence faced by children. The video was captioned, "David Beckham chose the marks on his skin, but millions of children bear marks that they haven't chosen. Violence against children is wrong." Beckham has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2005.
