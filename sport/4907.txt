An Agra-based cricket fan, who has offered to iron clothes free of charge for five days if India wins the Champions Trophy, has allegedly received a threat call from Pakistan. Azad Diwakar, who runs a roadside laundry, said that the caller from Pakistan asked him to withdraw his announcement and threatened him of "dire consequences".
