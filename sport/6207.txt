Roger Federer and Andy Murray played a tennis match on a floating raft on the river Limmat in Zurich, Switzerland, to raise money for charity. Federer defeated the world number one 6-3, 7-6, with the proceeds going to Federer's foundation to promote children's education in Africa. The two will play a reverse fixture in Glasgow in November.
