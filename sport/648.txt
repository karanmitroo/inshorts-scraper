Speaking about the recently-concluded IPL auction that featured 581 players, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said, "Don't judge players by the amount of money they get in the IPL". "Hashim Amla went unsold and he has 54 international hundreds while Ishan Kishan gets over â‚¹6 crore having played only Ranji Trophy", Ganguly added.
