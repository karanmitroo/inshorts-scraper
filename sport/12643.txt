An inflatable arch, marking one kilometre to the finish line, deflated and collapsed during the Tour de France race on Friday. While frontrunners of the race remained unaffected, the arch collapsed on British rider Adam Yates, who got four stitches on his chin. The cause of the accident was a fan accidentally snapping the cable which keeps the arch inflated.
