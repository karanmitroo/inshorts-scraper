Cricket South Africa Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat has confirmed that South African players will be allowed to participate in IPL 2017 and the subsequent editions only if India confirms its December tour to the country. However, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, in his reply, said he "didn't even bother to communicate" to Lorgat. SA players' IPL NOC expired on May 8.
