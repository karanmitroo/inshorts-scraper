A late goal from Spanish forward Marco Asensio against Leganes on Thursday helped Real Madrid end their three-match winless run in all competitions. Asensio struck in the 89th minute in the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinals. Earlier in the competition, Messi missed a penalty kick in Barcelona's 0-1 loss at Espanyol.
