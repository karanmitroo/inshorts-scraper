Former world number one John McEnroe has suggested that men and women should play together, to prove his comments on 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams. McEnroe had said Serena was the greatest female athlete but she would be like "700 in the world" on the men's circuit. Serena had asked McEnroe to keep her out of his statements.
