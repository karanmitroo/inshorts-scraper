Tennis player Sania Mirza got into a Twitter argument with cricket commentator Sanjay Manjrekar, over the former's tweet on her number one ranking. When Sania tweeted about completing 80 weeks as the top-ranked player, Manjrekar replied saying, "No 1 doubles player you mean". Sania, in turn, replied, "Since I don't play singles anymore isn't that obvious/ common sense?"
