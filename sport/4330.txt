The BCCI has clarified that former India pacer Zaheer Khan has been appointed as a "consultant on overseas tour-to-tour basis", and not as a full-time bowling coach of the Indian cricket team. The board added that the appointments of Rahul Dravid, who is the overseas batting consultant, and Zaheer were made after discussion with new head coach Ravi Shastri.
