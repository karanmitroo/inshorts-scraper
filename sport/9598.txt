Brazil's football clubs have requested the Brazilian Football Confederation to allow them to loan players for free to Chapecoense after the team was involved in a plane crash on Tuesday, which killed 71 people. The request was made in a statement of solidarity, which added that Chapecoense be given relegation exemption from Brazil's top-tier league for the next three years.
