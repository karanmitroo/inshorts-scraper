Arunima Sinha, a former national-level volleyball player and the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest, claimed that her disability was mocked at the Mahakal Temple in Ujjain. "I felt greater pain in visiting Mahakal temple (at Ujjain) than scaling the Everest," part of Arunima's tweet read. Arunima is reportedly yet to file a complaint about the matter.
