India coach Ravi Shastri has said that 36-year-old wicketkeeper and former captain MS Dhoni can still beat players ten years junior to him. "We are not stupid. I have been watching this sport for the last 30-40 years. We know, at this age, he can beat players aged 26. People who talk, forget that they played the game," said Shastri.
