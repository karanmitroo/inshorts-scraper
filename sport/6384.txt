Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders have signed New Zealand all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme as a replacement for West Indies' Andre Russell, who is set to miss the Indian Premier League 2017. The West Indian has been handed a one-year ban for violating anti-doping whereabouts regulations. "We are looking it as an opportunity," KKR captain Gautam Gambhir said.
