Indian Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav's coach Kapil Pande has said captain Virat Kohli should have shared the Man of the Match award he won in the second ODI with the spinner. Pande added that by sharing the honour, Kohli could have encouraged junior players. Yadav became the first Indian spinner to take a hat-trick in ODIs in the second ODI.
