BCCI has blocked Indian cricketers including Suresh Raina and Yusuf Pathan from playing in the Tamil Nadu Premier League, as rules state that only players registered with Tamil Nadu Cricket Association should take part in TNPL. The association has argued that since it is a BCCI-sanctioned league, the board should not prevent outstation players from participating in the tournament.
