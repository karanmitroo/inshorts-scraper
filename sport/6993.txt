Travelling fans of German football club Bayern Munich threw toilet paper on the pitch to protest high ticket prices at the second leg of their round of 16 Champions League game against Arsenal at Emirates on Tuesday. The German fans, who delayed the game at the protest, reportedly had to shell out £80 (almost ₹6,500) to watch the match.
