Swiss tennis star Roger Federer did the Mannequin Challenge at the Lindt Chocolateria in the Swiss city of Kilchberg. In the video, which Federer put up on his Facebook page, he is seen standing, waiting to taste a chocolate. Notably, Federer had ended his 2016 season prematurely so as to recover from a knee surgery.
