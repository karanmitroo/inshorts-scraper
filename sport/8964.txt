Australia's Nic Maddinson took a one-handed leaping catch at short leg to dismiss Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq during the ongoing Boxing Day Test on Monday. Misbah edged a delivery off Jackson Bird before it hit the pad to go straight towards short leg. Maddinson leapt to his left to catch the dropping ball, dismissing Misbah at 11.
