Pakistan Cricket Board's chief Shahryar Khan has said they oppose ICC's Big Three revenue model, of which India is the biggest beneficiary. "While India gets $500 million, Pakistan gets much lesser...We don't see this as a system based on equality," said Shahryar. Pakistan earlier backed the model since India had signed an MoU for a series with Pakistan.
