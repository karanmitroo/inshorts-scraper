Usain Bolt was awarded a 3,000 kg section of the Berlin Wall by the city's Mayor after Bolt broke the 100-metre and 200-metre world records in the city. The Mayor reportedly said Bolt had shown the world that one can tear down "insurmountable" walls. Notably, the construction of the Berlin Wall began on 13th August 1961.
