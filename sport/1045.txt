Former India captain Rahul Dravid's father Sharad Dravid used to work with Kissan, a company known for producing jams. Dravid's mother Pushpa handed him a bottle of jam whenever he went out playing, which prompted his teammates to give him the nickname 'Jammy'. Dravid was also called 'The Wall' and 'Mr Dependable' for his technique and defence.
