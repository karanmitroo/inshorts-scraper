England's Ben Stokes was caught in the slips by Murali Vijay on the bowling of Ravichandran Ashwin in the ongoing Mumbai Test. The left-hander was attempting a reverse sweep when the ball took the bat's under-edge and bounced off his foot towards the fielder. The on-field umpires referred the decision to the TV umpire, with 'out' as the soft signal.
