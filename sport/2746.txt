Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios has pledged $50 for every ace he hits in the remainder of the season, for hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico. Kyrgios had earlier pledged $10 for each ace, but upped his offer during the China Open on Wednesday. More than 34 people died in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
