Bangladesh player Tamim Iqbal, who was playing county cricket in England, was reportedly chased out of a London restaurant along with his family because his wife was wearing a hijab. Following the alleged incident, Iqbal cut short his county stint with Essex to return home. Iqbal, however, denied reports that there was an acid attack on his wife.
