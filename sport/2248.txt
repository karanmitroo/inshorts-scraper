Ex-Indian cricketer Hemang Badani revealed that pacer Ashish Nehra, who retired recently, once told then captain Sourav Ganguly to not fear during an ODI against Pakistan in 2004. Badani said Pakistan needed nine runs to win from six balls when Nehra ran towards Ganguly and said, "Dada, main dalta hoon, aap daro mat. Main match win karke dunga."
