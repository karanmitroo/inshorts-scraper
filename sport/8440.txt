South Africa's Hashim Amla on Thursday scored an unbeaten 125(221) against Sri Lanka, becoming the eighth batsman in Test history to score a hundred in his 100th Test. The first batsman to achieve the feat was England's Colin Cowdrey who did it in 1968. Notably, Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have scored two tons in his 100th Test.
