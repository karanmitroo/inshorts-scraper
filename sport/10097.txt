South Africa's JP Duminy pulled off a Jonty Rhodes-like catch to dismiss Australia's Mitchell Starc in the Hobart Test on Saturday. Duminy was fielding at gully when Starc edged an offish Kyle Abbott delivery, which the former caught with an instant dive to his right. Starc's dismissal was Australia's eighth wicket, with the entire team being dismissed for 85.
