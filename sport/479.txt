Glenn Maxwell gifted a bat to Alex Carey, who took a single when Australia needed two to win the T20I against England on Wednesday to allow him to get a hundred. Maxwell revealed he told Carey to take two runs as he "hadn't much left in him". However, Carey took one and Maxwell got to his century with a six.
