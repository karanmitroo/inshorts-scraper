Following Indian captain Virat Kohli's verbal altercation with Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade in the 2nd ODI, former Australian pacer Stuart Clark said that the Indian cricketer seems to play 10 times better after fighting with people. Wade, during the Dharamsala Test earlier this year, also got into a verbal altercation with Ravindra Jadeja, who responded with a half-century.
