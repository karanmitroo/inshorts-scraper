Amul recently released a poster on England bowler James Anderson's comments on Indian Test captain Virat Kohli. The caricature showed the Amul girl standing between Anderson and Kohli, and saying, "Jimmy, we can't anderstand you!" Anderson had recently said Indian pitches hide Virat Kohli's technical shortcomings as a batsman.
