BCCI on Tuesday alleged in the Supreme Court that the Lodha Panel is trying to run cricket in the country. It argued that by giving directions regarding match schedules and setting conditions for awarding of tenders, the Committee was going beyond its jurisdiction. The SC bench replied that BCCI can approach the Court if the committee exceeds its jurisdiction.
