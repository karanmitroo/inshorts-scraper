Former Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara became just the eighth player in history to register five consecutive first-class centuries, after scoring 177 not out for Surrey against Essex on Friday. Sangakkara, who announced that the current county season will be his last, notched scores of 136, 105, 114 and 120 in his four previous outings.
