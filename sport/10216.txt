Samantha Gash, a 31-year-old ultramarathon runner from Melbourne, ran 3,800 km from Jaisalmer to Shillong to raise funds for children's education. Speaking about her 12-week-long journey, Gash said, "It was like running across several countries as the culture, geography and climate is so diverse. It was an incredible experience and an eye-opener".
