Rajasthan pacer Aniket Choudhary, who was bought for ₹2 crore by Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2017 IPL auction on Monday, said he was bowling to Virat Kohli in the nets when he got the news of his selection. "I had no expectations of being sold at a price anywhere even close to ₹2 crore," the pacer added.
