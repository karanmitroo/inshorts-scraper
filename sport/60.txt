New South Wales pacer Sean Abbott bowled a bouncer that hit the helmet of Victoria's batsman Will Pucovski during an Australian domestic match on Sunday. Pucovski dropped to his knees and took several minutes to get to his feet after treatment. This comes over three years after Abbott bowled the bouncer that led to the death of Phil Hughes.
