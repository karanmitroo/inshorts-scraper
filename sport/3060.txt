Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has said that current captain Virat Kohli's confidence and faith in former captain MS Dhoni has transformed the 36-year-old's career. "Players are made and players are broken by the faith you show in them", Ganguly said. In 2017, Dhoni has so far scored 627 runs in 19 ODIs at an average of 89.57.
