NBA player Taj Gibson hit a buzzer beater from a distance of around 70 feet for his side Oklahoma City Thunder during their game against the Portland Trail Blazers last week. At the end of the first half, Gibson intercepted a pass by an opponent and attempted a basket throwing the ball up to score and take the lead.
