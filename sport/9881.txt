England batsman Ben Stokes was 'bowled' by India's debutant spinner Jayant Yadav on the second day of the Vizag Test, but wasn't declared out since the bails did not dislodge. As per the rules, a batsman is out only if the bails fall. Stokes, then batting on 3*, is still not out on 12* at the end of day two.
