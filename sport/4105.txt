India will host the men's World Boxing Championship for the first time in 2021 and the women's World Championship in 2018. India has never hosted the men's championship but played host to the 2006 women's event. "It is the first time ever that a country has been awarded two major championships, that too back-to-back," Boxing Federation of India President said.
