Filmmaker Amole Gupte, who is making a biopic on Olympic medal-winning badminton player Saina Nehwal, has said that Shraddha Kapoor resembles Saina and she was always his first choice for the film. Amole added, "Shraddha is undergoing training from...badminton player Jitesh Padukone...she is so committed to it." He further said that he had conceptualised the script two years ago.
