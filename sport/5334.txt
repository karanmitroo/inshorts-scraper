Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja mocked himself on Twitter after not getting even a single game during the four-month India tour. Khawaja was not picked in the Australian side for any of the four tests, and was later a water boy for RPS in the IPL. Khawaja tweeted a picture of Bobby Boucher, the Adam Sandler character from 'The Waterboy'.
