Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell's bat, which was broken by an Umesh Yadav delivery in the Ranchi Test last week, will be displayed at the player's former club South Belgrave. Talking about the bat, with which he scored his maiden Test ton, Maxwell revealed he found it lying in his garage and put it in his kit since it "sounded good".
