Indian fast bowler S Sreesanth has revealed that he is considering representing a different country if the BCCI does not revoke his life ban. "BCCI is a private firm...It is only us who say that this is the Indian team," the 34-year-old further said. This comes after the Kerala HC restored his life ban on October 17 following BCCI's appeal.
