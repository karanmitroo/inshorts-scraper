Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams has accused Wimbledon authorities of discriminating against women when scheduling matches in the two main arenas. She played her second-round match against Greek player Maria Sakkari at Court 18, which seats only 782 people. Venus also said that she can not imagine a five-time male champion playing on an outside court.
