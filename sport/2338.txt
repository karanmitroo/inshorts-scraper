Indian pacer Ashish Nehra was presented with a memento by ex-captain MS Dhoni and skipper Virat Kohli ahead of the Kotla T20I against New Zealand on Wednesday, his career's last match. BCCI released a video, wherein Nehra can be seen addressing the team huddle before being presented the memento. Nehra had made his debut for India in 1999.
