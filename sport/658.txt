Virat Kohli, who led India to the 2008 Under-19 World Cup title, said the current India Under-19 team is much more confident than his 2008 side. "It feels amazing (to see them do well)...(their) confidence levels are somewhere else which's a great sign," he further said. "Playing such a high pressure game (against Pakistan), they really stood up," he added.
