Former Pakistani cricketer Aamer Hanif's son, Mohammad Zaryab, committed suicide at his home in Karachi after being excluded from an Under-19 team. Zaryab, a first-year student at a college, was not selected as selectors claimed he was overage for U-19 cricket. Hanif, who played five ODIs for Pakistan, said Zaryab was pressurised and coaches' behaviour forced him to commit suicide.
