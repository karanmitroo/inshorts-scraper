Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association over an Instagram post criticising the referee of the club's Premier League game last week. He had posted, "10 against 12...but still fighting and winning as a team #youfreetothinkwhatyouwant," after the match, which City won 2-1 despite being reduced to 10 men following a red card.
