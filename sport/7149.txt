Following India's 333-run loss to Australia in the Pune Test, an Australian news website called former spinner Harbhajan Singh a 'Colossal Clown' and ex-captain Sourav Ganguly a 'Sheepish Shocker'. Ganguly and Harbhajan had earlier predicted Australia would not be able to win a single Test, with the latter commenting, "This is the weakest Australian side to tour India".
