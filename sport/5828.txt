Vinod Rai, head of the Supreme Court-appointed BCCI's Committee of Administrators, has said former players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid should aid in cricket administration. "We have a remarkable young team...legends like Kapil, Sourav, Anil Kumble, Rahul, Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar need to speak up and ensure that cricket administration in this country improves," said Rai.
