All-rounder Faheem Ashraf became the first Pakistani bowler to take a hat-trick in T20I cricket on Friday. The 23-year-old pacer achieved the feat by dismissing Sri Lanka's Isuru Udana, Mahela Udawatte and Dasun Shanaka in his third over. The hat-trick was sixth in T20Is and first by a Pakistani cricketer across all formats in 15 years.
