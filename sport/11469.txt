Egypt's Ibrahim Hamadtou, who participated at the Rio Paralympics, holds the table tennis paddle in his mouth as he has no arms. The 43-year-old lost both his arms in a train accident when he was 10 years old. Hamadtou plays table tennis with one shoe on and one shoe off. He picks the ball up with his toes to serve.
