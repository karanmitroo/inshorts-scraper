Ethiopian runner Etenesh Diro qualified for the womenâ€™s 3,000-metre steeplechase finals in the Rio Olympics, despite losing one shoe during the race. Diro had finished seventh in her heat, losing out on time after her shoe got entangled with other competitors'. The Ethiopian later appealed along with the Ireland and Jamaica teams, after which they were advanced to the final.
