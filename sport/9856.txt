India's first individual double century in Test matches was scored by Polly Umrigar on November 20, 1955, almost 23 years after India started playing Test cricket. The batsman had finished the opening day of the Hyderabad Test against New Zealand on 112 and went on to score 223. Notably, India played its first Test against England in 1932 at Lord's.
