Lyricist Javed Akhtar has said that he takes back his "harsh" words as cricketer Virender Sehwag has clarified his statements on Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur. "Since Sehwag undoubtedly a great player has clarified he was just being facetious and is not anti Gurmehar I take back my rather harsh words," Akhtar tweeted.
