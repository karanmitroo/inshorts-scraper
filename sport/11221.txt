No cricketers from the last two generations of Indian cricket featured in commentator Harsha Bhogle's Dream XI. The team, not featuring the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar among others, comprised of players from the Indian cricket team of the pre-1970s era. Bhogle's team selection "relie[d] on numbers and perceptions based on conversations with people of that era".
