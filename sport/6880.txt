South African captain Faf du Plessis has been left "surprised" after neither Steve Smith nor Virat Kohli was charged by ICC over the Bengaluru Test DRS row. Du Plessis said he was surprised because he was charged by ICC over an alleged ball-tampering offence in November last year, which according to him was "a lot smaller and a lot lesser".
