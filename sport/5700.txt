Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge missed out on becoming the first athlete to run a sub-two hour marathon by 25 seconds, after finishing it in a record time of 2 hours, 25 seconds. Kipchoge's run will not be recorded as an official IAAF world record since the pacing strategy and fuelling strategy was not compliant with IAAF's standards.
