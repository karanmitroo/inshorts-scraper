Senegal goalkeeper, Khadim Nâ€™Diaye, tripped over his own feet while in his stride, as a ploy to waste time against Algeria in the Africa Cup of Nations tournament's group match on Tuesday. The goalkeeper managed to avoid a yellow card for the act, which helped Senegal top the group and eliminate Algeria from the tournament.
