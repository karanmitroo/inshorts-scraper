The first six in international cricket was hit by Australian batsman Joe Darling in 1898, almost 21 years after the first Test was played. Back then, a six had to be hit out of the ground as hits over the boundary counted as five. Darling, born on November 21, 1870, went on to hit two more sixes in his innings.
