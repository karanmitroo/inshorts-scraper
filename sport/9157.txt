A pitch invader halted the ongoing Pakistan-Australia Test at Brisbane on Friday. During Australia's 130th over of their first innings, a spectator ran onto the pitch while tailenders Nathan Lyon and Jackson Bird were at the crease, with security personnel following and handcuffing the invader to take him away. A fine of $8,000 is levied on anyone entering the arena.
