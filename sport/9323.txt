Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag recently said that Virat Kohli's performance in 2016 is better than Donald Bradman. "I enjoy when Kohli bats. He reminds me of Virat only. In 2016, his stats are better than Bradman. He is good in all formats...No one should be compared. If that happens, you risk forgetting your own game," added Sehwag.
