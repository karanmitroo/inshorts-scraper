Former Indian pacer Chetan Sharma bowled out three New Zealand batsmen in three successive deliveries on October 31, 1987, in Nagpur, becoming the first bowler to take a hat-trick in a Cricket World Cup match. It was also the first hat-trick taken by an Indian and the first all-bowled hat-trick in international cricket.
