Gymnast Zama Mofokeng set a Guinness World Record after performing the most consecutive one-handed backflips in South Africa. Mofokeng performed 34 backflips one after the other, ensuring there was no more than a three-second gap between each flip, as required by Guinness guidelines. Zama, who suffers from epilepsy, said he hoped his record will be an inspiration for children.
