Speaking about his comeback to international cricket with the T20I series, pacer Ashish Nehra said, "It takes me only one game to get back into the groove." The 37-year-old added, "Whether I'm playing 50 overs or T20 or if I'm bowling in the nets with a single stump to aim at, I've never felt short of match practice."
