Indian women's cricket team all-rounder Deepti Sharma has said that Ravichandran Ashwin is her role-model and she wants to bowl the "carrom-ball with Ashwin-like accuracy". "I keep watching Ashwin's videos and try to learn from his variations," she added. Deepti Sharma picked up 12 wickets and scored 216 runs in the recently concluded Women's World Cup.
