American Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter Andrew 'The Beast' Whitney accidentally knocked out a ring girl after losing a bout in America's 'Titan Fighting Championship'. The Beast, who was confident he was winning, punched in the air blindly after finding out he had lost. His arm hit the ring girl, but she signalled she was fine.
