The Gujarat HC has asked the state government to file an affidavit by May 22, giving its stand on whether poker is a form of gambling or a game of skill. The state police raided poker clubs in the state, and ordered their closure under the anti-gambling act. The Indian Poker Association filed a plea asking for a restraining order.
