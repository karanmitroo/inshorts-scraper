Rising Pune Supergiant owner Sanjiv Goenka has claimed that current captain Steve Smith's mind is sharper than former captain MS Dhoni's. "MS is one of the greatest minds I have interacted with. And he is the best wicketkeeper in the world. The one mind ahead of Dhoni's is Smith's," Goenka said about Dhoni and Smith.
