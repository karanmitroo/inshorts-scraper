Kanpur's Green Park stadium, which is hosting the first T20I between India and England, is named after British lady Madam Green, who would ride horses there in the 1940s. The India-England T20I is the first-ever T20I being held at the ground, which hosted two matches of the IPL in 2016. Green Park stadium was the venue for India's 500th Test.
