Wimbledon matches will be held on the middle Sunday of this year's tournament for the first time since 2004. The middle Sunday is traditionally a rest day, but rain delays have created a backlog of matches, forcing rescheduling this year. This will be the fourth 'People's Sunday' in Wimbledon's 139-year history, with the other occasions being 1991, 1997 and 2004.
