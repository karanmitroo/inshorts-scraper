The Bombay High Court issued notices to the BCCI and Maharashtra Cricket Association for violation of noise pollution norms at Mumbai’s Wankhede and Pune’s Subrata Roy Sahara stadiums during IPL 2013. The notices were based on a PIL filed in 2014, which called for imposing a ₹100 crore fine on the BCCI. The next hearing is scheduled on September 16.
