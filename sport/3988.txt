India's Deaflympics squad, which put up the country's best-ever show at the recently concluded Deaflympics, refused to leave the Delhi airport after landing, since no government official was there to receive them. The 46-athlete contingent, which won five medals, demanded to speak with sports minister Vijay Goel. The athletes protested for over six hours before an SAI official received them.
