Pakistan will be presented the ICC Test mace, awarded to the top-ranked Test team, on September 21 in Lahore. ICC CEO David Richardson will make the presentation to captain Misbah-ul-Haq at the Gaddafi Stadium. Pakistan achieved the Test number one rank for the first time since the new ranking system's introduction, following a 2-2 series draw with England last month.
