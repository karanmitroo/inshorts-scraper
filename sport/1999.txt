Turkey's three-time Olympic gold medal-winning weightlifter Naim Suleymanoglu died aged 50 due to liver failure on Saturday. Dubbed the 'Pocket Hercules' due to his short height of 4.8 feet, Bulgaria-born Suleymanoglu won the World Championships five times representing Turkey and twice representing Bulgaria. He was the first-ever weightlifter to claim gold at three different Olympic Games.
