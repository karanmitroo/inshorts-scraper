Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga was seen bowling off-spin for his side Teejay Lanka during a one-day match in a domestic tournament. The 34-year-old decided to bowl off-spin with a short run-up due to bad light at the stadium, finishing with figures of 3/22. Malinga's team went on to win the match by 82 runs (DLS method).
