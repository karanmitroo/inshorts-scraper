Rohan Bopanna, who won the 2017 French Open mixed doubles title, has slammed the All India Tennis Association for not nominating him for this year's Arjuna Award. Saketh Myneni was recommended by AITA instead. "I am calling out to the lack of professionalism and efficiency by AITA for not sending my nomination before the deadline", Bopanna wrote in a letter.
