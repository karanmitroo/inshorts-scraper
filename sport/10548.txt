Ex-Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist posted an Instagram message for Indian ODI captain MS Dhoni, who completed 9,000 ODI runs recently. Gilchrist wrote, "A day or so late, but huge congrats to #MSDhoni on reaching #9000 ODI runs. Cool, calm, collected at all times..." Gilchrist and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara are the only other wicketkeepers to score 9,000+ ODI runs.
