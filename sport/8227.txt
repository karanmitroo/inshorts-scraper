Shoaib Malik scored six runs off a James Faulkner delivery during the third Aus-Pak ODI, helped by an overthrow from wicketkeeper Matthew Wade. Malik had taken off for a double after pushing the ball towards point. Wade received the ball from David Warner and threw it towards Faulkner who could not catch it, resulting in the ball going for four.
