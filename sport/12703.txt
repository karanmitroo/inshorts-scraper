During the menâ€™s doubles third-round match on Monday, Uruguayan player Pablo Cuevas was handed a warning for threatening to urinate in a ball can, after being denied a toilet break by the umpire. Cuevas and his Spanish partner Marcel Granollers, who eventually lost the match, later sat down on the court in protest and refused to play the final game.
