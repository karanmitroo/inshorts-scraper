Commentator Ravi Shastri forgot to announce the Man of the Match award while conducting the post-match presentation in Mumbai Indians' IPL match against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Wednesday. Shastri interviewed Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma before ending proceedings. He then realised he had not announced Jasprit Bumrah's award, and apologised before asking Akash Ambani to present the award.
