Indian fast bowler S Sreesanth has claimed his comments about playing for some other country were 'misinterpreted' and he meant he wanted to play foreign T20 cricket leagues. "I was emotional and got carried away that day. What I meant was that cricket is important to me. That I would play for T-20 leagues in other countries," said Sreesanth.
