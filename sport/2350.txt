The Delhi & District Cricket Association on Tuesday inaugurated a gate named after Virender Sehwag at  Feroz Shah Kotla stadium, with a plaque on it wrongly calling Sehwag the only Indian to score a Test triple century. While Sehwag has scored two triple hundreds in Tests, Karun Nair became the second Indian to score a Test triple century last year.
