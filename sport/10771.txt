India's Umesh Yadav took a diving catch to dismiss New Zealand's Corey Anderson off Hardik Pandya's bowling in the first ODI at Dharamshala on Sunday. New Zealand were at 43/3 at 10.4 overs when Anderson played a shot towards mid-off where Yadav was fielding. Yadav leapt to his right, with commentator Ravi Shastri calling the dive "timed to perfection".
