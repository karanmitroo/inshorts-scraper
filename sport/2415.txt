Forward Ianis Stoica, aged 14, scored on his professional debut for Romanian football club Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday, becoming the club's youngest ever goal-scorer. Stoica, who played for 30 minutes in his first match in the Romanian Cup, netted the team's sixth goal in the injury time. "I could write a book about this," said the 14-year-old.
