Sports Minister Vijay Goel on Wednesday tweeted in support of sportspersons being criticised for their comments on Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur, saying they should not be called illiterates. Goel was referring to lyricist Javed Akhtar, who had earlier called wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt and Virender Sehwag a "hardly literate player" after they had commented on the issue.
