The Australian Cricketers' Association announced on Thursday that Australia A's proposed tour to South Africa, which was set to begin next week, has been cancelled. The cancellation has come after the players refused to take part in the tour owing to the ongoing contract dispute between the Australian Cricketers' Association and Cricket Australia.
