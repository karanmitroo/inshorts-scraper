Reacting to MS Dhoni driving Team India around the stadium in Jasprit Bumrah's car, a user tweeted, "Normal People: It's too crowded. Mumbaikars travelling by Locals : It could have 5-6 more easily 'Andar Ghus be.. Pura Khaali hai' #SLvIND." "Both man-of-the-match and man-of-the-series sitting behind like they had nothing to do with the series win," read another tweet.
