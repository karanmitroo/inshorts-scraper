Nine-time Olympic gold medal winner Usain Bolt claims that if chose to be a footballer, he'd be "a good mixture" of both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Bolt, who has previously shown his interest in playing for Manchester United, said, "If they [Manchester United] call me to say, 'we need you now', I'd take the next flight to England".
