In letters to the National Anti-Doping Agency and Sports Ministry, BCCI has said NADA has no jurisdiction to conduct dope tests on Indian cricketers. This comes after the World Anti-Doping Agency reportedly warned its Indian arm that it may lose affiliation if it fails to get Indian cricketers under its jurisdiction. BCCI stated it had a zero-tolerance policy towards doping.
