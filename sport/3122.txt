Former India cricketer Virender Sehwag has claimed not having any "setting" in the BCCI cost him the coach's job, for which he had applied after being convinced by board officials. He further revealed that he was not interested in the post, but applied after Ravi Shastri told him he won't. Sehwag added that he will never apply in the future.
