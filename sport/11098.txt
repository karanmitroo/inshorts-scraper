Olympic medal-winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt has said he will not compete against any Pakistani wrestler until the tension between the two countries is resolved. "Indian Army is the sole reason me and my family sleep in peace at night...If a country attacks India killing our actual heroes, the Army, I will not fight against wrestlers from that country," said Dutt.
