Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who took off his shirt at Lord's after India's NatWest series win on July 13, 2002, had later called the celebration a "big mistake". "It was only a way of relieving the pressure. You make mistakes in life. I made a mistake. But we were on the winning side," Ganguly later admitted.
