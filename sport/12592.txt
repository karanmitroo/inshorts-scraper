British rider Chris Froome was fined approximately $203 for punching a fan during the Tour de France. The Colombian fan, wearing a yellow wig, was running alongside the rider, when Froome abruptly punched him while riding. Froome then went on to win the stage by 13 seconds to claim the yellow jersey, which is awarded to the race leader.
