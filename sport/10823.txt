Cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said he prefers watching hockey over cricket or football on television. "I am very passionate about Indian hockey. I watched all their games at the Olympics. They played reasonably well and though they didn't win a medal, the graph is going upwards. I hope India can go to the same level of the 1980's," said Gambhir.
