Following Neymar's world record move to PSG from Barcelona, many Barcelona football fans burned the jerseys bearing the name and number of the 25-year-old forward. Many Barcelona fans commented that Neymar was a 'snake' and that he ran after money. Other fans said they would even go as far to buy a new Neymar shirt to burn it upon purchase.
