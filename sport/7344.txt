The players of the Vietnamese football team Long An refused to continue playing in a league match after the referee awarded a penalty to their opponents. Long An's goalkeeper turned around in front of the goal as the opponents converted the penalty to make the score 3-2. The opponents scored two more goals unchallenged in the match's dying minutes.
