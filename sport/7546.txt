Bangladeshi opener Tamim Iqbal was dismissed on day four of the Hyderabad Test against India, after Virat Kohli appealed for a catch while the rest of the team called LBW. The ball hit Tamim's bat first and then pad, with the team appealing for LBW which the umpire rejected. Kohli reviewed for a catch, following which the decision was reversed.
