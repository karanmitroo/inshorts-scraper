Cricket's first ever limited-overs competition, The Gillette Cup, began with Lancashire playing Leicestershire at Old Trafford on May 1, 1963. The match was forced into a second day due to rain and bad weather conditions. It was a 65-over match with Lancashire scoring 304/9 batting first. Lancashire then bowled out Leicestershire for 203 to win the opening match.
