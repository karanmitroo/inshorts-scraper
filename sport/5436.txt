After rain interrupted the IPL 2017 Eliminator match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad, Virender Sehwag posted a picture of SRH mentor VVS Laxman and tweeted, "Laxman ji spotted praying for torrential rains in Bangalore." In case the match got cancelled, Hyderabad would have reached the Qualifier 2 by virtue of a higher place in the points table.
