Kanpur police has claimed that an Ajmer-based bookie instructed his accomplices to pour acid on the Green Park stadium pitch and move boundary ropes to prevent Gujarat Lions from scoring in their IPL matches. The revelations were made by three people, including a former U-17 cricketer, who were arrested for betting. The bookies admitted they procured pictures of the pitch.
