Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's instructions to Indian spinners from behind the stumps during the first ODI on Sunday were revealed through the stump microphone. "Woh maarne wala daal na, andar yaa baahar koi bhi," Dhoni was heard telling Kuldeep Yadav. "Tu bhi nahin sunta hai kya," Dhoni was further heard, scolding leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal.
