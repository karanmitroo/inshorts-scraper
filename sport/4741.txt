Pakistan cricket team captain Sarfraz Ahmed met a specially-abled fan outside his house around four in the morning, and gifted him his jersey. A video of the incident has emerged which shows the boy, reportedly named Fawad Haider, waiting in a wheelchair along with his family. Sarfraz comes out of his house and interacts with the fan.
