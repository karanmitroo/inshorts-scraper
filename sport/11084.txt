Indian boxer Mary Kom has penned an open letter to her sons as part of 'Let's talk about rape' initiative, wherein she wrote, "[Y]our mother was molested." Telling her sons that 'chinky' is a slur, Kom added, "My country has given me fame and recognition but I'm not recognised by each person... but I don't deserve to be called 'chinky'."
