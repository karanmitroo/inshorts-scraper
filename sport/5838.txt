Ex-Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar was the first player to bowl over 100 mph, recording 100.04 mph (161 kmph) in an ODI against New Zealand on April 27, 2002. However, the record remained unofficial since ICC refused to sanction it as they did not have a standard measuring tool. The previous fastest recorded speed was 99.8 mph by Australia's Jeff Thomson.
