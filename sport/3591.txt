Barcelona forward Lionel Messi on Tuesday posted a picture of himself with Luis Suárez and former Barcelona player Neymar Jr to troll teammate Gerard Piqué. Messi captioned the picture, "He [Neymar] has returned, Gerard Piqué", taking a dig at Piqué who had posted a picture of himself with Neymar, saying, "He stays", before the Brazilian's record ₹1670-crore transfer to PSG.
