Western Sydney Wanderers' goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic was hit by snakes during his team's A-League match against his old club Sydney FC. Janjetovic had left Sydney FC two weeks prior after playing for them since 2012, and his old fans expressed their disgust by pelting rubber snakes at him. Notably, Janjetovic was playing in his first Sydney derby since changing sides.
