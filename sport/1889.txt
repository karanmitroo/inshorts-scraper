Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli celebrated Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella's wicket by doing a bhangra dance during the first day of the second Test on Friday. Dickwella got out for 24 runs off 30 balls after lifting Ravindra Jadeja's delivery in the 61st over towards mid-off, where Ishant Sharma took a catch.
