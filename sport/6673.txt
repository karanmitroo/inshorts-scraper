South African bowler Dale Steyn shared an old picture with pacer Ishant Sharma, after the latter took a wicket during the recently-concluded Ranchi Test. The photo shows Steyn and Ishant dressed in a similar red kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket and is captioned, "Just as @ImIshant took a wkt I saw this pic on a old phone. Nicely done bud."
