Australian domestic side Queensland's Marnus Labuschagne has become the first fielder to be penalised for 'fake fielding', within 24 hours of new cricket laws coming into effect. During a one-day match on Friday, Labuschagne failed to stop the ball but faked a throw, causing the batsman to hesitate before completing a run. The opposition were awarded five penalty runs.
