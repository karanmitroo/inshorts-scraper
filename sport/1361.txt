Indian opener Rohit Sharma smashed the joint-fastest T20I hundred, off 35 balls, against Sri Lanka in the second T20I on Friday. He joined South African batsman David Miller, who had hit a century off 35 balls, against Bangladesh in October this year. Rohit's century is the fastest by an Indian across all formats in international cricket.
