Kabaddi has once been showcased at the Olympic Games, when it was demonstrated by Maharashtra's Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal during the 1936 Berlin Olympics. However, it is not a recognised Olympic sport since it does not have a recognised international federation. Kabaddi is a regular Asian Games sport since 1990, with India winning all the gold medals till date.
