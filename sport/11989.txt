Usain Bolt became the first athlete to complete a triple-triple of winning golds in 100-metre, 200-metre and 4X100-metre at three consecutive Olympics after helping the Jamaican team win the 4X100-metre race in Rio on Saturday. With a total of nine golds in as many events, Bolt has the second most number of Olympic gold medals, behind American swimmer Michael Phelps.
