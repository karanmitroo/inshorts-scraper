Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, on Sunday, became the third cricketer in Test cricket history to score over 500 runs and pick over 50 wickets in a single season of Test cricket. The feat was previously achieved by former Indian captain Kapil Dev in 1979-80 and former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson in 2008-09.
