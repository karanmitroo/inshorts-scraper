Delhi opener Unmukt Chand slammed a hundred despite having a broken jaw in a domestic 50-over match against Uttar Pradesh on Monday. The 2012 Under-19 World Cup-winning captain got injured while practicing in the nets but still opened the innings and hit 116(125) including three sixes and 12 fours. Chand's ton helped Delhi put up a total of 307/6.
