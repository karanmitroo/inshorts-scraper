Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi hailed the upcoming World XI tour to Pakistan for a T20 series, but said that it would have been great if the team included Indian players. The World XI team, which includes 14 players from seven nations, was announced on Thursday. The team does not include any Indian player as BCCI had not given clearance.
