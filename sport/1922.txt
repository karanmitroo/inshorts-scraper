Former BCCI President Anurag Thakur has asked the Supreme Court to make public the names of 13 players who were allegedly named in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. The names were submitted to the SC in February 2014 in a sealed envelope, which was never opened. SC had let the Lodha Committee decide on the feasibility of opening the envelope.
