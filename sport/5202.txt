Former Pakistan cricketer Waqar Younis has said Umar Akmal should be "ashamed" for being sent back to Pakistan from the Champions Trophy. The batsman was sent home after the coaching staff did not find his fitness up to the mark. On his return, Akmal apologised for his conduct and said he has a lot of cricket left in him.
