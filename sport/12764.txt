New head coach Anil Kumble has brought back former coach John Wright’s ‘buddy system’ in the Indian team’s preparations. The system involves making batsman-bowler or batsman-all rounder pairs so that players help out each other in specific departments. Virat Kohli is reportedly paired with Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Shikhar Dhawan with Mohammed Shami, while Stuart Binny is partnering with Rohit Sharma.
