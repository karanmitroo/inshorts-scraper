Australian cricket captain Steve Smith played a few rounds of tennis with former world number three and Wimbledon 2016 finalist Canada's Milos Raonic ahead of Australian Open, 2018's first Grand Slam of the season. Smith, who gifted Raonic a signed bat later, scored a double hundred against England in the third Ashes Test to help his side retain the Ashes.
