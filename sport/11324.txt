Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has sarcastically labelled himself the “worst manager in football history”. Mourinho was heavily criticised after United lost three games in a row this week, despite winning his first four games in charge. United is currently at seventh position in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Manchester City.
