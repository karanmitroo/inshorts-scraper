Sourav Ganguly's wife Dona, at an event, said the former captain's shirt-waving act at Lord's after India's NatWest series win in 2002 was a "fantastic gesture". Talking about it, Ganguly said, "I would never do it now. It was a lot more out of satisfaction." He added having his name on Lord's honours board will remain "a lot more special".
