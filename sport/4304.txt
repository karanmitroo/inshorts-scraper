Indian women's cricket team captain Mithali Raj registered the joint-highest 50+ scores in women's ODIs, going past the mark for the 55th time in the ICC Women's World Cup match against New Zealand on Saturday. Mithali now shares the record with England's Charlotte Edwards, whom she surpassed to become the highest run-getter in women's ODIs earlier.
