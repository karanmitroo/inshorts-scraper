Australia captain Steve Smith has said that he prefers to be batting on the field instead of watching cricket. Speaking about the comparison between him and Australian legend Don Bradman, Smith said, "I just go out and play and try and get better each and every day." Notably, Smith has achieved the second highest Test rating points of all time.
