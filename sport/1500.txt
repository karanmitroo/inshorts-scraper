Austin Waugh, the son of World Cup-winning Australian captain Steve Waugh, has been included in Australia's squad for the 2018 U-19 World Cup. The 17-year-old slammed 372 runs in eight Under-17 National Championships matches last season. The Australian side will be led by Jason Sangha, who is the second-youngest cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar to score a first-class ton against England.
