Former West Indian cricketer Brian Lara has said Virat Kohli's Twenty20 style is helping him move towards the level of Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar. "He's got a stage set for him with Sachin Tendulkar and trying to follow in his footsteps, but I think he's held himself pretty well so far," added the ex-Caribbean batsman.
