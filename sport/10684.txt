Indian batsman Virender Sehwag became the first player in Test cricket history to reach triple century with a six when he hit Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq for the maximum in the Multan Test in 2004. Sehwag is one of the only four batsmen to have scored two triple centuries in Test cricket, and the only triple centurion from India.
