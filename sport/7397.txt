Shuttler PV Sindhu has defended Telangana MLA Mumtaz Ahmed Khan, who allegedly called her a "national volleyball player" at an event recently. In an Instagram post, Sindhu wrote, "Here MLA sir doesn't mean that I am a volleyball player. He has expressed my dad's presence on the stage as national volleyball player." Sindhu's father PV Ramana is an ex-volleyball player.
