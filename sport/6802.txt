Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Australian player Josh Hazlewood with a MS Dhoni-like no-look runout during the Ranchi Test on Friday. KL Rahul collected the ball at square leg and threw it towards the non-striker's end, where Jadeja ran Hazlewood out with a back flick. MS Dhoni had produced a similar runout at the same venue in an ODI last year.
