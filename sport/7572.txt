Rio Olympics' venues have suffered numerous thefts and are in a dilapidated condition six months after the Games ended. Worms have reportedly infested the pitch of the Maracana Stadium, the main venue for most events, besides power supply being disconnected because of unpaid bills amounting to $940,000 (â‚¹6.2 crore). Four venues have been shut down after failing to attract buyers.
