Indian cricket team's first ever Test series win came against Pakistan in 1952, more than 20 years after becoming a Test playing nation. India had won the five-match series 2-1, with Pakistan's only win of the series being their first ever Test match victory. The Men in Blue are currently playing their 250th home Test in Kolkata against New Zealand.
