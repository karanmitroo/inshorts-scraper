Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli were involved in three close run-out calls during their 226-run partnership, before they scored their centuries. The 18th over had two mix-ups, one of which saw Pujara losing his bat mid-pitch while he ran back to the crease. In the 26th over also, Pujara called a single but was sent back by Virat Kohli.
