A three-minute video explains the origin of the Olympic Rings which were designed by the father of modern Olympics, Baron de Coubertin in 1912. The rings were inspired by a former French sports-governing body, USFSA, which had a symbol of intertwining blue and red rings. The video further discusses the myth that suggests the symbol was borrowed from ancient Greeks.
