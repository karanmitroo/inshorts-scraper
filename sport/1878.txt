The Indian Navy has issued an arrest warrant against its officer and cricketer Deepak Punia for representing Haryana in the Ranji Trophy without procuring a No Objection Certificate. Punia claimed his officer warned him that in order to play for Haryana, he would need to apply for a leave, which he did, or else face an arrest warrant.
