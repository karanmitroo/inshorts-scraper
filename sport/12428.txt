German midfielder Mario Götze has been re-signed by his former club Borussia Dortmund, for a fee of £22 million ($29 million) from Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich. Götze had joined Munich in April 2013 for £31.5 million ($41.6 million), to be the then most-expensive German player. In a statement on Facebook on Thursday, Götze said he regretted leaving Dortmund.
