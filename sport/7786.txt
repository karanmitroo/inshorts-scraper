Ex-Australian captain Steve Waugh was left stranded on 99 in the Perth Test on February 4, 1995, after his brother Mark Waugh got himself run-out. Mark was acting as a runner for the injured Craig McDermott, who was batting at number 11. Steve had tapped the ball back towards the bowler when Mark charged down the wicket and got out.
