Don Bradman is international cricket history's only player to score 300+ runs in one day, accomplishing the feat on July 11, 1930. Playing his seventh Test, the Australian cricketer came out to bat after 11 balls had been bowled in the third Ashes Test. He reached 100 before lunch, 200 before tea, and was at 309* at close of play.
