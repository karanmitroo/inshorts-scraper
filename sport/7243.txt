Australian YouTube channel, How Ridiculous' Brett Stanford has set a new Guinness World Record for the 'Longest golf putt-non-tournament'. Stanford managed the shot which has been confirmed as being from a distance of 135.67 yards (120.6 m), more than the length of a football field. Stanford's shot beat the record that had stood since 2001.
