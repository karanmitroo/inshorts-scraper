World number two Novak Djokovic played wheelchair tennis with Dylan Alcott, Australia's two-time Paralympics gold medalist. The game, held during a charity event in Melbourne, saw Djokovic struggling to move around the court on the wheelchair asking Alcott to "keep playing it down the middle". Djokovic added he would take Alcott's Olympic medal if the latter lost the match.
