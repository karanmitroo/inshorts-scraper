MS Dhoni drove members of Indian cricket team around the stadium in a mini truck after India completed a 5-0 series whitewash against Sri Lanka on Sunday. Dhoni, who took a few minutes to figure out how to operate the vehicle, completed a single round around the stadium. Notably, Kedar Jadhav was seen sitting atop the vehicle with the trophy.
