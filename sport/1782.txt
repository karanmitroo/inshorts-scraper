The male coach of Thailand women's kabaddi team wore a hijab to enter an arena and watch matches during the Asian Kabaddi Championship tournament in Gorgan, Iran. The Iranian federation said the incident was "unjustifiable" and that the man had "violated the rules of the host country". Iran bans men and the media from attending female sporting events.
