Former India captain Sourav Ganguly got into a brawl with a fellow passenger while travelling to Balurghat in a train to inaugurate his statue. Ganguly, who was travelling in a train after 16 years, got into an argument after the fellow passenger reportedly occupied the cricketer's berth. RPF personnel then intervened and Ganguly was reportedly shifted to AC-2 tier.
