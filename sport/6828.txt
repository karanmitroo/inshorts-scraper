Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell's bat broke in half on the first ball of the day, bowled by Indian pacer Umesh Yadav, on day two of the Ranchi Test on Friday. Maxwell attempted to defend the 137 km/h delivery, which hit the bat below the handle and split it completely. Umesh was then seen pointing towards his bicep.
