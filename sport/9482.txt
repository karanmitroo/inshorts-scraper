Australian batsman George Bailey employed a full side-on stance against New Zealand in the Sydney ODI on Sunday. The batsman stood in a completely closed posture, with his front leg pointing almost towards the slips. Bailey, however, would switch to a more conventional stance as the bowler approached to deliver the ball. He was finally dismissed for 17 runs.
