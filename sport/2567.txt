BCCI was forced to delete its earlier tweet wishing former India coach Anil Kumble on his birthday, in which the board referred to him as a "former bowler". Fans found the tweet disrespectful, with a follower tweeting, "Umm bowler? Wasnt he also Captain and Coach and is India's leading Wicket taker?" BCCI later tweeted another wish, calling Kumble a "legend".
