Dutch football club Ajax FC's footballer Joel Veltman showed unsportsmanlike behaviour on the field, during a match against Sparta. The defender asked an opposition player to stop the play so that Ajax's physiotherapist could tend to an injured teammate, before continuing play and crossing the ball towards his attacker teammates, into the penalty area.
