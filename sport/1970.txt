Former Brazilian forward Pelé, whose full name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, was named after American inventor Thomas Alva Edison as electricity had just been introduced to his hometown when he was born. He had stated that he was proud to be named after Edison and initially hated the nickname Pelé as it sounded "horrible".
