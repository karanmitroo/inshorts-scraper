English goalkeeper Peter Jeffries pulled off a quick reaction save while facing his own goal during his team Consett AFC's match against South Shields. One of the Shields' player hit the shot from inside the six-yard box aimed at the right corner of the goal before Jeffries turned and got a glove on the ball before hooking it away.
