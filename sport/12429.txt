New Zealand diver William Trubridge has set a new world record of 102 metres for the deepest unassisted freedive. The 36-year-old held his breath for four minutes and 14 seconds as he descended the world's deepest marine cavern, the Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. This is Trubridge's 18th record overall, and the third of this year.
