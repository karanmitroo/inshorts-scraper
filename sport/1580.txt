The BCCI on Monday decided to revoke the ban imposed on Rajasthan Cricket Association since May 2014, on the condition that former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi stays away from its functioning. The RCA was suspended after it re-elected Modi as president despite him being banned by the BCCI. During the suspension, no international or IPL match was played in Rajasthan.
