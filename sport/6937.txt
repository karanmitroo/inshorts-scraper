Australian media have claimed Virat Kohli will be allowed to choose the pitch for the Ranchi Test, while the ground curator has denied the claims. Curator SB Singh and association secretary Debashis Chakraborty said match officials will choose the surface. Media reports quoted Singh saying three surfaces had been prepared, with the team choosing the pitch before the match.
