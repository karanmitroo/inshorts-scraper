Virat Kohli reached his century with a six against England in his first match as the full-time captain of the ODI team. With his 17th century batting second, Kohli equalled Sachin's record for most tons in chases. Chasing 351 to win, Kohli was supported by Kedar Jadhav on the other end as India lost quick wickets early in the innings.
