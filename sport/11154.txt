West Indies' Kieron Pollard took a boundary catch to dismiss Pakistan's Babar Azam during the first ODI at Sharjah on Friday, which Twitter users called "one of the greatest catches ever". Azam struck a Carlos Brathwaite delivery towards the mid-wicket boundary, which Kieron Pollard caught using one arm, threw back to regain his balance, and then caught it again.
