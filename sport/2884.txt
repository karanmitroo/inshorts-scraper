England all-rounder Ben Stokes and batsman Alex Hales will not be considered for selection for England after being banned indefinitely, following Stokes' arrest after an incident in Bristol. Stokes, initially named in England's Ashes squad, will not be able to play unless he is cleared by ECB. Earlier, a video had emerged showing Stokes hitting two men outside a nightclub.
