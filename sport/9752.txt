As per reports, BCCI owes ₹68 lakh (£80,000) to the England team, who are in India for a three-month tour. The team, which includes 17 players and 16 staff members, is yet to receive the £50 per person daily allowance from BCCI since the start of the tour. Reportedly, Indian players and umpires have been paid partly in ₹100 notes.
