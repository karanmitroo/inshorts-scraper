Red Bull racer Daniel Ricciardo took selfies from Lewis Hamilton's unattended phone and posted them on Hamilton's Instagram account while the latter was celebrating his Japan Grand Prix title. The 28-year-old Australian driver had previously photobombed Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas while he was giving an interview at Silverstone earlier this year.
