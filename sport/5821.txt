Former world number one women's singles player Monica Seles was stabbed on court during a match on April 30, 1993. The then 19-year-old Yugoslav was attacked in the back during a timeout with a nine-inch knife by Gunter Parche, who claimed to be a fan of Seles' rival Steffi Graf. Seles returned to tennis almost two years after the incident.
