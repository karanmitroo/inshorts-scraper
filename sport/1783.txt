Former badminton player Prakash Padukone has said if the growth of badminton in India has to continue, the focus should be on coaching the coaches. He added the authorities should hire a foreign coach to train coaches. "In one year if we can get 50-100 coaches trained, that will make a big impact in revolutionising...Indian badminton," Padukone further said.
