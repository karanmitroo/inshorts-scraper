Shuttler Jwala Gutta has said there needs to be glamour in badminton for the sport to be promoted. "I've always been very conscious of clothes worn on and off court. But to see everybody go through it is good...For badminton to get that kind of popularity in our country, we need to do this," said Gutta.
