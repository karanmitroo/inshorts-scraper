US-based oceanographer Nick Pizzo has found the exact location on a wave where a surfer gains the maximum speed. Pizzo, who is also an avid surfer, said the "sweet spot" lies right inside the curl of the breaking wave. Studying breaking waves and how energy is transferred from underlying wave to the surface helps improve understanding of weather, he added.
