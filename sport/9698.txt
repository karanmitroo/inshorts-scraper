BCCI is planning to give cash cards to all national players following demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. The Board had already awarded the cards to a few officials and are now mulling to extend it to the players also. Cash cards are prepaid instruments provided by banks, which can be used by persons who don't have accounts with them.
