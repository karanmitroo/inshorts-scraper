Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was slammed for participating in a marketing campaign which asked people to share contact details of their friends on social media. Sachin was part of a video in a bank's campaign, which encouraged people to share "names, cities, and mobile numbers" of friends who "make excuses". The posts were removed after being criticised online.
