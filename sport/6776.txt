Murali Vijay survived after Australia lost their remaining DRS review on the previous ball during the Ranchi Test on Saturday. Australia unsuccessfully used their last review for an LBW appeal for Cheteshwar Pujara in the 58th over. On the subsequent delivery, Vijay inside-edged the ball which was caught at short leg, but the appeal was turned down by the umpire.
