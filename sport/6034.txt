Six-year-old Jack Dunn has become the youngest player to score a hole-in-one at Scotland's Bruntsfield Links, the world's fourth-oldest golf club. Jack, son of a club member, used his driver to putt the 134-yard par-three seventh hole. He adhered to the tradition of buying a drink for the club's members, serving Coke to celebrate the achievement.
