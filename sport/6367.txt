Mohammed Saif, a left-arm spinner, took all ten wickets in a second division league play-off match in Kolkata on Tuesday. Playing for Ariadaha Sporting Club, Saif took 10 for 28 and helped his team win the two-day match by 38 runs. "It (pitch) assisted spin and I was concentrating on getting turn and bounce and keeping things simple," Saif said.
