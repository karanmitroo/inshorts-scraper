Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis was slammed on Twitter for suggesting shortening of women's ODIs to 30 overs a side. A user tweeted, "Wait, so are you saying they women should not be given equal treatment? Or asking for equal treatment is... Wrong?" Waqar later tweeted a clarification, saying he meant no discrimination or prejudice towards women.
