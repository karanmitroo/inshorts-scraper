IPL Commissioner and senior BCCI official Rajeev Shukla has said the captain of the Indian cricket team will have no say in the selection of the new coach. He said the matter will be the prerogative of the Cricket Advisory Committee, with the BCCI taking the final call. He added the coach will be finalised before the Sri Lanka tour.
