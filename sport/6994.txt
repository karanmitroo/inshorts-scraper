Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's current bowling strike rate of 51.43 is the best by a Test spinner, who has picked a minimum of 50 wickets, in the last 100 years. Ashwin, who became India's fifth highest wicket taker in Tests after his eight wickets in the second Test, is the fastest to pick 25 five-wicket hauls in Test cricket.
