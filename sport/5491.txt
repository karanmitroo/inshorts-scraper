Argentina international Ezequiel Lavezzi has apologised through his Chinese club after publicity photos showing him in a racist pose caused outrage on social media in China. Lavezzi, who had joined the Chinese Super League side Hebei China Fortune last year, was seen smiling and pulling the corners of his eyes back to pose for the photographs.
