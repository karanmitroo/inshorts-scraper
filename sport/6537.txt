Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who scored a half-century and followed it up with his trademark sword celebration, said that next time he would try to score a century and celebrate with two bats as his swords. Speaking about his partnership with Ravichandran Ashwin, he said, "Ashwin and I maintain pressure from both ends...Hopefully, we can continue this outside India too."
