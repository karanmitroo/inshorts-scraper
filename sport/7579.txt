University of Kentucky's basketball fans set a Guinness record for the largest crowd roar at an indoor sports event, during their team UK Wildcats' match against Kansas University Jayhawks last week. The fans, known as the Big Blue Nation, recorded a roar measuring 126.4 decibels, beating the previous record of 126 decibels held by fans of NBA team Sacramento Kings.
