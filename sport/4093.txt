The family of late wrestler Khashaba Dadasaheb Jadhav, who bagged India's first Olympic bronze medal in 1952, has threatened to auction the medal to fund a wrestling academy. The wrestler's son said the Maharashtra government had planned an academy in 2009, but no action was taken. The family has also threatened a hunger strike if funds are not released.
