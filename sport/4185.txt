Swiss tennis player Roger Federer, who recently won his 19th Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon, has said it would be a "joke" if he wins a third Slam this year at US Open. "I'm not 25 anymore. I'm not sure I can win three Slams...Winning two is already pretty crazy and plenty good enough for me," said the 35-year-old.
