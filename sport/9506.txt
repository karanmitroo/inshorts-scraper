Nine-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt has said he could have won more titles if he'd gotten serious about his career earlier. "I was relying more on my talent. If I'd got more serious, I think I would have done a lot more...It's shocking but it's true. Maybe if I'd started younger, I'd have had four Olympics," he said.
