Former batsman Sachin Tendulkar became the first cricketer to smash 17,000 ODI runs during his 175-run knock against Australia on November 5, 2009, in Hyderabad. Sachin's 175(141) was his 45th ODI hundred and ninth against Australia, the most by a player against one team. Despite Sachin's innings, India failed to chase Australia's 350 and lost the match by 3 runs.
