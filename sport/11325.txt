Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin has become India's highest run-getter and wicket-taker in Tests in 2016. The 30-year-old spinner, who normally bats at number seven, scored 275 runs including two centuries in five matches to overtake KL Rahul as India's top run-getter of the year. In those five matches, he also took India's best 17 wickets, which includes two five-wicket hauls.
