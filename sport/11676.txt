MS Dhoni has filed a complaint with BCCI over technical failures that occurred during the second T20I against West Indies in Florida. The match didn't start on time as the production house could not uplink the signals, causing a delay of 50 minutes to the start of the game. According to ICC rules, the match should've begun despite the failure.
