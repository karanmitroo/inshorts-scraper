Indian bowlers equalled the record for getting the most number of batsmen out bowled in a T20I, registering six such dismissals during the rain-curtailed first T20I against Australia at Ranchi on Saturday. Out of the six bowled dismissals, Kuldeep Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah effected two each. Four other bowling sides have managed to achieve the feat in T20Is.
