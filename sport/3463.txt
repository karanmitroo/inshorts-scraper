Windies defeated England by five wickets in the second Test to register their first win in Tests in England since 2000, levelling the three-match series 1-1. Windies were helped by Shai Hope who slammed tons in both the innings, becoming the first batsman to do so in a first-class match at Headingley. The final Test will start on September 7.
