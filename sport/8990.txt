Ravichandran Ashwin, in a recent interview, picked the Antigua Test against West Indies as his most satisfying performance of 2016. Ashwin scored a century in the first innings and claimed seven wickets in the second innings to help India win the match. "My dream was to score a hundred and pick up five wickets in a Test," said the all-rounder.
