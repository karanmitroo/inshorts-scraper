Australian opener Aaron Finch was bowled by New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner following a mistimed sweep shot during the Canberra ODI on Tuesday. Finch attempted the shot early while Santner bowled a full delivery which hit the leg stump. Finch, dismissed on 19(34), had attempted a similar shot two balls earlier, which was dropped by NZ keeper Bradley Watling.
