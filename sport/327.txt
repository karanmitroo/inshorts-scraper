Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath was jokingly shown a red card by umpire Billy Bowden for mocking an underarm delivery in the first-ever T20I, on February 17, 2005. McGrath was re-enacting the 1981 incident when Australia's Trevor Chappell bowled underarm to save seven runs off the last ball. Australia won the first-ever T20I against New Zealand by 44 runs.
