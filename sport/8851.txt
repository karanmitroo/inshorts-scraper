Former Indian spinner Erapalli Prasanna has said Jayant Yadav's bowling is not suited to the traditional format of the game. "I do not think he will be able to bowl long spells at all," said Prasanna. Notably, Jayant picked up 9 wickets at an average of 29.55 and scored 221 runs in the three Test matches he played against England.
