American basketball player Akil Mitchell's left eye popped out of his socket after he was accidentally poked in the eye by an opposing player in a game in New Zealand on Thursday. The player, however, later posted two eyeball emojis on his Twitter feed and said he was "seeing fine" although he was due to undergo more tests.
