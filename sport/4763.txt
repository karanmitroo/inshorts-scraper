Afghanistan and Ireland have become eligible to play Test cricket after being granted full membership of the ICC. The decision was taken after a unanimous vote at ICC's AGM in London on Thursday. The nations, the 11th and 12th full members of the ICC, are the first to be inducted since Bangladesh was awarded the status in 2000.
