Following his maiden Test ton against India on Friday, Glenn Maxwell became the second Australian after Shane Watson and thirteenth player overall to score centuries across all the three formats. West Indian Chris Gayle was the first cricketer to achieve the feat after he smashed 117* off 57 balls in the first match of the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 2007.
