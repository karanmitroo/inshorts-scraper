Tommy McKay, a 32-year-old fan of Scottish club Dundee United, has won the Scottish Professional Football League's goal of the month award for a chip shot scored during a half-time challenge in a match last month. McKay, who plays for Scotland's only amputee team, Partick Thistle Amputees FC, beat professional players to win with 80% of the public vote.
