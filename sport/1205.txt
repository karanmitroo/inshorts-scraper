Former Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne was smashed for 150 runs by the Indian batsmen in his debut Test, which started on January 2, 1992, in Sydney. Ravi Shastri, who slammed 206 runs off 477 balls, was Warne's only dismissal in the match. Warne went on to take 708 wickets in Test cricket, the highest by any Australian bowler.
