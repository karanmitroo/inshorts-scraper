England all-rounder Moeen Ali became only the third player in Test cricket history to aggregate 1,000-plus runs and more than 30 wickets in a calendar year. Ali has taken 36 wickets and scored 1,034 runs this year, including four hundreds. While former South African cricketer Jacques Kallis achieved the feat in 2001, England's Ian Botham accomplished it in 1982.
