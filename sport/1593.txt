German top-tier club Eintracht Frankfurt's Marius Wolf was handed a red card for his tackle on a Bayern Munich player but was recalled from his dressing room to the field later by the referee. The match official referred to the video review before retracting the red card and awarding a yellow card, allowing Wolf to continue.
