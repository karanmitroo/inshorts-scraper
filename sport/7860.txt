A six-year-old boy was injured when the ball, hit by Indian batsman Suresh Raina for a six, struck him during the Bengaluru T20I against England on Wednesday. The ball hit the boy's left thigh, after which he had to be taken to the medical centre in the stadium. He, however, returned to watch the match after the doctor gave clearance.
