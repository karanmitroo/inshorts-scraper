ICC's Chief Executive Committee has proposed a regional tournament which will determine qualification for World T20. As per the proposal, a regional event will be held in each of ICC's five regions, similar to the existing Asia Cup, from which teams will qualify for the World Cup. ICC is also mulling to host two World T20s between 2018 and 2022.
