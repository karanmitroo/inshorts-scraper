Virat Kohli's childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma has revealed the cricketer gave up fast food to improve his fitness. "Kohli once told me, if I don't set the benchmark as captain, who else will...He used to gorge on butter chicken, rolls and all sorts of fast food. But today, it finds no place in his diet," said Sharma.
