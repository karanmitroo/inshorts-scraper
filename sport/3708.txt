South African Olympic and Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, nicknamed the 'Blade Runner', was allowed out of prison on Wednesday to attend his grandmother's funeral. Pistorius is serving a six-year sentence at the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013. Pistorius' grandmother died of old-age related complications last Thursday.
