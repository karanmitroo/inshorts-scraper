With the victory against Australia on Tuesday, India now simultaneously holds series wins against all Test-playing nations. India is the third team to accomplish the feat, with Australia having done it twice earlier and South Africa once. The 2-1 series win over Australia is Virat Kohli's ninth consecutive as captain, the longest streak by an Indian skipper.
