Perth Scorchers' wicketkeeper Sam Whiteman produced a direct hit from around 27 metres to dismiss Sydney Thunder's Pat Cummins in the Big Bash League on Sunday. Cummins' lofted shot was mistimed and went towards the square leg, where no fielder was placed. Whiteman ran towards the ball and attempted a successful direct hit with Cummins falling short of the crease.
