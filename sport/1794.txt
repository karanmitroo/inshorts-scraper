Talking about making a comeback to Team India, Indian cricketer Suresh Raina, in a recent interview, said that the selectors would have to let him play one day. "If not today then tomorrow...if not then after 10 days, if not then 10 months after but khilana toh padega," said Raina. The 31-year-old last played an ODI for India in 2015.
