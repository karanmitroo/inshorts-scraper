During the Caribbean Premier League match between St Lucia Stars and Trinbago Knight Riders, a delivery by spinner Khary Pierre to Stars' batsman Andre Fletcher hit the stumps but redirected to the boundary. The ball did not dislodge the bails despite the stumps getting  illuminated  as it deflected to the boundary behind the keeper, resulting in four byes.
