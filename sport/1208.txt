International cricket's first ever hat-trick was taken on January 2, 1879, by an Australian pacer named Fred Spofforth. Spofforth, whose nickname was "The Demon", claimed three English wickets in the third-ever international Test. The second wicket Spofforth took was of a player who was facing his first ever ball in international cricket.
