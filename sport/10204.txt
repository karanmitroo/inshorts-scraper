Batsman Cheteshwar Pujara's father, Arvind, has never seen his son play a Test match in India, and will do so for the first time in the Rajkot Test against England, which started on Wednesday. Arvind, who is also Cheteshwar's coach, expressed nervousness about watching his son play. Incidentally, Rajkot's Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium is the cricketer's home ground.
