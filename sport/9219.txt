Sydney Sixers' wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy produced a Mahendra Singh Dhoni-like look-away run out of Brisbane Heat's Holly Ferling during a Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) match on Monday. Healy jumped to collect a high throw from the deep midwicket fielder before instinctively hitting the wickets with her back facing the stumps.
