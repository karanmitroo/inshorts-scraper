New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson's name was misspelt on his jersey during the T20I against Bangladesh on Tuesday. Instead of 'Williamson', his 22-numbered jersey read 'Willamson'. Williamson, who noticed the typo, said, "Everyone makes a typo; it's just that this was permanent and beamed around the world. And it wasn't a rookie it was the best-known name in the team."
