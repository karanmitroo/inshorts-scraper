NFL's Houston Texans player Jadeveon Clowney dressed up in a prison jumpsuit for a Halloween party on Monday night. This comes after Houston Texans' owner allegedly referred to the players as "inmates" while discussing the players' protest during the national anthem at the games. However, team officials have claimed that there "was no hidden meaning behind Clowney's Halloween costume".
