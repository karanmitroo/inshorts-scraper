Video replay technology will be used to assist refereeing decisions in the friendly match between Italy and Germany on Tuesday. As part of a semi-live trial, there will be two video assistant referees who will monitor the goals, penalties, red cards, and other decisions but the main referee will not be able to review the footage on a pitchside monitor.
