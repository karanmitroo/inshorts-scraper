England's Ben Duckett, who was called up to take part in an Ashes tour game, has been dropped from the squad after he poured a drink on James Anderson in a late-night drinking incident in Perth. Earlier, a midnight curfew was imposed on England after Jonny Bairstow was involved in a 'headbutt' incident with Australia's Cameron Bancroft at a bar.
