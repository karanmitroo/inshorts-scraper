Australian coach Darren Lehmann has suggested the ICC to take the World T20 tournament to the United States. Lehmann stated that organising the tournament in the US would be the best way to "break the game there". "It can be a success there thanks to the significant supporter base that exists there among its large Asian community," he added.
