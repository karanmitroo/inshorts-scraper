The BCCI on Friday took to Twitter to share a video of former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni slamming a similar shot like the 2011 World Cup-winning six in the nets at the Wankhede Stadium. "When @msdhoni hits a big one at the Wankhede Stadium, it invariably takes us back to that famous six in 2011," read the caption.
