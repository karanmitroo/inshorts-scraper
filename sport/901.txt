Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag has said that if Ashish Nehra can make a comeback to the Indian team at 36 then even Yuvraj Singh can. "He's not in the Indian team...His talent is intact. I don't think we'll get a player like him again. If his form is good, he's a match-winner," Sehwag added.
