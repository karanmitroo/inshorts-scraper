Commenting on MS Dhoni's resignation as the limited-overs captain, Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin said that Dhoni's decision should be respected as he must have thought before passing the baton on. Ashwin further added that Virat Kohli is in the right phase to take over and looking at his 2016's achievements, he is no less a captain than MS Dhoni.
