US President Donald Trump on Friday slammed National Football League (NFL) players who protest the playing of the country's national anthem at games, calling them "son of a b****". "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now'," Trump said.
