The BCCI on Saturday announced a 15-member-strong Indian squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series against New Zealand starting October 22. Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, who had missed the recently-concluded ODI series against Australia due to his wife's illness, has been included. All-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin have been left out of the squad again.
