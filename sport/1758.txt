Ultra marathon runner Samir Singh started a 15,000-km run from Attari-Wagah border in Amritsar on Friday to raise funds for the families of Central Armed Police Forces jawans who lost their lives at the border. Earlier in April this year, Singh had taken up the challenge of running 10,000 km, by running 100 km daily for 100 successive days.
