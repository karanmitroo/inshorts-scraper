Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted in support of Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed, who was trolled and mocked on Twitter for his English speaking skills. Sehwag tweeted, "Criticizing Sarfaraz for not speaking English is insane. His job is to play & he has done brilliantly to take Pak in finals #StopColonialMindset."
