American football player Shaquem Griffin, who had his left hand amputated when he was four years old, put up 20 repetitions of 102-kg bench press using a prosthetic strapped to his left arm. The 22-year-old performed the presses at NFL Combine, where college football prospects perform physical and mental tests in front of NFL coaches.
