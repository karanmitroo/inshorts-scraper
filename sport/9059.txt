Farmers in Dulay, a village near Ludhiana, have sacrificed their land to build a stadium to boost sports in the region. The ground accommodates a cricket pitch, a football/handball ground, and a basketball court which is under-construction. The contribution for the construction of the ground came from the village sarpanch, a couple of villagers and an NRI from the UK.
