In an undercover investigation by a British tabloid, two Indian bookmakers have claimed they fixed up to 18 matches involving two IPL teams. Further, during the investigation, the tabloid's reporters were asked for $187,000 for spot-fixing in the third Ashes Test. A bookmaker said that a former Test bowler was paid $230,000 to bowl a wide in a T20 game.
