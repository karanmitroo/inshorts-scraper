England opener Andy Sandham, who scored Test cricket's first triple century on April 4, 1930, did not play another Test after scoring the first-ever international 300. Sandham had scored 325 in a Test against West Indies, and subsequently went on a tour to South Africa. The 40-year-old suffered a broken bone during the tour and never played a Test again.
