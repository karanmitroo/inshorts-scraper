Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi pulled off a boundary line catch during his team Karachi Kings' match against Quetta Gladiators in Pakistan Super League on Friday. Afridi first caught the ball with one hand and threw it up before losing balance and going outside the fence. The 37-year-old ran back inside and completed the catch to dismiss  Gladiators' Umar Amin.
