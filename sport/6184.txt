A Bangladeshi bowler gave away 92 runs in four legal balls, deliberately bowling extras to protest poor umpiring decisions in a Dhaka Second Division Cricket League match on Tuesday. The bowler, Sujon Mahmud, bowled 15 no balls and 13 wides, each of which went for four. The 32-ball over saw the opposition win in 0.4 overs, having scored 92.
