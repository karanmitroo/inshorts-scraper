As many as 1,400 soccer fans watching the Champions League final between Juventus and Real Madrid on Saturday in the Italian city of Turin were injured in a stampede, according to reports. The stampede was reportedly provoked by a firecracker mistaken for a bomb. Bags and shoes were left scattered on the ground as people ran screaming after the rumours.
