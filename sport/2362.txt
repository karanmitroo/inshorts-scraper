The propaganda cell of terror group ISIS has released a poster of a jihadist holding knife to football star Cristiano Ronaldo, days after it released a poster of Lionel Messi crying blood. In the poster, Ronaldo can be seen with a black eye and his hands tied. "Our words are what you see NOT what you hear," the poster read.
