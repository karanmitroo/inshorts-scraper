New Zealand tail-ender Neil Wagner got hit on his head three times in a space of 16 deliveries in the first Test against Bangladesh. One of the blows resulted in the grille of the helmet hitting Wagner on the chin. Wagner was put under medical observation for 48 hours initially but he came back on the field to bowl.
