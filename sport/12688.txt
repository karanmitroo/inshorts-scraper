Argentina national football team coach Gerardo Martino submitted his resignation from the post on Tuesday, citing lack of support from the Argentina Football Association in preparing an 18-man squad for the Olympic Games. The association reportedly owed Martino the last six months of his salary and also criticised his tactics in the two Copa America finals.
