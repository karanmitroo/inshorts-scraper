The UAE Football Association has issued a warning to 46 footballers for having "unethical hair" as per UAEFA guidelines. The hairstyles in question, referred to as 'Qaza' where only a part of the head is shaved, are banned as per certain Islamic teachings. During matches, referees are supposed to judge players' hairstyles which can inspire children, according to the Association.
