Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag has revealed he applied for the post of India coach after Ravi Shastri told him he would not apply. Sehwag added he had not intended to apply but did so after being convinced by BCCI officials and discussions with Virat Kohli. Shastri had told Sehwag he would not repeat the "mistake" he had made earlier.
