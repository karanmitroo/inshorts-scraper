Australian captain Steve Smith hailed Indian pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah as the best death-over bowlers. "First 38 overs, we were very good with the bat but we could not execute our plans towards the end," Smith said. Smith also said he needs to work on his catching after having dropped multiple catches in the three ODIs so far.
