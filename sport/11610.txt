Fifteen-year-old British swimmer Ellie Robinson seemed to make a 'gangster' entrance before her S6 50-metre butterfly event at the Rio Paralympics on Friday. Robinson, who reached the poolside wearing a black jacket with her hood up, stretched out her arms when the crowd started cheering. She later went on to win the gold medal at the event.
