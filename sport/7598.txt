Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim survived a run-out after the third umpire gave him the benefit of doubt during the ongoing Hyderabad Test against India on Saturday. Ravindra Jadeja attempted a run-out when Rahim was batting with Shakib Al Hasan. Rahim dove but it was unclear whether his bat was grounded or not, after which the umpire called it not out.
