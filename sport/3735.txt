Australian vice-captain David Warner had to retire hurt after he was hit on the side of his neck by a bouncer from his Australian teammate Josh Hazlewood. Warner was playing in a three-day practice match ahead of Australia's tour of Bangladesh. Notably, Warner's former teammate, Phil Hughes, had died on the field after getting struck by a bouncer in 2014.
