Cricketer Sachin Baby and his wife-to-be Anna Chandy announced their marriage date through a video in which they are seen playing cricket wearing RCB's jersey. The video starts with Baby readying to go out to bat, with an image of Sachin Tendulkar and chants of 'Sachin Sachin' in the background. Baby later gets bowled out by Chandy in the video.
