The mayor of Lauderhill city in Florida, which hosted India-West Indies T20Is, said he is getting maximum requests to organise an India-Pakistan series at the stadium. "I hope authorities take heed and host a series between these two nations," he added. India played its first international match in the US on Saturday in Lauderhill, the country's only designated cricket stadium.
