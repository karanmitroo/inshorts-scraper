Nadezhda Sergeeva, who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, has become the second Russian to test positive for a banned substance at the Games. This comes after Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky was stripped of his Olympic bronze medal after he had tested positive for a banned substance.
