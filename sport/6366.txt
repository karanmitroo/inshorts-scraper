Formula One driver and former champion Jenson Button was disqualified from an Ironman triathlon for overspeeding during the cycling section. Button, participating in the Ironman 70.3 in California, finished third but was later stripped off his title when he went over the speed limit in a cycling section where riders are supposed to be slow for safety reasons.
