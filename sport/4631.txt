Australia's cricket board, Cricket Australia (CA), has warned the national team's players that they will be unemployed if they fail to sign Cricket Australia's proposed MoU by July 1. Alongside the MoU, which comprises CA's revenue sharing contract, contracted and uncontracted Australian players will be expected to participate in foreign cricket leagues only after approval from the board.
