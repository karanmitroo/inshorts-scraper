American figure skater Jimmy Ma performed a routine to rap song 'Turn Down For What' by DJ Snake and Lil Jon at the 2018 US Figure Skating Championship. "The whole point was to get people hyped. Get older people hyped and for younger people to think it (figure skating) is cool," the 22-year-old said about his song selection.
