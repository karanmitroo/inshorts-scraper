British snooker professional Ronnie O'Sullivan sealed a world record seventh Masters title after registering a comeback victory over compatriot Joe Perry in London on Sunday. O'Sullivan has now surpassed Stephen Hendry's tally of six Masters trophies. "When I was younger I was just happy to win one, so to win seven, someone up there is looking after me", said O'Sullivan.
