Indian women's cricket team pacer Jhulan Goswami has said she has no time for a romantic relationship. "I am focusing on the game. If I can't devote time to a relationship then I won't be able to do justice to it. I would prefer to do one thing at a time...there's a lot of time for that," said the 34-year-old.
