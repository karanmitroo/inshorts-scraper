Indian cricketing great Sachin Tendulkar hit his maiden Test century at Old Trafford on August 14, 1990, becoming the then second youngest player to score a Test ton. The 17-year-old, who went on to score 100 tons in international cricket, said afterwards, "My ambition is just to play for my country as long as possible and to do my best".
