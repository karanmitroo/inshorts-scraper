England is the only country to appear in two Test matches in two different countries on the same day. England beat New Zealand in the Christchurch Test on January 13, 1930, the same day another English team was playing an away Test against West Indies. Two different teams were sent to the Caribbean and New Zealand to promote cricket there.
