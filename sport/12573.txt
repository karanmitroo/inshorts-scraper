The US women's volleyball team, while training for the upcoming Olympics, uses the VERT wearable jump monitor, which calculates their jump heights and counts, and sends the real-time data to an accompanying app. The team has also been using it as an injury-prevention tool. VERT President and Founder Martin Matak has claimed that NBA's Miami Heat also uses this wearable.
