Commenting on wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel's return to Test cricket, Indian team coach Anil Kumble said he was pleased that Parthiv "got a chance to open and that he did so well". "It shows the character of the player... he wasn't worried about failure. People always want to do well for themselves, he put the team ahead of him," added Kumble.
