The Chhattisgarh High Court issued a notice to the BCCI and Chhattisgarh State Cricket Sangh on Monday, following a PIL which alleged bias and nepotism in the selection of the state's Ranji Trophy team. The petition named three players who were reportedly inducted into the team without trials, adding that rules of selection are not available on the association's website.
