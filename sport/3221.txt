Former England cricket captain Kevin Pietersen, who is also an amateur golfer, was held in Geneva and London as he was seen doing golf swings at their respective airports. "Held in a cell in Geneva airport today. That wasn't fun! Partial arrest for a HOPELESS golf swing!" Pietersen later tweeted about the incident.
