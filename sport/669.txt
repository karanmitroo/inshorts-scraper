Mahatma Gandhi founded three football clubs, all named Passive Resisters Soccer Club, in the 1900s during his stay in South Africa. He would talk to teams at half-time about the principles of non-violent resistance and distribute pamphlets to spectators addressing the issue. Gandhi was assassinated 70 years ago, on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse during a prayer meeting.
