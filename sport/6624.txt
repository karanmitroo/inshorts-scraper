Force India's Mexican driver Sergio Pérez has been asked to lose weight by his team to compensate for a heavy car this season, which starts this weekend. F1 cars have a minimum weight limit, with every five kilograms of extra weight reportedly making the car 0.2 seconds a lap slower. Pérez has gone on a crash diet to lose weight.
