Gautam Gambhir has revealed that he once sledged Shane Warne over a text he sent to his ex-wife Simone Callahan by mistake. Warne had texted, "Hey beautiful, I'm just talking to my kids, the back door's open," when he was in England while Simone was in Australia. Gambhir asked Warne to make sure he sends text to the right person.
