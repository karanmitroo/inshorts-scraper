Mountaineer Arjun Vajpai scaled the 8,201-metre Cho Oyu, the world's sixth-highest peak, at the Nepal-Tibet border on Wednesday. This was the climber's second attempt, after he suffered a paralytic attack during his first in 2011. Vajpai has now climbed five of the 14 highest mountains in the world, and is the third-youngest Indian to summit Mount Everest at 16 years.
