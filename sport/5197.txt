Maxime Hamou, a 21-year-old French tennis player, has been banned from the French Open after trying to kiss a journalist during a live television interview. Hamou grabbed journalist Maly Thomas around the neck while she interviewed him following his first round defeat on Monday. Thomas later said she would have "punched" him, had she not been live on air.
