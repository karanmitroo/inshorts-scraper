Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli has hit back at critics for "conveniently" targeting former captain MS Dhoni while ignoring failure of other players, including himself. "I don't understand why people are pointing him out. If I fail as a batsman three times, no one is going to point fingers at me because I am not over 35," he added.
