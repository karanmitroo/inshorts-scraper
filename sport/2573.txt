Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag took to Twitter to wish ex-South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis on his 42nd birthday on Monday. Sehwag wrote, "Happy birthday @jacqueskallis75, one of the greatest ever cricketers to have graced the game. #JhakaasJacques." Kallis, who represented SA for 19 years, is the only cricketer with over 25,000 runs and over 500 wickets in international cricket.
