American baseball team Pittsburgh Pirates have installed an LED screen in their home stadium, which allows fans to play virtual reality games during intervals. A video showed a fan playing Super Mario on the 11-foot-high, 136-foot-long screen during a recent match. The screen, which converts into a scoreboard while a match is in progress, also has other games.
