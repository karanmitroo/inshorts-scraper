Australian cricketer Glenn Maxwell imitated Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja's sword celebration while wearing a motion-capture suit to shoot for an upcoming Ashes Cricket video game. Maxwell also imitated Steve Smith's batting technique and recreated cricket shots including Virender Sehwag's cut, Brian Lara's pull, Matthew Hayden's charging shot, and Tillakaratne Dilshan's 'Dilscoop' shot.
