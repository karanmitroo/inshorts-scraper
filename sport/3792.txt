Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag recalled his two consecutive first-ball dismissals, known as the 'king pair', in a Test match against England six years ago. "#OnThisDay 6 years ago, I honoured Aryabhatta unwillingly by scoring a king pair in Birmingham. Full on Kachha Limbu waali feeling," Sehwag tweeted. Notably, Sehwag had re-entered the squad after a shoulder surgery.
