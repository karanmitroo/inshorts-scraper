Ravichandran Ashwin uses five variations of spin during his spells including off spin, side spin, arm ball, carrom ball and top spin. While the arm ball does not turn off the pitch but follows the arm's trajectory, the carrom ball is released by flicking it like a carrom disc. Ashwin bowls the wider arm delivery to impart side spin.
