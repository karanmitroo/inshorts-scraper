On being asked if he would like to brand himself as the Don Bradman of the T20s, Caribbean batsman Chris Gayle said, "I am the Chris Gayle of cricket, the king, the universal boss of T20 cricket." "I am known for big-hitting, but since the T20s came in, my God, it has changed the entire script of cricket," Gayle added.
