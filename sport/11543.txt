The BCCI has decided not to invite any representative from the ICC for the celebratory event at India's 500th Test match, set to begin against New Zealand in Kanpur on September 22. The move follows BCCI exclusion from ICC's finance committee meeting, in which $135 million was allocated as a budget for the ICC Champions Trophy in England and Wales.
