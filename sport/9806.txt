Former West Indies captain Brian Lara has signed for The Bennett Hotel Centurions, a fifth-division Australian side, after the team approached him at a bar. The players reportedly printed out the registration form which Lara signed, while they filled out his career statistics. The team later sent an email to the cricket association titled "This is not a hoax".
