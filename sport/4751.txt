Lionel Messi's first agent Horacio Gaggioli has revealed the footballer could have signed for Real Madrid instead of Barcelona as a 13-year-old. Gaggioli had arranged Messi's trial at Barcelona in September 2000, after which the latter relocated from Rosario, Argentina. Gaggioli said had he lived in Madrid, where he actually considered living, Messi would have given a trial for Real.
