Pakistan spinner Yasir Shah's diving catch off his own bowling to dismiss West Indies' Darren Bravo helped Pakistan register a 56-run win in their 400th Test on Monday. Bravo, who was playing on 116, tried to hit a straight drive but only managed to send it straight back to Shah, who dived to his left to take the catch.
