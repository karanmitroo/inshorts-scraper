Spanish pole-vaulter Didac Salas failed to qualify for the Olympics after a local airline misplaced his pole in Amsterdam. The 23-year-old was scheduled to compete at an event in Barcelona on Sunday, but had to use a substitute pole since the airline lost his own. Salas recorded 5.35 metres at the event, falling short of the Rio qualification mark.
