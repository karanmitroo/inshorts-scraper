Indian commentator Sanjay Manjrekar was criticised by social media users after he posted a tweet about Tamil Nadu politics. "Generally uninterested in TN politics. Names too complicated," Manjrekar had tweeted. Responding to it, a user tweeted, "Names are not complicated, your education is," while another tweet read, "We can pronounce your names though all boils down to interest and effort."
