Former England bowler Steve Harmison has said Sachin Tendulkar thanked the English team with tears in his eyes for continuing their India tour in 2008 after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. In his autobiography, Harmison wrote, "Sachin Tendulkar...hit a hundred and the winning runs...He was in tears...For him to come into our dressing room and thank us was moving, very humbling."
