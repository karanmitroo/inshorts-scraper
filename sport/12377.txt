Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinoo Mankad and Polly Umrigar are the only Indian cricketers who have scored a century and have taken a five-for in the same Test. Further, Ashwin, who first achieved the feat in 2011, became the first Indian to do it twice when he notched up 113 runs and took seven wickets in the recently concluded India-West Indies Test.
