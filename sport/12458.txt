American golfer and the current World number six, Gerry Lester "Bubba" Watson and California-based sports equipment manufacturer Oakley recently introduced what they claim is the world's first golf cart jetpack. The vehicle, which was introduced to celebrate the return of golf to the Olympics after 112 years, can attain heights of 3,000 feet with air speeds up to 74 kmph.
