Former Swedish captain Zlatan Ibrahimović will be honoured with a bronze statue in Stockholm following his Golden Ball award for Sweden's best player for the tenth year in a row. The statue will be placed outside Sweden's national stadium. Ibrahimović's former PSG teammate David Beckham said, "His physique, his passion, his love for the game, hasn't changed."
