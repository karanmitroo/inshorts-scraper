Argentine football captain Lionel Messi stopped security guards from dragging away a crying kid who wanted a photograph with the Barcelona star in Montevideo, ahead of Argentina's World Cup qualifier match against Uruguay. The forward stopped the guards and asked them to allow the kid, who then stopped crying before hugging him and posing for photographs with him.
