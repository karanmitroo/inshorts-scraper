India captain Virat Kohli was given out lbw by the on-field umpire when he was on 0 before he used the DRS during the third South Africa ODI. The decision was overturned as the replays suggested Kohli had got an inside edge before the ball touched his pads. Kohli remained unbeaten in the innings, scoring 160 off 159 balls.
