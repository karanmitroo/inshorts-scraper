Choreographer Farah Khan has said she will choreograph the sangeet ceremony of Yuvraj Singh, who is marrying actress Hazel Keech on November 30. Yuvraj recently attended the dance show 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa' in which he danced to the song 'Maahi Ve' from 'Kal Ho Naa Ho'. Farah then said, "Main kasam khaati hoon ki Yuvraj ka sangeet main choreograph karungi."
