NBA team Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin wore shoes designed by an 11-year-old boy suffering from leukemia, during the team's game against Washington Wizards on Wednesday. Griffin is now auctioning the shoes, with the proceeds going to the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. The team will also match donations by people up to $25,000 for the hospital.
