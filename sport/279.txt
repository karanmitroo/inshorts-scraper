Former English football coach Barry Bennell has been jailed for 31 years for sexually assaulting 12 boys aged 8-15 while working at clubs including Manchester City between 1979 and 1991. "To those boys you appeared as a god...in reality you were the devil incarnate," the judge said while sentencing. The 64-year-old had been previously convicted three times of child abuse.
