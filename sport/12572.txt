The Chinese Football Association has struck a deal with FIFA to host the first 'China Cup' in January 2017, a competition that will involve its national side against three international “first-class” teams. The deal is backed by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, whose conglomerate is a FIFA sponsor. "We aim to become the best football competition in Asia", Wang said.
