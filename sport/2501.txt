Virat Kohli bowed down to Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar after the latter smashed a six off New Zealand pacer Adam Milne in the first ODI on Sunday. Bhuvneshwar had hit the six off a bouncer over long-on, following which non-striker Kohli congratulated him by bowing down. Bhuvneshwar scored 26 off 15 balls, including two sixes and two fours.
