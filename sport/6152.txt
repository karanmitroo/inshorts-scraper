The official website of the Indian Premier League wrongly mentioned Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli to be a left-handed batsman, whereas the player is actually a right-hander. On realising the faux pas, the website later updated the player's profile and mentioned him as a right-hander. Kohli played his first match in IPL 2017 against Mumbai Indians on Friday.
