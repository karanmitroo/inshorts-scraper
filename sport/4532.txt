Former English footballer David Beckham has defended kissing his five-year-old daughter Harper on the lips, after followers slammed the player for a picture he posted last month. "I got actually criticised...I kiss all my kids on the lips...We want to show our kids love and we protect them, support them, and we're very affectionate with them," said Beckham.
