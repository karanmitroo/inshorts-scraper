Pakistan Cricket Board's Chairman Shaharyar Khan has revealed the Board will file a compensation case against BCCI before ICC's Disputes Resolution Committee, to recoup financial losses incurred because of India's refusal to play bilateral series. Khan said BCCI did not honour the MoU signed between the countries, according to which India and Pakistan were to play six series between 2015-2023.
