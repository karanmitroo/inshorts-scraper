NBA player Glenn Robinson III produced two perfect dunks, including one that involved jumping over three people and slamming a two-handed reverse dunk, to win the 2017 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. He became the first Indiana Pacers player to win the dunk contest since 2004. "I've been an underdog all my life, all my career," Robinson said after his win.
