Spanish racer Marc MÃ¡rquez became the youngest four-time MotoGP world champion after clinching his fourth MotoGP world title in five years at the season-concluding Valencia Grand Prix on Sunday. The 24-year-old Honda racer, who only needed to finish in 11th place or better to seal the title, managed a third-place finish behind the race winner and teammate Dani Pedrosa.
