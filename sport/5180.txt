Tennis player Venus Williams mistakenly revealed that her sister and former world number one Serena Williams is expecting a girl. "She's going to call me her favourite aunt...We all like 'baby V, baby Lyn, baby Isha'. We all want the baby to be named after us," Venus said during an interview, while referring to the Williams sisters.
