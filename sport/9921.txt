Three Kazakh athletes have reportedly been stripped of their Olympic medals on doping charges. Silver-medallist Irina Nekrasova and bronze-medal winners Maria Grabovetskaya and Asset Mambetov have been disqualified after their samples from the Beijing 2008 Games tested positive for doping. Kazakhstan has one of the worst records in the retests carried out by the International Olympic Committee.
