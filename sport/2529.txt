Sri Lankan limited-overs captain Upul Tharanga has pulled out of the Lahore T20I against Pakistan due to security concerns. Tharanga's withdrawal made him ineligible to participate in the first two T20Is in UAE too as the Sri Lankan board decided to name only one squad for all the T20Is. Thisara Perera has been named skipper for the T20Is against Pakistan.
