Umpire Mick Martell stopped Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga from bowling and asked him what was in his pocket, during the first T20I against Australia at Melbourne on Friday. Malinga was repeatedly putting his hand in his pocket before each delivery, which made the umpire suspicious about ball tampering. Malinga revealed it was a hand warmer, which the umpire allowed.
