South Africa ended the third day of the Johannesburg Test at 17/1, needing another 224 runs to win against India. The day was called off early after batsman Dean Elgar was hit on the helmet, forcing umpires to discuss about the pitch, which offered uneven bounce throughout the day. While discussions were going on, rain also came into play.
