US-based blind skateboarder Dan Mancina, who performs skateboarding stunts in parks, hopes to go on a global tour as an ambassador for blind ambition. Mancina performs skating skills to challenge presumptions people may have about blind people. The 29-year-old is hoping that Francisco's LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired institute would help him with the tour.
