Bangladesh asked for a DRS referral against Indian captain Virat Kohli on Day One of the Hyderabad Test. The replays showed the ball to be nowhere close to the pads, hitting the bat nearly in the middle. The review was asked by wicketkeeper-captain Mushfiqur Rahim who had appealed for LBW, thinking the ball to have struck the pads first.
