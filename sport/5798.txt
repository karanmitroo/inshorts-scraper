Cheteshwar Pujara has said that he does not watch IPL on television, but not because he is not a part of the tournament. Pujara said that he only watches the tournament when someone else is watching it. "It's either practice or fitness training almost the entire day," Pujara said about the spare time he has got from missing the IPL.
