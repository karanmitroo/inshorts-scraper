The Supreme Court has allowed BCCI to release â‚¹58.66 lakh in order to host the first Test against England at Rajkot, which begins on Wednesday. BCCI had sought the Supreme Court's intervention so that matches don't get affected, after it was barred from disbursing funds to state associations. SC also ordered the Lodha Panel to appoint an auditor for BCCI.
