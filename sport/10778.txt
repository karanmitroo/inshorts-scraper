Badminton coach Pullela Gopichand has said Rio Olympics' silver medallist PV Sindhu is yet to be a "complete player". "There are lots of areas in the game that she needs to work on and improve. She has age on her side and will go a long way," said Gopichand, adding that Spain's Carolina Marin deserved the Rio gold medal.
