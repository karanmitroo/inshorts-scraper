India ended their campaign at the World Wrestling Championships without a single medal after Bajrang Punia lost his repechage round in men's 65 kg freestyle on the final day of the competition in Paris on Saturday. Notably, this is the second successive World Wrestling Championship in which the Indian wrestling contingent has returned empty-handed.
