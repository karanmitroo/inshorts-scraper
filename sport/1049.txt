Rahul Dravid, who celebrated his 45th birthday on Thursday, started wicketkeeping to get into his school team. Dravid revealed when he went to the inter-school selections, there was no wicketkeeper, so he made himself available as a wicketkeeper to get into the side. Dravid added he never kept wickets again until he was asked to keep for India in 1999.
