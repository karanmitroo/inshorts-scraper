Arsenal's Chilean forward Alexis Sánchez has confessed to having committed tax fraud in Spain of almost €1 million (approximately ₹7.25 crore). The Chilean, who confessed to two counts of tax evasion, defrauded the Spanish treasury between 2012 and 2013 when he was playing for Barcelona. Sánchez transferred money from his image rights to his Malta-based company called Numidia.
