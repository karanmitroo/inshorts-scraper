German football club SV Darmstadt 98 renamed their stadium as the 'Jonathan-Heimes Stadion am Boellenfalltor' in memory of Jonathan Heimes, a club supporter who died from cancer in March. The stadium's name will remain in memoriam for the entirety of the 2016-17 season. "Despite his illness, Jonathan has repeatedly given the team a lot of energy", said the club president.
