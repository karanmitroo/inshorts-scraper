American football legend and Hollywood star OJ Simpson was freed on parole on Sunday after spending nine years in a Nevada jail. Simpson, now 70, was sentenced to 33 years in prison following an arrest in 2007 over an armed robbery in Las Vegas, when he led a group of men into a casino to steal sports memorabilia.
