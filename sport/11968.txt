British long-distance runner Mohammed Farah won the men's 5,000 metres race on Sunday to secure his second gold in Rio, after having won the 10,000 metres event last week. The 33-year old had also won gold in both the events at London 2012. "It shows I didn't just fluke it in London. To do it again is incredible," said Farah.
