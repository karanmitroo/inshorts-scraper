In a domestic match at the Lord's on June 1, 1936, umpire Billy Bestwick declared Middlesex batsman Denis Compton LBW as he had to relieve himself. Compton was the last batsman to come out to bat and the umpire admitted that he adjudged the player out as he would have wet himself had he not ended the innings.
