Retired Australian spinner Shane Warne has admitted that his 'ball of the century' during 1993 Ashes, was a fluke. "It was one of those deliveries which all leg-spinners want to bowl and I am proud that I have bowled it," Warne said. The delivery, Warne's first in Ashes, pitched outside Mike Gatting's leg-stump before spinning back to hit the off-stump.
