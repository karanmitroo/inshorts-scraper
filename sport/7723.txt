Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting feels that Indian skipper Virat Kohli is the best one-day batsman in the world but it is not yet time to call him a great of the five-day format. "[T]he Tendulkars, the Laras, the Kallises â€“ those guys played 120, 130-200 Test matches. Virat's not even halfway along that path," Ponting said.
