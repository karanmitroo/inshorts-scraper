Australian motorcycle stunt performer Robbie Maddison performed an almost vertical 120 metre-long ski jump at Park City’s Utah Olympic Park, USA, while riding on a customised dirt bike. The rider, who was around 130 metres shy of the highest recorded jump while skiing, also ​navigated around the Olympic Park at high speeds.
