Australia defeated England in the first T20I to retain the Women's Ashes, a seven-match points-based multi-format series. Australia won four points from two ODI wins, two points from the drawn day-night Test alongside two from the T20I victory to take an unassailable lead. Australia won the last series, which was staged in England and Ireland, 10-6 in 2015.
