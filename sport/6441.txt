England's ODI captain Eoin Morgan has said change is needed in the current format of cricket since "people are falling out of love with the game". Speaking about England's new city-based T20 tournament, Morgan said, "We're always going to have the same cricket fans unless we do something differently...People are falling out of love...because it's not engaging enough."
