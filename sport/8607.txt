Two members of BCCI's five-member senior selection committee will be removed after they were found to be ineligible as per the Lodha Panel guidelines. Selectors Jatin Paranjpe and Gagan Khoda, who have only represented India in ODIs, stand disqualified as Lodha guidelines require a national selector to have Test experience. The selection committee will now be a three-member panel.
