Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt's preserved samples will undergo dope retests before his London 2012 bronze gets upgraded to silver, a Wrestling Federation of India official said. Silver-winning late wrestler Besik Kudukhov's samples tested positive for doping due to which Dutt's rank was elevated. However, he tweeted he'd like the late wrestler's family to keep the medal and the recognition is enough.
