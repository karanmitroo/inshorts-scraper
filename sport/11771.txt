BCCI President Anurag Thakur said the board is open to using the revised model of Decision Review System (DRS), provided the Hawk-Eye technology is completely removed from it. According to Thakur, the point of using the technology is nullified since it is not 100% accurate. DRS was first implemented in Tests in 2008 and India has opposed its usage since.
