Tennis player Roger Federer was the subject of a social media hoax on Thursday, after an article claiming he had met with a serious accident surfaced online. It was later clarified that the rumours were false and the photograph being circulated online was of an unrelated car crash. Federer, meanwhile, was in Spain to promote Rafael Nadal's tennis academy.
