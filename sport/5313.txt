Indian-origin wrestler Jinder Mahal mocked USA at his title celebration after defeating Randy Orton to become the new WWE champion. Mahal, who entered the arena doing bhangra along with a dance troupe, said, "Randy Orton is just like all of you...he is just like America. He's on the decline." Mahal then spoke in Punjabi while the crowd chanted, "USA, USA."
