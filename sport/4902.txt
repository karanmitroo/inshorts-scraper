Australia won the 1999 Cricket World Cup after playing out a tied semi-final against South Africa on June 17, 1999, in Birmingham. Batting first, Australia scored 213, which the Proteas matched after Allan Donald was run out on the fourth ball of the last over. Australia progressed to the final because of a better run-rate in the Super Six stage.
