The Sports Ministry rejected wrestler Narsingh Yadav's allegations of conflict of interest against Sushil Kumar, over his appointment as a national observer for wrestling. Sports Minister Vijay Goel called the allegations "baseless". Narsingh had objected to Sushil's appointment, since the Olympic bronze medallist is involved in grooming talent at an akhada run by his father-in-law Satpal Singh.
