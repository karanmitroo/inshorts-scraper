Following Spanish badminton player Carolina Marin's statement, where she claimed that she wouldn't let India's Saina Nehwal become world number one, Nehwal responded by saying that she has already been world rank one in her career. "Right now, Tai Tzu Ying is at the top spot and let's see whether Marin can herself become world number one," Nehwal added.
