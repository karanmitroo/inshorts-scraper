Mumbai batsman Shreyas Iyer has been called in as a cover for Virat Kohli for the Dharamsala Test against Australia, which starts on Saturday. Kohli, who injured himself while fielding during the Ranchi Test, has reportedly been taking pain-killing injections but has not been ruled out. Iyer scored an unbeaten double hundred against Australia in a tour game last month.
