The hijab has been made compulsory for all women participants at next year's world chess championships in Iran. Female participants are threatening to withdraw from the tournament over the issue, accusing the World Chess Federation of failing to stand up for women's rights. Reportedly, women face arrest or a public reprimand in Iran if they don't wear the hijab.
