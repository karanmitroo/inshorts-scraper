Former world number one tennis player John McEnroe has said that he regrets the comments he made about tennis star Serena Williams. McEnroe, who had claimed Serena would rank like "700 in the world" on the men's circuit, has now said, "It would have been easier to leave it. Look, she's a great player and it's apples and oranges."
