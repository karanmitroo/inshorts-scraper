Pakistani cricketer Umar Akmal, who had been reprimanded by the PCB for his outburst against coach Mickey Arthur, has alleged that he was verbally abused by the coach. Akmal said that Arthur had dismissed him in a demeaning manner after he wanted to use facilities at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), stating he should "earn the right" to use them.
