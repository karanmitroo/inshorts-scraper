Former England pacer Steve Harmison has revealed in his autobiography 'Speed Demons' that he contemplated committing suicide when he was ranked world number one in Tests. "Fast forward to the great summer of 2004...The demons had not bothered to travel. They had come to get me at home, in the middle of a very successful English summer," said Harmison.
