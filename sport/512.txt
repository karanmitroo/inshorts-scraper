India captain Virat Kohli on Wednesday slammed 160*(159) against South Africa to record the highest score by an Indian in an ODI in South Africa. The previous record was held by Sachin Tendulkar who slammed 152(151), his 34th ODI hundred, against Namibia in the 2003 World Cup. Incidentally, Kohli broke Sachin's record with his 34th ODI hundred.
