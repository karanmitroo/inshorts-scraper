German football club Bayern Munich have sacked three-time Champions League winning coach Carlo Ancelotti a day after their 0-3 loss against Paris St-Germain in the CL group stage on Wednesday. Under Ancelotti, who has won the Champions League both as a player and coach, Bayern reached the tournament's quarter-final last year and are currently third in the German league.
