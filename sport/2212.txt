Reacting to New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor's 'Agli silai Trivandrum mein' tweet, Virender Sehwag tagged UIDAI and asked if Taylor can get Aadhaar for "such wonderful Hindi skills". UIDAI responded, writing, "Language no bar. Resident status is what matters." Sehwag and Taylor have been engaging in a banter ever since Sehwag pointed out how Taylor can mean darji (tailor).
