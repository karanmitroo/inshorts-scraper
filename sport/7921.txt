Sachin Tendulkar has revealed he used a waiter's advice to change his playing style. A waiter in Chennai had approached the cricketer and said his elbow guard restricted the bat's swing. "He was 100% right...I knew I was uncomfortable but I never thought of it myself...I realised padding on elbow guard is inadequate...I instantly redesigned my elbow guard," said Sachin.
