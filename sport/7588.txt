Reacting to Pakistani cricketers being involved in spot-fixing in the Pakistan Super League, a user tweeted, "You may take fixing out of cricket but not Pakistan cricket!". Other users tweeted, "My gaming console wasn't working. I gave it to my Pakistani cricketer friend. He fixed it." and "Deported from a domestic cricket league. Only in Pakistan".
