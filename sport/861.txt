Team India coach Ravi Shastri said players need to rectify the "schoolboy errors" that led to run-outs in the second South Africa Test. Cheteshwar Pujara was run-out twice, once on duck and again while running for a third run, whereas Hardik Pandya got out after failing to ground bat. "You can't afford to give away wickets like that," added Shastri.
