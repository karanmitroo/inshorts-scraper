Responding to her criticism for questioning the Padma awards, Indian shuttler Jwala Gutta said, "People don't realize that cribbing is...about materialistic things. I am not a cribber." "I questioned the system of Padma Shri. It is not just for myself but for others as well to know why do people actually get Padma Shri," said Jwala.
