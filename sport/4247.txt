The Ladies Professional Golf Association has been criticised by former players for enforcing a dress code that bans plunging necklines, short skirts that reveal the "bottom area", leggings, among other attire. The LPGA said the new code was in place so that "players present themselves in a professional manner to reflect a positive image for the game."
