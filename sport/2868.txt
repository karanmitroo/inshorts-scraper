Indian opener Rohit Sharma was hit on the head by Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade's throw during the fourth ODI on Thursday. The incident happened in the 16th over when Wade received the ball from long-on and attempted to return it to the bowler. The ball fell short of the bowler and landed on non-striker Sharma's helmet.
