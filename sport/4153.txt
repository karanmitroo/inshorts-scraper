IPL Chairman and senior BCCI official Rajeev Shukla made a faux pas on Twitter, writing "Champions Trophy" instead of "World Cup" while congratulating the Indian women's team for reaching the final. Shukla was trolled for the error, following which he deleted the tweet and reposted his wishes. Shukla called the women's team's achievements a "defining moment for Indian Cricket."
