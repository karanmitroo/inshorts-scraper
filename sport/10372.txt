Australia's Shaun Marsh took a diving catch at short leg to dismiss South Africa's Temba Bavuma during the ongoing Test at Perth on Thursday. Bavuma, batting on 51, edged a Nathan Lyon delivery towards Marsh who caught it one-handedly leaping to his right. The dismissal ended Bavuma and Quinton de Kock's 71-run stand for the sixth wicket.
