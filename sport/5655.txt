Kolkata Knight Riders' opener Sunil Narine said he was surprised after he made the joint fastest half-century, scoring 54 runs in just 17 balls, in the IPL during KKR's match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday. "Definitely wasn't expecting something like this... I try to keep it simple and back my ability", Narine said about his innings.
