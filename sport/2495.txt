MS Dhoni's wife Sakshi had contacted Suresh Raina to inform then Indian captain about the birth of his daughter Ziva, when the team was in Australia for the 2015 World Cup. Dhoni did not have his phone around him which led Sakshi to send an SMS to Raina to inform him. Journalist Rajdeep Sardesai's book revealed the incident.
