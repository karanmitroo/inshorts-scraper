Madhya Pradesh batsman Harpreet Singh remained unsold at the IPL auction because of an incorrect tweet regarding his arrest. The social media news updates had mixed up Harpreet's name with Harmeet Singh, who was arrested for driving his car straight into Andheri Railway Station's platform. A franchise official revealed they wanted to buy Harpreet but didn't after reading a tweet.
