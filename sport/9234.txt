A 'spin summit' in Australia in 2009 made it illegal for cricket coaches to teach the 'doosra' in Australia. The doosra is an off-spinner's delivery which unexpectedly turns away from a right-handed batsman. The committee, which included former spinner Shane Warne, said the doosra cannot be bowled with a legal action, without 'chucking' or throwing the ball.
