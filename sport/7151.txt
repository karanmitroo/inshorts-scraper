Former spinners Rajinder Goel and Padmakar Shivalkar, who will be awarded BCCI's Lifetime Achievement award this year, have never played international cricket. While 74-year-old Goel took 750 wickets in 157 first-class matches, 76-year-old Shivalkar claimed 589 scalps in 124 domestic games. The awards, decided by a three-person jury, will be given at a ceremony on March 8 in Bengaluru.
