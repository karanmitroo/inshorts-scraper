Talking about the upcoming India-Australia Test series, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said, "They (Australia) might come back hard at Kohli, they will do that in the first Test match." "I'm not sure it's going to make any difference to Virat Kohli. They targeted him in Australia and he came back and played superbly," added Ganguly.
