American tennis player Jack Sock kissed a lineswoman's forehead, after the ball hit her at the Hopman Cup in Perth on Tuesday. Following a 204 kmph serve from opponent Feliciano LÃ³pez, the ball straight hit the lineswoman's head after which Sock went upto her, rubbed her forehead and gave her a kiss. The woman then signalled that she was fine.
