Playing in the Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen, Real Madrid's Zinedine Zidane hit a left-footed volley to win Real Madrid the Champions League on May 15, 2002. Roberto Carlos sprinted down the left flank, before sending in a looping cross which Zidane bundled into the goal's top-left corner after hitting it from near the edge of the box.
