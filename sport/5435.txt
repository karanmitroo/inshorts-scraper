American baseball player Chris Iannetta was hit by a 150 km/h pitch during a Major League Baseball game last week. Iannetta was put on a 'seven-day concussion disabled list' after suffering a broken nose, broken teeth and a split upper lip. "Having a busted-up lip and broken teeth is the best-case scenario when you get hit like that," said Iannetta.
