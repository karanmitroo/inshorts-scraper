Kenyan runner Paul Lonyangata won the men's Paris marathon, while his wife Purity Rionoripo stood first in the women's category of the same race on Sunday. Purity finished the race in two hours, 20 minutes and 55 seconds, smashing her personal best by almost four minutes. Paul still won despite losing time while doubling back after missing a water station.
