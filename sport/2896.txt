Former Australian cricketer Rodney Hogg has accused Australian captain Steven Smith of picking his friends in the national team. "Smith shouldn't be a selector...We saw (Nic) Maddinson get selected (he's) a mate, he's one of Steve Smith's mates. You can't pick bloody mates," Hogg added. Hogg's comments come after Australia registered their 11th consecutive away loss in ODIs.
