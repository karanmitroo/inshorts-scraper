Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has apologised for posting a video online wherein he can be heard yelling at his nephew for wearing a dress. In the video, which has since been deleted, Hamilton shouted, "Boys don't wear princess dresses." "My deepest apologies for my behaviour as I realise it is really not acceptable for anyone." Hamilton later tweeted.
