For the first time in Test cricket, a team's top four scored tons in an innings, when Wasim Jaffer, Dinesh Karthik, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar scored centuries against Bangladesh on Test that started on May 25, 2007. Jaffer and Karthik retired due to exhaustion, following which Sachin and Dravid helped amass 408 runs without India losing a single wicket.
