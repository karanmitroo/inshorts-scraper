Former US men's junior team member Jacob Moore became the first male gymnast to file a lawsuit against former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, who was given up to 175 years in prison for molesting young female gymnasts. Moore has joined more than 260 women who have claimed to have been sexually abused by the doctor.
