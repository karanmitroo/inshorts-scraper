Reacting to Indian women's team skipper Mithali Raj being pictured carrying his autobiography, ex-England captain Nasser Hussain said the book will not help her win a World Cup semi-final. Raj was photographed ahead of India's semi-final against Australia on Thursday. Nasser led the England team in the 2003 World Cup, exiting the tournament after the team boycotted a match.
