England cricketer and Yorkshire captain Gary Ballance will miss his side's pink-ball County Championship clash against Surrey due to being colour blind. The left-hander said he struggled to pick the pink ball previously and cannot differentiate between the pitch and ball. Ballance added that he has spoken to an optician to see if it could be of any help.
