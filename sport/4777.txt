USA Cricket Association was expelled from ICC at the Council's AGM in London on Thursday, 52 years after being inducted as a member. This comes after three suspensions given to USACA since 2005, since the body did not "genuinely exercise authority over the sport in USA". ICC CEO David Richardson said they would be ready to oppose any legal action.
