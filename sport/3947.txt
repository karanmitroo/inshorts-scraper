Sukhbir Singh, a 33-year-old Singaporean Sikh referee, was allegedly subjected to racial abuse on social media while he was officiating Chelsea's match against Inter Milan. Following a penalty decision, many users called him a "p**i c***t", saying he should not be a referee. UK-based anti-discrimination organisation 'Kick It Out' has said the matter is being investigated.
