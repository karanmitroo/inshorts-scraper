Reacting to India suffering their worst seven-wicket collapse in Tests against Australia on Friday, a user tweeted, "India just pulled off a Pakistan. Australia on the other hand is being themselves." Other tweets read, "India has already started missing MS Dhoni," and, "Switched on the TV and saw Australia batting again. Thought it was yesterday's highlights."
