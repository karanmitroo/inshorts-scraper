Pakistan's Cricket Board will send a legal notice to BCCI next week seeking compensation for India's refusal to play in the country. PCB has accused India of dishonouring the MoU between the nations, as per which India and Pakistan were supposed to play six series between 2015-2023. PCB claimed it lost around $200 million in revenue because of India's refusal.
