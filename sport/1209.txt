Manikandan, a 14-year-old footballer rescued as a child beggar from a temple in Kollam, Kerala, will undergo a one-month training camp at Real Madrid. He earned the opportunity after being spotted by trainers at an I-League junior camp. Manikandan and his sister were reportedly found begging for a living by the Child Protective Services and sent to a children's home.
