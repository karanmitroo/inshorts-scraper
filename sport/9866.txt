England pacer James Anderson clean bowled Cheteshwar Pujara with an in-swinging delivery in the Visakhapatnam Test. The ball came back in after pitching and went through the bat and pad of the batsman to knock out the middle stump. The pacer had bowled a short pitch delivery earlier in the over to push the batsman on to the back foot.
