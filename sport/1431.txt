Sydney Thunder wicketkeeper Jos Buttler was hit on the head, after a stray throw by teammate Andrew Fekete bounced sharply during Sydney Sixers' innings in the Big Bash League opener on Tuesday. The match was delayed by several minutes and resumed after Buttler was deemed fit to play. Later, Buttler was dismissed for a duck during his team's successful chase.
