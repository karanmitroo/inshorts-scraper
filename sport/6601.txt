Basketball player Michael Jordan's former USA teammate Charles Barkley has said the former used to bet amounts like $300,000 (almost â‚¹2 crore) on a single golf putt during games. "We'd be playing golf with certain people, for a couple hundred dollars a hole...He's like, 'Pick that up, Charles,'...I'm like, 'How much is that putt for?' He's like, '$300,000'," added Barkley.
