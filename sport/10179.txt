Alexander Zhukov, the outgoing chief of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), said that the drugs testing system imposed on Russia following revelations of doping is inefficient. He further said that while doping was a problem in Russia, there was no such thing as a state-backed doping system, as claimed to have been uncovered by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
