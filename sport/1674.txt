A 21-year-old footballer, who was photographed while hurling stones at security forces in J&K in April, met Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday as part of a 25-member delegation of women footballers. Afshan Ashiq, who captains J&K's first ever women football team, said the viral stone-pelting photo was clicked when she defended her teammates after the policemen "roughed" them up.
