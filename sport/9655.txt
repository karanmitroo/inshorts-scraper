Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin induced a chip shot from English batsman Moeen Ali to dismiss him in the second innings of the Mohali Test. The bowler deceived Ali in flight, making him come down the wicket in anticipation of a half-volley. Ali ended up chipping the ball in air as the ball pitched away from him, and was caught at mid-on.
