New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor trolled ex-cricketer Virender Sehwag by posting a picture of a closed tailor shop in Rajkot after the second T20I. The picture accompanied a caption which read, "@virendersehwag #Rajkot mein match k baad, #darji (Tailor) Ki dukaan band. Agli silai #Trivandrum mein hogi... Zaroor Aana." Earlier, Sehwag had called Taylor 'Darji', a wordplay on his surname.
