Hyderabad lost a T20 match against Karnataka by two runs after officials added two runs to Karnataka's total after their innings. Umpires wrongly signalled two after a Hyderabad player touched the rope during Karnataka's second over, which led to officials changing the total from 203/5 to 205/5. Hyderabad later asked for a super over thinking they had tied the match.
