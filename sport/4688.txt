Kerala's traditional snake boat racing, which is held during Onam, is set to become an IPL-like league-based sport with the inaugural edition of the Kerala Boat Race League scheduled to start in August this year. The league, comprising nine races, will feature snake boats, which are usually 100-foot long and require around a hundred rowers to ride.
