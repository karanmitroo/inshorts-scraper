Cheteshwar Pujara broke the 52-year-old record of most runs in an Indian first-class season, set by Chandu Borde in 1964-65. Pujara took his season tally to 1,605 first-class runs on the first day of the Hyderabad Test against Bangladesh, past Borde's record of 1,604 runs. While Borde played 28 innings to get those runs, Pujara did it in 21 innings.
