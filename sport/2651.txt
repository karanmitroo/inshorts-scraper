Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan took to Twitter to share the moment his brother and Baroda teammate Yusuf Pathan got to his hundred against Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy. In the video, Irfan, who was at the non-striker's end, can be seen leaving his bat and jumping in joy even before Yusuf raised his bat after hitting a six.
