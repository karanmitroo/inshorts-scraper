Snapdeal-owned FreeCharge has pulled out from the Indian Premier League contract following cash crunch at its parent company, days before the tournament is scheduled to begin. FreeCharge had signed a ₹100 crore contract with the BCCI in 2015 for on-ground sponsorship rights for two years. This comes after FreeCharge raised ₹30 crore from existing investor Jasper Infotech a week ago.
