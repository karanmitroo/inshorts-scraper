England's Ben Stokes was dismissed by Ravichandran Ashwin on day two of the Mumbai Test, following a successful review by India. Umpire Bruce Oxenford initially declined Ashwin's appeal for a catch at first slip by Virat Kohli, after which India went for the review. The third umpire reversed the decision after UltraEdge showed a visible edge from the bat.
