British lifter Eddie Hall, nicknamed ‘The Beast’, deadlifted 500 kg to create a new record in strongman competitions. Hall, who passed out because of burst blood vessels post the lift, said, “That nearly killed me. The pressure on my body was surreal. It’s not healthy doing something like that.” Hall is planning to compete in the World’s Strongest Man competition.
