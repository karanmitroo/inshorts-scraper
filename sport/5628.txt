Shooter Abhinav Bindra has slammed the National Rifle Association of India over the detention of shooters at Delhi airport, asking if Indian cricketers would ever be subjected to such a situation. Abhinav tweeted that the support from the national federation was "pathetic" and the athletes were left to fend for themselves after a team manager left them stranded.
