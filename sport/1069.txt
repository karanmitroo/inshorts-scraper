Yusuf Pathan has said the prohibited substance for which he has been banned was detected in a medicine which he was consuming for throat infection. Admitting he should have been more careful, Yusuf said, "I promise to be more careful with what I consume henceforth." Yusuf further thanked BCCI for allowing him to plead his case in a "reasonable manner".
