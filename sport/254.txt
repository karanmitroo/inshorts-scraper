An Indian newspaper recently published an interview with someone who they believed was ex-WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan. The interview titled 'I am falling in Love with India: Hulk Hogan' talked about the India visit of Hogan's lookalike 'Mr Wrestling' and also accompanied his picture. The newspaper later took down the report from its website claiming it to be "factually incorrect".
