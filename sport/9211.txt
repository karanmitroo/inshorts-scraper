The organising committee of the 2016 Rio Olympics has been unable to pay $3.7 million owed to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), three months after the Games. Rio organisers say the amount, intended to reimburse travel expenses incurred by national committees, has been seized by other creditors through lawsuits. As per IPC, national Paralympic committees now risk defaulting on loans.
