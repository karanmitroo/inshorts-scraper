Iran's Olympic weightlifting champion Kianoush Rostami will auction his gold medal, which he won at the 2016 Rio Games, to raise money for the victims of Sunday's earthquake. "I am returning the [medal]...which is theirs by right, to my people," Rostami said. The earthquake, which killed over 500 people, is the deadliest to strike Iran since 2012.
