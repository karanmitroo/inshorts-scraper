Rising Pune Supergiant's captain Steve Smith claims that his relationship with RPS' former captain MS Dhoni is "pretty chilled out". "He has been fantastic and has had a few valuable contributions with the bat and he is hitting the ball really well," Smith said about Dhoni. Smith also hopes Dhoni would return to form by the end of the tournament.
