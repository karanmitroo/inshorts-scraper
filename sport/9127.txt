Few men were reportedly found using women's loos at Bengaluru's Kanteerava Stadium on Friday. The men had reportedly torn the signboards and on questioning their presence in the women's restrooms, a woman athlete was told there were no signboards to indicate so. Earlier this week, the athletes had found a note in the restrooms asking them to masturbate before practicing.
