Barcelona forward Lionel Messi mistook Argentine footballer Sebastian Driussi for a fan and posed for a photo with him at a hotel in Moscow, Russia, where he is on international duty. Messi came to know that Driussi was part of Argentina's U-20 team when the latter uploaded their picture on Instagram. Messi then sent a message to him to apologise.
