The Amicus Curiae on Thursday, responding to Supreme Court's query, accused BCCI President Anurag Thakur of perjury, saying he lied in his affidavit. Thakur was asked to clarify whether he asked ICC Chief Shashank Manohar to write to SC that the Lodha reforms were government interference. The court has given the Board a week's time to suggest a new administrator.
