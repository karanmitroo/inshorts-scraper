The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has asked the BCCI to take into account atmospheric pollution while determining suitable playing conditions for a match. The IMA added that it was "greatly troubled" over the India-Sri Lanka Test that was played in Delhi despite high pollution levels. The Delhi Test saw play being halted multiple times with some players even throwing up.
