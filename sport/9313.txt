Virat Kohli became only the second Indian captain after Sunil Gavaskar to score more than 500 runs in a series, as he scored his Test career's 15th century and eighth as captain during Day 3 of the Wankhede Test. With this, he also equalled Sachin Tendulkar's record for most Test centuries (4) by an Indian captain in a calendar year.
