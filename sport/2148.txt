UFC champion Conor McGregor attacked officials after jumping into the cage to celebrate his teammate Charlie Ward's victory at an MMA event in Dublin. McGregor, who was not permitted to step into the octagon, retaliated after the referee and officials tried to interrupt the post-fight celebration. McGregor was heard screaming, "I'm sick of you. That was a f**king stoppage."
