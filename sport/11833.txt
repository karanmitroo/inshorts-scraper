A two-minute video explores the life of a blind soccer player, Andre de Souza Carlos, who has completely lost his vision. In the video, Carlos discusses how playing blind soccer "provided a fuel to keep fighting after he lost his vision". The sport is played by visually impaired or blind people using a ball, which has six rattles inside it.
