Umpire Chris Gaffaney raised his finger to apparently dismiss Cheteshwar Pujara, but ended up scratching his head during the Ranchi Test against Australia on Sunday. Pujara attempted a hook shot on a Josh Hazlewood bouncer, with the ball being caught by keeper Matthew Wade. Gaffaney raised his finger but went on to scratch his head with no appeal from Australia.
