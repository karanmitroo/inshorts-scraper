ISIS militants executed four footballers in Syria and posted their pictures on Twitter, which showed children examining the bodies. The footballers, who played for a local club Al-Shabab, â€‹were accused of spying for a Kurdish rebel group. Last year, ISIS killed 13 young boys for watching an Asian Cup football match, as it considers football and other sports anti-Islamic.
