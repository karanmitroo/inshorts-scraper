Shooter Abhinav Bindra reportedly broke his gun before the 10-metre air rifle qualification event on Monday, after falling from a chair. Bindra ended up damaging his rifle's ‘sight’, which he’d especially got made for the Olympics. Reportedly, before the same event at​ the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bindra’s gun was tampered with, but he eventually won the gold medal.
