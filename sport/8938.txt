At Rio Olympics, an Italy-Egypt beach volleyball match showed sharp cultural divide as the athletes competed in hijabs and bikinis. In an event showcasing true Olympic spirit, an athlete stopped and helped an injured competitor complete 5,000m race after a collision. A six-year-old Afghan kid, who became famous after wearing plastic bag with 'Messi' handwritten on it, met him recently.
