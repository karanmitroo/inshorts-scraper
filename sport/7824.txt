Sourav Ganguly has credited Indian Premier League for Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal's rise in T20Is. "He (Chahal) has got better and better by bowling in the IPL. He knows exactly what to do. It's a terrific effort. IPL has had great effects on India's T20," said Ganguly. Notably, Chahal took six wickets for 25 runs against England on Wednesday.
