Indian seamer Mohammed Shami's bowling broke England captain Alastair Cook's stump to dismiss him on the second day of the Vizag Test. Shami, bowling at 142 kmph, pitched the ball in the middle which seamed in and went on to hit Cook's off stump, breaking it into two. Cook was dismissed for 2(11) in England's third over.
