South Africa was suspended by the ICC in 1970 following a resolution against the country's government's apartheid policy. The country returned to international cricket after a 21-year gap on November 10, 1991, playing versus India at Calcutta. During the ban, SA could only play against rebel teams from England, Australia and New Zealand, and could field only white players.
