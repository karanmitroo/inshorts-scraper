Sunrisers Hyderabad's Yuvraj Singh complimented Kevin Pietersen on his yellow socks, which he wore during IPL's post-match show, by tweeting, "Looking sharp in those yellow socks mate @KP24 @IPL  hope you're well yours truly, the piechucker". "Love you! Not your bowling!", replied Pietersen, who had termed the Indian all-rounder as a 'pie-chucker' for his wicket-taking abilities.
