New Zealand batsman Neil Wagner was adjudged run-out in the Christchurch Test despite grounding his bat inside the popping crease. The rules require a batsman to ground some part of his foot behind the crease before the bails are dislodged. Wagner, in this case, had not grounded his foot behind the crease and was entirely airborne when stumps were disturbed.
