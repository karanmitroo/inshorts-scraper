Delhi Daredevils' 19-year-old batsman Rishabh Pant scored five boundaries which included three sixes and two fours off consecutive deliveries in what turned out to be Kolkata Knight Riders' pacer Umesh Yadav's most expensive over of his IPL career. Yadav, who ended with figures of 53/1 in 4 overs, conceded over 50 runs for the fourth time in his IPL career.
