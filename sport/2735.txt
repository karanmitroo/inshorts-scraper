Lionel Messi-led Argentinian side, the 2014 World Cup finalist, is in danger of missing out on next year's World Cup in Russia, after playing out a goalless draw against Peru on Friday. With only one more game remaining, Argentina is placed sixth in their qualification group, from which top four teams will qualify and fifth will play a qualification match.
