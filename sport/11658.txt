Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell made the second-highest individual T20I score of all time, scoring 145*(65) in the first T20I against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. Maxwell, scoring his maiden T20I century, fell short of Aaron Finchâ€™s 156, scored against England in 2013, which is the highest T20I individual score. Incidentally, the top three T20I individual scores are now held by Australians.
