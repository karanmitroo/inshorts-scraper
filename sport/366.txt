Reacting to Indian spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal taking 33 wickets in the India-South Africa ODI series, cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Yeh #ChaKu humka dedo Thakur. 33 wickets for ChaKu, stabbed South Africa brutally." The 33 wickets taken by Kuldeep and Chahal in this series are the most by any Indian spin pair in a bilateral ODI series.
