Wishing former Indian captain Kapil Dev on his 58th birthday, former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Stressed out, go just chill, feeling ill, go take a pill, In mood for Tabadtod Cricket, Go watch KAPIL. Happy Birthday @therealkapildev paaji." Notably, Kapil Dev led India to its first ever World Cup victory in 1983.
