Former BCCI chief selector Sandeep Patil says that the selection committee would've dropped former batsman Sachin Tendulkar from the ODI squad if he had not retired from ODIs in 2012. Patil revealed that the selectors had a chat with Sachin, after the fourth Test against England at Nagpur and added that perhaps Sachin understood what they were trying to indicate.
