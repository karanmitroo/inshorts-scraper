Amul recently released a poster on Indian cricketer Karun Nair, who became the second Indian to score a triple century in Tests. The poster showed the Amul girl with Karun captioned, "Kyarun banaye". Karun is also the quickest batsman in the world to reach his maiden triple ton, taking three innings to do so.
