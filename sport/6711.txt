The England and Wales Cricket Board has asked its players to play "bold and brave cricket" to attract new players and fans to the sport. "It doesn't work every time...cricket is not a privileged pastime...This is about winning the battle of the playground but it's also about winning the battle of the car park," said ECB chief executive Tom Harrison.
