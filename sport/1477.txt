Australian captain Steve Smith on Saturday became only the second batsman to score 1000-plus Test runs in a calendar year for the fourth successive time. Smith joined compatriot Matthew Hayden, who had scored 1000-plus runs in five consecutive years from 2001 to 2005. Smith is the only player to score 1000-plus runs at 60-plus averages in four consecutive years.
