Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has said Virat Kohli's success in the recently-concluded Test series against England has put pressure on limited-overs skipper MS Dhoni. "Virat's Test success will put pressure on the selectors...He will become the captain in ODIs and it's just a matter of when...I feel the (limited-overs) England series will be critical for Dhoni," said Ganguly.
