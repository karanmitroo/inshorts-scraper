Pakistan pacer Imran Khan, playing in the Bangladesh Premier League, missed a run-out opportunity due to lack of knowledge of rules. The ball dislodged the bails at the non-striker's end and rolled on to the bowler, who hit the stumps again instead of pulling out the wicket. The laws require the fielder to uproot the stumps in such a situation.
