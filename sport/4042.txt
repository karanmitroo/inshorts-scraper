Responding to Mike Tyson's comments on the upcoming Conor McGregor-Floyd Mayweather bout, McGregor posted an Instagram photo captioned, "You are all going to eat your words for the rest of your days, while I eat lobster for the rest of mine." Tyson had claimed that McGregor had made a mistake and would "get killed" while fighting against Floyd Mayweather.
