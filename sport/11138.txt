Indian cricket board BCCI has asked the ICC to not include India and Pakistan in the same group in future multi-nation tournaments. "If the two countries reach the semi-finals and have to clash at that time, it is another situation which can't be avoided," said the BCCI President. The next multi-nation tournament is the Champions Trophy, scheduled for next year.
