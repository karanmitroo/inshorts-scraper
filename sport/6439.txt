England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson has admitted he would've seriously thought about Test captaincy, following Alastair Cook's resignation in February. "I don't know if I'd have taken the captaincy but it would've been nice to have been considered for it", the 34-year-old said. He, however, went on to say, "it makes sense for a younger guy to do it".
