Adelaide United goalkeeper John Hall banged his head into the side post of the goal while making a save in the 34th minute of the Australian League match against Newcastle. Rather than getting substituted after the knock, Hall played on and helped his side register a 1-0 win over Newcastle. Hall made another save just moments after the knock.
