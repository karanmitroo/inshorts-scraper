British professional boxer Amir Khan says he is mistaken for actor Aamir Khan "all the time". "Even on the phone people mistake me for him. And on Twitter, Facebook, people send me messages thinking this is Aamir Khan 'the actor's' account. I think that my fans would be sending messages to his account too," said the Olympic silver medalist.
