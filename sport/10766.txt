Indian ODI players Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli and captain MS Dhoni are supporting the Star Plus' 'Nayi Soch' campaign, which aims to question various societal stereotypes that hold women back. The campaign, released during the team's series against New Zealand, features the players wearing jerseys with names of their mothers on the back instead of their own names.
