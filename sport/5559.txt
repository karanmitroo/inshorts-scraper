Barcelona's Spanish defender Gerard Pique is part of a consortium planning a World Cup-like tennis tournament, which has already been backed by Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. The tournament, which will take place in one location, will not have Davis Cup's format. "Tennis needs an event like that, and I think it would be very good," Murray said.
