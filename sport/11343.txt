Dutch club Willem II Tilburg's midfielder Anouar Kali became the Netherlands' first player to be sent off by the 'video assistant referee' (VAR), after his yellow card was converted into red. Referee Pol van Boekel, sitting in a parked van with six TV screens, scrutinised the incident's replays before asking the on-field referee to reverse his decision through a headset.
