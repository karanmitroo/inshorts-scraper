International football's governing body FIFA closed down its anti-racism task force after claiming that the body "has completely fulfilled its mission". The FIFA Task Force against Racism and Discrimination was established in 2013 by the then-FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Notably, the UEFA-affiliated FARE Network recently reported a surge in the number of racist incidents involving Russian fans.
