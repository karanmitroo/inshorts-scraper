Pakistan Cricket Board has offered to help banned spinner Danish Kaneria a "permanent, well-paying job" after the cricketer spent four years without playing any form of cricket. Reportedly, the issue was taken up when a Hindu member of Parliament spoke about the PCB doing nothing about the life ban imposed on Kaneria.
