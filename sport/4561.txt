American tennis player Venus Williams broke down in tears after her first round win at Wimbledon on Monday, following the death of a man in a car crash involving her in June. Venus was asked about the accident in the post-match press conference where she said, "There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and...yeah. I'm completely speechless."
