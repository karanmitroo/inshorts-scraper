The El Cl√°sico exhibition match between Real Madrid and Barcelona Legends, scheduled to be held in Mumbai on September 15, has been postponed due to unavailability of some players, the organisers said on Sunday. "[The exhibition match] will now be held tentatively in the first week of October ahead of the [U-17] World Cup," one of the organisers said.
