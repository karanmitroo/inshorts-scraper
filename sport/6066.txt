Gujarat Lions' Brendon McCullum pulled off a mid-air catch near the long-off boundary off the batting of Chris Gayle but he was denied the catch as the replays showed his hat flicking the boundary cushion. McCullum had successfully taken the catch inside the boundary rope but failed to stop his hat touch the rope on the follow-up.
