Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien referred to Indian Test captain Virat Kohli during the GST debate in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. “Virat was born when the GST concept was first introduced. There are millions of young Virat Kohlis across the country who are looking at us on Friday. For their sake, we need to implement the GST Bill,” O’Brien said.
