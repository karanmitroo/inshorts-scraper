Muhammad Ali’s 1974 heavyweight championship belt will be auctioned in September, along with the boxer’s other memorabilia, in the biggest sale since his death in June. Ali’s belt is expected to fetch $600,000, while his ‘Rumble in the Jungle’ trunks are expected to rake in $150,000. A handwritten letter explaining his conversion to Islam will also be up for sale.
