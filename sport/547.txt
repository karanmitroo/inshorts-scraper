Formula One has announced it will replace 'grid girls' with 'grid kids' from the start of the upcoming season. The 'grid kids' will be chosen by their motorsport clubs on merit, or by lottery, and will already be competing in karting or junior formulae. They will be accompanied by their immediate family, who will have paddock access during race day.
