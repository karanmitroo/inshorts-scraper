The Marylebone Cricket Club, international cricket's law-making body, has allowed substitutes to keep wickets under its new set of rules, following an injury to the team's primary wicketkeeper. Umpires will however need to give their approval for the change to prevent misuse of the law. Substitutes will still not be allowed to bat, bowl or lead the side.
