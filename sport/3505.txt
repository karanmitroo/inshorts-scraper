Boxer Floyd Mayweather will earn a minimum of $100 million (₹640 crore) from the richest boxing match in history. His opponent Conor McGregor will get $30 million (₹192 crore), 10 times his previous career-high purse. However, Mayweather's purse is expected to cross $200 million, while McGregor's might exceed $75 million once pay-per-view buys and other revenue streams are added up.
