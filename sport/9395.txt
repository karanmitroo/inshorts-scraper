Former Australian pacer Geoff Lawson was once fined for examining an umpire's spectacles after a series of his appeals had been turned down. Interestingly, Lawson, born on December 7, 1957, was a qualified optician. Lawson, who later became the Pakistan team coach, was associated with the team when they reached the final of the inaugural T20I World Cup.
