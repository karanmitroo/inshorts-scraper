Charles Townsend, born on November 7, 1876, is the only bowler in the history of first-class cricket to take a hat-trick of stumpings. Townsend achieved the feat while playing for Gloucestershire against Somerset in 1893. William Henry Brain, wicket-keeper on the day, hailed from a family traditionally steeped in the brewery business. Interestingly, Townsend played just two Tests for England.
