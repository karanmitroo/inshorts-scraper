Justice RM Lodha, head of the Supreme Court-appointed Lodha Committee, has said he spoke to six former Indian captains, including Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, before recommending the reforms. The reforms, which were opposed by BCCI, were also discussed with then-president Jagmohan Dalmiya and then-secretary Anurag Thakur, who was later sacked by SC for declining them.
