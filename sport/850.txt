Indian cricketer Suresh Raina, who has been retained by IPL side Chennai Super Kings for the 2018 edition, has said playing for the franchise made him a "real" cricketer. "The coaches and the players there, like Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and Muttiah Muralitharan had a fine influence on me. I have learnt a lot from them," Raina added.
