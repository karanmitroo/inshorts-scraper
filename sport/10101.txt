The wrongful death cases of wrestlers Matt Osborne and Nelson Frazier against WWE were dismissed by a US court. The lawsuits, filed by the widows of the wrestlers, claimed that both the wrestlers had suffered serious brain injuries while working with WWE. Osborne died in 2013 due to accidental opiate overdose while Frazier died after an heart attack in 2014.
