A boxing match which was supposed to be a World Featherweight title eliminator was cancelled on Friday with less than 24-hour notice after a contender fell in the shower, breaking his teeth and injuring his face. Mexican boxer Andrés Gutiérrez, a former world champion in featherweight and super-bantamweight, was due to fight Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton in his home town.
