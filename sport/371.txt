South African pacer Lungi Ngidi took to Twitter to share a video meme of himself with Malayalam actress Priya Varrier, created by a fan. The video, captioned "Valentine's day done", shows Priya's wink expression from the songÂ 'Manikya Malaraya Poovi' and the bowler's camera-shy moments from a Test against India. Lungi will represent Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 IPL.
