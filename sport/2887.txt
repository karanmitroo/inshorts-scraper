A video has emerged that allegedly shows England cricketer Ben Stokes, who was arrested in Bristol, landing 15 punches in one minute at two men outside a nightclub. One of the men was seen wielding a bottle with which he tried attacking someone from Stokes' group. Stokes, who missed England's ODI against Windies on Wednesday, was later released by police.
