A Pakistani fan trolled Indian captain Virat Kohli for not being a part of the World XI team which is currently playing in Pakistan. In the second T20I on Wednesday, the fan held up a placard which read, "Virat Kohli ko Ami se ijazat nahin mili". The World XI team does not have any Indian as BCCI didn't give clearance.
