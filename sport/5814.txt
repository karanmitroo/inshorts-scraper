Indian weightlifter Sushila Panwar has been provisionally banned by the Indian Weightlifting Federation after failing a dope test. The National Anti-Doping Agency conducted the test on March 25 in Patiala, in which her 'A' sample was found to test positive for banned substances. This comes after Indian goalkeeper Subrata Pal also failed a dope test on Tuesday.
