Former England captain Nasser Hussain has set a Guinness World Record for the highest catch of a cricket ball. The 48-year-old caught the cricket ball that was dropped using a drone from a height of 150 feet in windy conditions at the Lord's stadium. The ball reached an approximate speed of 119 km/h before landing safely in the cricketerâ€™s hands.
