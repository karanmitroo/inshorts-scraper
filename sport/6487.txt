Australian captain Steve Smith has said he does not know if Virat Kohli was referring to him when clarifying about not being friends anymore with "a couple of individuals" from the Aussie team. "That is for Virat to answer. I don't know if I am one of those couple of players Virat was hinting at in his tweet," said Smith.
