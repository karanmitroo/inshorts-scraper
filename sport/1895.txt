England was beaten at home for the first time by Australia in 1882, following which an English newspaper featured a mock obituary of English cricket. "The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia," it read. The then England captain vowed to "regain those ashes", which was termed as 'a quest to regain the Ashes' by English media.
