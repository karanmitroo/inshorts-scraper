Davis Cup, the first ever international tennis team tournament, is named after American player Dwight Filley Davis, who initiated the tournament when he challenged British players to play against his Harvard University team. Dwight Davis had personally spent over $1,000 on the construction of the silver trophy, which was first put up for competition on February 9, 1900.
