Reigning UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor rode a horse naked to promote the upcoming Pegasus World Cup, an American thoroughbred horse race, on January 28. The video, part of a four-episode series called the '13th Jockey' featuring McGregor, shows the fighter telling his mentor that he wants to "ride Stark Bollock naked", which he eventually does.
