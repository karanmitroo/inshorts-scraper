The Centre for Science and Environment has slammed tennis ace Sania Mirza for featuring in a "blatantly false, misleading" advertorial by an organisation representing the poultry industry. The body urged Sania to dissociate herself from the advertorial, which misrepresented a study on the use of antibiotics in the poultry industry. The advertorial appeared in a national daily on February 27.
