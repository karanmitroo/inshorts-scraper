Former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju will head a legal panel which will advise and guide BCCI in adopting the Lodha Committee recommendations. Katju will be assisted by three legal counsels, including BCCI legal advisor Abhinav Mukerjee. In a ruling in July, the Supreme Court had given BCCI six months to “reform” as per the Lodha Committee recommendations.
