ICC's new revenue structure, which would see the BCCI losing reportedly â‚¹1,000 crore of their revenue share, was accepted in principle at a meeting on Saturday. Out of the 13 ICC Board members, 10 voted against the existing 'Big Three' revenue model, of which BCCI is the biggest beneficiary. A final decision on the model is expected in April.
