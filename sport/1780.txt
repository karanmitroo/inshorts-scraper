Former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden has said that though Ravichandran Ashwin's statistics are "simply phenomenal", he is not as attacking off-spinner as Harbhajan Singh was. He further said that Ashwin enjoys a better fast bowling support than what Harbhajan used to get. "Harbhajan I thought in his era was 'the dominant bowler' especially against Australia," Hayden added.
