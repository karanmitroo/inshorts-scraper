Defending Virat Kohli over criticism of his captaincy, former India captain Sourav Ganguly said that it is important to be patient as the ongoing South Africa tour is his "first big overseas tour". Adding that nobody is a born leader, Ganguly said, "It's important that leaders are allowed to develop...I'm convinced Kohli will keep getting better at this."
