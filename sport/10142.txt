Indian cricket team's last defeat in a home Test match came in 2012 when they were beaten by England in the Kolkata Test. India has hosted Australia, West Indies, South Africa, and New Zealand at home since, and won each of the series without dropping a Test. India play England in the first five-Test series in India in 30 years.
