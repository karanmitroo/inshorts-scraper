Gautam Gambhir was involved in a Twitter exchange with a radio channel over the songs played on Republic Day. Gambhir tweeted, "Every Aug 15th or Jan 26th FM stations play patriotic songs. Sadly all dat vanishes next day. Why?" "@GautamGambhir Some occasions deserve a special celebration, but imagine if your TV only aired Republic Day parade everyday," replied the channel.
