India's lone individual Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra's Twitter account was hacked on Monday reportedly by a Turkish group, which posted pro-Turkish military messages on his handle. "Operation in Afrin, I support Turkey," one of the tweets read. Recently, accounts of Anupam Kher, Abhishek Bachchan, Kiran Bedi and Pritish Nandy were also hacked by the 'Turkish Cyber Army' group.
