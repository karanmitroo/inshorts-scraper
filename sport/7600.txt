Ibtihaj Muhammad, who became the first American athlete to compete in the Olympics wearing a hijab, revealed she was detained at US Customs for two hours at an airport last month, following Trump's immigration ban. "Even though I represent Team USA and have that Olympic hardware, it doesn't change how you look and how people perceive you," said Ibtihaj.
