Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir has come forward to help 1998 Asian Games gold-medallist Dingko Singh, who is undergoing treatment for bile duct cancer. Dingko, who is a coach at SAI, had 70% of his liver removed as a part of the treatment. "It is disturbing to note that Dingko has been left alone to fight for his life," Gambhir said.
