Ex-Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is set to send a legal notice to former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad after the latter had accused the former of match-fixing while speaking to a news channel. Miandad had said that the whole Pakistan team fixed matches and that he wouldn't have left the team if he had money related issues.
