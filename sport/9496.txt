Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh got run out after a straight shot by Steven Smith was deflected on to the stumps by New Zealand's Jimmy Neesham in the first ODI at Sydney on Sunday. Marsh, who was way out of the crease at the non-striker's end, could only see the ball hit the stumps in no time in the 21st over.
