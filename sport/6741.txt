Cheteshwar Pujara scored his career's third double century during the Ranchi Test against Australia on Sunday. This is Pujara's second double hundred against Australia, with the first coming in Hyderabad in 2013. Pujara was earlier given out LBW off Nathan Lyon's bowling when he was at 157, but the decision was reversed after a DRS review by India.
