Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo has been named UEFA's Best Player of the Year for the 2016/17 season, becoming the first footballer to receive the honour thrice. Ronaldo finished ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon, to be awarded in back-to-back seasons. The 32-year-old was the top-scorer in last season's UEFA Champions League, which was won by Real Madrid.
