Barbados Tridents captain Kieron Pollard bowled a no-ball to deny St Kitts and Nevis Patriots' Evin Lewis the chance to score the second-fastest T20 century after Chris Gayle. Pollard bowled a big no-ball when Lewis was on 97 off 32 balls, with his team needing one run to win. Pollard was slammed for his alleged display of poor sportsmanship.
