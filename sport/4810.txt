A 15-year-old boy was killed during celebratory firing in Karachi, following Pakistan's win over India in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. The boy was standing on his balcony when he was struck by a stray bullet as men fired in the air. Nearly a dozen others were injured in separate incidents in Karachi, and several more in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
