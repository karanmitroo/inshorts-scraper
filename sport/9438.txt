Former West Indies batsman Brian Lara scored 501 runs in an innings in County cricket in 1994, to become the first and the only player to score 500+ runs in first-class or international cricket. Lara, who made his Test debut on December 6, 1990, against Pakistan in Lahore, also holds the record for the highest individual score in Test cricket.
