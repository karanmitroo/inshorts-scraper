Ben McKelvie, a dairy farmer from Manawatu, New Zealand, has built a 13,378 square-metre laser-levelled cricket field behind his house. McKelvie built the field after discussions with the local Bloomfield Club, taking advice from professional groundsmen for the construction. Bloomfield will use the pitch as their home ground, with McKelvie planning to add a scoreboard and pavilion later.
