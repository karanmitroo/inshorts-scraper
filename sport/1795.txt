England cricketer Kevin Pietersen blocked former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson on Twitter after the two were involved in a banter during the first Ashes Test. Johnson had taken a dig at English fast bowlers for not bowling quick after which Pietersen suggested that Johnson should 'sack' his management for tweeting. Pietersen blocked Johnson after the latter tweeted, "Good response #flog."
