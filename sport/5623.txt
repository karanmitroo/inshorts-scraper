Former Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has backed the Pakistani cricket team to perform well against their Indian counterparts in the upcoming Champions Trophy. "We don't have a great record against India in major events, but every day is a new day and I am sure the players will perform well in the first match," Inzamam added.
