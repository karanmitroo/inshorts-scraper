South Korean organisers of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics published a world map on the official website of the Games, completely omitting Japan. An official from the organising committee called the omission a "simple mistake", caused by changes in image files during updating. The mistake was corrected later but Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary warned that his country will "keep watching".
