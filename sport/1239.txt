F1 champion Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton has emptied his Instagram account and deleted some of his older tweets after facing backlash over a post in which he mocked his nephew sporting a blue and pink dress. Hamilton shouted, "Boys don't wear princess dresses". Hamilton later apologised and wrote, "[I] realised that my words were inappropriate so I removed the post".
