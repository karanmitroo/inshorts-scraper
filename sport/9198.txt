A telephonic helpline launched to address reported cases of child sexual abuse in football has received over 1,700 calls in the three weeks following its launch. The helpline, set up by UK's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was launched following revelations of abuse faced by former football players during their time as junior players in England.
