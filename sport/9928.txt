Former Australian Test captain Greg Chappell has been drafted in the Australia's four-man national selection panel on an interim basis. Trevor Hohns will be serving as interim chairman of the panel after Rod Marsh left the position on Wednesday. This comes after Australia suffered a fifth consecutive Test loss, after losing the second Test against South Africa in Hobart.
