ICC General Manager Geoff Allardice will make a presentation on the Decision Review System (DRS) before the BCCI next week. Allardice is likely to highlight a Massachusetts Institute of Technology research, which points at how DRS has become more reliable. India is the only country not using the DRS, despite being the first nation to test it in 2008.
