West Indies' Curtly Ambrose delivered ODI's second-most economical 10-over spell, registering figures of five maidens, five runs, and one wicket against Sri Lanka in the first match of Champions Trophy 1999 in Sharjah on October 13. Ambrose's figures were only second to compatriot Phil Simmons' figures of 10-8-3-4 against Pakistan in 1992.
