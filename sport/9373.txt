Marylebone Cricket Club's World Cricket Committee has recommended batsmen be given out if they are caught or stumped after the ball has made contact with the fielder's helmet. As per the existing law, a batsman is not out if the ball is caught after coming in contact with the fielder's helmet. The recommendation awaits approval from the MCC main committee.
