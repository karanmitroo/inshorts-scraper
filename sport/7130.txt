The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic venues are set to have gender-neutral public restrooms. At least one universal-use toilet has been planned for seven of the 11 venues the metropolitan government is building from scratch. Notably, Donald Trump's government has revoked the guidance to US public schools that allowed transgender students to use toilets matching their gender identity.
