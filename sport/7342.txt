Brazilian footballer Everton Luiz, who plays for Serbian club Partizan Belgrade, left the field in tears after being subjected to racial abuse during his team's 1-0 victory over Rad in Belgrade, Serbia. The crowd abused the player despite warnings by the referee and public address announcer, and also unveiled a banner with a racial message during the match.
