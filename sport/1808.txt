Former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist and former England captain Michael Vaughan recreated the incident where England's Jonny Bairstow greeted Australian debutant Cameron Bancroft with a headbutt. "Actually, in all seriousness, well done England, well done Australia; clarified everything, moved it on. Let's just focus on the cricket now," Gilchrist said about the incident.
