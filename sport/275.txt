Reacting to German figure skater Paul Fentz's Winter Olympics free skate routine to music from 'Game of Thrones', a user tweeted, "The German ice skater cosplaying Jaime Lannister and dancing to the GoT theme wins a gold medal at life." "Not going to lie, the #GameOfThrones theme song makes me want to dance on ice, too", tweeted another user.
