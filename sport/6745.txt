Aussie wicketkeeper Matthew Wade attempted a no-look runout during the Ranchi Test on Sunday but gave away one extra run. During India's 181st over, the fine leg fielder collected the ball and threw it at the striker's end where Wade back-flicked it to the non-striker's end. It resulted in an overthrow, while Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha took another run.
