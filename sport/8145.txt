Former New Zealand player Brendon McCullum vomited on the pitch after choking on a chewing gum in the Big Bash League on Friday. McCullum, playing for Brisbane Heat, sat down next to the wicket while batting and threw up, when the 12th man rushed to help. Teammates thought it was a heatstroke, but McCullum revealed it was the chewing gum.
