French forward Aboubakar Kamara, who was recently transferred to English football club Fulham, chose his jersey number to be 47 so that his nickname could be read as 'AK-47', referencing the Russian semi-automatic gun. The 22-year-old had scored 11 goals in 29 appearances for the French Ligue 2 side Amiens FC last season.
