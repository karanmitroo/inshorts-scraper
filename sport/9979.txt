Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has said South African pacer Vernon Philander was the hardest bowler he faced in his career. Describing the bowler as 'class act', the 41-year-old stated, "You don't get any visual clues with the swinging ball (when Philander bowls)." Philander took five wickets for 21 runs in the first innings of the recently concluded Hobart Test.
