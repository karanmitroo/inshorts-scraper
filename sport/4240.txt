The women's singles champion of Wimbledon is presented the Venus Rosewater Dish, which is a salver, made of sterling silver and measures 18.75 inches in diameter. The British tradition dates back to the 19th century when a woman's power was linked to the daily household activities she performed. Meanwhile, the men's champion is presented an 18-inch high silver trophy.
