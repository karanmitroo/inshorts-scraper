Spanish football club Real Madrid's transfer ban on signing players has been reduced to one transfer window after the club's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The Spanish club had been banned for breaching rules on signing non-Spanish under-18 players. Real will now be able to exercise their transfer rights as early as 2017's summer transfer window.
