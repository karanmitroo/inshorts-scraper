England captain Alastair Cook has made the most Test hundreds by a visiting batsman in India, scoring his fifth in the country on Sunday during the Rajkot Test. Cook went past Everton Weekes, Clive Lloyd and Hashim Amla, who have four centuries each on Indian soil. The century was Cook's 30th in Tests, which took him past Donald Bradman.
