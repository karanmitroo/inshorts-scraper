England batsman Joe Root was dismissed for 88 during the ongoing Chennai Test on Friday following a successful DRS review by India. India appealed for a caught behind off a Ravindra Jadeja delivery, which was turned down by the on-field umpire. Following a DRS review, the decision was reversed with UltraEdge showing that Root had edged the ball.
