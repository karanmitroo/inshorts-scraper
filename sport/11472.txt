Former athlete Milkha Singh has said Paralympians deserve the “highest recognition and awards the country can bestow upon them”. “They are shining examples of what a society can achieve through hard work, determination and commitment,” he added. His comments come after Sports Minister Vijay Goel said there was no decision to award medal-winning Paralympians the Khel Ratna award.
