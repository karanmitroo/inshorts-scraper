Sachin Tendulkar had not let Virender Sehwag watch the 2011 World Cup final live, and neither watched it himself, as a superstition when India were chasing Sri Lanka's 274-run target. Sachin revealed that in an earlier match, when he and Sehwag were getting a massage, India played well. Sachin stopped Sehwag from watching the final because of the same superstition.
