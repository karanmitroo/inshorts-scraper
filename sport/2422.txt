A video has emerged in which former Team India captain MS Dhoni is heard calling skipper Virat Kohli 'Cheeku' during the Pune ODI against New Zealand. The stump mic captured Dhoni giving fielding instructions to Virat, whose nickname is Cheeku. "Cheeku, do-teen jan ko idhar chod de! Cheeku ek ball aur rakhega," Dhoni is heard telling Virat.
