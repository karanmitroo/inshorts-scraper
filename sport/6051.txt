After former Indian captain MS Dhoni's finishing skills were criticised, Australian spin legend Shane Warne has said that the 35-year-old does not have to prove anything to anyone. Warne also applauded Dhoni's class and called him a great and inspiring captain. Dhoni's strike-rate in IPL 2017 so far has been 87.14 with an average of 15.25.
