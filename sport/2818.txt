South African pacer Morne Morkel extended his record of taking the most number of Test dismissals off a no-ball, after witnessing the 14th such wicket against Bangladesh in the first Test. "Somebody needs to hold it. It's 13 wickets I'd like to have in the bank, but it wasn't meant to be," Morkel had earlier said about the record.
