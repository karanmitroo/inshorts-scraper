Haryana Sports Minister Anil Vij has sparked a controversy for donating â‚¹50 lakh to Dera Sacha Sauda for promoting sports. The Opposition slammed the move saying that the games played at Dera like kho-kho are not played at national and international levels. However, defending himself, Vij said, "If I had power to donate more, then I'd have done so."
