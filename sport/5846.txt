Maria Sharapova has responded to Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard's remarks after the latter called her a 'cheater'. "I don't have anything to say, I am way above that," Sharapova said. "She's a cheater... I don't think a cheater in any sport should be allowed to play that sport again," Bouchard had said on Sharapova's return from the doping ban.
