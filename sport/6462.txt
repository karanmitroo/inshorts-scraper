Kolkata Knight Riders' CEO Venky Mysore on Friday said he hasn't heard anything about Umesh Yadav's reported unavailability for the first few weeks of the 2017 IPL season. Earlier, media reports had suggested Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja would miss the first three weeks of the tournament. Mysore added that he would wait for a BCCI statement before reacting.
