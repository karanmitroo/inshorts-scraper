Atl√©tico Madrid striker Fernando Torres scored with an overhead kick, with the ball looping over two defenders and the goalkeeper, in his side's 3-2 La Liga win over Celta de Vigo on Sunday. The 32-year-old, who also missed a penalty in the same match, received a pass with his back towards the goal before hitting the top right corner.
