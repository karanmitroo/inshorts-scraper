The distinction of scoring the first double-century in ODIs belongs to Australian female cricketer Belinda Clark, who played an innings of 229* against Denmark in 1997. Belinda made her double-hundred almost 13 years before Sachin Tendulkar, who scored 200* in 2010. Interestingly, Belinda's 229* was the highest individual ODI score till it was surpassed by Rohit Sharma in 2014.
