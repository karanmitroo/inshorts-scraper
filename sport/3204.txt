India's Priyanka Panwar, 4x400 metre gold medalist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, was banned for eight years by the National Anti Doping Agency on Monday. The 29-year-old tested positive for a banned stimulant during a national inter-state athletics competition last year, her second doping offence. She had earlier tested positive for steroids in 2011, resulting in a two-year suspension.
