Russian Deputy PM Vitaly Mutko has slammed world anti-doping agencies and said that they "should control the situation in their country, collect urine, but not interfere with politics". The statement comes after a joint statement by 19 national anti-doping agencies (NADOs) called for Russia to be stripped of all international competitions.
