India's World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has suggested that BCCI should buy its own private aircraft, to "make life easier" for Team India. "The board can afford it. They should have done it five years ago... If BCCI owns planes, the players will get enough rest between matches. I am sure BCCI can also afford the parking charges," said Kapil.
