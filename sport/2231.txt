The father of Girish Sharma, who invaded the pitch during a Ranji Trophy match in Palam, said that his son, a "cricket enthusiast", just wanted to watch the match up close. He further claimed that his son wasn't even aware that a Ranji game with international stars was taking place when he drove on to the ground on Friday.
