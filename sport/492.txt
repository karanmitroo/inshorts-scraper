The Norwegian delegation has taken more than 6,000 doses of asthma medication to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea's Pyeongchang. It amounts to 10 times more asthma drugs than what Finland has brought to the Winter Olympics. Last year, Norwegian ski team doctor Petter Olberg had estimated that 50-70 percent of the team had asthma.
