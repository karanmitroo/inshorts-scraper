Former Sri Lankan cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan has shared a video of himself giving a tutorial of his famous 'Dilscoop' shot. The shot involves the batsman going down on their knees to scoop the ball to the boundary over the wicketkeeper. The video, shared by ICC's Twitter account, shows Dilshan telling fans how short and fuller balls should be dealt with.
