Ravichandran Ashwin expressed displeasure and complained to the umpire, twice in the over, about Joe Root standing close to the official at the non-striker's end. The move by the batsman was aimed at having a better view of the LBW decisions, so as to assist Alastair Cook in the DRS appeals. Ashwin, however, clean-bowled Cook on the over's last ball.
