Swiss tennis star Roger Federer was quizzed by kid reporters at the BNP Paribas Open 2017. The kids asked Federer questions about his childhood, his pets as a kid and his favourite shot. The 35-year-old told the kids that he used to have two cats and two rabbits as pets. Federer also did push-ups with the kids.
