BCCI President Anurag Thakur officially became a part of ICC's Finance and Commercial Affairs committee, at the Board's meeting in Cape Town on Friday. BCCI had earlier expressed reservations about not having a representative in the committee, which approves all revenue-related decisions. Thakur was made Chairman of ICC's Development Committee, after which he became a part of the F&CA panel.
