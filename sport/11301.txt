ICC's amended Decision Review System rules will come into effect immediately, starting with Sunday's South Africa-Ireland ODI. According to the new rules, a not-out decision can now be overturned if the ball is striking between the outside of off and leg stumps, and the bottom of the bails. With the new rule, more batsmen are likely to be out LBW.
