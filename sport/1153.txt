Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya hit his Test career's third 50-plus score in only his Test career's fourth innings against South Africa on Saturday. All of his Test knocks have come at a strike rate of over 100 and have come outside India. Pandya's highest score in Test cricket is 108 (96), which came against Sri Lanka in August last year.
