Under their 'Adopt a Lion' campaign, New Zealand rugby fans have offered free stay for visiting Irish and British rugby fans who are expected to fly to New Zealand in June for a rugby tour. About 20,000 visitors are expected, while over 100 New Zealanders have offered free accommodation. Many have also offered to pick the visitors up from airports.
