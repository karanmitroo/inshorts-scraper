Hong Kong has pulled out of their second round Davis Cup tie, scheduled to be held in Islamabad next month, over security concerns. Hong Kong had challenged the Davis Cup Committee's decision to hold matches in Pakistan, but withdrew after an independent tribunal ruled in Pakistan's favour. Pakistan hosted its first Davis Cup match in 12 years last month.
