Former England footballer Adam Johnson, convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old, was secretly filmed laughing about his crime in prison. British tabloid The Sun released a video in which Johnson is describing his crime as "f*** all" to fellow prisoners, and says he wished he had raped the victim for six years. The Ministry of Justice is investigating the incident.
