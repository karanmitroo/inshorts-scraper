Designs by a nine-year-old English boy have been chosen as mascots for the upcoming IAAF World Championships and World Para Athletics Championships. 'Hero the Hedgehog' and 'Whizbee the Bee' were chosen from over 4,000 entries in a competition run by the organisers. The animals were chosen by the winning designer since "they are endangered species and are survivors".
