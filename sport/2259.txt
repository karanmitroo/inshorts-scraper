After a man drove a car onto the pitch and stalled the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh's Ranji Trophy match, a user tweeted, "Chacha vidhayak hai inke." Other tweets read, "Kejri uncle ji ki WagonR to nahi?" and, "Looks like he is looking for directions: Bhaisaab, zara bataiye G23/7, sector 4, New Palam Extn kaha hai?"
