World number 16 Nick Kyrgios, who was once banned for 'not trying' in a match, mocked tennis authorities on Twitter after compatriot Daria Gavrilova went unpunished after her outburst on Tuesday. Nick Kyrgios said he would have been banned for six years if he behaved like her. Gavrilova threw her racquet after dropping a point, which almost hit ball boys.
