Kolkata might host an exhibition match featuring former players from Real Madrid and Barcelona in the third week of September. The exhibition match will be a tribute to the late Dutch legend Johan Cruyff. Notably, Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium will not be able to host the exhibition match due to the upcoming FIFA U-17 World Cup in October.
