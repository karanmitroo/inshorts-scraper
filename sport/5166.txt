Late boxer Muhammad Ali, who died on June 3, 2016, claimed that he had taken 29,000 punches in his boxing career, which spanned from 1960 to 1981, and included 61 professional bouts. "People say I talk so slow today. That's no surprise. I calculated I've taken 29,000 punches. But I earned $57 million," Ali had said in 1984.
