Italy's failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup could cost its economy in excess of €1 billion (₹7,600 crore), ex-president of Italy's Olympic Committee, Franco Carraro, said. Carraro attributed it to missed advertising sales, television rights, merchandising and missed sales for travel operators, among others. Italy failed to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1958.
