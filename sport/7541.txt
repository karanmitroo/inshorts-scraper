Indian pacer Ishant Sharma gestured Bangladesh batsman Sabbir Rahman to 'keep quiet and focus on batting' on the final day of the Hyderabad Test. Ishant had stared at Rahman after delivering the ball, which was responded with a nod by the batsman. The fast bowler trapped Rahman plumb in front in his next over and gave him a hostile send-off.
