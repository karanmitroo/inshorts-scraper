All-rounder Yuvraj Singh, who turned 35 on Monday, is the only player in cricket history to take five wickets and score 50-plus runs in a World Cup match. Yuvraj achieved the feat on March 6, 2011, when he ended up with bowling figures of 10-0-31-5 against Ireland and hit 50* off 75 balls to help India win their group match.
