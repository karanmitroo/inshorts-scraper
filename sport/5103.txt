American ice hockey side Nashville Predators' Finnish goalkeeper Pekka Rinne made four saves in as many seconds to help his side register a 4-1 win over Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup final. The keeper made his first two saves at the end of a Penguins counterattack, before scrambling across the face of goal to defensively clear the puck.
