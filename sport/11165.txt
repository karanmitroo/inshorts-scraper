A private jet belonging to Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo crash landed at Barcelona's El Prat airport on Monday, reportedly due to its landing gear breaking on impact. The player or any of his family or friends were not on the plane, while the pilot was treated for minor injuries. Ronaldo bought the Gulfstream G200 in 2015 for Â£15 million.
