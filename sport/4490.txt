South African tennis player Kevin Anderson, ranked 42nd in the world currently, has requested for a rematch with AB de Villiers, 21 years after getting beaten by him in a tennis match. "[AB] was 12 and I was 10. He was a good tennis player and he beat me... but I am still waiting for a rematch," Anderson said.
