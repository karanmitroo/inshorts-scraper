Reacting to England's 444-run total and their 169-run victory over Pakistan, a user tweeted, "I'm pretending there is no ODI series going on between England and Pakistan. Maybe this way, it'll just vanish". Another tweet read, "England has scored 444 against Pakistan in ODI. Balochistan to door ki baat hai, Pakistan izzat bacha le wahi kaafi hai".
