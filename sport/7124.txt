Coaches of Russian bandy teams that scored a total of 20 own goals in a Russian Bandy Super League game have been suspended by the sport's national federation for 30 months. The Vodnik Club had scored 11 own goals in the match, which was later declared void, to avoid facing the league's reigning champions in the next round.
