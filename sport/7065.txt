Following a request by the Muslim Women's Sport Foundation, England's Amateur Swimming Association has allowed female swimmers to wear burkinis in amateur competitions. The outfit was previously banned as it was said to have performance-enhancing characteristics since it streamlined the shape of the body. However, swimmers will have to get their burkinis approved by a referee before competing.
