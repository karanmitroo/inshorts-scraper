Former BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke, who was removed from the post by the Supreme Court, said he is not banned from watching the India-England ODI in Pune. "If I come, I will sit in my own box which I have purchased from the MCA (Maharashtra Cricket Association)," added Shirke on the eve of the match.
