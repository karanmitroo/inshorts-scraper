A foreign national had sparked a terror alert in Mumbai after he was caught on CCTV taking photos of Wankhede stadium, ahead of a cricket match between India and New Zealand on Sunday. After the security agencies launched a massive manhunt, he was traced to a hotel in Colaba but was reportedly let off after no incriminating evidence was found.
