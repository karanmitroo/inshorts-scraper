England's Joe Root threw the ball at KL Rahul while bowling to him during the ongoing Chennai Test on Sunday. Rahul, then batting at 146*, played a straight drive to bowler Root, when the latter collected it and threw it straight towards the batsman, who had to duck to avoid it. Root then apologised after Rahul confronted him.
