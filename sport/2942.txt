India's World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has clarified that the upcoming film in which Ranveer Singh is set to play him is not a biopic. "It is apparently a film on the 1983 World Cup. Not about me," Dev said. Members of India's World Cup-winning squad have been invited to Mumbai for the film's formal announcement on September 27.
