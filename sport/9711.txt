Hashim Amla handed Australian captain Steve Smith a lifeline as he dropped him during the Adelaide Test. Smith got a thick outside edge off Duminy but Amla failed to hold on to the ball at first slip despite making two attempts. The ball jumped off after hitting Amla's hands and fell away from him as he tried another catch.
