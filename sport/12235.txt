Former cricketer Rahul Dravid responded to Indian Test captain Virat Kohli’s message, which the latter had posted for him on social media. Dravid wrote on his Facebook page, “Were you trying to only make eye contact or telling yourself, 'Buddy, I will do everything you did, but do it even better!' You have been remarkable Virat Kohli, keep going!!”
