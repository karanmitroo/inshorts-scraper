The Pakistani cricket team was booed and taunted by fans at Lahore airport on their return from Australia. Captain Azhar Ali was reportedly caught exchanging glances with fans chanting that he should quit captaincy. Pakistan suffered a 0-3 whitewash in the Test series and a 1-4 drubbing in the ODIs, with the team's lone win coming under Mohammad Hafeez's captaincy.
