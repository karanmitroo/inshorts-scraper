West Indies batsman Evin Lewis became the first batsman in the history to hit two T20I centuries against the same opponent, after smashing an unbeaten 62-ball 125 against India in the lone T20I on Sunday. Lewis also joined compatriot Chris Gayle and former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum as the only players to have registered multiple centuries in T20I cricket.
