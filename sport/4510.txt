Swarms of flying ants invaded Wimbledon's courts on Wednesday, causing inconvenience and distraction to players who were forced to swat them away. American Sam Querrey, who complained about it to the chair umpire, said that the umpire laughed his complaint off. Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who was playing on Court no. 2 said, "It was in my nose, in my hair".
