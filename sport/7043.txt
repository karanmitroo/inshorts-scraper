Australian captain Steve Smith dove to his right to take a one-handed flying catch to dismiss KL Rahul off Steve O'Keefe's bowling during the Bengaluru Test on Monday. O'Keefe bowled a full-length delivery outside off which Rahul edged. The ball was wide of slip where Smith was positioned when he dove to his right to grab a stunner.
