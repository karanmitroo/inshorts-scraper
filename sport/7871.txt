As per reports, English cricketers will lose up to ₹3 lakh (£3,500) daily for participating in the IPL. England and Wales Cricket Board is reportedly deducting 0.5% of centrally contracted Test players' fees daily to compensate counties, whose players will participate in the IPL. The move affects players like Joe Root and Ben Stokes, who are on ECB's Test contracts.
