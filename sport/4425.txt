Cricket Advisory Committee member Sourav Ganguly said Team India skipper Virat Kohli has not made any suggestions in the coach selection process. "We will speak to Virat and the announcement will be made...Virat, who we respect so much, is an important cog in this wheel. Credit needs to be given to him for staying out of this process," said Ganguly.
