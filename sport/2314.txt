Organisers of the New York City Marathon have said that the event will neither be cancelled nor will it be postponed following the terror attack that killed at least 8 people. "We have extensive safety and security measures in place, both visible and behind the scenes," organisers added. Around 50,000 runners are expected to take part in the marathon.
