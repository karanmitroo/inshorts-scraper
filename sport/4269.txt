During a domestic T20 match in England, a spectator managed to catch a six in the stands while holding a pint of beer to his mouth. Glamorgan County batsman Colin Ingram had hit the maximum over the long on boundary before the fan tucked his pint between his teeth and managed to hold on to the catch without spilling beer.
