There are four jerseys awarded to cyclists each year at Tour de France. The yellow jersey is awarded to the rider with the lowest cumulative time for the distance completed at every stage, with the holder at the end of the competition being the winner. It is yellow because the newspaper which started the race was printed on yellow paper.
