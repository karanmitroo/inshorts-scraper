Boxer Mary Kom has said less awareness in sports in India was one of the main reasons behind the country winning only two medals at the Rio Olympics. London Olympics bronze medalist, Mary had failed to qualify for Rio, calling her trials “unfortunate”. “I only got two chances to qualify. Male boxers get five to six chances,” she said.
