Nike released an advertisement featuring tennis player Serena Williams, referring to her as the ‘greatest athlete ever’. The video initially uses the phrase ‘the greatest female athlete ever’ to describe Serena, before the word ‘female’ is dropped. Serena had once objected to being called 'one of the greatest female athletes', and said she preferred the phrase without the word 'female'.
