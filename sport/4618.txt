The Cape Verdean Football Championship semi-final first leg tie between Ultramarina and Mindelense was postponed after officials lost the keys to the stadium. The Cape Verdean Football Federation (FCF) has ordered the tie's second leg to go ahead as planned for Sunday. Cape Verde is a 10-island archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, about 500 km off the coast of Senegal.
