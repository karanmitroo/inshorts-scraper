Indian captain Virat Kohli congratulated women's team skipper Mithali Raj for becoming the highest run-getter in women's ODIs, but posted the wrong picture on social media. Along with his congratulatory message on Facebook, Kohli posted a picture of women's team player Punam Raut, which was pointed out by his followers. The post was later deleted.
