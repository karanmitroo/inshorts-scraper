England midfielder Dele Alli has been accused of showing the middle finger to the referee during England's World Cup Qualifier match against Slovakia on Monday. Alli was seen gesturing after the referee rejected his appeal for a free-kick following a foul 13 minutes from time. Alli later claimed that the gesture was a joke between him and teammate Kyle Walker.
