The Olympic flame made its first appearance in the modern Games at Amsterdam in 1928, where it was lit atop a tower overlooking the Olympic Stadium. The first time a torch was used to transport the flame was in 1936 Berlin Olympics, when the originating flame was lit in Olympia, Greece, a tradition that continues till date.
