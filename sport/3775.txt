Yorkshire Vikings' English cricketer Jack Leaning pulled off a single-handed catch while jumping in the air in England's domestic T20 competition. Leaning, who was fielding on the cover boundary in the eighth over, jumped in the air while running towards the boundary after Lancashire Lightning's Arron Lilley hit a flat shot off a Liam Plunkett full toss.
