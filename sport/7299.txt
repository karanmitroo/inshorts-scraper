Australia's Peter Handscomb, while fielding at short-leg, dived forward and completed a one-handed catch to dismiss Ravichandran Ashwin off a Nathan Lyon delivery on the Day 2 of the Pune Test. Ashwin had played a defensive backfoot shot following which the ball struck his toe and went near Handscomb, who reacted in no time to pluck the catch.
