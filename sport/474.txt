India Test opener Murali Vijay has been dropped from the Tamil Nadu squad for Vijay Hazare Trophy after he failed to turn up for their match against Mumbai on Thursday. A TNCA official said that Vijay neither came to the ground nor informed the selectors about his shoulder injury which was "very disappointing". Vijay was replaced by Ganga Sridhar Raju.
