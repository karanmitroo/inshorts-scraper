The upcoming Under-19 Asia Cup has been moved out of India following the Pakistan Cricket Board's objection. The tournament was initially scheduled to be held in Bengaluru in November but PCB was hesitant in sending their team to India citing security concerns. The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has moved the tournament to Malaysia after its annual general body meeting.
