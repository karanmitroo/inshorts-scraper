Ajax's Richairo Zivkovic, currently on loan at FC Utrecht, ran almost a hundred metres in near-Olympic time to score his side's third goal against FC Twente. Zivkovic dashed towards the empty goal after Twente had sent their goalkeeper forward for a corner. Zivkovic scored after a reportedly 10.96 second-long 100-metre sprint, almost 0.2 seconds behind Rio Olympics' 100-metre qualification time.
