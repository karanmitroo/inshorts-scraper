Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan has said that India do not want to face Pakistan because they are scared of the Pakistani team after having lost the Champions Trophy 2017 final against them. According to a MoU signed by the BCCI and PCB, India and Pakistan were supposed to play several bilateral series from 2015 to 2023.
