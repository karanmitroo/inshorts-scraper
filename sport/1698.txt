Former Indian cricketer Ajit Agarkar scored only one international hundred in his career, which came in a Test against England at Lord's in July 2002. Batting at number eight, Agarkar slammed an unbeaten 109, becoming the seventh Indian to smash a Test ton at Lord's. Agarkar, who turns 40 today, also hit the fastest fifty by an Indian in ODIs.
