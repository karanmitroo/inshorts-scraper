Russia will organise a two-day tournament for its banned Paralympians, coinciding with the start of the Paralympic Games in Brazil on September 7, as per Russia’s Paralympic Committee head Vladimir Lukin's announcement on Tuesday. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had lashed out at the blanket doping ban on Russia’s Paralympians and pledged to organise competitions to “show their skills”.
