Italian Serie A side Benevento grabbed their first-ever point in the top tier league after goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli scored with an injury-time flying header off a free-kick to give them a 2-2 draw against AC Milan on Sunday. Benevento, playing in the Italian top flight for the first time in history, had lost each of their previous 14 games.
