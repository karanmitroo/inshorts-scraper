On cricketer Ravindra Jadeja's 28th birthday, Virender Sehwag tweeted, "Chips ki packet ki tarah jaldi over khatam karne waale @imjadeja ,Happy Birthday. Cut the cake in this style,by ghumaoing knife like sword." Jadeja, who is known to celebrate his milestones by swinging his bat in a traditional Rajput style, performed the same celebration in the recently-concluded Mohali Test against England.
