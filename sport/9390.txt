Brazilian club Atlético Mineiro's midfielder Juan Cazares scored a long-range goal from inside his own half in the injury time of the Brazilian Cup final's second leg match against Grêmio. The 24-year-old's shot flew towards the goal with the goalkeeper backing up and jumping unsuccessfully to save the ball from going into the right corner of the goal.
