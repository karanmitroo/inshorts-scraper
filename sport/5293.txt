A 27-year-old German walked 1,600 metres across a highline between two mountains in France, successfully setting the world record for highlining. Participating in the fifth annual French Riviera Highline Meeting, he took two hours to achieve the feat and walked at a height of over 600 metres. The previous highlining record, 800 metres, was set at an earlier Highline Meeting.
