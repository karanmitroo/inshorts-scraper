Shashank Manohar has decided that he will not step down as the chairman of the ICC and will see out his tenure, which runs until June 2018. Earlier in March, Manohar had said that he was going to step down immediately due to "personal reasons" but said that he was later convinced by other ICC directors to complete his tenure.
