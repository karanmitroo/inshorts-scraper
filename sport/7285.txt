New Zealand's batter Katey Martin got bowled out against Australia, after she dragged the ball on to the stumps with her bat. She had come down the track to play the ball towards square leg but mistimed the shot. Martin then directed the ball to the stumps while trying to get back in her crease to avoid a run-out.
