Azhar Ali has stepped down as the captain of Pakistan's ODI cricket team, claiming that the pressure of captaincy was affecting his form as a batsman. Wicketkeeper-batsman Sarfraz Ahmed is set to lead the national team in ODIs. Notably, the move comes after Pakistan slumped to a 1-4 loss to Australia in the five-match ODI series in January.
