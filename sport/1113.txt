Former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin was barred from attending the Hyderabad Cricket Association meeting on Sunday. Azharuddin was stopped and made to wait for an hour at the main gate of the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. The meeting, convened to adopt the Lodha panel's recommendations, ended abruptly amid chaos after Azharuddin's arrival.
