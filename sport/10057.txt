Following India's drawn Test against England, India's Test captain Virat Kohli said, "Well, at least we know how to draw games now. Before that, some people obviously were skeptical about our side knowing how to draw games". "It was a challenging situation but one that we counted really well," Kohli added. India extended its unbeaten streak in Tests to 14.
