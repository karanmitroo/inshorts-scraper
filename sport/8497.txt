The University of Mumbai barred a Muslim student, named Sayyed Imran Ali, from a boxing competition because he refused to shave off his beard, according to reports. "I have been participating in kick-boxing, karate and taekwondo competitions at the state and the national level for the past seven years. My small beard was never an issue," the boxer said.
