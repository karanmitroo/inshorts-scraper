Afghan spinner Mujeeb Zadran, who was bought by Kings XI Punjab at the IPL auction, has become the youngest bowler to take a five-wicket haul in an ODI. Zadran achieved the feat at the age of 16 years and 325 days against Zimbabwe on Friday, ending with match figures of 10-0-50-5. Previously, the record was held by Pakistan's Waqar Younis.
