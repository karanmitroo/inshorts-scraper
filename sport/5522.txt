Cricket Australia has threatened to stop pay of their men and women cricketers if they fail to agree to the new compensation model by June. Disregarding the threats, players, including Shane Watson, Mitch Starc and Pat Cummins have threatened to go on strike and boycott the Ashes. "It will be an interesting game of cricket without any players," tweeted Watson.
