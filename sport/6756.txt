Claiming that Indian Premier League is tough for the bowlers, Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh suggested that the boundaries should be widened in order to make matches even for batsmen and bowlers. "It is very hard to be a bowler in IPL... If they can make pitches that help bowlers more than batsmen, then it'll be an even match," added Singh.
