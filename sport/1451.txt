Australian pacer Mitchell Starc's delivery to dismiss England's James Vince during the third Ashes Test on Sunday is being dubbed 'ball of the 21st century'. The delivery, bowled from around the stump at 143.9 kmph, hit a crack and swung in late, uprooting Vince's off stump. Several former cricketers including Mitchell Johnson, Wasim Akram, and Shane Warne praised the delivery.
