Pakistan Cricket Board has barred its players from doing push-ups in celebration and instead perform "nafl prayers or sajdahs". The order came after a ruling party lawmaker objected to the celebration saying it "promoted a negative image of Pakistan". The push-up celebration was started by Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq as a tribute to the Pakistan Army during their England tour.
