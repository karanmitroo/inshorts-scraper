Sprinter Usain Bolt has said he is planning to open a sports clinic in Jamaica. “Especially for the youth in track and field… I think injury has always been a problem… and I would like them to get better care,” said Bolt. The sprinter had won three gold medals at the Rio Olympics last month, before retiring from competition.
