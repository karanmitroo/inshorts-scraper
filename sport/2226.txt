German football club Mainz's goalkeeper Robin Zentner kicked thin air with the ball nowhere near him during his team's 1-1 draw against Monchengladbach. After controlling a back pass, Zentner tried an outward pass but didn't realise that the ball had rolled back nearly two yards behind him. Zentner later revealed he thought the white-coloured penalty spot was the ball.
