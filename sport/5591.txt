The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators has barred the BCCI from purchasing IPL tickets to distribute to VIPs as complimentary. The move comes after the office of former BCCI President Anurag Thakur bought tickets worth â‚¹76 lakh  for VIPs during the World T20, but failed to provide details of distribution. BCCI had claimed the laptop containing the details was lost.
