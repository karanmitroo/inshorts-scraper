Former Pakistani captain Shahid Afridi has said that Indian and Pakistani cricketers get along well but "there are exceptions like Gautam Gambhir, who dare I say isn't the friendliest". "We had a heated exchange on the field some years ago... I have moved on in life... Gautam for some reason can't get over it," Afridi added.
