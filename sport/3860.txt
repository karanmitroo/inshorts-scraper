Swiss tennis great, Roger Federer, who turned 36 on Tuesday, was gifted a cow by the organisers of the Swiss Open in 2003, following his first ever Wimbledon title. Federer, who named the cow 'Juliette', was presented a cow named 'Desiree' after returning to the tournament in 2013. Juliette gave birth to a calf which Federer named 'Edelweiss'.
