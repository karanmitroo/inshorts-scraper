India defeated Macau 2-0 in the Asian Cup 2019 Qualifiers on Tuesday, extending their unbeaten run to 11 matches. The Indian team, which last lost a match in March 2016, was helped by Balwant Singh who scored both the goals. India's longest winning streak had come to an end after they drew 1-1 with Saint Kitts and Nevis last month.
