The Democratic Republic of the Congo has suspended top-flight football in the nation amid fears of violence that may occur after President Joseph Kabila's mandate next week. The country's football association has been ordered to suspend the nation's league football competition from Thursday until further notice. Congo's football team is scheduled to play in next month's Africa Cup of Nations.
