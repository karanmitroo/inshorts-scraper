New Zealand batsman Colin Munro has become the first-ever batsman in T20I cricket to hit three fifties in less than 20 balls each. Munro achieved the feat by hitting a fifty in 18 balls against England on Sunday. Munro's knock helped New Zealand reach the final of the tri-series, despite losing the match by two runs.
