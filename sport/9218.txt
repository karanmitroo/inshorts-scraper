Macclesfield Town football club's sponsor offered each player of the team a free king-size bed if they defeated Oxford United in their FA Cup second-round replay match. The town's local furniture supplier made the offer to the National League side's squad. The winner of the match will earn Â£27,000 in prize money and will travel to Rotherham for round three.
