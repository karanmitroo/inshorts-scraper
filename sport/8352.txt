England captain Eoin Morgan was dismissed for 28 (26) following a successful review by India during the first ODI at Pune on Sunday. Pacer Hardik Pandya bowled a short-length delivery which was edged by Morgan and caught behind by MS Dhoni. The on-field umpire turned down the call but captain Virat Kohli went for the DRS review after consulting Dhoni.
