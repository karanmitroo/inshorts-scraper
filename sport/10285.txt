A housewife in Kerala's Malappuram district, whose first name is Serena, received a ration card with her name misprinted as Serena Williams, the American tennis player. The name was misprinted on the draft of the renewed ration card published on the internet. Some other names of the members on the same ration card were reportedly also found wrongly printed.
