Nine-year-old bowler Anadi Tagde has been included in the Indore division Under-19 cricket squad. The right-arm medium pacer will take part in an inter-division Under-19 girls tournament starting in Gwalior on Thursday. Anadi's mother Deepti used to play as a left-arm spinner at the university level, but could not play at the higher level.
