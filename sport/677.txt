The pitch used for the India-South Africa Test at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg has been rated 'poor' by the ICC as it had "excessively steep and unpredictable bounce". Further, the stadium has received three demerit points and if it reaches five demerit points in a five-year period, it will be suspended from staging international cricket for a year.
