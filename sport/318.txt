Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has predicted the Indian spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal will 'excel' in Australia. The duo was also praised and credited for India's success by Sachin Tendulkar. Chahal and Yadav managed to pick up a combined 33 wickets in the SA ODI series, the most for a spin duo in a bilateral series.
