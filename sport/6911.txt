Former Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson has called India captain Virat Kohli "frustrated" at not being able to score big runs in the ongoing India-Australia Test series. "He's obviously quite passionate, but I just think he's frustrated... and he's letting his emotions get the better of him," Johnson added. Kohli has hit 40 runs in four innings so far.
