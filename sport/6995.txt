American sportswear manufacturer Nike has launched a special hijab for female Muslim athletes, which will go on sale in 2018. The pull-on hijab, which has been in development for a year, is made of light, stretchy fabric and includes tiny holes for air circulation and a long back which can be tucked in. It has also been tested on athletes.
