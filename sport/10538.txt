Russian base jumper Valery Rozov smashed his own world record by leaping from the Himalayan mountain Cho Oyu, the world's sixth tallest mountain. The 51-year-old base jumper dived from a height of 7,700 meters from the mountain, which is almost nine times taller than the Burj Khalifa. Rozov's previous best attempt was a 7,220-metre jump from Mount Everest in 2013.
