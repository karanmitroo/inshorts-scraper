The Jamaican eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt is working with the Australian cricket team to help improve their batsmen's running between the wickets. Bolt is helping the batsmen bring in 'explosiveness' in their take-off for a run. "They seem to always take off at a slow rate," the 31-year-old Jamaican remarked about the running he observed in cricket.
