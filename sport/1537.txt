Hardik Pandya, who was at the non-striker's end, fist-pumped even before Rohit Sharma celebrated his record third double hundred against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Later, the all-rounder shared a picture on social media of them celebrating with the caption, "Lightning does not strike twice? Well, it struck for the third time yesterday...I'm glad to share this special moment with you."
