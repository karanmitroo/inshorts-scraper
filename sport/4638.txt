Virat Kohli has said that the appointment of Indian team's new coach is in BCCI's control and he and the team will give opinions only if BCCI asks. Kohli added that the team is currently focused entirely on the Windies series and not on anything else. Notably, BCCI will finalise the coach before India's tour of Sri Lanka next month.
