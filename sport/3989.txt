A footballer from Greek team PAOK was spotted urinating behind the advertising boards near the pitch during his team's UEFA Europa League match against Olimpik Donetsk last week. A Ukrainian sports journalist posted the picture of the incident on Facebook and wrote, "I am sorry...but this event, despite the sadness and the bad smell...I will remember for my entire life."
