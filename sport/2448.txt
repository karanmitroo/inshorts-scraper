Brazilian goalkeeper Jefferson was carjacked at gunpoint on Sunday on his way to training in Rio de Janeiro. A CCTV footage has emerged in which Jefferson can be seen kneeling on the pavement as three thugs speed off in the keeper's Range Rover, abandoning their car. The vehicle was reportedly recovered several hours later by police.
