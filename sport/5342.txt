Former cricketer Virender Sehwag posted a congratulatory tweet for Army Major Nitin Gogoi, who was awarded the COAS (Chief of Army Staff) commendation for "sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations" on Monday. A video of Major Gogoi had recently surfaced, in which he had tied a Kashmiri man to a jeep during the Srinagar by-polls reportedly to avoid stone-pelters.
