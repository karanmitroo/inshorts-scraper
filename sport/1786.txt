Ex-England captain Wayne Rooney scored from nearly 60 yards out from inside his own half to complete his first hat-trick for Everton in their 4-0 win against West Ham on Wednesday. It was Rooney's first league hat-trick in 2,272 days while his previous one was for Manchester United against Bolton Wanderers in September 2011. Rooney has netted seven PL hat-tricks.
