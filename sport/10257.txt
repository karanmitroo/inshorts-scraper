Nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal said that he is ready to die to win another Grand Slam. "I'm really motivated to come back to where I was before the injury happened because I feel ready for it", added Nadal. The 30-year-old won two titles this year alongside the Olympic gold in Rio in the men's doubles event.
