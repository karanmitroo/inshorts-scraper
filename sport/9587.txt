Brazilian footballer Tiago da Rocha Vieira, who played for Chapecoense, found out that he was going to become a father, a week before he passed away in Monday's plane crash in Colombia. A video shot after the revelation shows the 22-year-old embracing and celebrating with his teammates and later rocking his arms back and forth like cradling a baby.
