The Uttar Pradesh Basic Shiksha Parishad has based its selection for school-level sports on the number of teeth a student has. Reportedly, a candidate should not have more than 28 teeth to be eligible for block, district, and state-level contests. The Parishad had another criteria earlier, which required the sum of candidateâ€™s age, height and weight to not exceed 215.
