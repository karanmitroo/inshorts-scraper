Actor Rishi Kapoor appealed for allowing Pakistani cricketers to play in the IPL, the tenth edition of which begins on Wednesday. Kapoor cited the example of Afghanistan's players, who are playing for the first time in the tournament this year, saying "Hum bade log hain". No Pakistani player has been a part of IPL after 2008, its year of inception.
