The County Championship in England was decided by a deal between the finalists, Middlesex and Yorkshire. A draw in the final would have crowned Somerset the champions. To avoid a draw, Yorkshire gave away runs to enable Middlesex set a pre-decided target of 240 from 40 overs. In another instance, a U-19 WC match was decided by Mankad run-out.
