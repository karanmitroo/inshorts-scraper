Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh has defended pacer Shardul Thakur for wearing Sachin Tendulkar's jersey number 10 on his debut against Sri Lanka on Thursday. "What's the poor guy's fault if he wore that jersey?...It could be his way of paying tribute to the great man (Sachin Tendulkar), or emulate him, or it could be his lucky number," Harbhajan said.
