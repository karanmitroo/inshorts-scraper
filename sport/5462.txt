Sri Lanka Cricket Board President Thilanga Sumathipala has offered to host an India-Pakistan bilateral series, following India's refusal to play against Pakistan. Sumathipala made the offer to PM Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Sri Lanka, saying, "India is losing when Pakistan is not playing India, as much as Pakistan is losing if India is not playing them."
