Rising Pune Supergiant batsman Manoj Tiwary's bat broke into two after he tried to play a shot through midwicket off Gujarat Lions pacer Praveen Kumar's bowling in IPL on Friday. The large broken piece of the bat flew and landed down the pitch. Tiwary dived to complete his second run with just the handle of the bat in his hand.
