Right-back Daniel Carvajal's solo strike in the 119th minute helped Real Madrid lift their third Super Cup on Wednesday. Madrid took the lead with Marco Asensio's long-range strike before Sevilla's Franco Vazquez and Yevhen Konoplyanka handed Sevilla the lead. Sergio Ramos made it 2-2 to force extra time before Carvajal handed Zinedine Zidane his second trophy as Madrid coach.
