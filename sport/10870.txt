Pakistani opener Azhar Ali became the first player to hit a century in day-night Tests, scoring a hundred in the first Test against West Indies in UAE on Thursday. The Pakistan-West Indies match is the second day-night Test in history, after the Australia-New Zealand game at Adelaide in November 2015. Three players had scored half-centuries in the first day-night Test.
