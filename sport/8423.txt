Former Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan praised former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni calling him one of the best Indian captains. "The three years I played under his captaincy in Chennai Super Kings, I never saw any arrogance from Dhoni. He was always down to earth and was open to take advice from senior players," added Muralitharan.
