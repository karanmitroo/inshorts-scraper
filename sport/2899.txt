Australian batsman David Warner has said that the assumption that bigger bats assist in hitting sixes better is misleading. Warner's comment comes after ICC implemented the bat size restrictions starting September 28. He added that the new rules would not have any impact on his game and he had already changed his bats two weeks ago.
