Wrestler Vinesh Phogat, niece of Mahavir Phogat on whose life the Aamir Khan-starrer 'Dangal' is based, has said her uncle was ten times stricter than what is shown in the film. "It's kind of strange how popular the Phogat clan has become post 'Dangal'...Tauji was 10 times stricter than Aamir, he was at a different level," said Vinesh.
