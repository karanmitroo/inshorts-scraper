Indian batsman Rohit Sharma will miss the entire Test series against England due to a thigh injury. Chairman of selectors, MSK Prasad said that Rohit would be assessed in England and might undergo surgery. Rohit had injured himself while batting in the final ODI against New Zealand but continued to bat which is considered to have aggravated the injury.
