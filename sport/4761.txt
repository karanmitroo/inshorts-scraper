England opener Jason Roy became the first T20I player to be dismissed for obstructing the field, during the second T20I against South Africa on Friday. The ball hit Jason's boot while he was running to the crease, following which the third umpire adjudged him out. He is the eighth international player across all formats to be dismissed in this fashion.
