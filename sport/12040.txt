Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has reportedly accused his nurses of trying to kill him with “toxic” medication and filed a complaint with prison authorities. Earlier, Pistorius was placed on a suicide watch after sustaining wrist injuries in jail last week, which he claims were due to falling from his bed. Pistorius was recently convicted of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
