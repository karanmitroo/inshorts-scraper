Alcohol would be banned from streets and public places during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The organisers stated that they were against the provision of alcohol in the stadiums and they would not bow to the pressure by FIFA to alter its laws. Drinking will be permitted only in "far-away places", said the head of the organising committee.
