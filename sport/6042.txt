A Sarasota Open match between Frances Tiafoe and Mitchell Krueger was interrupted multiple times on Tuesday due to a couple in a nearby house having loud sex. The match announcer assumed the sound was coming from a spectator's phone before realising it was coming from an apartment nearby. Krueger jokingly hit a tennis ball in the direction of the apartment.
