Ice hockey player Jocelyne Larocque removed her silver medal as soon as it was presented at the Winter Olympics after Canada's loss to the US. Around thirty minutes later, an official from hockey's governing body asked her to put it back on, explaining the "legal reasons". "I truly wish I could take back (the moment)," said Larocque, apologising later.
