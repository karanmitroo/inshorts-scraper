Since the formation of the English Premier League in 1992, not a single English manager has won the title. Only nine managers have won the Premier League in its 25-year history, with Manchester United's former manager Alex Ferguson of Scotland winning it 13 times. Notably, 104 managers from England have coached a Premier League side, the most from a country.
