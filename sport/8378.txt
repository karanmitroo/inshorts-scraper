India captain Virat Kohli has said Yuvraj Singh was selected in the limited-overs squad to ease the middle-order burden on MS Dhoni. "We cannot leave so much burden on MS alone in the middle order...There needs to be one more guy with Dhoni down the order in case the top order doesn't fire," said Kohli.
