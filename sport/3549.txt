Spanish football club Real Madrid's social media accounts were hacked on Saturday, with the hackers welcoming Barcelona forward Lionel Messi to the club. The hackers posted a video of Messi's winning goal from Barcelona's stoppage time victory in the El Clasico last season. Hackers OurMine claimed responsibility, posting, "Internet security is s*** and we proved that," from Real's official handle.
