England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow celebrated his maiden Ashes century on Friday by kissing the badge on his helmet and headbutting it during the third Ashes Test. This comes after Bairstow was mocked by the Australian team and its fans, after reports surfaced of him headbutting Australia opener Cameron Bancroft at a nightclub in Perth.
