Recalling the Australian cricket teams he faced in his career, Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh said, "This team is not a shadow of that Australian side". "[T]he Australian side that I competed against, the top seven or eight blokes were all match winners. Anyone could come in and win a match in his own right," Harbhajan added.
