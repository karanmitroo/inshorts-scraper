A match between Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley in the Championship, England's second-tier football league, was halted after a fan threw a Peppa Pig toy from the crowd at an away player. Sheffield striker Sam Winnall, who left Barnsley in January after three years, was attacked by the toy five minutes into the game. Winnall later scored in the second half.
