BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said it was "unethical" of former Chairman of Selectors, Sandeep Patil, to comment on the potential sacking of Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni during his tenure. "One should refrain from making such unethical and unwanted commentsâ€¦ Any organisation, if they hire him, will think ten times that he will later speak about them," added Thakur.
