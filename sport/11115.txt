On Gandhi Jayanti, the Indian cricket team participated in a Swachh Bharat Abhiyan drive at the Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata. Led by captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble, the cricketers wielded brooms and cleaned the stands at the behest of PM Narendra Modi. They were joined by BCCI President Anurag Thakur, who later tweeted pictures of the drive.
