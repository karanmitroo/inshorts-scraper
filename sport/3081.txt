Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who scored a 66-ball 83 in the first ODI against Australia, was spotted wearing his IPL side Mumbai Indians' gloves while batting. Reacting to it, a user tweeted, "Hardik Pandya does justice to MI slogan: Dil se Indian, Mumbai Indians." During the Champions Trophy too, Pandya was seen batting while wearing Mumbai Indians' gloves.
