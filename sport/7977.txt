Scottish goalkeeper Gary Whyte was sent off for urinating behind the goal during a match in a junior football league in Scotland on Saturday. In the 72nd minute of the match, Whyte went behind the goal to urinate, only to return to be red-carded. The player later said he had asked the linesman, who had not allowed him to go.
