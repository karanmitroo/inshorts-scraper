Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, who has set 28 world records in her career, announced retirement from the sport after being elected as a member of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Athletes Commission on Friday. The 34-year-old, who is the current world record holder and three-time world champion, was barred from the Rio Olympics due to IOC's ban on Russia.
