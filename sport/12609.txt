Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who was substituted in the first half of the EURO final against France due to an injury, has his legs insured for â‚¬100 million (approximately $120 million). Shortly after a knee injury in 2013, Ronaldo's club Real Madrid decided to get the insurance, in case he ever gets seriously injured.
