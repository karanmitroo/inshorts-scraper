Virat Kohli on Friday suggested India's athletes to have belief in their dreams and "work tirelessly to achieve those". "If you can believe, you can achieve anything. I live by that slogan... and it doesn't put any limits to what I can achieve and the same can happen to you as well," added Kohli during an event in Gurgaon.
