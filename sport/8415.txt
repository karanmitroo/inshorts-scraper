China faces a one-year ban from international weightlifting competitions after three of its weightlifters failed doping retests and were stripped of their Olympic 2008 gold medals. The International Weightlifting Federation had announced in 2016 that countries with three or more athletes failing doping retests will be disqualified from all international competitions for a year.
