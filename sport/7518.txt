A couple of Bangladeshi cricketers got their jerseys signed by Indian captain Virat Kohli, following the team's loss in the Hyderabad Test on Monday. Soumya Sarkar and Mehedi Hasan Miraz also clicked pictures with Kohli, which were later posted on the Indian team's Facebook account. Meanwhile, Hasan also met spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and was seen taking bowling tips from him.
