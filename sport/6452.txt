Former Australian cricketer Ed Cowan has said he wanted to "pick up a stump and stab Virat Kohli" for saying something "highly inappropriate" during an earlier series. "I had a very sick Mum during one of those series...he didn't realise he'd overstepped the mark until the umpire came over and said...he then took a step back and apologised," said Cowan.
