The Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) has claimed that the low attendance in the ongoing India-England Test at Rajkot was due to the demonetisation of ₹500, ₹1000 notes, which was announced a day before the Test. "People are more concerned queuing up at banks to exchange the banned notes. How can they come to watch cricket?," argued SCA's Secretary Niranjan Shah.
