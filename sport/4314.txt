Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor did the 'Ali Shuffle' during his press meet with Floyd Mayweather in London on Friday, ahead of their August 26 clash in Las Vegas. The move is named after late boxer Muhammad Ali, who would move his feet in a jig during a bout and then unleash a series of punches on his opponent.
