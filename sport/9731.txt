South Africa's stand-in captain Faf du Plessis has appealed against ICC, after being charged guilty of ball tampering. The matter will now be heard by a judicial commissioner who could declare du Plessis not guilty, or amend the sentence and hand him a one-match suspension. Du Plessis was fined 100% of his match fee for tampering in the Hobart Test.
