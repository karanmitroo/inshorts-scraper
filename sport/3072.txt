At 101 years and 110 days old, Adelaide's Irene O'Shea became the world's oldest female skydiver after plunging from a height of 14,000 feet in South Australia on Sunday. Irene, who was raising money for Motor Neurone Disease (MND) through her feat, also performed a 12,000-foot tandem jump last year to mark her 100th birthday.
