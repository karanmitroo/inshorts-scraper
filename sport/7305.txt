Speaking about MS Dhoni's removal as Rising Pune Supergiants' captain, Virender Sehwag said, "I am happy that he isn't captain because maybe now my team, Kings XI Punjab, can beat this Pune team." "I believe that this is an internal decision of the franchise but he is one of the best ever captains India has ever had," added Sehwag.
