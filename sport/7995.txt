India won its first-ever ICC Under-19 World Cup on January 28, 2000. The team, featuring Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif, defeated Sri Lanka's Under-19 team to lift the title. India later went on to win two more Under-19 World Cups, in 2008 and 2012, and currently shares the top spot with Australia for claiming the most number of World Cups.
