Former world number one men's singles player Ilie Nastase, who had made racist remarks towards Serena Williams and her unborn child, will not be welcome at this year's Wimbledon championships, organisers said on Wednesday. Wimbledon Club's chief executive Richard Lewis said that Nastase "could be stopped at the gate" if he tried to enter the grounds with a ticket.
