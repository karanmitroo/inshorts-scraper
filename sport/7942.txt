Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer, during his speech after winning the Australian Open, acknowledged the possibility that this year's tournament could be his last Australian Open. "I hope to see you next year, but if not, then it was a wonderful year here and I couldn't be happier tonight," said Federer to the crowd at the Rod Laver Arena.
