A Calendar Year Golden Slam in tennis is when a player wins all four Grand Slams in a single year and also bags gold in Olympics in the same year. Steffi Graf is the only player to have completed a Calendar Year Golden Slam. She achieved the feat by winning season's last Grand Slam, US Open on September 10, 1988.
