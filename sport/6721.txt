Former cricketer Ravi Shastri has slammed the move of Mumbai being stripped of its Full Member status according to the new BCCI constitution. "It's a joke. I feel sad that the glorious history, tradition and contribution of the association to Indian cricket went unnoticed," Shastri said. Notably, Mumbai has been one of the most successful sides with 41 Ranji titles.
