Murali Vijay survived a run-out after sloppy fielding by Bangladesh on the first day of the Hyderabad Test on Thursday. Vijay drove the ball towards square leg when non-striker Cheteshwar Pujara took off for a run, while Vijay was hesitant. Vijay fell short of the non-striker's crease while the bowler failed to collect the ball following a poor throw.
