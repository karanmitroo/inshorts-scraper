Responding to Sourav Ganguly's comment that Australia could lose the Test series in India 4-0, former Australian captain Steve Waugh said, "I think Sourav is a bit optimistic... anything can happen." "Maybe he is right, but I will love to challenge Sourav on that part. Certainly, Australia won't be going to India thinking that they will lose 4-0," Waugh added.
