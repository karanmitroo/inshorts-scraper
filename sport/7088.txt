Indian skipper Virat Kohli reviewed an LBW decision but walked off before the TV umpire could announce his decision after watching replays on the screen, during the Bengaluru Test against Australia on Saturday. Kohli padded a Nathan Lyon delivery, which was straight towards the middle stump. He had a discussion with non-striker KL Rahul, after which he took the review.
