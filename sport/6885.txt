Winds of up to 100 kmph, which dislodged competitors off their bicycles, forced the organisers of the Cape Town Cycle Tour race to cancel the event. The 109 km race, in which 35,000 competitors were taking part, was cancelled at the 21 km mark after organisers deemed the weather conditions too dangerous to continue.
