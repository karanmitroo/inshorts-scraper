Reacting to erroneous umpiring decisions in IPL, former international umpire K Hariharan has said the standard can improve by having mentors guide the "clueless" officials. "There should be... mentors to tell them after the game where they went wrong, where they went right," added Hariharan. "I say DRS or no DRS, [umpires] should be making minimum mistakes," he further said.
