Former Australia batsman Dean Jones retweeted a video on Twitter in which he was clean bowled by an in-swinging delivery from former Pakistan pacer Waqar Younis in 1993. Jones reminded Waqar that before he was clean bowled, he had already smashed 80 runs. Waqar then asked Jones if he had seen the stump, which had broken into two, behind him.
