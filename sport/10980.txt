The Indian team was handed a five-run penalty after Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja repeatedly ran over the protected area of the pitch during the second day of the third Test against New Zealand on Sunday. The five runs which were penalised were added to New Zealand's total before the start of their innings.
