Virat Kohli slammed the BCCI over scheduling of series for the Indian cricket team, saying the team was "as usual, cramped for time". "Everyone starts judging players when results come after Test matches. It should be a fair game, where we get to prepare the way we want to and then we are entitled to be criticised," said Kohli.
