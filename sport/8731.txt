Indian Olympian Krishna Poonia chased down three bullies, who she saw harassing two teenage girls while waiting at a railway crossing, in Rajasthan's Churu district on the New Year's day. The boys, on seeing her approaching, sped up their motorbike and tried to race away before Poonia caught hold of one of them and hauled him off the bike's saddle.
