Wheelchair athlete Aaron Fotheringham performed a skateboarding-BMX hybrid stunt on his wheelchair to mark the opening of the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. The athlete appeared on a six-storey high construction, racing down a ramp and ending the stunt somersaulting through a ring with fireworks around. Fotheringham suffers from a birth defect called spina bifida.
