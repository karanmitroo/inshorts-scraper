Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal's six-wicket haul against England in a T20I in February last year at Bengaluru has been named ICC's T20I Performance of the Year. Playing his sixth T20I, the leg spinner posted figures of 6/25, the third-best of all time and the best by an Indian bowler in T20I history. India had won the match by 75 runs.
