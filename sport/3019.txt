Former Indian captain MS Dhoni visited Kolkata Police Training School on Wednesday for a session in pistol shooting after Indian team's outdoor practice ahead of the second ODI was cancelled due to rain. Kolkata Police's Facebook page shared Dhoni's photos from the school and wrote, "His accuracy is breathtaking." Dhoni shot both in the 10m and 25m ranges.
