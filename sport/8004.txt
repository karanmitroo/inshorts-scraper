Jasprit Bumrah clean bowled England's Joe Root twice in two balls during the first T20I at Kanpur. Bumrah bowled Root off a no-ball in the 17th over as Root missed the ball trying to hit it over the leg side. Root was then bowled on the next ball, a yorker, but he remained not-out as it was a free-hit.
