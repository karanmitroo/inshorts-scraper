Cricketer Virender Sehwag has suggested naming the Udhampur railway station after a martyred soldier, Captain Tushar Mahajan, who died in a gunbattle with terrorists in Pampore near Srinagar last year. Sehwag shared the soldier's picture on the anniversary of the encounter with the suggestion. Captain Mahajan belonged to Udhampur and was an alumnus of the National Defence Academy.
