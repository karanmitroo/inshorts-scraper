A tennis court has been installed inside a 16th century Milan church, which was deconsecrated in 1808 after a decree was issued by Napoleon. It presently serves as a studio for art projects, with the latest 'Untitled (plot for dialogue)' aimed at exploring the subject of space. The entry is free, providing visitors with racquets to practice with onsite coaches.
