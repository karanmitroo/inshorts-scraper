Former Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has said that India's Ravichandran Ashwin and Pakistan's Yasir Shah could break his record for the most number of wickets in Test cricket. The Sri Lankan legend, who has 800 Test scalps to his name, added that reaching the record would depend on the spinners' longevity, fitness, and form.
