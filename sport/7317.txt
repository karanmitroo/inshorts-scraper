Egypt's top court upheld death sentences for 10 men for being part of Egypt's worst violence at a football stadium, in which over 70 football fans were killed in February 2012. Rioting broke out after Cairo's Al-Ahly fans unfurled banners insulting the local Al-Masry team, which had won the match 3-1. Since the incident, Egypt has restricted attendance at matches.
