The 13th National Ice Skating Championship has been shifted to the iSKATE ice rink in Ambience Mall in Gurugram, owing to less snowfall in Shimla. Over 300 ice skaters will compete in figure skating and short track speed skating. Boys and girls aged 10-17 will compete in different categories in the competition, which will conclude on January 6.
