American tennis star Serena Williams will play her first match after becoming a mother at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, event organisers have confirmed. Williams has not played since winning a record 23rd grand slam singles title at the Australian Open in January, after which she gave birth to her first child Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr in September.
