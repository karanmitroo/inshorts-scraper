A crew of Englishmen will play a 30-over cricket match against an all-Parsee team on November 12 to commemorate the 1886 trophy at the Parsee Gymkhana in Mumbai. The match will be played to celebrate the 130th anniversary of a historic tour in 1886, which was the first time an Indian team, full of Parsees, toured England to play cricket.
