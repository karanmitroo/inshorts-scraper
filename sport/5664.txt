Brazilian football club Chapecoense won the Santa Catarina state championship on Sunday, five months after 19 of its players died in a plane crash in Colombia in November. The club, which had only three surviving players, signed 25 new footballers before the season began in January. The club also had to find replacements for scouts, medics and other backroom staff.
