Opener Abhinav Mukund made a comeback to the Indian Test side after missing 56 Tests and was out for a duck in the second Test against Australia on Saturday. Mukund, who last played a Test for India in July 2011, was caught leg before by Mitchell Starc. Mukund's 56 missed Tests are the second-most by an Indian making a comeback.
