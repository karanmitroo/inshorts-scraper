Indian-origin bowler Shrikant Mundhe on Saturday became the first player to take 10 wickets in an innings in the Liverpool Competition Premier League since its inception in 2000. Playing for Colwyn Bay, the 27-year-old Maharashtrian all-rounder also top-scored for his team helping them to a one-wicket victory. Mundhe is also the 17th league player since 1920 to take a 10-for.
