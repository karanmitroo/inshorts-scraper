The bat used by MS Dhoni in the 2011 World Cup final holds the record for being the most expensive bat in cricket history. It was auctioned for £100,000 (then ₹72 lakh) at the 'East Meets West' Charity Dinner in London in July 2011 and bought by Mumbai-based investment firm RK Global. The proceedings went to Dhoni's wife's charitable organisation.
