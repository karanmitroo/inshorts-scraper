Australian YouTube channel 'How Ridiculous' has broken its own previously set world record for the greatest height from which a basketball shot is made. Atop a Southern African waterfall, the channel's Derek Herron managed to net a basketball from a little over 200 metres, bettering their own world record of 180 metres, which was set in November 2016.
