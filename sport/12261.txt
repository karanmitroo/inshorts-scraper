At 13 years and 255 days, Nepali swimmer Gaurika Singh, who survived the 2015 Nepal earthquake, will be the youngest Olympian at the Rio Games. The 13-year-old will participate in the women’s 100-metres backstroke heats event. "It was terrifying. We were on the fifth floor of a building (in Kathmandu) that we couldn’t escape from," Gaurika said about the experience.
