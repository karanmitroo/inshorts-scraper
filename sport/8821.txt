Manchester United forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic termed Barcelona's Lionel Messi as "one of a kind" player. Stating that playing with Messi was like playing PlayStation, Ibrahimovic added, "You give the ball to the guy and you start to go through every player and that's who Messi is." Ibrahimovic added that to become like the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is impossible.
