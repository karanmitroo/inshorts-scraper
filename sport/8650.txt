Ex-Pakistan badminton coach Raziuddin Ahmed slammed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Badminton Association for displaying Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal's posters at a provincial championship in Peshawar. "Posting the picture of an Indian badminton player on the banners of the championship...put the head of the badminton community in Pakistan down," said Ahmed.
