Former cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted a picture of ex-South African player Jonty Rhodes in action on the occasion of the latter’s 47th birthday. The caption read, “Hpy Bdy @JontyRhodes8 who while fielding gt confused & literally played 'Chidiya Ud’ (Bird Fly) #HumansCanFly #UdanKhatola.” Rhodes, widely known as his generation's best fielder, holds the record for​ most catches in an ODI.
