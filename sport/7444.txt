Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly interacted with visually-challenged Bangladeshi cricketers at an event hosted by the National Cricket Club at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Thursday. The players took a round of the stadium and clicked pictures with Ganguly, who is the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal. They were later presented mementos by the organisers.
