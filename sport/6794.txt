Two bowlers took six-wicket hauls in the Afghanistan-Ireland ODI at Greater Noida on Friday, marking the first such instance in ODI history. Ireland's Paul Stirling and Afghanistan's Rashid Khan both registered career-best figures of 6/55 and 6/43 respectively, with both claiming their first five-fors. Eighteen-year-old Rashid became the second-youngest to take a 6-for in ODIs, after Waqar Younis.
