Reacting to India's collapse against Sri Lanka on Sunday, a user tweeted, "Indian batting line-up without Virat Kohli is like a bank account without a linked Aadhar Card". Other users reacted with tweets like, "Now, Indian team misses Kohli more than what Anushka has missed him over the years" and "In Dharamshala, the mountains stand up and applaud Dhoni."
