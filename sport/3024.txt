Over 20,000 spectators showed up to watch a football match being hosted near the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir's Kupwara district. The crowd witnessed a 60-minute match between Mohammaden Sports Sopore and SW Ashkura Baramulla. "Such was the enthusiasm of the football fans that for a moment we forgot whether we are near the border," said the organisers.
