Ajay Thakur, member of India's Kabaddi World Cup-winning squad, has expressed surprise that no kabaddi players are being considered for cash awards. "The entire team was given Rs 10 lakh by the Sports Ministry...If you divide it yourself, you will realise the amount is nominal...I didn't start playing for money, so I'll continue to do what I'm doing," said Thakur.
