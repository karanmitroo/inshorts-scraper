Indian cricketers wore jerseys with their mothers' names during the fifth ODI against New Zealand in Vizag on Saturday, as a part of team sponsor Star Plus' 'Nayi Soch' campaign. Indian captain MS Dhoni said they had always been wearing their father's names on their backs and it was high time that the mothers received the respect they deserve.
