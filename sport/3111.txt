British professional boxer Billy Joe Saunders' seven-year-old son Stevie punched his father's opponent Willie Monroe Jr in the groin at the fight's weigh-in on Friday. Stevie stepped in onto the weighing scale before Willie started ruffling his hair, following which he punched him in the groin. The security guards interfered and pulled Stevie away.
