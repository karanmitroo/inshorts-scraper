The first FIFA World Cup match was played on July 13, 1930, in Uruguay. The country, which had won the 1924 and 1928 Olympic gold medals, was celebrating the 100th anniversary of its independence in 1930, and hence was chosen as the host nation for the tournament's inaugural edition. Uruguay eventually won the tournament by defeating Argentina in the final.
