Australian cricketer David Warner's scores of 0 and 1 in the first Test match against Sri Lanka is the worst performance by an Australian opener since 1994. Opener Mark Taylor had scored a 'pair of ducks' on his captaincy debut against Pakistan in Karachi in 1994. Australia is currently playing a three-match away Test series against Sri Lanka.
