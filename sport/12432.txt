The 'Reffetto-Rio' project will turn surplus food from the Olympic Village in Rio de Janeiro into meals for people in need. The project aims to collect approximately 12 tons of leftovers from the Olympic Village. It is initiated by non-profit 'Gastromotiva' founder David Hertz and Chef Massimo Bottura, whose Italian restaurant was named the world's best in 2016.
