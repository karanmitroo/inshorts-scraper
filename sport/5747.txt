The body of award-winning Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck, who passed away on Mount Everest, was cremated at a Buddhist monastery in Nepal on Thursday. Steck died after falling from a ridge during an acclimatisation climb. Known for his record speed ascents in the Alps, this year he was attempting to climb Everest and Lhotse without the use of supplemental oxygen.
