Former WWE wrestler and current COO Triple H has invited Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor to WWE, saying there are "plenty of microphones at Monday night Raw". At their first face-off, McGregor wore a suit with "f**k you" stripes and said, "He's in a fu**ing tracksuit...He can't even afford a suit anymore." Mayweather then took out a $100 million cheque.
