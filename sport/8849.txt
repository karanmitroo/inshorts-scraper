Mitchell Starc smashed seven sixes in the first innings against Pakistan, thereby breaking the record for most sixes hit in a Test innings at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. MCG is considered to be one of the biggest grounds with the longest boundary being over 80 meters. Starc overtook Andrew Symonds, who had hit six sixes against South Africa in 2005.
