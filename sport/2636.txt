Windies' all-rounder Chris Gayle has filed a $1-million defamation suit against three Australian newspapers that have accused him of exposing to a masseuse during the 2015 World Cup. The newspapers claimed Gayle 'intentionally exposed his genitals to a woman in the dressing room during a training session'. Gayle will provide evidence in the NSW Supreme Court later this month.
