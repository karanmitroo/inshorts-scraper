Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday said that people often say India doesn't win medals at Olympics but they do not realise that the youth, which is "hooked to electronic gadgets", should instead be playing outdoor sports. "It (outdoor sports) will not only help them stay active but also help them in their academics," he added.
