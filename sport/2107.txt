American football player Marquise Goodwin helped his team San Francisco 49ers win their first NFL match of the year, just hours after his wife lost their baby son due to complications in her pregnancy. Goodwin blew a kiss to the sky before crossing the goal line for a touchdown and then knelt in prayer with his teammates around.
