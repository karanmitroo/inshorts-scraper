Mahendra Singh Dhoni, along with the rest of the Indian cricket team, wore the name of his mother on his jersey in the Visakhapatnam ODI against New Zealand. The ODI was the last match that Dhoni featured in as the skipper of the team. "What's important is to appreciate the stuff that Mothers have done for us," Dhoni had said.
