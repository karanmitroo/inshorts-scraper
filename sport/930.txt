Rajan Nayer, a former official in Zimbabwe cricket administration, has been suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on charges of fixing international matches. The suspension has come after Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer informed coach Heath Streak about an alleged approach by an official to influence the result of Zimbabwe-Windies Test series last year.
