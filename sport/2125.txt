American radio host Michael Felger mocked late baseball player Roy Halladay who died in a plane crash aged 40 on Tuesday. "'Wheee! Oh look, I just landed on the water, everybody! I'm going to tweet it!' Splat. You're dead. With two kids. Moron", Felger said about Halladay's accident. Felger, who also included splash sound effects during the show, later apologised.
