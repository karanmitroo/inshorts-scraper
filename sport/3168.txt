Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan has been released from India's squad for the first three ODIs against Australia to be with his wife, who is unwell. The BCCI has decided not to name a replacement for the left-handed batsman. Earlier, Dhawan had also missed the final ODI and the only T20I in Sri Lanka to tend to his sick mother.
