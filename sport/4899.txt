Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid congratulated Yuvraj Singh on his 300th ODI, saying that one can't think of an all-time India XI without considering "superstar" Yuvraj Singh. "He'll make most people's all time one day XI, the performances he's had over the last 17 years," Dravid added. Yuvraj on Thursday became the fifth Indian to reach the 300-ODI mark.
