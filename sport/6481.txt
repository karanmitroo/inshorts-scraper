Royal Challengers Bangalore batsman KL Rahul has been ruled out of the upcoming edition of the IPL following a shoulder injury. Rahul sustained the injury five weeks ago during the Pune Test against Australia, but continued to play in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, ending as the third-highest run-getter. The cricketer will now reportedly undergo surgery in London.
