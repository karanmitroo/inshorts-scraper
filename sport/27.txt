Pune curator Pandurang Salgaoncar, who was caught in a sting operation allegedly offering to tamper the pitch for an India-New Zealand ODI last year, has been suspended for six months by ICC. Pandurang had allowed reporters to inspect the pitch in person, which is a major rule violation. He was found guilty of failing to report an approach to ICC.
