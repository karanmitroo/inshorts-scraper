Dismissing the allegations of drug abuse on Yuvraj Singh, cricketer's father Yograj Singh said, "Yuvraj and all my other three children are like lions. They don't eat grass." This comes after Yuvraj Singh's sister-in-law, Akansha Sharma, claimed in an interview that the cricketer is a drug addict and smokes marijuana.
