New South Wales in Australia on Tuesday reversed its plans to ban greyhound racing, a competitive sport wherein the dog breed races around a track. The ban had come after an inquiry found evidence of mass killings of greyhounds. The reversal comes after public backlash and a fall in the approval ratings of New South Wales premier Mike Baird.
