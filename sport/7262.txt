For the second straight year, the Brazil Open tennis tournament will deploy shelter dogs instead of ball boys to fetch balls along the net line during the warmups on the semifinal and final days of the tournament. Six dogs, coming from two Sao Paulo shelters, will be used to fetch balls and will be available for adoption.
