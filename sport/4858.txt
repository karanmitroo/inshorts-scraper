Pakistani batsman Mohammad Hafeez got a reprieve in the 49th over as he remained not-out after Jasprit Bumrah's yorker hit the stump but failed to dislodge the bails. Bumrah's yorker hit Hafeez's bat and pad before rolling towards the stump, where it ricocheted off it while the bail jumped only to fall back in its groove.
