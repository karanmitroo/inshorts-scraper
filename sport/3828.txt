Former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar on Wednesday revealed the reason behind his 'flying' celebration, saying that he wanted to be a fighter pilot than a cricketer because of his 'endless love for jets'. Akhtar called himself an 'F-16 fighter jet' and said, "This F-16 was better than All." Akhtar picked up 444 wickets in 224 matches for Pakistan.
