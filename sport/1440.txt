Greater Manchester Police has opened investigations into a "hate crime" amid reports that Manchester City player Raheem Sterling was kicked and subjected to racial slurs at the club's training base before Saturday's match against Tottenham. Sterling scored twice in City's 4-1 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur, which helped extend the Manchester side's all-time record win streak to 16 league matches.
