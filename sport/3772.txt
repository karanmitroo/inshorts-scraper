Indian opener KL Rahul has equalled the all-time record of registering 50+ scores in seven consecutive Test innings, crossing the landmark in the third Test against Sri Lanka on Saturday. He is the first Indian and sixth cricketer overall, alongside Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Kumar Sangakkara, to achieve the feat. Notably, none of Rahul's seven 50+ scores resulted in a century.
