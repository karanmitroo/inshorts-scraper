Sanjay Manjrekar explained why Indian skipper Virat Kohli avoided playing the Nathan Lyon delivery on which he was dismissed leg before during the Bengaluru Test on Saturday. Kohli had attempted playing a similar ball earlier in the over which led to an unsuccessful catch appeal. He left the other delivery assuming it would have spun more, which it didn't.
