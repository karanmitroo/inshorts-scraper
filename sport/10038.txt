Virat Kohli, while he was batting on 41 in the Rajkot Test, asked the on-field umpires if it was one bouncer for the over when spinner Zafar Ansari's ball took off from the pitch and went over his shoulder. Umpire Chris Gaffaney, who was standing at square-leg, responded to Kohli's call and indicated it was 'one for the over'.
