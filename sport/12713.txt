After losing to Andy Murray at Wimbledon, Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios said that he doesn’t love tennis. “I woke up this morning and played computer games,” Kyrgios said, adding, “Is that the greatest preparation? I don’t know. But it was fun.” He further said that although he doesn't love tennis he doesn't know what else to do without it.
