ICC has approved the consistent use of Decision Review System (DRS) in all international cricket, besides approving its use in the World T20 next year. The decision was taken in principle at an ICC meet on Saturday and will be formalised in May, with a roll-out expected to begin in October. Till now, DRS was not used in T20Is.
