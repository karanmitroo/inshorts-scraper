Delhi High Court on Friday asked a trial court to consider afresh the plea of Hockey player Sardar Singh's former girlfriend, who had made allegations of sexual harassment against him. The allegations also include charges of attempt to murder, causing miscarriage without consent, and criminal intimidation. High Court had earlier granted interim stay on the proceedings before the trial court.
