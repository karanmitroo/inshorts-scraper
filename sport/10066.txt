Bengal cricketers Pragyan Ojha and Ashok Dinda were involved in an altercation during a training session ahead of their Ranji trophy match in Rajkot. The incident happened when the team was playing football and Dinda's shot almost hit Ojha. Ojha shouted at Dinda, who then charged at the former and termed him an 'outsider' due to his interstate transfer.
