England's Albert Trott is the only batsman in the cricket history to clear the pavilion of the iconic Lord's stadium with his hit. The ball bounced on the reverse slope of the pavilion roof, struck a chimney pot, and toppled down into a garden on the other side. Trott, born on February 6, 1873, had achieved the feat in 1899.
