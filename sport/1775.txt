Australian coach Darren Lehmann took a dig at England, saying that he would not impose a curfew on the Australian team as they are "adults". "We have faith in the blokes to do the right thing," Lehmann added. His statement comes after England cricket chief Andrew Strauss slapped a curfew on players following England's loss in the first Test.
