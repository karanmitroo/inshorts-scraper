Ramachandra Guha has accused BCCI of according preferential treatment to some national coaches by giving them ten-month contracts to allow them to work in IPL for two months. The historian blamed the board for handling the issue of Anil Kumble's contract "in an extremely insensitive and unprofessional manner". Guha also raised the issue of low match fees for Ranji players.
