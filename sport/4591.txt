Australian boxer Jeff Horn lifted the WBO welterweight championship after handing legendary boxer, Manny Pacquiao, his career's seventh loss with a unanimous decision on Sunday. Horn, who is open to a rematch with Pacquiao, immediately called out former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather for a fight. Notably, this is Pacquiao's first loss since losing to Mayweather in 2015.
