Manchester United's midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan's scorpion kick goal against Sunderland was named as the Premier League Goal of December. Mkhitaryan had scored the goal in the Boxing Day match in the 86th minute after running inside the box and acrobatically flicking the cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic through a flying backheel.
