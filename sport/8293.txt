World number three women's tennis player Agnieszka Radwanska successfully pulled off a between-the-legs shot, also called a 'tweener', during her first round match against Poland's Tsvetana Pironkova in the Australian Open on Tuesday. During the second set, Radwanska ran back towards the service line to recover a lob and hit the shot between her legs, with her back facing Pironkova.
