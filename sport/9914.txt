Sea Hero Quest, a mobile-based video game that tests the users' spatial navigation skills, has become the largest dementia study in history. After having been played by over 2.4 million users, the game has generated 9,400 years' worth of lab-based research data since its launch in May. The gathered data will help scientists understand the disease's progress with age.
