Hobart Hurricanes' pacer Shaun Tait bowled a 148 km/h yorker which uprooted the middle stump of Sydney Sixers' batsman Sam Billings. Billings was batting on 42 when he tried to hit the in-swinging delivery to the leg side but he missed it getting bowled out. The game had to be stopped for 10 minutes as the stumps required complete renovation.
