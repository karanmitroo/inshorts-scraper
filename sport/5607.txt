A fan of Gujarat Lions captain Suresh Raina invaded the pitch to seek the player's autograph during the IPL match against Delhi Daredevils in Kanpur on Wednesday. The fan, wearing a Raina jersey, held out a paper and pen and sat on his knees, before being asked by the player and the umpire to leave.
