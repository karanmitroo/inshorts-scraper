A professional beekeeper was called during the South Africa-Sri Lanka ODI at Johannesburg on Saturday when a swarm of bees invaded the field and halted play thrice. The bees first flew onto the ground during Sri Lanka's 25th over, with ground staff using fire extinguishers to clear them. The beekeeper then arrived with can of honey to clear the bees.
