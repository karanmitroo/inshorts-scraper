Ex-New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum scored Test cricket's fastest century off 54 balls in his career's last match against Australia in February 2016. McCullum, who turned 36 on Wednesday, broke the record jointly held by Viv Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq, who scored a century each off 56 balls. McCullum also holds the record for hitting most sixes in Tests, at 107.
