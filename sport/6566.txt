Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly claims that pacer Umesh Yadav is the Indian cricket team's find of the season, after having picked up 17 wickets in the recently concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. "To see an Australia team on the back foot against fast bowling is a great sign", Ganguly said about Umesh's performance in the series.
