Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has requested the BCCI to consider recognition of Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI) and bring the visually-impaired players under its pension scheme. This comes weeks after India defeated Pakistan to lift their second Blind Cricket World Cup. Sachin mentioned that the recognition will be an acknowledgement of the cricketers' passion for cricket.
