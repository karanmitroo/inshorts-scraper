Cricket Australia Chief James Sutherland has mocked Virat Kohli, saying he is not sure if the latter knows how to spell 'sorry'. Sutherland was responding to a query on whether the Indian captain should apologise to Steve Smith for the DRS controversy. He added he hoped the players have "a bit of a laugh" at the end of the series.
