The England-Windies Test that began on January 29, 1998, in Jamaica, is the only match in Test cricket's 140-year history which was abandoned as drawn due to 'dangerous pitch'. The match lasted 10.1 overs and 56 minutes as England batsmen were struck several times due to uneven deliveries. The England physiotherapist claimed even bowlers were "embarrassed" by the pitch.
