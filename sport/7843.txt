England lost their last eight wickets for eight runs in the Bengaluru T20I against India on Wednesday, registering the worst collapse in the last 71 years of international cricket and the worst in T20Is. It is also the second-worst collapse in international cricket history, behind New Zealand's eight wickets, five runs collapse in a Test against Australia in 1946.
