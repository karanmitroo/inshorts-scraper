Afghanistan batsman Najibullah Zadran fell while attempting a shot but managed to hit a six in the ongoing Desert T20 Challenge, a tournament for ICC's eight associate members, in UAE. Afghanistan needed 20 runs off the last two overs against UAE, when Zadran stretched to his left and lost his balance, with the ball going over extra cover for six.
