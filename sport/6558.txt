The government had reportedly rejected the proposal to felicitate cricketer MS Dhoni, journalist Arnab Goswami, spiritual leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, music composer Anu Malik and others with Padma awards. NCP leader Sharad Pawar and BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi were awarded Padma Vibhushan under the "public affairs" category, which falls under the government's discretion, a report said.
