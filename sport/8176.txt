Commentator Mark Howard is being investigated by Cricket Australia after giving tips to Adelaide Strikers captain Brad Hodge while commentating in the Big Bash League on Wednesday. Hodge was on the on-field mic when Howard said bowler Ben Laughlin was particularly successful against Sydney Thunder's Shane Watson, who was batting then. Hodge then brought on Laughlin in the next over.
