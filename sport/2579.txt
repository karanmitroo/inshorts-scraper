Cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag apologised to South African batsman AB de Villiers for posting a tweet, minutes after which the latter was dismissed, missing out on his maiden ODI double ton by 24 runs. Sehwag had tweeted that the South African might become the first middle-order batsman to hit a double ton. "Sorry @ABdeVilliers17 , nazar lag gayi," Sehwag later tweeted.
