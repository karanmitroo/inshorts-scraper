Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj Singh on Wednesday revealed that he did not attend his son's wedding as it was solemnised at a Dera sect. Criticising his family's devotion to Dera, Yograj asked, "Has the baba taught him how to play cricket?" He also claimed that Yuvraj never gave him a kurta, but gave several cars to the Dera.
