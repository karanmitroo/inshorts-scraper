Philippe Coutinho, who recently became the world's second-most expensive footballer, made his debut for Barcelona in their 2-0 win over Espanyol in the Copa del Rey on Thursday. The former Liverpool player, who made the £142-million move earlier this month, replaced Barcelona captain Andrés Iniesta on the 68-minute mark. The match saw first-half goals from Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi.
