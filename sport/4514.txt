Bowling at England cricket team's net session, Sachin Tendulkar's son Arjun, a left-arm seamer, caught England's wicketkeeper-batsman Jonny Bairstow on the foot with a yorker. Bairstow was seen limping out of the ground and had to receive treatment. Bairstow's injury was not serious as he made it to England's final XI which is facing SA in a Test at Lord's.
