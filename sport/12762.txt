Former team director Ravi Shastri has defended himself from Sourav Ganguly’s accusation, saying it was the BCCI who suggested that the interview for the coach’s post be held on Skype, due to short notice. Earlier, Ganguly had replied to Shastri's no-show comment, saying the latter was “spending time on a Bangkok holiday” at the time of an important interview.
