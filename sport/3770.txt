Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt failed to finish the last ever race of his career, getting injured in the final leg of the 4x100-metre relay at the IAAF World Championships. Jamaica didn't finish as Great Britain and NI set a national record to win the race. Bolt had finished with a bronze in the 100-metre sprint, his career's last solo race.
