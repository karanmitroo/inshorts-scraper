Pakistan Under-19 cricket team manager Nadeem Khan on Sunday said the way his side lost wickets against eventual champions India in the Under-19 World Cup semi-finals, it seemed like they were under some spell. "It appeared as if our batsmen had no idea what was happening out on the field or how to tackle the situation and pressure," Nadeem added.
