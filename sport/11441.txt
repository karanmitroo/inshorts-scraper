A move to give Shahid Afridi a farewell during the Pakistan-West Indies T20Is in UAE has not materialised, with the former captain left out of the squad for the three matches. Afridi had planned to retire at the end of the 2016 World T20 in April, but later said he was reconsidering his retirement due to "huge pressure" from friends.
