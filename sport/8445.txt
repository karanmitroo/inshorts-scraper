American football team Dallas Cowboys has released an 'Official Bandwagon Fan Application' for its followers. The form, posted on Cowboys' social media accounts, asks questions relating to the fan's history of supporting and "trash talking" about the team, allegiances to other sides and "reasons for leaving them". The form also asks if the fan is willing to work on Thanksgiving.
