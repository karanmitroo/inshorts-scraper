Following Virat Kohli's hit wicket in the first Test against England at Rajkot, commentator Dean Jones asked Virender Sehwag in the commentary box if he had succumbed to the dismissal. Jones tweeted Sehwag's reply, who said, "you kidding? I never moved my feet!" Kohli's dismissal was the 22nd instance of an Indian being out hit-wicket in Tests.
