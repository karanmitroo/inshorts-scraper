Phil Taylor, 16-time darts world champion, flipped his middle finger to the crowd at the PDC World Darts Championship final in his last ever professional appearance. The incident occurred after Taylor's opponent and eventual tournament winner Rob Cross dropped a glass of water during Taylor's turn. Earlier the crowd had booed during Michael van Gerwen's semifinal against Rob Cross.
