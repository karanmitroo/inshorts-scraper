The BCCI on Tuesday named former Indian cricketer Bharat Arun as the Indian cricket team's bowling coach. Arun, who was Indian coach Ravi Shastri's teammate from their Under-19 days, had previously served in the same capacity during Shastri's tenure as team director from 2014 to 2016. Notably, Sanjay Bangar and R Sridhar will remain the batting and fielding coach respectively.
