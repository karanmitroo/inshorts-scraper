French Ligue 1 side Bastia FC's match against Lyon was abandoned at the 45-minute mark after Bastia supporters twice invaded the pitch to attack the visiting Lyon players. The Bastia fans had also tried to attack the Lyon players during their pre-match warm-up. Earlier in January, Bastia fans had shouted racist insults at Nice striker Mario Balotelli.
