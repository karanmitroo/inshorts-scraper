American airline Delta was criticised for refusing to provide US men's curling team, which won a gold medal at the Winter Olympics, an upgrade to fly back from South Korea. While the team thanked Delta for considering the request, users tweeted, "These people won gold for your country," and "you are making it so easy not to fly with you".
