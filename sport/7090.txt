Ravindra Jadeja was reviewed following an LBW appeal but dismissed caught behind by the TV umpire during the Bengaluru Test against Australia on Saturday. Jadeja had edged a Nathan Lyon delivery which the umpire didn't notice, and hence rejected the LBW appeal. Steve Smith reviewed, after which the third umpire gave Jadeja out since the ball was caught at slip.
