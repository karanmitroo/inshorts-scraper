"I have seen God. He bats at number four for India," former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden had said about Sachin Tendulkar, who celebrated his 44th birthday on Monday. Australian cricket legend Sir Don Bradman once said, "I never saw myself play, but I feel that this feller [Sachin Tendulkar] is playing much the same as I used to play."
