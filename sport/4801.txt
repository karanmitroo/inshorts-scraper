After Anil Kumble resigned as the Indian team's coach over an "untenable" relationship with captain Virat Kohli, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said, "[I]t's a really sad day for Indian cricket". "Hope he will take it on the chin and comes back stronger. But it is the first time a known fighter like Anil did not stand up," Gavaskar added.
