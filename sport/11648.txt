Belgium's Paralympic wheelchair racer, Marieke Vervoort, who suffers from an incurable spinal degenerative disease that has left her wheelchair-ridden, is considering ending her life after the Paralympic Games in Rio. The 37-year-old two-time London 2012 Paralympic medallist said, "I suffer greatly, sometimes sleeping only ten minutes a night - and still go for the gold. Rio is my last wish."
