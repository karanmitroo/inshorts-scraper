Sri Lanka's 39-year-old spinner Rangana Herath went past Pakistan's Wasim Akram to become the highest wicket-taker among left-arm bowlers in Test cricket history. Herath took his 415th Test wicket against Bangladesh to complete a 215-run win for Sri Lanka. Herath is just two scalps behind Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh in the list of Test cricket's highest wicket-takers.
