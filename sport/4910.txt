A mural of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo winking has been unveiled near the Portugal team's hotel in Russia, ahead of their Confederations Cup match on Thursday. The three-floor-high artwork, which took five days to paint, will be visible from the player's hotel room. It depicts Ronaldo's wink at his Portugal teammates after Wayne Rooney was red-carded in the 2006 World Cup.
