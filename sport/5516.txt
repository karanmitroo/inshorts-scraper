Sunrisers Hyderabad's Mois√©s Henriques, who leads Big Bash side Sydney Sixers, has said, "I must say as captain of the Sixers I have been contemplating our little leggie (Rashid Khan) we have over here". Henriques said that he still couldn't pick up Rashid in the nets, who is able to get the ball to spin both ways.
