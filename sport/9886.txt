Indian wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha produced a Mahendra Singh Dhoni-like run out of England opener Haseeb Hameed during the Vizag Test on Friday. Joe Root played a shot towards square leg and attempted a double with Hameed. Jayant Yadav collected the ball and threw it to Saha, who hit the stumps immediately, with Hameed failing to get back to the crease.
