Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli revealed that during his under-17 days, post a haircut which made his ears look big, his teammates and others started calling him 'Cheeku', since he resembled a rabbit. He added that MS Dhoni then picked up the nickname and used it behind the stumps, which got caught on the stump mic and became popular.
