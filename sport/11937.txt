For the first time since the inception of the award, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna will be given to four athletes in the same year. The government announced on Monday that the countryâ€™s highest sporting honour will be given to Olympians Sakshi Malik, PV Sindhu, Dipa Karmakar and Jitu Rai. In 2009, three sportspersons shared the award, also a first.
