Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal took three South African wickets without giving a single run in the second ODI on Sunday. Chahal first dismissed Quinton de Kock when the score was 51 before Yadav cleaned up Aiden Markram and then David Miller. Earlier, Quinton De Kock survived a scare after the ball hit the stumps without dislodging the bails.
