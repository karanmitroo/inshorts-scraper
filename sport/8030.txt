Rahul Dravid has declined the honorary doctorate conferred on him by Bangalore University, saying he would like to accomplish research in sports and earn the degree. The university had earlier announced Dravid would be awarded a degree at their convocation on Friday. In 2014, Dravid did not turn up at Gulbarga University's convocation, who had also awarded him a doctorate.
