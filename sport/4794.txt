Pakistan's limited overs captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, who led Pakistan to their maiden ICC Champions Trophy title, is reportedly set to be appointed as the captain of Pakistan's Test team. The 30-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman will be replacing Misbah-ul-Haq, who retired last month after serving as captain for seven years. Pakistan's Test side will next face Sri Lanka in UAE.
