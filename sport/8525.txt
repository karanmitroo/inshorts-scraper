Former Pakistan captain and current chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq has said Pakistani batsmen cannot hold their nerves for "even two sessions" in a match, which is "unfortunate". "Even when they were in strong position, our batsmen could not show aggression...If that is the standard of our consistency, it is not good enough at the international level," said Inzamam.
