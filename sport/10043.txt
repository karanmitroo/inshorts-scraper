Former Australian cricketer Mitchell Johnson trolled Graeme Smith and Neil Manthorp after Australia's loss to SA in the first Test. Johnson posted a picture of instances when SA "choked", with a caption that read, "Australia have coped it and yes they aren't performing but when comments come from SA @NeilManthorp @GraemeSmith49 remember the big moments!".
