Deepa Malik, who was not considered for this year's Khel Ratna award, has requested the Sports Ministry to reconsider her case, with Haryana CM ML Khattar backing her. "Do I need to win one more medal in 2020...at the age of 50 to be given this award," asked Malik, the first Indian woman to win a medal at the Paralympics.
