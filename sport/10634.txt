Bangladesh debutant spinner Mehedi Hasan, who took six wickets in England's first innings in the ongoing Test, has described former Indian spinner Ramesh Powar as his hero. "I used to watch him play IPL matches on TV and took inspiration," said Hasan. Powar, on learning that Hasan was inspired by his bowling, said he was really happy for the youngster.
