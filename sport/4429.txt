Peter Woodville, a 14-year-old boy who caught American tennis player Jack Sock's towel at Wimbledon last Tuesday before it was forcibly taken away by an older spectator, was given a replacement towel by the American player. Peter had come again to watch Sock's doubles match at Wimbledon on Friday, where he was given the replacement towel by the player himself.
