England football team captain Wayne Rooney was pictured having gatecrashed at a wedding party while being drunk, following England's victory over Scotland in World Cup qualifying matches. Although the forward has apologised for his conduct as being "inappropriate for someone in his position," he will be sacked from the post of England captain by the team manager, according to reports.
