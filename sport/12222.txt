Local police authorities used stun grenades and tear gas to clear away protesters when the Olympic torch arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. Reportedly, anti-government protesters in a Rio suburb threw rocks and blocked the torch's path, with police dispersing them with pepper spray and rubber bullets. Over 80,000 security personnel have been deployed in Rio to ensure security.
