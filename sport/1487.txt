The BCCI on Friday organised a workshop on the Decision Review System (DRS) in Visakhapatnam for its top 10 domestic umpires, who are not a part of the International Cricket Council panel. The workshop was conducted by ICC umpires coach Dennis Burns and elite panel umpire Paul Reiffel. A simulation session on DRS calls was also held for the umpires.
