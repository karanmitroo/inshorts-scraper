Cricket umpire Bruce Oxenford, who wears an arm shield while officiating, has said a Barinder Sran shot which struck an umpire, made him design his shield. “I did some research and looked at polycarbonate which is like bulletproof glass. I had people throw cricket balls at me from close range and it stood up to the test,” said Oxenford.
