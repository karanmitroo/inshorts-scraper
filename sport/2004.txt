MS Dhoni has revealed that his favourite moment from the 2011 World Cup final was when the crowd started singing 'Vande Mataram' when India was about to win. "We knew from that point that we will win the game... That whole atmosphere has never been recreated, but hopefully someday, I will be able to witness it again," added Dhoni.
