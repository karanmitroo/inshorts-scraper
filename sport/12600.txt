India won the NatWest series for the first time after defeating England at the Lord's on July 13, 2002. Chasing a target of 326, India were reduced to 146/5, when Muhammad Kaif's 87*(75) and Yuvraj Singh's 69(63) handed India its first victory at Lord's since 1983. The win prompted former captain Sourav Ganguly to take-off and wildly twirl his jerseyâ€‹.
