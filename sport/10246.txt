Indian cricket team coach Anil Kumble has made it mandatory for players recovering from injuries to play in domestic cricket to be in contention for a return to the national team. Kumble stated that players should make a comeback only when they are 100% fit. "We are trying to set certain protocols...Play under pressure before coming back," he added.
