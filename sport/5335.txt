Barcelona forward Lionel Messi dribbled past four Eibar players to score the Catalan giants' last goal of the La Liga campaign on Sunday. After receiving an aerial ball at the half-way line, Messi began his solo run, dummying opposition's defenders on by one before reaching the face of the goal where he scored with a right-footed shot.
