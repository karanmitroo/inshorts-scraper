An amateur English football team walked out of a match after the referee banned their Sikh striker from wearing his black religious bandana. Striker Gurdeep Mudhar, 21, was ordered to take off the headwear, which he wears in accordance with his religious beliefs. "He always plays with a bandana. It's never been a problem anywhere else", said the team secretary.
