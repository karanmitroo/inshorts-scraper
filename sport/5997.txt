Cricket is among the 62 sports excluded from the 2018 Asian Games to be held in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Olympic Council of Asia said it was reducing the number of events from 493 to 431 to lessen the burden on organisers. Skateboarding and surfing are among other eliminated sports, while there would be lesser events in others.
