Brazilian footballer Roberto Carlos scored a 35-metre banana free kick with no direct line to the goal against France on June 3, 1997. The rotations of the ball about its axis created a pressure difference on its sides, making it curve towards the goal. This phenomenon is called the Magnus Effect and was first documented by physicist Isaac Newton.
