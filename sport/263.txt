During a one-day match in New Zealand on Wednesday, Auckland batsman Jeet Raval hit a six after the ball hit Canterbury pacer Andrew Ellis' head and flew over the long-off boundary. The incident happened in the 19th over and Ellis was taken off for a concussion test, which he passed. In the 48th over, Ellis went on to dismiss Raval.
