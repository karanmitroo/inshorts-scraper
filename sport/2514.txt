Ex-Australian spinner Timothy May excreted while appealing for an LBW against Pakistan during an ODI on October 22, 1994. The umpire turned down the appeal and May's teammates noticed a change in his expressions with some thinking he was "just disappointed". Later, while celebrating a wicket, Australians went into huddle and May admitted he had "sh*t himself" after "appealing strongly”.
