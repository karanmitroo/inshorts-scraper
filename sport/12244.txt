Hockey India president Narinder Batra lashed out at India’s Chef de Mission and IOA officials in Rio, complaining about the lack of basic furniture in the players’ rooms. Following hockey coach Roelant Oltmans' complaint, Batra shared a video on Facebook of the players sitting on bean bags. “Have you all gone for a paid holiday to Rio,” wrote Batra.
