Ajit Agarkar was dismissed for a duck seven times in a row against Australia, including four consecutive first-ball dismissals. Five of his dismissals came on the 1999-2000 Australia tour, following which Agarkar bagged a pair in Mumbai in 2001. Interestingly, Agarkar raised his bat in the 2003 Brisbane Test on scoring his first run against Australia after these dismissals.
