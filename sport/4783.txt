Cricketer Lasith Malinga is facing an investigation by Sri Lanka's cricket board for comparing the country's sports minister to a monkey. The minister had criticised the Lankan team suggesting that the cricketers were too fat. Malinga responded to the criticism, saying, "[D]on't care about criticism from those who're simply warming chairs...What does a monkey know about a parrot's nesting hollow?"
