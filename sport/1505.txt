Former Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram has said that he would have loved to bowl to Indian captain Virat Kohli because it would be "so much fun". "Kohli is very aggressive...I always think I have a chance to get him...Kohli with 32 one-day hundreds is definitely the player of the new era. India has a gem in Kohli," added Akram.
