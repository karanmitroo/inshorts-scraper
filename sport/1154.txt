South African pacer Dale Steyn overtook veteran Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh to become the tenth highest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Steyn achieved the feat by taking his 418th Test wicket by dismissing Shikhar Dhawan in the Cape Town Test on Friday. Steyn is the seventh-highest Test wicket-taker among pacers and South Africa's second-highest wicket-taker in Tests after Shaun Pollock (421).
