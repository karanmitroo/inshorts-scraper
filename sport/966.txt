Shoaib Malik scored four runs after a Colin Munro throw bounced off his head to the boundary during the fourth New Zealand-Pakistan ODI on Tuesday. Malik was returning to crease while attempting a single when Munro's throw hit him on the back of his head and flew for four overthrows. He faced four more balls before getting out for 6(8).
