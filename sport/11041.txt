Bangladesh's army commandos staged a security drill at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Thursday, to assure the visiting England cricket team of security arrangements in the country. More than a dozen commandos scaled down ropes from helicopters at the ground, with England's security chief expressing his satisfaction with the arrangements. The series starts with the first ODI on Friday.
