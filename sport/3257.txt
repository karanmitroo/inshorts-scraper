A video has surfaced which suggests Indian captain Virat Kohli was wrongly awarded the toss in the T20I against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Kohli had called 'heads' before Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga tossed the coin. Referee Andy Pycroft looked at the coin, saying, "Tails, India." Presenter Murali Kartik, on hearing "India", started interviewing Kohli while the referee tried to intervene.
