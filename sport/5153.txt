Legendary Australian spinner Shane Warne bowled a big leg-break as his first delivery in an Ashes Test to clean bowl England batsman Mike Gatting on June 4, 1993. The flighted delivery drifted in, then dipped and eventually hit Gatting's off-stump with a sharp turn and is popularly known as 'the ball of the century'.
