Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has said public perception has played a major role in him being unsold at last month's IPL auction. Pujara, who averages over 50 in List A cricket and has a T20 strike rate of 105.18, added, "I am not at all worried as I know my opportunity would come at some point of time."
