BCCI CEO Rahul Johri has rejected demand of â‚¹30 lakh by 10 state associations for IPL. In a letter, Johri said their demand for funds on "ASAP basis" was "not justified". "The said amount can only be released after you have duly performed in full and at each match...taken all steps to ensure that IPL is conducted smoothly," wrote Johri.
