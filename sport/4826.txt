The International Cricket Council's (ICC) chief executive David Richardson has revealed that Champions Trophy could be scrapped to make way for bi-annual World T20 events. "What we want to do is differentiate our global events from each other so that they can be stand-alone and create maximum interest every time the event happens," Richardson said.
