Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga, who recently turned 34, is seeking help from former Indian cricketer Zaheer Khan to help prolong his career. "Zak is more of a seam and swing bowler, and I want to learn more of that kind of thing over the next few years," Malinga said. Malinga has played along Zaheer for the Mumbai Indians.
