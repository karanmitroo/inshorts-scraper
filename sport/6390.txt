Australian all-rounder Shane Watson will captain Royal Challengers Bangalore in the opening match of IPL 10 on Wednesday, after AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli were ruled out due to injuries. Coach Daniel Vettori had announced de Villiers will captain the team while Kohli sits out, but the South African suffered a back injury in a domestic T20 competition.
