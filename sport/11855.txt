An injury-time goal by 18-year-old Marcus Rashford helped Manchester United register a third straight victory, defeating Hull City 1-0 on Saturday. In the injury time, skipper Wayne Rooney took a solo run on the left flank, before supplying a grounded cross for Rashford to tap in. The win helped the Reds retain their second spot on the Premier League table.
