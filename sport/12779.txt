Former Brazil captain Pelé has said that he hopes ex-Argentina player Lionel Messi will reconsider his decision to retire from international football following Argentina's loss in Copa America final. "He got very upset but maybe wait a little bit and he'll forget, because this has happened with a lot of good players. I hope he listens to me," Pelé said.
