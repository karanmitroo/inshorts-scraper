Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to score 100 goals in European club competitions following his brace in Real Madrid's 2-1 win over 10-man Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-final first-leg in Munich on Wednesday. Bayern midfielder Arturo Vidal's 26th-minute header gave the hosts the lead before Ronaldo scored his 96th and 97th UCL goals in the second half.
