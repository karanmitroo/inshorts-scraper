American tennis player Tennys Sandgren's mother Lia broke her rib while celebrating her son's fourth-round victory at the Australian Open. Lia revealed her neighbours were dancing around with her when she tripped on the carpet and fell backward onto the table. "I've spent most of this week in bed, watching from the comfort of my bed," she said.
