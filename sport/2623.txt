India's Under-17 footballer Nongdamba Naorem trolled his teammate Anwar Ali after the latter shared an Instagram post about the pride associated in representing India. Replying to Ali's tweet, Nongdamba wrote, "Kahase laya English ha ha", referring to the long post in English. The post came out when there were concerns about Ali's availability for India's final match against Ghana.
