Indian Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav was seen practicing with a wet ball in the nets on the eve of the first India-New Zealand T20I. The idea was proposed by bowling coach Bharat Arun to tackle the issue of loss of grip because of dew. Previously, pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar had also applied the same strategy to prepare himself for death bowling.
