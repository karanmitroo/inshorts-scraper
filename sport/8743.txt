Five-year-old Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery has been given the 'Goal of the Month' award for December by football TV program, Match of the Day. Lowery, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, scored in the warm up before Sunderland's match against Chelsea. Goalkeeper Asmir Begovic went the wrong way as Lowery converted from the penalty spot.
