Kings XI Punjab's mentor-cum-director of cricket Virender Sehwag has revealed the team has bought Chris Gayle as a back-up opener. "Simply having him in your side means a lot. Being an opening batsman, Gayle can prove to be a danger to any opposition," he added. Notably, Gayle was bought by KXIP for â‚¹2 crore after he went unsold twice.
