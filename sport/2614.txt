Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova reached her first final since her return from the 15-month-long doping ban, at the Tianjin Open in China. This will be the former world number one's first WTA Tour final appearance since winning the Italian Open in May 2015. Sharapova, ranked 86th in the world, will take on world number 102 Anya Sabalenka on Sunday.
