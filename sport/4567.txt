A statue of Barcelona's Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez was vandalised in the Uruguayan city of Salto. The statue, which was unveiled in July last year, was seen toppled face-down in the street and was later taken away to be refurbished. The note left behind at the statue's spot read, "I went to Messi's wedding, I'll be back soon."
