Australia's Bert Oldfield was knocked unconscious during a match of 1932-33 Ashes, dubbed Bodyline series, wherein England skipper had asked pacers to aim at bodies of Australian batsmen. In a 1979 match, Australia's Dennis Lillee used an aluminium bat and threw it in "disgust" when asked to change. A 1975 match was abandoned after vandals sabotaged the pitch with oil.
