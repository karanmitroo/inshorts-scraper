Dallas Mavericks' basketball player Dirk Nowitzki, who has taken pay cuts to help the team, received a $20 bill as 'lunch money' alongside a hand-written letter from a fan during a Mavericks practice session. "You been taking discounts the past six years to help the team bring talent and a title, lunch is on me big fella," the fan wrote.
