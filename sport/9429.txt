BCCI has said IPL 2017 is in "real danger," following a stand-off between the Lodha Committee and the Board. "The International Management Group begins work on IPL every year in October. They're not on board yet. There's no word on the opening ceremony," said a BCCI official, adding that "not a single contract had been signed yet."
