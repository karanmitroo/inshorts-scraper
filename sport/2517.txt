Former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz has filed a complaint with the police and asked for protection after getting death threats from bookies. The 68-year-old claims his car was intercepted by unknown individuals last month, when he was returning after giving statements in court. He was warned not to speak against the Pakistan Cricket Board, players and bookies.
