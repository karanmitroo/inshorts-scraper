Windies' cricketer Chris Gayle, who is the only player to score over 10,000 runs in T20 cricket, was not picked by any of the franchises in the Pakistan Super League draft held in Lahore on Sunday. An owner cited Gayle's lack of runs in the IPL and said his partial availability was also one of the reasons behind it.
