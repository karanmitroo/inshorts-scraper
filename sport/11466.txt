India’s limited-overs​ captain MS Dhoni has said the public reaction to India’s group stage exit in the 2007 World Cup changed him. “It felt as if we had committed a big crime... That actually had a big impact on me and I channelised the aggression to become a better cricketer and a better human being,” said Dhoni.
