Turkish NBA player Enes Kanter, whose Turkish passport has been revoked, tweeted, "You can't catch me. Don't waste your breath. I will come on my own will anyway, to spit on your ugly, hateful faces," responding to an arrest warrant. Kanter has been accused of supporting US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen and supporting the failed coup attempt against President Erdoğan.
