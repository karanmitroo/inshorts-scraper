Speaking about India's performance on Day 2 of the Pune Test, coach Anil Kumble said, "You are bound to have one bad day. It was disappointing." "We were in a decent position when Rahul and Ajinkya were batting. But once Rahul got out, we lost those four wickets in five or six balls. That certainly pushed us back," Kumble added.
