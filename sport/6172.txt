Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel accused UEFA of not taking the attack on the team bus seriously, saying they treated it as if "a beer can had been thrown at the bus." Dortmund's Champions League quarter-final against Monaco, scheduled for Tuesday, was shifted to Wednesday after the blast. "We were told by text message (that we were playing)," said Tuchel.
