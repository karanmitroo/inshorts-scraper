Germany's Angelique Kerber got past Venus Williams 6-4, 6-4 in their Wimbledon semi-final to qualify for the final. The 36-year-old Williams committed 21 unforced errors in comparison to the southpaw's 11. This is the second time Kerber will face Serena Williams in a Grand Slam final, the previous occasion being the 2016 Australian Open, which was won by Kerber.
