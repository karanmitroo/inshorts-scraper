Lalmatia Club's bowler Sujon Mahmud, who conceded 92 runs in four legal deliveries to protest against umpiring in his side's match against Axiom Cricketers last month, has been handed a 10-year ban by Bangladesh's cricket board. The club has been barred indefinitely from competition, while the captain, the manager and the coach have been banned for five years.
