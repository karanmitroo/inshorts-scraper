In the first instance in seven years, India's top-three batsmen in the batting order scored fifties in the same innings against Australia in Ranchi on Saturday. The trio included openers KL Rahul and Murali Vijay, who scored 67 and 82 respectively, and number three Cheteshwar Pujara. The last such instance was in 2010 in a Test against New Zealand.
