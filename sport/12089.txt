South Pacific nation Fiji's Olympic Rugby team, considered gold-medal favourites, includes a prison warden and a hotel bellboy. The rugby team was affected by a cyclone that struck the island nation earlier this year. The Fiji team, members of which learned the game using plastic bottles and flip-flops as balls, have qualified for the tournament's semi-finals in Rio.
