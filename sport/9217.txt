Sachin Tendulkar was adjudged out LBW for a duck after a ball from Glenn Mcgrath hit his shoulder, on December 13, 1999. Playing in the Adelaide Test, Tendulkar tried to duck an intended short ball, which did not bounce as much as he expected and hit him in front of the stumps. The dismissal led many to term it 'shoulder-before-wicket'.
