Famous Indian cricket fan, Sudhir Gautam has been barred from entering the Mohali's PCA Stadium, which is hosting the ongoing India-England Test, because of his body paint in the colours of the Indian flag. It is against the "guidelines provided under the Flag Code of India" and "we have been asked to adhere to it without fail", said an official.
