Indian pacer Ashish Nehra has confirmed his retirement, with the first T20I against New Zealand in New Delhi on November 1 slated to be his last match. "I informed Virat and Ravi Shastri that I think Bhuvi and Bumrah are doing well...this is the right time for me to go," said Nehra. The 38-year-old has represented India for 18 years.
