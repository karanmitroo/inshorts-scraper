Kathrine Switzer, the first female to finish the all-male Boston Marathon in 1967, participated in the event 50 years later on Monday. Switzer was a women's rights activist back then, and after the 1967 Boston Marathon, women were officially allowed in the competition in 1972. Switzer has entered more than 30 marathons and has founded women's running club '261 Fearless'.
