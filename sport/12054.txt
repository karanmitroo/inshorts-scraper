Russia's sole track and field competitor at the Rio Olympics, Darya Klishina, who was participating under the neutral flag, has reportedly been suspended from the Games and her special eligibility status has been withdrawn. The 25-year-old long jumper was suspended as new evidence had emerged in relation to the World Anti-Doping Agency report which described the state-sponsored doping in Russia.
