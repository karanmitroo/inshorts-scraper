English all-rounder Ben Stokes has been called a "real hero" by a gay couple he defended outside a nightclub in Bristol, where he was arrested by the police for violence. The couple revealed that Stokes stepped in to stop a group of revellers hurling homophobic abuse at them. Stokes also reportedly bought the couple drinks.
