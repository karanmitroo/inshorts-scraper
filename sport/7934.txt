Boxer Sarita Devi, who recently became India's first female professional boxer, won her debut pro bout in Imphal on Sunday, defeating Hungary's Zsofia Bedo by unanimous decision. Sarita floored her opponent, who had played 59 pro bouts earlier, in the second round. Former world champion Sarita had trained under 73-year-old American Joe Clough, who was in Muhammad Ali's coaching staff.
