Barmy Army, a group of English cricket fans, targeted Australia's David Warner and his wife Candice in a new chant during the first day of the Ashes on Thursday. David was targeted with a reference to his bar incident, wherein he punched England captain Joe Root. Candice was attacked over her 'toilet cubicle' picture with rugby player Sonny Bill Williams.
