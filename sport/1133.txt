South Africa's batting coach Dale Benkenstein said that he wanted to book an Uber and head to the hotel after witnessing Bhuvneshwar Kumar reduce SA to 12/3 in the first Test on Friday. "They (India) are a quality bowling attack. The class and genius of AB and the tenacity of our captain changed the momentum of the game," Benkenstein added.
