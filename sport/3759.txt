Sprinter Usain Bolt, who is considered as the world's fastest man, retired from competitive athletics on August 12. Bolt, who won a total of 22 medals in Olympics and World Championships, after winning the 2012 Olympics 200-metre race said, "I'm now a legend, I'm also the greatest athlete to live. I am in the same category as Michael Johnson."
