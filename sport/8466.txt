Indian batsman Rohit Sharma said that outgoing captain MS Dhoni's decision to make him open the batting in the 50-over format was a career-changing move. "I became a better batsman after that. In fact, it helped me understand my game better, react better according to situations," said Sharma. The right-hander first opened in 2013 against England during a home series.
