Following reports that Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar might join the WWE, India's former WWE wrestler The Great Khali said it's "a bit late for Sushil" to join the wrestling entertainment company. "One has to join at an early age and the chances of success increase. WWE is very difficultâ€¦I'd personally like to see someone in WWE after me," said Khali.
