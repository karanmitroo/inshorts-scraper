Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by armed gunmen near the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on March 3, 2009. Several Sri Lankan players, including the then captain Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, were injured in the attack. The terror strike led to the cancellation of the tour and no international cricket match took place in Pakistan for next six years.
