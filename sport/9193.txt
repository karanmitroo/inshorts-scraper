Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima claims that she would have been a boxer if she hadn't been a model. The 35-year-old Brazilian model, who has been boxing for over 10 years, has published videos with her coach Dino Spencer, encouraging women to get involved in the traditionally male-dominated sport. Notably, Forbes named Lima as the year's second highest-paid model.
