Indian long jumper Anju Bobby George has claimed she was "robbed" of an Olympic medal at the 2004 Athens Games and will appeal to the International Olympic Committee. The three Russian medalists at the event failed subsequent drug tests and fifth-placed George has claimed they were "inhaling something on the field". She will appeal with the fourth and sixth-placed athletes.
