Sourav Ganguly called MS Dhoni's offer to lead the team during the final Test of his career a "surprise gesture" and said he had initially rejected it. "I'd rejected his offer earlier in the day, but couldn't refuse a second time," Ganguly wrote in his book. Ganguly added he told Dhoni to captain after three overs as he couldn't focus.
