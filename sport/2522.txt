Pakistani pacer Hasan Ali, the top-ranked bowler in ODIs, celebrates his wickets by mimicking a 'bomb explosion'. Ali, who is the highest wicket-taker this year with 43 wickets in 17 matches, imitates pumping the blasting mechanism which leads to the blast after claiming his victims. Ali said it was one of his childhood dreams to be the top-ranked bowler.
