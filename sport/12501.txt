The Pakistan Cricket Board has started a ‘Misbah Push-Up Challenge’, after Pakistani captain Misbah-ul-Haq celebrated his century at Lord’s with 10 push-ups last week. The challenge requires people to post videos of themselves doing ten push-ups with the hashtag #PushUpChallenge. A user tweeted, “I have more #MisbahPushUpChallenge nominations than Meryl Streep does for Oscars.”
