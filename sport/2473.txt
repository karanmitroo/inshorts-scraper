Michael Papps, at 38 years and 113 days, has become the oldest batsman from New Zealand and the oldest overall since World War II to slam a triple century in first-class cricket. Wellington's Papps smashed an unbeaten 316 against Auckland, overtaking England's Graham Gooch who had smashed a triple ton, aged 37 years and four days, against India in 1990.
