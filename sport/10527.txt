Former cricketer Shoaib Akhtar has said Pakistan shouldn't "risk inviting" foreign teams to the country, following the current security situation. "The security situation is such that we will have to be patient. I am sure international cricket will return to Pakistan but it will take some time," he said. No top Test team has toured Pakistan since March 2009.
