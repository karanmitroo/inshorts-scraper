A cameraman fell down at the Rogers Cup in Montreal while moving backwards to track Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal's warm up jog. Moving backwards, the cameraman failed to notice the ground staff standing behind him before tripping over and falling. Nadal crashed out of the tournament after losing to 18-year-old Denis Shapovalov in the Round of 16.
