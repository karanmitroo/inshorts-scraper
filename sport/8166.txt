The modern day bowling game is believed to have originated as a religious ceremony in ancient Germany. During the 3rd-4th century, every German peasant carried a wooden club and as a customary test of faith, set the club as a target. If the club was successfully knocked down by a stone, the person was deemed to be free from sin.
