A player in the Tamil Nadu Premier League, K Deeban Lingesh, was run-out while trying to take the fourth run off the last ball, after two earlier unsuccessful attempts on the same delivery, during a tournament match recently. Before Lingesh was dismissed, his partner survived twice, with the first attempt being blocked by his bat and the second an overthrow.
