Slamming Virat Kohli over team selection in the second Test, cricketer-turned-commentator Virender Sehwag said Kohli should drop himself if he fails to perform in the Centurion Test. Sehwag added that "Kohli hurt Bhuvneshwar Kumar's self-confidence" by dropping him for the Centurion Test. "Bhuvneshwar performed well in Cape Town and excluding him like this isn't justified," he added.
