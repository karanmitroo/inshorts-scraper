Swedish Olympic freestyle skiers Jesper Tjäder and Emma Dahlström filmed themselves skiing down one of the world's highest sand dunes, Cerro Blanco in Peru. The duo can be seen trekking up the sand dune, which is almost 7,000 feet above sea level, before performing various ski stunts including attempting at hitting kickers and rails in the sand.
