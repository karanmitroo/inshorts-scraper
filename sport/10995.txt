Former Australian opening batsman Matthew Hayden broke Brian Lara's then 375-run world record for the highest individual Test score, after scoring 380(437) against Zimbabwe on October 10, 2003. The southpaw struck 38 fours and 11 sixes in his ten-hour long stay on the pitch. Lara, who congratulated Hayden on the feat, broke the world record again after six months.
