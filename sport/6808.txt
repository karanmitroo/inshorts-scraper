Indian fast bowler Umesh Yadav on Friday said that captain Virat Kohli is already batting in the nets and is fit to bat against Australia in the Ranchi test. "Bandage will obviously remain after an injury. But I think he's fit to play. The way he's practising at the nets it seems he's all set to come back," said Yadav.
