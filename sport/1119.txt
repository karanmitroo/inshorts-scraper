All-rounder Ben Stokes has been named in England's squad for next month's T20 tri-series against Australia and New Zealand. Stokes had also been named in the ODI squad against Australia even though he remains unavailable for international selection as he waits to see if he will be charged following an incident outside a pub in Bristol on September 25.
