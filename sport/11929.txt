Former Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath criticised T20 leagues for spoiling cricketers, saying, "Sometimes, I see young cricketers reach a certain standard, all of a sudden they get paid good money and they stop work." The pacer added, "I think money should always be secondary. Ultimate goal should always be representing your country."
