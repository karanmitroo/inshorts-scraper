The International Basketball Federation has changed its rules to allow players to wear headgear during matches. The rules, which will come into effect from October 1, will now allow players to wear hijabs, which were previously disallowed on safety grounds. As per new rules, the headgear has to be black or white, or of the same colour as the uniform.
