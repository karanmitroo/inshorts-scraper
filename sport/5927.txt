Richard Branson-owned Virgin Comics created a superhero based on Sachin Tendulkar, who featured in comic books, animation and games. The superhero, named "The Master Blaster" wore a blue and gold armour with a sun across the chest and wielded a cricket bat. The comics were announced in 2007, with Sachin himself working closely with the creators to develop the character.
