Indian batsman Suresh Raina said that he was 'hurt' after getting dropped from the Indian team despite performing well. Raina, who last played for India in the T20 series against England in February last year, had failed to clear the Yo-Yo test. "I have to play the 2019 World Cup," Raina said while talking about his ambitions.
