World number 16 Nick Kyrgios has withdrawn from his quarter-final match against Roger Federer at the Indian Wells Masters citing food poisoning. Kyrgios tweeted before the match that he had "a restless night of being sick" and "needed to have my best chance" to play Federer. The Swiss player, who is automatically in the semis, said it "was a pity".
