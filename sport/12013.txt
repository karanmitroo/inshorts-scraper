Jamaica's Elaine Thompson completed the double of 100m and 200m Gold at the Rio Olympics on Thursday to become the world's fastest woman. This is also the first time a woman has completed a double since USA's Florence Griffith Joyner at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. Thompson clocked timings of 10.71 seconds and 21.78 seconds in 100m and 200m respectively.
