French forward Antoine Griezmann has revealed his goal celebration is a tribute to rapper Drake’s dance move in the song ‘Hotline Bling’. Griezmann scored a brace in Thursday’s Euro semi-final against Germany, and was seen gesturing with both hands to imitate a telephone while celebrating his goal. The player uses the celebration while playing for Atletico Madrid as well.
