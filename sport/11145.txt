Former captain Sourav Ganguly has said players like Virender Sehwag and Matthew Hayden have redefined batting in modern-day Test cricket. "You look at modern-day openers who are criticised for not scoring quickly. It was all started by Virender Sehwag and Mathew Hayden," said Ganguly. Sehwag said Ganguly was a captain who would strongly back his players.
