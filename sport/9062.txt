England's Joe Root was dismissed by a DRS review by India in both the innings of the Chennai Test. In England's second innings on Friday, the on-field umpire rejected Ravindra Jadeja's appeal following which India took a review, which was successfully given by the third umpire. In the first innings, Root fell on 88, caught behind on a Jadeja delivery.
