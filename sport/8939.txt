The Sports Ministry has derecognised yoga, 15 months after declaring it a 'priority sport'. The decision was communicated to National Sports Federations and the Sports Authority of India after the government concluded it will not be possible to conduct competitions. Yoga will now come under the prerogative of the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy).
