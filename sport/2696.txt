US Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a National Football League game on Sunday after some players knelt during the national anthem in a silent protest against police violence toward racial minorities. "I left because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem," Pence said on Twitter.
