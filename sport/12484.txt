Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has sought Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's intervention in the resolution of a property dispute involving a holiday resort in Mussoorie. The property, partially owned by Tendulkar's business partner Sanjay Narang, had allegedly breached the no-construction zone next to the DRDO's Institute of Technology Management.
