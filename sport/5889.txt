Former West Indies captain Brian Lara has suggested scrapping draws in Test cricket to  make the format stay relevant. "I would like to see results in every single Test match...You have 450 overs in five days, come up with some formula that can bring a win at the end," he said. Lara also said he was pro 20-over format.
