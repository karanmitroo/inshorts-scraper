The Janwaar Skating Park, India's first rural skate park, is a not-for-profit project that teaches village children skateboarding for free. It exists in Janwaar village in Bundelkhand and has been built by German community activist Ulrike Reinhard. The park allows children from the age of five only, on the condition that they attend school regularly, resulting in increase in attendance.
