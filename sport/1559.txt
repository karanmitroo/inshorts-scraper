A 12-foot-tall bronze sculpture of legendary Argentinian footballer Diego Maradona was unveiled at a club in Kolkata during his visit to the city. The statue features the 1986 World Cup-winning captain holding the trophy he helped Argentina win. The 57-year-old also gave out cheques to 11 cancer patients at the event, which was attended by around 1,000 people.
