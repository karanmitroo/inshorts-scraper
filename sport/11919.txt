The Court of Arbitration for Sport has upheld the ban imposed by the International Paralympic Committee on Russia, barring the nation's participation at September's Rio Paralympic Games over state-sponsored doping charges. The governing body added that the ruling was "proportionate in the circumstances". As a result of the ruling, at least 250 Russian competitors will miss the event.
