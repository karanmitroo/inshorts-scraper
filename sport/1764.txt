The BCCI's Chief Financial Officer Santosh Rangnekar has alleged that treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry issued multiple "death threats" to him. Rangnekar submitted a written statement to the Supreme Court narrating three separate incidents including being asked to take potassium cyanide by Chaudhry. The Supreme Court has given two weeks time to BCCI and Chaudhry to respond to the complaint by Rangnekar.
