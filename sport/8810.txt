Former Ultimate Fighting Champion Ronda Rousey was knocked out by Brazil's Amanda Nunes in 48 seconds in her bantamweight title fight on Saturday. Returning to UFC after a 13 months-long break, Rousey suffered her career's second knockout in the match's first round. Rousey had been knocked out by Holly Holm last year, following which she took a break from UFC.
