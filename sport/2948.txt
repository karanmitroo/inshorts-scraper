The International Cricket Council has launched an anti-corruption investigation into Sri Lanka Cricket after former cricketer Pramodya Wickramasinghe accused the national side of "unnatural match patterns" and player selections. The ICC's decision comes a day after 40 contracted Sri Lankan players signed a petition to SLC calling for an inquiry into Wickramasinghe's allegations.
