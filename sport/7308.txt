MS Dhoni, who was removed as the captain of IPL side Pune Supergiants, travelled alongside his Jharkhand teammates for the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Karnataka. In the last couple of seasons, Dhoni did not lead Jharkhand even though he was part of the side. Notably, Dhoni stepped down as the Indian limited-overs captain in January.
