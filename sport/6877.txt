Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara said that spinner Ravichandran Ashwin is always happy when Australian opener David Warner comes out to bat. In 12 Tests against Warner, Ashwin has dismissed the opener nine times, more than any other bowler Warner has faced. "So I always keep reminding [Warner] that Ash[win] is the one", Pujara said about his sledge aimed at Warner.
