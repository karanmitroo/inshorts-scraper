Sri Lankan cricketers have reportedly refused to visit Pakistan to play a T20I in Lahore on October 29. Around 40 Sri Lankan players have written to their board demanding a change of venue, while a meeting has been scheduled between players and ICC officials. Sri Lanka's team's bus was attacked in Lahore when the team last visited Pakistan in 2009.
