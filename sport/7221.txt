Netherlands' Li Jie and Japan's Hitomi Sato produced a 766-shot table tennis rally, lasting for ten minutes during an ITTF World Tour match. Because of the rally's length, the 'Expedite System' was instated. Under this rule, the server is forced to win every point of the remainder of the match in under 13 shots or they lose that particular point.
