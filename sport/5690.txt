India's lone individual Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra has said "there is hardly any time left to reap benefits of long-term planning" for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Abhinav said the possibility of making major changes was "remote" and that a comprehensive plan will be in place for the following editions. He is a part of the government-constituted Olympic task force.
