West Indies' T20 captain Darren Sammy has claimed he has been sacked by the selectors over a 30-second phone call. "They've reviewed the captaincy of T20 and I won't be captain anymore... [and] my performances have not merited selection in the squad," he added. The 32-year-old, who is a two-time World T20 winning captain, had replaced Chris Gayle in 2010.
