Australia's Adam Voges played a mistimed shot in the Hobart Test against South Africa on Tuesday which led to his dismissal at 2(17). Many reacted to the dismissal with tweets like, "Second best mannequin challenge award goes to Adam Voges." Voges misjudged a short-length Kyle Abbott delivery and held his bat in position, while the ball nicked straight towards gully.
