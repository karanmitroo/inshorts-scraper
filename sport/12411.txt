Former Manchester United player Ryan Giggs, who is a marquee player in the Premier Futsal League in India, has compared the sport to T20 cricket. “We have seen how Twenty20 format has brought younger people, a newer audience to cricket. Hopefully this will be the same for futsal because it is quick,” said Giggs, who plays for the Mumbai franchise.
