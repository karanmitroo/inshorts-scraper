The Indian cricket team will take part in the Independence Cup next year in Sri Lanka, following an agreement between the Prime Ministers of the two nations. Sri Lanka, who gained independence from colonial rule in 1948, will celebrate their 70th year of independence by hosting the four-nation cricket tournament, which also includes Pakistan and South Africa.
