Windies' cricketer Chris Gayle has won his defamation case against Australia's Fairfax Media after the articles published in 2016 alleging he exposed himself to a masseuse were found to be untrue. The masseuse, Leanne Russell, had given evidence last week that she had cried uncontrollably when Gayle pulled down his towel in front of her.
