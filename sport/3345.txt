Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar questioned the Indian cricket team's selection process saying that the "nice guys" should start getting different hairstyles and body art to get picked in the team. Gavaskar's comments come after India-Windies ODI series' highest scorer, Ajinkya Rahane, was not selected for first four of the five ODI matches against Sri Lanka.
