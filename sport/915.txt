Australian left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc produced a 142.2-kmph yorker to clean bowl England's Moeen Ali for 1 run during the second ODI in Brisbane on Friday. Moeen Ali was deceived by the late movement as he failed to block the ball, which rattled his stumps. Starc ended with figures of 10-0-59-4 as England won the match by four wickets.
