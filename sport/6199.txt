A letter claiming responsibility for the attack on German football club Borussia Dortmund's team bus on Tuesday has been found at the blast site. The police did not reveal who took responsibility but said its authenticity was being verified. The three explosions, described by Dortmund city's police chief as a "targeted attack", postponed the team's Champions League quarter-final against Monaco.
