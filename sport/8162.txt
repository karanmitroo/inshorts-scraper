Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath has said Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar sledged him during his career. "There is no bigger insult than saying to an Australian that he is a bad loser or a cheat...If we played India or Sri Lanka, they would say something to us but no one would see it...I was even sledged by Tendulkar," said McGrath.
