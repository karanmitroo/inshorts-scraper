Indian Olympic bronze-winning shooter Gagan Narang said that winning a medal at the Olympics is equivalent to winning the Nobel Prize in academics or a Fields Medal in Maths or an Oscar in films. "Am not sure how many of the critics in their life have attempted to win an Olympic medal, let alone won one," added Narang.
