Poland’s Tomasz Zieliński, who finished ninth in the 94-kg weightlifting at the 2012 London Olympics, will be awarded the bronze medal for the event, following dope retests. Six of eight lifters placed ahead of Zieliński tested positive in retests, with the gold medal going to the fifth-placed lifter. Incidentally, Zieliński was sent back from the recently-concluded Rio Olympics for doping.
