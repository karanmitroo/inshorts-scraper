Sachin Tendulkar visited Virender Sehwag's school in Haryana on Monday, where he interacted with the students. Talking about how to cope with failure, he said, "You should not be thinking about failures...you should be thinking about what you want to achieve...when I was not scoring enough runs, I spoke to my brother...It is all in the mind."
