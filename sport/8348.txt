The English cricket team has not won a bilateral ODI series on Indian soil since they defeated India 4-1 in 1984-85. The victory that came 32 years ago is England's sole ODI series win in India overall. While India has won the last four home ODI series against England, the series in 1993 and 2002 ended as drawn.
