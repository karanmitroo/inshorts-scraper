Former NBA player Vlade Divac sank a basketball shot from half-court after turning his back towards the basket, at a basketball clinic for kids. The 49-year-old, who used to play for Sacramento Kings, is now its General Manager. Kings' Twitter handle shared the video with the caption, "Vlade Dade he likes to party. Hits reverse half-court shots and surprises everybody."
