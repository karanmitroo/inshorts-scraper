Posting a selfie from a meeting with Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday, Virender Sehwag wrote on Twitter, "God ji ke Darshan in Delhi." Sachin, posting another picture, replied "Arre @virendersehwag, thodi der ruk jata to yeh photo use karleta. Always a joy to meet you!" Sehwag then replied to Sachin, saying, "Hamesha se hi jaldi me raha hoon God ji."
