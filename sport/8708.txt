Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has said he does not qualify to be BCCI President after reports emerged that he is likely to succeed Anurag Thakur as the chief. "My name is coming up unnecessarily. I don't qualify. I have just completed one year (as the Cricket Association of Bengal President) and have got two more years left," added Ganguly.
