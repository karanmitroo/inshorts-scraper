Australian pacer Mitchell Starc has said that Australia is wary of a comeback from Indian captain Virat Kohli. "We know he'll come back bigger and stronger, but he's one I'll take over Pujara at the moment", Starc said about the Indian duo he dismissed in the Pune Test. "One Test is not going to win us the series", Starc added.
