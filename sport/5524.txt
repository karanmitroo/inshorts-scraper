Jet Airways misspelt Rising Pune Supergiant player Ben Stokes' name on a boarding pass, writing "Strokes" instead of his actual surname. Stokes shared a picture of the boarding pass on Instagram captioned, "Typo", but the airline is yet to reply to the post. Stokes was flying from Delhi to Pune for his team's last match against Kings XI Punjab.
