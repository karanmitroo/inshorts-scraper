Former cricketer Virender Sehwag has claimed that ex-India captain Sourav Ganguly's sacrifice of his batting spot to give MS Dhoni a chance to bat higher up the order was one of the reasons behind the latter's success. Speaking about Ganguly's tendency to experiment with the batting order, Sehwag said, "Ganguly always believed in giving chances to new players."
