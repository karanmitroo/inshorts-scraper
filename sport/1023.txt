Saudi Arabia on Friday allowed women to attend a men's football match for the first time from a sports stadium. This comes after Saudi women were allowed in a stadium for National Day celebrations in a one-off event in September last year. Saudi women had long been barred from stadiums over rules on gender segregation in public.
