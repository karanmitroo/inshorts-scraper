Five-time Grand Slam winner Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova will be making her first Grand Slam appearance in over 18 months after being handed a wildcard invitation for the US Open's main draw. The 30-year-old Russian had returned from a 15-month doping ban earlier this year and was denied a wildcard at this year's French Open.
