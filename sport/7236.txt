Edinho, the son of Brazilian football great Pelé, surrendered to police on Friday after a court ruled he must serve almost 13 years of a 33-year drug-trafficking sentence, his lawyer stated. A former goalkeeper at Pelé's club Santos, Edinho was found guilty of drug trafficking and money laundering in 2005 but has been fighting the charges ever since.
