England opener Keaton Jennings, who scored a century on debut against India in the Mumbai Test on Thursday, was dropped on 0* by Karun Nair off an Umesh Yadav delivery. He went on to score 112(219) to become England's 19th Test centurion on debut. Incidentally, England's last three Test debut centurions, including Jennings, were born in South Africa.
