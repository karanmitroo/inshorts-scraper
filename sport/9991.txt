Inspired by wizard sport 'Quidditch' from the 'Harry Potter' series, a 'Quidditch Premier League' has been launched in the United Kingdom. The season, beginning in July 2017, will have eight teams competing for national champions title. In the sport, players on each team have a broom between their legs as they try to score points with three types of balls.
