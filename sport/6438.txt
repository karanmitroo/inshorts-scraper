Suresh Raina has reacted to claims of a former state coach, who said the former had become a "reluctant cricketer" after marriage. "Tabiyat kharaab thi, bhai, couldn't train properly and logon ne shuru kar diya...I had to miss out on cricket but circumstances were such...my health and my daughter's. If that leads to criticism, what can I say," said Raina.
