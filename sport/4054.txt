Italian club Inter Milan's French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia scored an own goal from near the halfway line in a pre-season friendly against Chelsea in the International Champions Cup on Saturday. The midfielder tried to pass the ball back to his goalkeeper with an aerial back pass, which went over his head bundling into the goal's left corner.
