Real Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo was subjected to homophobic chants by Barcelona supporters during the La Liga El Clásico in Barcelona on Saturday. The 98,000 Barça fans reportedly sang 'Cristiano come out of the closet' to the Madrid player. Ronaldo was earlier also homophobically abused during the Madrid derby in November when Atlético Madrid player Koke called him a f****t.
