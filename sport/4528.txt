Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal has said that if he reaches the Wimbledon 2017 final he would like to face a different opponent than seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer, as he has faced him enough times already this year. The Spaniard, who was beaten by Federer in the Australian Open 2017's final, is aiming to win his third Wimbledon title.
