Bihar MP Pappu Yadav's son Sarthak Ranjan has been selected for the Delhi T20 side despite not having played any competitive cricket this past season. The 21-year-old was picked ahead of under-23 top-scorer Hiten Dalal. Ranjan made his T20 debut in 2016, making 10 runs in three games, and played his only List A match last year against Himachal Pradesh.
