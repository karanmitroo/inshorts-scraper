Nineteen-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has revealed his family asked him to see a psychologist when he was 17. "There was a time when I used to throw my racket a lot and when I was 16, I was even chased off court because of it...I was so angry...From that moment on, my growth has been constant," said Federer.
