Spain's 16-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Rafael Nadal's uncle and former long-time coach Toni Nadal claims that Switzerland's Roger Federer is better than his nephew and is the world's best player. "Rafael [has] won 16 Majors, triumphed four times in Davis Cup, but Federer is better, he is the best," Toni said comparing the two rivals.
