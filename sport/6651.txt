BCCI has uploaded a video which shows Indian team players playing rugby with a cricket ball during a practice session ahead of the Dharamsala Test, which begins on Saturday. Spinner Kuldeep Yadav explained the warm-up session, which consisted of an "eight-pass modified rugby game" focussing on coordination between players and practicing underarm throwing.
