Indian spinner Pragyan Ojha has been dropped from the Bengal squad after Cricket Association of Bengal selectors "failed to establish contact" with him. Ojha, who played two seasons for Bengal, has not informed the board about his whereabouts and has not joined the training camp. The bowler wanted to return to the Hyderabad team but was not given an NOC.
