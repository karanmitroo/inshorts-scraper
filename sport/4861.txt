Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir on Sunday suggested Kashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to cross the border to "get better fireworks" after the Champions Trophy final between India and Pakistan. Congratulating the Pakistan team for its win, the Hurriyat leader had said there were fireworks all around after the match. Gambhir even sarcastically offered to help Farooq pack his bags.
