Bats with installed computerised chips will be used by players including Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane at the Champions Trophy in England. The chips, developed by Intel, will track the movement of the players and data collected will be used by coaches and players to improve their game. Reportedly, three players from each team will use the specially designed bat.
