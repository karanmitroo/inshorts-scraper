British transgender athlete, Lauren Jeska, has been given an 18-year jail sentence for attempting to murder a UK Athletics official after authorities threatened to strip her of her titles because she was born a male. Jeska stabbed the official multiple times in the head and neck after a dispute over whether she should be able to compete in women's races.
