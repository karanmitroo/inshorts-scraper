On being asked what he admired most about Roger Federer outside the tennis court, Rafael Nadal said, "I don't want to look like I'm going to be his boyfriend." Federer was set to meet Nadal for the first time at the US Open, but instead, Nadal will face one-time US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in the semis.
