Bangladeshi batsman Tamim Iqbal became the country's first player to register 5,000 runs in One Day International cricket, after reaching the landmark in the third ODI against England on Wednesday. The 27-year-old left-hander is also Bangladesh's leading run-scorer in the other two formats of the sport. Notably, only Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood have managed the feat for England.
