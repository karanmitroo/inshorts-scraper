French Ligue 1 match between Metz and Lyon had to be abandoned after one of the firecrackers, thrown at Lyon's goalkeeper Lopes, exploded next to him. The incident happened at the half-hour mark when a flare knocked Lopes to the ground and while he was being attended by the team doctor, another firework landed near him and exploded.
