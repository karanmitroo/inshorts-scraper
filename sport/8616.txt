MS Dhoni had a 30-minute long meeting with his Jharkhand team-mates on their Ranji Trophy campaign, just before the announcement of his resignation was made. The 35-year-old then played FIFA on PlayStation and went out for dinner with Jharkhand team later. Dhoni even went to the centre wicket for a range-hitting session after the end of the Ranji semi-final.
