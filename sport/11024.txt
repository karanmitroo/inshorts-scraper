Italian international Graziano Pell√® was removed from the squad and sent home after he refused to shake hands with the national coach Giampiero Ventura in Italy's World Cup qualifier match against Spain on Friday. The 31-year-old, who was "angry" after being substituted on the hour mark, later posted an apology on Instagram.
