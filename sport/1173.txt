England's Football Association has handed Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a three-match touchline ban on charges of foul language and bad behaviour towards match officials in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with West Brom in the Premier League last Sunday. Wenger will miss Arsenal's FA Cup tie against Nottingham Forest, the EFL semi-final first leg against Chelsea and a PL match against Bournemouth.
