The Pakistan Cricket Board has suspended pacer Mohammad Irfan from playing cricket for a year for his involvement in the spot-fixing scandal in the Pakistan Super League. The 34-year-old pacer's suspension can be reduced to six months if he agrees to the board's conditions, including paying a fine of Pakistani Rupee 10 lakh to the board.
