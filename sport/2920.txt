After his omission from the Indian squad for the last two ODIs against Australia, Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja shared a picture of himself with smoke around his mouth. Jadeja captioned it, "Had a really great 'Night Out' last night, according to my police report.#rajputboy." Jadeja, who did not play a single match against Australia, has been replaced by Axar Patel.
