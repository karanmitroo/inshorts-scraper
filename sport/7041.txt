A video posted by BCCI highlights the difference between the style of spin bowling of Australia's Nathan Lyon and India's Ravichandran Ashwin. The video shows that Lyon is able to generate more bounce than Ashwin as he uses his body weight to create a more effective pivot. Ashwin, who primarily employs finger spin, generates lesser revolutions on the ball.
