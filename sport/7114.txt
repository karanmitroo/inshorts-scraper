As per reports, Team India's support staff have refused a 25% salary hike since it fell below their expectations. The staff was reportedly promised a 100% hike by former President Anurag Thakur, but BCCI CEO Rahul Johri offered a lower raise. Batting coach Sanjay Bangar is reportedly working at the same pay at which he was appointed three years ago.
