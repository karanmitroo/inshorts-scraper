England's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan praised MS Dhoni stating that his leadership in the 2011 Cricket World Cup was exceptional. "MS is a very, very good captain... His records speak for itself," he added. Morgan further said that Virat Kohli will find it easy to adapt to limited-overs captaincy as he has been India's Test captain for a while now.
