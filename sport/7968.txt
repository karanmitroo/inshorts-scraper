MS Dhoni has alleged that mobile firm Maxx Mobilink is using his name and projecting him as brand ambassador, despite their contract being terminated in 2012. In a 2014 order, the Delhi High Court had directed the company to "refrain from selling any products" using Dhoni's name. Dhoni also alleged the company had defaulted on paying the cricketer his dues.
