Team India got the local caterer removed and hired an Indian restaurant to get non-breakfast meals in the dressing room at Centurion and Johannesburg during their South Africa tour. Non-breakfast meals included chicken rezala, lamb, dal makhani, palak paneer, goli masala, khurmani tikka and butter naan. A local caterer said that it never had issues with other visiting teams.
