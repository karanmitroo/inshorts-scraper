Indian opener Rohit Sharma scored a consecutive ODI century against Sri Lanka on Thursday, the third time he achieved the feat in ODI cricket. Sharma is now the sixth highest century-scorer among Indians with 13 tons. His other consecutive tons came against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 2010 tri-series, followed by back-to-back tons against Australia last year.
