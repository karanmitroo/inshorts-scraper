Real Madrid defender Nacho Fernandez scored a scissor kick goal against third-division side Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. In the 69th-minute, Nacho converted James Rodr√≠guez's right-wing cross just inside the area, prompting astonishment from teammates. Coach Zinedine Zidane later said that the goal was better than his volley in 2002's Champions League final for Real Madrid.
