Manchester United's Bastian Schweinsteiger trained with the first team on Monday for the first time this season. "He's a big influence...It's a great boost for us, the experience...the quality that he brings," said United's defender Luke Shaw. Schweinsteiger last featured for United as a 70th-minute substitute at Manchester City in a 1-0 win in March, and has been excluded since.
