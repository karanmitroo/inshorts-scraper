England football team manager Sam Allardyce was sacked from his position after just one match in charge, following Daily Telegraph's sting investigation which shows Allardyce offering advice on how to "get around" transfer rules. Allardyce, who has been temporarily replaced by Gareth Southgate, is alleged to have used his role to negotiate a deal worth $520,000 to represent a firm.
