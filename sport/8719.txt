The Sports Ministry has said that 41 of 48 National Sports Federations risk losing government funding since they are non-compliant with Ministry guidelines. The defaulting federations failed to disclose information regarding day-to-day operations on their websites, which is mandatory under the RTI Act. The Ministry has set a deadline of March 31, after which their recognitions would be reviewed.
