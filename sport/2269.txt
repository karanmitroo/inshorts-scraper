A Delhi court has ordered an FIR against Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who was part of a complaint by a homebuyer who had invested in a housing project in Gurugram. The project was named after the Russian but the construction never took off. The homebuyer said the builders had attracted buyers by advertising the project as 'Ballet by Sharapova'.
