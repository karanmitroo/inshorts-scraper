Pakistan's suspended batsman Khalid Latif, who has been charged with spot-fixing, refused to appear before Pakistan Cricket Board's Anti-Corruption Unit in Lahore. Khalid had approached the Lahore High Court earlier to challenge PCB's authority of appointing an anti-corruption tribunal to hear the spot-fixing cases. Khalid was allegedly involved in the spot-fixing scandal in Pakistan Super League.
