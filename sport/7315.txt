Australian opening batsman David Warner was bowled by Indian spinner Jayant Yadav, only to get a reprieve because the umpire called it a no-ball as Yadav had overstepped by almost a foot. The ball reached the boundary after hitting the stumps, thereby giving five runs to the Australian team. Warner was later bowled by Umesh Yadav.
