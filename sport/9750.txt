Virat Kohli's alleged 'ball tampering' case is not being probed by the ICC since the footage that has emerged is older than the stipulated time period. As per rules, an offence has to be reported by the ICC CEO within five days or umpires within 48 hours. Kohli's ball-tampering video is from the Rajkot Test, which began on November 9.
