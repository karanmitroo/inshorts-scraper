Former Australian cricketer and commentator, Mark Nicholas was rushed to a hospital in Melbourne after having complained of abdominal pain during the first day of the Boxing Day Test between Pakistan and Australia. The 59-year-old commentator, whose commentating career has spanned nearly two decades, was carried off on a stretcher and was later declared to be in a stable condition.
