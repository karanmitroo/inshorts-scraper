Gujarat Lions' Andrew Tye picked up a hat-trick against Rising Pune Supergiant on Friday, becoming the first debutant to take a five-for and a hat-trick in the Indian Premier League. This was also the first instance of two hat-tricks on the same day in IPL, as RCB's Samuel Badree had taken a hat-trick against MI in the evening match.
