India and Pakistan were playing an ODI on October 31, 1984, in Pakistan's Sialkot, which was called off midway following Indira Gandhi's assassination. India had made 210/3 in their 40 overs, when the city's Deputy Commissioner announced that Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq had ordered the match be cancelled. Reportedly, Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri broke down upon hearing the news.
