Cricket Australia has reportedly offered a multi-year deal to a few players in order to make them skip the IPL. CA reportedly discussed the deal with captain Steve Smith, David Warner, Mitchell Starc, among other players, who found the deal to be underwhelming. Smith and Warner already earn $1 million annually from the IPL, with their pay expected to rise.
