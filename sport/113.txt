Former Pakistani all-rounder Shahid Afridi, who turns 38 today, smashed the then fastest ODI hundred off 37 balls with Sachin Tendulkar's bat against Sri Lanka in 1996. Afridi had revealed that former Pakistani pacer Waqar Younis had given him Sachin's bat during net practice before the match. Incidentally, the innings was Afridi's first in international cricket.
