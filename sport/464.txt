After the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Olympics were threatened by a lack of snow, the Austrian army transported 50,000 cubic yards of snow to the skiing slopes from nearby snow-capped mountains. The soldiers packed snow in baskets without the use of machines and also carried 20,000 ice blocks to tracks. Austria was suffering from its mildest February in over 60 years.
