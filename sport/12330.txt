The Estádio Milton Corrêa stadium in Macapá, Brazil has a half line which is aligned with the Earth's equatorial line, dividing the ground into two hemispheres instead of just two halves. Since the zero latitude​ line passes horizontally across the stadium, the locals call the stadium the 'Zerão', which translates to “the Big Zero”.
