WWE on Sunday signed Shadia Bseiso, its first female performer from an Arab nation. Bseiso, who hails from Jordan, is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist. "Female athletes are finally getting credit they deserve. The world is more open to that, and in terms of how the region will react to it, I'm hoping it's going to be very positive," said Bseiso.
