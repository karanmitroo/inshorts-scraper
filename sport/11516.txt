Neeraj Pandey, the director of the upcoming Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer biopic on MS Dhoni, has revealed that he is not a Dhoni fan. "I am not a fan of Dhoni. I like AB de Villiers and Sachin Tendulkar. But I am not a fan of these players as well. Dhoni also knows that I am not his fan," said Pandey.
