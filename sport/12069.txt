Indian Test captain Virat Kohli expressed his displeasure over the backlash Indian athletes in Rio are receiving over their failure to win medals. “These guys give 100% effort in what they do. Some people don’t even have 10% facilities that sportsmen from other countries have. For people to just ignore what they do, I think it's very hurtful,” said Kohli.
