Australian captain Steve Smith said he suffered a "bit of a brain fade" when he looked towards the dressing room to consult his DRS review during the Bengaluru Test on Tuesday. "I got hit on the pad and looked towards the non-striker batsman and then turned around towards Paddy. I should not have done that," said Smith.
