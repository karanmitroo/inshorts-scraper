The Court of Arbitration for Sport has rejected the appeal filed by the Russian Olympic Committee against the suspension of the country's track and field athletes from Rio Olympics. The suspension was imposed after reports found evidence of widespread doping in Russian sports. Further, the IOC is considering banning all Russian players from the Olympics following reports of state-sponsored doping.
