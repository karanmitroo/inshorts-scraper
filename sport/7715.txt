Spinner Kuldeep Yadav has replaced Amit Mishra in the India squad for the one-off Test against Bangladesh, starting in Hyderabad from February 9. Kuldeep, who is yet to play a Test for India, took a five-wicket haul against England A in a warm-up match at Mumbai in January. Mishra sustained a knee injury during the last T20I match against England.
