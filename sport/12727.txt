Yoshiro Mori, ex-Japanese Prime Minister, has warned the country’s Rio-bound athletes to sing the national anthem clearly, or be considered unfit to represent the country. “If you won’t sing the national anthem, then you can’t consider yourselves representatives of Japan,” Mori said at a sendoff organised for the Olympic participants, after the athletes sung the national anthem unenthusiastically.
