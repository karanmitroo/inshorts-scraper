BCCI posted a video of cricketers Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya and Ravichandran Ashwin taking commentator Ravi Shastri's #TracerBulletChallenge. The Challenge requires the players to imitate Shastri's commentary with the phrase "like a tracer bullet". In the video, Virat says, "Ravi bhai, I don't think anybody can match up to your level of 'tracer bullet', but I'll give it a go."
