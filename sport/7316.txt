Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon has played down Harbhajan Singh's prediction of a 4-0 whitewash for Australia in the upcoming Test series. "Good luck to him. Everyone has his opinion," said Lyon. "As an Australian team, we are worried about our processes. We are not worried about what everyone believes and thinks about this team," added Lyon.
