BCCI intervened and cut short Indian captain Virat Kohli's first official media interaction after the appointment of Ravi Shastri as the team's head coach. The media interaction, which was the last before the team left for the Sri Lanka tour on Wednesday, was supposed to be 15 minutes long but was cut short to 10 minutes.
