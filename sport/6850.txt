Australian media has slammed the pitch of Ranchi's JSCA Stadium through a mock online quiz. The quiz, titled "Quiz: The Ranchi dirt track challenge", has been posted on The Daily Telegraph's website, besides other publications, and pokes fun at Virat Kohli. The media has also accused India of pitch doctoring, calling Indian cricket being "on the brink of complete embarrassment."
