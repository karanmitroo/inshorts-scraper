An iguana invaded a tennis court and halted an ATP World Tour match at the Miami Open on Wednesday. The reptile was sitting on the scoreboard when German player Tommy Haas took a selfie with it, before it crawled onto the court and ran to the opposite baseline. Officials tried shooing it with towels before it was finally taken away.
