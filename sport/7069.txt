Tennis player Sania Mirza has revealed she is in talks with filmmakers for a Bollywood movie on her life. In an interview, Sania said, "There are talks going on, but there's nothing concrete right now. I'm a private person, so it is a difficult ask of me to open up." The player released her autobiography 'Aces Against Odds' last year.
