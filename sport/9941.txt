Sports Minister Vijay Goel mistakenly tweeted on Wednesday that the Tokyo Olympics will be held in 2017 instead of 2020. The tweet, which was later deleted, read, "Ministry is working keeping in mind that Tokyo Olympics is happening next year so we plan to prepare in next months the team selection, their coaching, Indian coach, foreign coach and other things."
