Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has said Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli should "look himself in the mirror" following his poor form in the IPL this year. "He has got to say to himself that he is the captain...he should work himself with proper shots," said Gavaskar. Kohli has scored 245 runs in eight matches in the IPL this year.
