Rising Pune Supergiant player MS Dhoni has set the record for most IPL finals reached by a player, with the 2017 final against Mumbai Indians being his seventh in ten seasons. This is also his first as a non-captain, after having led Chennai Super Kings in six finals. Dhoni has won the title twice with CSK, in 2010 and 2011.
