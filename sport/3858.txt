At least two athletes staying at a hotel in London, where they were due to compete at the World Championships, were forced to withdraw from their respective events due to an outbreak of gastroenteritis. The organisers of the event have ordered a floor in one of the hotels used by the athletes to be quarantined due to the outbreak.
