Responding to criticism over her run-out dismissal in the Women's World Cup final loss against England, India Women captain Mithali Raj said that her shoe's spike had got stuck in the ground. "Before I reached the halfway mark, this thing happened...I couldn't push myself hard...I was helpless. I was gutted," Mithali said. She was run-out for 17 off 31 balls.
