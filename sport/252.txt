Twenty-three-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams has said she almost died after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia, last year. Williams revealed she underwent multiple surgeries and was bedridden for six weeks after the delivery due to series of complications, which included pulmonary embolism. "If it weren't for...professional care, I wouldn't be here today," she added.
