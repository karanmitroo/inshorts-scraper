Football agent Mino Raiola, who negotiated three transfers for Manchester United, earned more this window than what the world's highest-paid footballer, Cristiano Ronaldo, does at Real Madrid. Raiola reportedly made over £30 million (₹266 crore) negotiating Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s transfers. Ronaldo receives £17.7 million (₹157 crore) each season at Real Madrid.
