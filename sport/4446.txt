Nottinghamshire fast bowler Luke Fletcher was hit on the head after Warwickshire batsman Sam Hain played a straight drive in the NatWest T20 Blast on Saturday. Fletcher went down to the ground holding his head, while teammates rushed to him. He was later led from the field and admitted to hospital, while play was suspended for over half an hour.
