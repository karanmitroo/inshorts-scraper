Former world number one women's tennis player Monica Seles was stabbed on court during a match in 1993. The then 19-year-old Yugoslav was attacked in the back during a timeout with a nine-inch blade by Gunter Parche, who was obsessed with Seles' rival Steffi Graf. Seles, who celebrates her 43rd birthday on December 3, returned to tennis after two years.
