Following their five-wicket win over Australia in the third ODI, India, already number one in the Test format, dislodged South Africa to become the sole number one ODI team as well. This is the first time they are number one in the two formats simultaneously since ICC introduced rankings in 2002. Notably, India are currently 5th in T20I rankings.
