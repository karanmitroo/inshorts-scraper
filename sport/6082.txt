Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday defeated Kings XI Punjab by 5 runs in the Indian Premier League, helped by Bhuvneshwar Kumar's five-for. Batting first, SRH put up 159/6, powered by opener David Warner's unbeaten 54-ball 70. In reply, opener Manan Vohra's 95(50), his highest score in IPL, went in vain as Kumar helped SRH defend the target with figures of 5/19.
