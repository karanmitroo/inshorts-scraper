As per reports, the BCCI will ask former cricketer Virender Sehwag to "keep his mouth shut" if he is made coach of the Indian cricket team. "Our fear is that he would just say, 'so what', if India loses a match or a series. That would surely ruffle the feathers of important people," a BCCI official was quoted as saying.
