American weightlifter Ray Williams became the first person to squat above 1,000 lbs in powerlifting, completing a 456 kg (1,005.3 lbs) raw squat at the USA Powerlifting Raw Nationals in Georgia. Williams attempted the squat wearing a weightlifting belt and knee sleeves without a squat suit, which complies with the "raw" standards of the International Powerlifting Federation.
