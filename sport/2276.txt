French club Marseille defender Patrice Evra was sent off for kicking a fan of his own team during the warm up before a Europa League match against Portuguese side Vitoria. The 36-year-old former Manchester United player, who was named as substitute, reportedly kicked the fan in reaction to the taunts directed at him and was ushered away by his teammate.
