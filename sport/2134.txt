Fans of US football team 'Ohio State' on Saturday trolled Apple over its autocorrect bug during a game against the Michigan State. While chanting "Ohio", the fans held giant cards to form the letter 'A[?]'. This comes after users reported that an iOS 11.1 bug autocorrected the letter 'I' to the letter 'A' along with a Unicode character.
