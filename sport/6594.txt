Commentator Harsha Bhogle took a dig at Australian media who have been criticising Indian pitches and Virat Kohli since the start of Australia's tour. Bhogle listed positives from the Dharamsala Test and mocked Aussie media saying "wonder what the tabloids will search for now" to criticise about the Test. Australian newspapers had also accused Indian curators of "pitch doctoring".
