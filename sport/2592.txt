Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja slammed 201 for Saurashtra against Jammu and Kashmir in the Ranji Trophy on Sunday, claiming his fifth 200-plus score and eighth hundred in first-class cricket. Prior to this, Jadeja's last three first-class cricket centuries were all triple-hundreds, with the last of them coming in 2012. Jadeja's 201 helped Saurashtra amass 624/7 in less than 2 days.
