The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Thursday announced that it will be distributing over $500 million to the national bodies over the 2017-2020 period. These funds, officially called 'Olympic Solidarity 2017-2020 Quadrennial Plan', represent a share of the broadcast revenue generated from the Rio Games and the 2018 Winter Games, and will be used for the development of athletes.
