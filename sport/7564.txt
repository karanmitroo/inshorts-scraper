Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag has revealed that former Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was the bowler he feared the most. Sehwag cited that Muralitharan was difficult to face because of his bowling action as well as the length at which he bowled. The Sri Lankan spinner got the better of Sehwag on three occasions during his Test career.
