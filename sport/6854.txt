Commenting on the Monkeygate scandal during India's tour to Australia in 2007-08, Sourav Ganguly recently said "only a Sardarji will know what Harbhajan tried to say" to Andrew Symonds. "The Monkeygate chapter will not have its true picture in the book (Michael Clarke's autobiography)...I was standing right there when Harbhajan spoke to Symonds...I know what he meant," said Ganguly.
