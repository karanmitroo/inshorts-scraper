US-based Formula One team 'Haas F1 Team' has signed Indian racer Arjun Maini as a development driver. The 19-year-old won Force India's 'One in a Billion' Indian driver talent competition in 2011, following which he moved to Europe and subsequently raced in GP3 support series. The development drivers will attend races, while also taking part in the team's simulator program.
