Three people were shot dead by unidentified gunmen during a football match in Mexico on Friday. Spectators and players fled the stadium as gunmen chased three men on the pitch before taking them to a nearby alley and shooting them. The shooting took place in Acapulco,  a coastal, crime-infested city in southwestern Mexico.
