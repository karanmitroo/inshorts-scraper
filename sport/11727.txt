As per reports, wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt’s 2012 London Olympics bronze medal may get upgraded to gold, after winner Toghrul Asgarov from Azerbaijan reportedly failed doping retests. Earlier, Dutt had tweeted his medal was upgraded to silver after late Russian wrestler Besik Kudukhov’s samples tested positive for banned substances. The upgrade, however, would be subject to Dutt passing dope retests.
