Russia's Daniil Medvedev, who knocked out Stanislas Wawrinka from Wimbledon 2017, is set to be fined for accusing the officials of bias by throwing loose change towards the chair umpire in his Wimbledon second round exit. Medvedev later said that he would like to apologise to chair umpire Mariana Alves personally if he sees her.
