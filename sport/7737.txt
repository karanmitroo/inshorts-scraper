Soon after the announcement of Alastair Cook's resignation as England Test captain, Kevin Pietersen asked for his return to the national side, tweeting, "#BringBackKP". Pietersen, who last played a Test against Australia in Sydney back in January 2014, was ousted from the team due to differences with the team management, including the former captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower.
