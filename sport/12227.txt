Former India captain Sourav Ganguly criticised the West Indies Cricket Board for holding the Caribbean Premier League alongside the Test series against India. Ganguly was unhappy with the absence of senior players like Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo, owing to the CPL. “They will get $2,000 to play for WI, while $1 million to play the T20 leagues,” said Ganguly.
