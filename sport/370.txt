Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma, who went unsold at the IPL auction last month, will play county cricket for Sussex from April 4 to June 4. The 29-year-old pacer will become the third Indian cricketer after MAK Pataudi and Piyush Chawla to represent Sussex in the county circuit. Earlier, Cheteshwar Pujara, who also went unsold at IPL auction, joined Yorkshire.
