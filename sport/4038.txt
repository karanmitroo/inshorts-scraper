In response to BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filing a petition in the Supreme Court seeking the e-auction of IPL media rights, BCCI has said that "cricket is not coal". Swamy argued that India had seen the coal and spectrum allocation scams due to non-transparency, and cricket carried equal economic value. BCCI has said e-auction will lead to a revenue loss.
