Former cricketer Michael Hussey on Thursday said the opposition teams can take Virat Kohli lightly during the Champions Trophy at their own peril. "[A]nyone who wants to write him off in this tournament will probably have to eat humble pie!" said Hussey. "You can't keep a gun player down for long...he will be determined to show...his class again," added Hussey.
