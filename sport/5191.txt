A 19-second clip of England cricketers Charles Fry and Kumar Ranjitsinhji from 1901 has been restored in Australia. The clip, reported to be among the oldest cricket films to be preserved and restored, shows the two engaging in an informal session at their county team Sussex's ground. The clip comprises 465 individual images and was purchased from a UK collector.
