A depleted Barcelona side suffered a 0-2 defeat at MÃ¡laga in the La Liga on Saturday, missing the opportunity to go top of the table, level on points with Real Madrid. Barcelona forward Neymar was sent off in the 65th minute after receiving two yellow cards following a first-half strike from ex-Barcelona forward Sandro Ramirez that put the hosts ahead.
