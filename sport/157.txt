After naming Ravichandran Ashwin as captain of Kings XI Punjab, the team's director of cricket Virender Sehwag revealed the management had also considered Yuvraj Singh's name. Adding that he wanted a bowler to lead the side, Sehwag said, "Yuvraj is a great friend, but in cricketing matters, you keep friendships aside and we felt Ashwin will be a great leader."
