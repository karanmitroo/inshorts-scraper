Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic withdrew mid-game from his Mexico Open match against American Donald Young on Wednesday, citing "unbearable heat" when the temperature was 27Â°C. Tomic had lost the first set before quitting the game and later returned for a doubles fixture in the evening. Previously, the player had retired from matches, quitting four ATP fixtures last year itself.
