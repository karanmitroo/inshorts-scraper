Cricketer Yuvraj Singh trolled former pacer Zaheer Khan's rumoured girlfriend, actress Sagarika Ghatge, on Twitter on Thursday. Sharing a poster of Sagarika's recently-released film, Yuvraj wrote he remembered her from the days when she "dated a vice-captain of the Indian team and good choice not do it in real life". Sagarika was shown dating a cricketer in 'Chak De! India'.
