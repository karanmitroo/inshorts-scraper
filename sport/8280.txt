Swiss tennis player and world number four Stan Wawrinka smashed the ball at his opponent Martin Kli≈æan's groin in the Australian Open on Monday. Wawrinka immediately crossed the net to apologise to his opponent, who was visibly hurt. "I just wanted to make sure he was OK...I'm sorry I touched him in the wrong place," said Wawrinka.
