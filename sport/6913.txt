Former Australian skipper Michael Clarke met underprivileged children at a slum in Delhi on Friday and played cricket with them. Posting a picture from the interaction, Clarke tweeted, "Awesome to meet these young boys and girls. Glad I could be here today and hopefully make a difference through sport." He also participated in a question-answer session with the children.
