Brazilian forward Neymar Jr says that his penalty kick, the final kick of the shootout, at the Rio Olympics was the most nervous moment of his life. The Barcelona forward converted the penalty kick to hand Brazil its first-ever soccer Olympic gold medal, winning 5-4 on penalties after the game in August ended 1-1 after extra time.
