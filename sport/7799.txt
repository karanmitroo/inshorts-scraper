Teams competing in the ICC Champions Trophy in June will be blood-tested for doping as per World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines. This is the first time when cricketers' blood samples will be taken, with earlier tests being conducted on urine samples. Cricketers will be issued athlete biological passports, a blood profile of the player which will later be used for reference.
