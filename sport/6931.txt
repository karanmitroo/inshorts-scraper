Barcelona-based Jaume Almera Institute of Earth Sciences, located near the Camp Nou, measured a 1.0 tremor on the Richter scale after Sergi Roberto's goal, which sealed Barcelona's historic comeback win against PSG in the Champions League. Notably, humans are able to typically detect earthquakes which measure 3.0 or greater on the Richter scale.
