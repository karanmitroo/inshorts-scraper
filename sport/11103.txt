Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh has said Lodha Panel's 'too much interference' would kill cricket. "Why should you object to BCCI giving funds to State Boards which are the Nurseries of Cricket? No doubt BCCI functioning needed to be looked into but with due respect to Justice Lodha his too much interference would kill Cricket," Singh tweeted.
