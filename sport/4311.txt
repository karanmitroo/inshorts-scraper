Indian female cueist Keerath Bhandaal has said it is "disgraceful" to receive â‚¹5,000 for a national title, which is five times less than the amount male cueists get. Bhandaal further said that many female cueists are "on their own" despite representing India for a long period. "Prize money...has a sentimental value...They might as well not pay us," added Bhandaal.
