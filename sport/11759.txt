Badminton coach Pullela Gopichand, who's coached Olympic medallists Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, said he felt lucky he wasn't good in studies, since it let him continue with sports. "My brother was a state champion, went to IIT and stopped playing. I wrote the engineering exam and failed, but continued in sports. This is where I stand now," said Gopichand.
