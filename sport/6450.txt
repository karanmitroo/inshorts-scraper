A footage of an armless 13-year-old kid, named Jamarion Styles, shows him scoring two three-point shots in a basketball match during a local school championship. Styles, who lost his arms as an infant due to a bacterial infection, said that he also plays drums and that scoring those three-pointers in the match was "a good feeling."
