England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who scored his Test career's sixth hundred against Windies on Friday, described the moment of getting dropped by Shannon Gabriel at 98 as a "brain fart". "I'm not quite sure what I was thinking...But to do well you need luck every now and then," he added. Stokes was dropped when he was on nine as well.
