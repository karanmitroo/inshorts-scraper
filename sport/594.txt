Prithvi Shaw, who led India to their record fourth Under-19 World Cup title on Saturday, has won all the 11 matches he has captained India U-19 in. With this, Shaw equalled Virat Kohli's record of winning most matches in a 100% win record as captain in Youth ODIs. Kohli had led India to Under-19 World Cup title in 2008.
