Following Australia's loss in the fourth Test on Tuesday, Australian captain Steve Smith offered the Indian captain Ajinkya Rahane and the Indian team to join them for a beer in the dressing room. The Australian skipper also criticised BCCI for releasing a commentary-free version of the verbal spat between India's Ravindra Jadeja and Australia's Matthew Wade.
