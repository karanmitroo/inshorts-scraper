Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes, known for his acrobatic fielding, praised a ball boy who took a one-handed catch while sitting near the boundary in the first ODI between India and New Zealand on Sunday. "Even the ball boys in Mumbai are brilliant catchers #whatacatch," tweeted Rhodes after witnessing the ball boy's catch.
