A front foot no ball cost South Africa's Temba Bavuma a wicket off his first ever delivery in international cricket. The player was denied his first wicket again when Hashim Amla dropped Josh Hazlewood in the slips. Bavuma finally picked up his first wicket in international cricket after getting Hazlewood caught at short mid-wicket.
