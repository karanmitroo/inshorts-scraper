Two men dressed up as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump crashed the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea on Friday. The impersonators posed for selfies and were later escorted out by the security staff. "We (just) wanted to surprise everyone and bring world peace," said the lookalike of Kim Jong-un.
