Footage of Indian captain Virat Kohli applying saliva to the ball with mint in his mouth, during the Rajkot Test against England, has surfaced online. As per cricket laws, a fielder may polish a ball "provided that no artificial substance is used". Notably, South African captain Faf du Plessis was on Tuesday fined 100% match fees for a similar offence.
