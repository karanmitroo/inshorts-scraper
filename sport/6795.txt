Former Australian bowler Brett Lee, while commentating in the Ranchi Test, pointed out that Pat Cummins has the middle finger of his right hand cut off by a centimeter. As a kid, Cummins' sister had slammed a door on his finger and the injury sustained was so severe that doctors had to amputate the tip of his finger.
