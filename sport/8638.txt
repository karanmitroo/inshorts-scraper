Australian batsman Usman Khawaja celebrated his half-century against Pakistan at the SCG by 'dabbing', a gesture that involves simultaneously dropping the head while raising an arm and elbow. Dabbing as a celebratory gesture has gone viral after being popularized by US athletes and rappers. Khawaja went on to remain unbeaten on 79 at the time of Australia's declaration.
