Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav will not participate at the Rio Olympics after getting a four-year ban from the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) for doping. The decision comes after World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal against the clean chit given to him. "The CAS panel did not accept the argument... that he was victim of sabotage", an official release read.
