Fifteen-year-old Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova beat her teammate and two-time world champion Evgenia Medvedeva to win gold at the ongoing PyeongChang Winter Olympics. Zagitova is competing as a neutral "Olympic Athlete From Russia", since the country has been banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics. She is the first Russian to win a Winter Olympic event since the 2014 Games.
