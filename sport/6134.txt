Gujarat Lions' captain Suresh Raina took a one-handed catch at first slip to dismiss Rising Pune Supergiant's Ajinkya Rahane for a duck off Praveen Kumar's bowling on Friday. Rahane had tried to hit the ball towards the third-man, but instead offered a thick outside edge which Raina caught using his left hand before falling on his back.
