Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has said that Pakistan lacks talented players in the country. “There is no talent in Pakistan. I am centrally contracted so cannot talk about certain things or I will get a notice at my house tomorrow. I will tell you a lot more (on how players are selected) when I retire one day,” said Afridi.
