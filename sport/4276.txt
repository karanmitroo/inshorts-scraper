Reacting to Zimbabwe's recent ODI series win against Sri Lanka, Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin said results like these are "very healthy for the game". "Tomorrow Afghanistan may beat someone...so that's the way the sport needs to (go)," added the 30-year-old. Ashwin is part of the India squad which will play its first full series in Sri Lanka after eight years.
