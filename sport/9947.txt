MSK Prasad, chairman of the Indian cricket team's selection panel, has revealed that the national selectors are now also a part of the process for picking the playing eleven for the international matches. Earlier, the playing eleven was selected by the captain, the coach and the vice-captain, while the selectors' job was to solely select the squad for the tournaments.
