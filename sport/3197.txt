Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has revealed his new tattoo, an image of his wife Antonella Rocuzzo's lips, inked above his groin. The 30-year-old showed off the tattoo on social media after netting a hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-0 win against Espanyol in the La Liga last Saturday. The couple got married on June 30 this year in Messi's hometown of Rosario.
