Chinaman, in layman's term, is considered to be a leg-spin delivery by a left-arm bowler. While an orthodox leg-spin delivery turns away from a right-handed batsman, a chinaman delivery brings the ball back to the right-handed batsman. Also known as left-arm unorthodox spin, a chinaman delivery usually turns sharply owing to the spin imparted by the wrist.
