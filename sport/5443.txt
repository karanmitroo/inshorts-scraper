In a letter addressed to Anil Kumble asking for revision of Ranji match fees, Harbhajan Singh has revealed Ranji players earn one-tenth of what an Indian Test cricketer is paid as match fees. While an Indian player gets ₹15 lakh for a Test, Ranji cricketers earn ₹1.5 lakh per match. Harbhajan added Ranji fees had not been revised since 2004.
