English left-arm spinner Monty Panesar has compared Australia's Steve O'Keefe to a Korean car. "When I first saw him, he asked me: 'what do you think of my spin bowling?' I said to him, 'you're like a Hyundai i30," said Panesar in a recent interview. "You're very much unassuming. You're reliable," Panesar further told the Aussie bowler.
