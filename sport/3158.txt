Stephane Cottalorda, India's first foreign coach for women boxers, resigned within a month of taking over due to delay in salary payment and lack of professionalism in the Boxing Federation of India. "None of you would take the risk of crossing the earth with his family by not having any guarantee on his future," the Frenchman wrote in his resignation.
