The ICC has appointed Richie Richardson as match referee for the Pakistan-World XI T20 series in September. This will be the first time since 2009 that an ICC match official will oversee cricket in Pakistan. Zimbabwe's 2015 tour was the only international tour in Pakistan since the 2009 attack on Sri Lanka team, but it was officiated by local officials.
