Indian pacer Javagal Srinath, in the 1999 Delhi Test, deliberately bowled wide off the stumps to avoid taking a wicket when Pakistan team was nine down. Anil Kumble, who had claimed all nine wickets, went on to become only the second bowler in history to take all ten wickets in an innings. Notably, Srinath was born on August 31, 1969.
