Buli Basumatary, a two-time gold medallist at the National Senior Archery Championship, has reportedly been selling oranges in Assam since three years to earn a living. The archer, who quit the sport in 2010 following sickness, had failed to get a job in Assam police. However, Assam's Sports Minister has now said Buli will be appointed as an archery coach.
