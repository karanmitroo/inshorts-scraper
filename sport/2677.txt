Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden smashed the then highest individual Test score of 380, in 10 hours and 22 minutes against Zimbabwe on October 10, 2003. Hayden broke former West Indian batsman Brian Lara's record of 375 runs, which was established in 1994. Hayden's record was broken again by Brian Lara, who smashed Test cricket's only 400 in April 2004.
