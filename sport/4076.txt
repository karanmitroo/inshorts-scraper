Artist Bingo Rimer painted Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic's image on a 1,000 Swedish krona note. Ibrahimovic posed with an enlarged version of the note on Instagram, captioned, "You have Benjamin Franklin and you have me", referring to the American statesman whose image is printed on USA's $100 note. Notably, the 1,000 Swedish krona note is the nation's largest denomination.
