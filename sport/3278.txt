The Committee of Administrators on Friday released BCCI's first-ever handbook for cricketers titled '100 Things Every Professional Cricketer Must Know'. The handbook, which will act as an official resource for cricketers registered with BCCI, covers topics including recovery from injuries, emotional hardship and managing money. Ex-India captain Rahul Dravid has written the foreword for the book.
