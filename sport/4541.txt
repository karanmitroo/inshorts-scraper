Self-proclaimed critic Kamaal Rashid Khan (KRK) has urged people to follow only women's cricket matches while calling the men's team "fixers". KRK had earlier accused MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and other Indian cricketers of fixing the Champions Trophy 2017 final. He had also demanded that captain Virat Kohli be jailed for allegedly fixing the tournament's final.
