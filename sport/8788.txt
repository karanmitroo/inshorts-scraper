Melbourne Stars' Adam Zampa broke his bat in frustration after he was run out against Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League on Sunday. Zampa slipped after being sent back by partner Marcus Stoinis while they were trying to take a double, resulting in his run-out. Zampa's bat broke into two pieces after he smashed it into the turf.
