India's Shikhar Dhawan scored 490 runs in June 2017, which is the second most ODI runs scored by an Indian batsman in a month behind Sachin Tendulkar's 564 in April 1998. Dhawan's showing in the Champions Trophy 2017, which was held in June, led him to several records including becoming the joint highest century scorer in the ICC Champions Trophy.
