Former Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore has said that the pitch criticism during the recently concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia was just the visiting media's defence mechanism. "More than the players, it was media's hype that led to the pitch controversy," he added. Whatmore said that the players know what to expect from the pitches.
