Indian football club Bengaluru FC has defied a government advisory and travelled to the Maldives to play an AFC Cup match on February 13. The Ministry of External Affairs had issued an advisory last week asking people to defer "non-essential travel" to the island nation following a political crisis. Bengaluru FC risk losing points if they forfeit the match.
