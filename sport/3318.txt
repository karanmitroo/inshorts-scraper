German midfielder Sami Khedira bought 1,200 tickets for Monday's World Cup qualifier match between Germany and Norway for charity. The tickets have been distributed to socially disadvantaged children and children fighting cancer in the region. "Most wouldn't have had the chance to attend a game for various reasons, financial or logistical," the Juventus midfielder said about the initiative.
