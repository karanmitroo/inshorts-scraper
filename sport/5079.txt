Virender Sehwag has revealed Virat Kohli used to be "shy and quiet" in front of senior players but used to be "very very naughty" when in the U-19 team. Sehwag added that once Kohli fell ill and after being told by his U-19 coach that he wouldn't play the next match, his "fever went away" and he "started batting normally".
