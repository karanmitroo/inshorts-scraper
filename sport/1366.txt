A day after Sachin Tendulkar was prevented from making his debut speech in Rajya Sabha, the former cricketer took to Facebook to deliver his message. Tendulkar talked about transforming India into a sport-playing nation among other things in the 15-minute-long video. On Thursday, Sachin's speech was disrupted by Opposition members sloganeering over PM Modi's remarks on former PM Manmohan Singh.
