The BCCI on Tuesday shared a video of Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli working out in Sri Lanka. In the video, Virat Kohli can be seen doing spot running, weights and lunges, and taking tips from strength and fitness coach Shankar Basu. "What goes into the making of the Indian captain's well sculpt body?" BCCI captioned the video.
