Sports Minister Vijay Goel revealed in the Parliament on Tuesday that the Chief Medical Officer accompanying the Indian contingent at the Rio Olympics, Pawandeep Singh, was not a sports medicine expert but a radiologist. Singh is the son of Tarlochan Singh, Vice-President of the Indian Olympic Association. The fact came to light following a query by a CPI (M) MP.
