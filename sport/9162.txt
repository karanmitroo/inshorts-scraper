Indian Test captain Virat Kohli has said that he rates batsmen Steve Smith, Joe Root, and Kane Williamson above him in Tests because of their performances in the last two seasons. He added that he understands his limitations and never tries to outdo these three. Kohli further stated that consistent comparisons along with rankings are a massive distraction.
