BCCI has filed an official complaint with ICC against Australian captain Steve Smith and Peter Handscomb for the DRS incident during the Bengaluru Test. This comes after ICC had said no action was being taken against Smith or Indian skipper Virat Kohli regarding the matter. Kohli had accused Smith of consulting the dressing room while seeking a DRS review.
