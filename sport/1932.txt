Sri Lankan batsman Chamara Silva tried to play a shot from behind the stumps but was clean bowled during a domestic T20 match. The 37-year-old exposed his stumps as the bowler was approaching to deliver the last over's second ball and was dismissed for 6(2). "Umpires must intervene to stop such desecration of cricket," a user tweeted about Silva's shot.
