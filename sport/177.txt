Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR), who won the ice hockey gold at the Winter Olympics, sang their country's anthem over the Olympic anthem being played, at the medal presentation on Sunday. The International Olympic Committee had barred Russia from having their flag raised or anthem played, with the "clean" athletes competing as neutrals at the event.
