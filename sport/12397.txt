India’s Rio-bound wrestler Narsingh Yadav tested positive for the banned substance, methandienone, putting his Olympic participation in doubt. National Anti-Doping Agency chief Navin Agarwal confirmed that the wrestler’s ‘B’ sample also tested positive and he appeared before a disciplinary panel on Saturday. Yadav was chosen ahead of Sushil Kumar to represent India, after earning a quota in 2015.
