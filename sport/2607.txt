English all-rounder Ben Stokes married his girlfriend Clare Ratcliffe in a country church in Somerset on Saturday. The 26-year-old, who was sporting a bandaged hand, remains under investigation for causing bodily harm in a brawl outside a nightclub in Bristol last month. The wedding was attended by Stokes' current and former teammates including Alastair Cook, Paul Collingwood and Joe Root.
