Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya hit the fastest ever half century in the final of an ICC ODI tournament after reaching the score in 32 balls against Pakistan on Sunday. The record was earlier held by former Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist who reached his fifty off 33 balls against Pakistan in the final of the 1999 World Cup.
