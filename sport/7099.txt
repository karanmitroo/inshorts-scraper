A typo on news portal tennis.com saw Roger Federer's opponent's name at the Dubai Tennis Championships being written as 'Donkey'. Federer had lost to world number 116 Evgeny Donskoy at the Dubai Tennis Championships this week, following which a news headline on the portal read, "Federer blows three golden opportunities in stunning loss to Donkey." The typo was corrected later.
