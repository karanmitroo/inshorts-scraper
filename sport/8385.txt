UFC fighter Bec Rawlings has shared two topless pictures of her, with a sign that states, "F*** Feminism. I believe in human rights... for all!!!" The caption on the photos, that were previously released two years ago as well by the fighter, reads, "#TB  to upsetting all the Feminazi's of the world with common sense & a single finger salute."
