After scoring his 30th ODI hundred, Virat Kohli said that it will take "one hell of an effort" to reach anywhere near Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI hundreds. Adding that he doesn't think about records, Kohli said, "It's only about team where even if I score a 90* and team goes across the line, it's good enough for me."
