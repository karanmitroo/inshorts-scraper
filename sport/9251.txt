Football club Chapecoense, whose 19 players died in a plane crash recently, was fined 100,000 Brazilian reais ($30,000) by Brazil's football association for failing to play their last match. Chapecoense's opponent Atletico Mineiro was also fined the same amount for the offence. However, it was later reported that the fine was waived off by the Superior Court of Sports Justice.
