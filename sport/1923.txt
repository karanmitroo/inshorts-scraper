Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova has been booked under cheating and criminal conspiracy charges by Delhi Police, following the collapse of a luxury housing project in Gurgaon which she endorsed. The project, named Ballet by Sharapova, was scheduled to be completed in 2016 but was abandoned by builders after they collected money from the buyers.
