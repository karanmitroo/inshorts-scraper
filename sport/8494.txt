Eighteen US female athletes have sued a sports doctor, earlier associated with Olympic gymnasts, saying he sexually assaulted them on the pretext of medical examinations over two decades when they were minors. The doctor, identified as Larry Nassar, was an employee at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University and has been in federal custody since December on child pornography charges.
