West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite has been appointed as the West Indies T20I captain for the two-match T20 series against India in the USA, post the ongoing Test series. Former captain Darren Sammy had earlier explained in a Facebook video that he was sacked after a 30-second call with the Board's chief after having served as captain for six years.
