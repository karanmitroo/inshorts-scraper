Real Madrid lost to Celta Vigo 1-2 in the first leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final on Wednesday, suffering their second consecutive loss after a record 40-match unbeaten run. This was the first time since November 2015 that Madrid lost two straight games, and the first under manager Zinedine Zidane. Madrid's unbeaten run was ended by Sevilla on Sunday.
