Former cricketer Virender Sehwag, on Wednesday, slammed the British media for levelling allegations of ball tampering against India Test captain Virat Kohli. Sehwag said, "I feel one should accept defeats in a graceful manner. We never gave excuses when we lost matches abroad." A British media report had said Kohli used saliva to shine the ball while chewing a mint.
