Indian Test captain Virat Kohli has responded to Harbhajan Singh's recent tweet saying that present-day pitches were made spin-friendly. Virat said, "Even if it is a turning pitch, you have to bowl well... When we lost to New Zealand in the World Cup... suddenly their spinners were quality bowlers. The same spinners did not pick up wickets in this series."
