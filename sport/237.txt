Ex-Windies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul, while playing in a domestic one-day match, hit a straight shot which resulted in his son Tagenarine's run-out at the non-striker's end. Guyana Jaguars' father-son duo added 13 runs for the second wicket before Windwards Volcanoes' bowler Ryan John deflected Shivnarine's straight drive onto stumps. Tagenarine was found short of crease, getting out for 12.
