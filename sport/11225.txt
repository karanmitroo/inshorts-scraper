Indian bowlers took 10 wickets through LBWs in the recently-concluded Test against New Zealand at Kanpur, the most by India in a single Test. The previous record was of nine LBW dismissals, from the Eden Gardens Test between India and Australia in 2001. Spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin claimed four wickets each through LBWs in NZ's two innings.
