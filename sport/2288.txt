Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has said that he is penning a book on mind games in sports. "It's a book on how the player's mindset is important to develop the sport," he added. Ganguly further said that he had been approached by publishers for an autobiography but he would not write one as he doesn't have time and patience.
