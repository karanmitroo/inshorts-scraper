Commenting on Harbhajan Singh's tweet on Indian pitches' conditions, Sourav Ganguly said Harbhajan should "take it easy" and "move ahead". Harbhajan had claimed his wicket tally would have been "something else" had he bowled on pitches India have played on recently. "That's (pitches) not Ashwin's fault...Harbhajan is a great bowler...he should enjoy cricket and leave it at that," added Ganguly.
