Pakistani opener Sharjeel Khan has been handed a five-year ban from all formats of cricket by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over his involvement in the spot-fixing scandal in the country's franchise Twenty20 league PSL earlier this year. The five-year ban, of which two-and-a-half years have been suspended, was handed after the batsman was found guilty on five counts.
