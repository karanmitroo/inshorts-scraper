Eight-time Grand Slam champion Australia's Ken Rosewall writes a 'good luck' letter addressed to Swiss tennis star Roger Federer before each Australian Open. Federer, who has won the tournament five times, said that he cherishes Rosewall's letters. "I just write a simple half-page. Good luck. Hope the family's well. That's the extent of it," Rosewall said.
