Sourav Ganguly has said that he is curious to know why Ajinkya Rahane did not play the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Dharamshala. "Rahane should have played...because he has the ability to play in such conditions," he said. "If you are looking at World Cup 2019, I would want the team management to back Rahane and Rahul," he added.
