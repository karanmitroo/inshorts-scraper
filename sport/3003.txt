Karnataka's K Gowtham has been dropped from the India A squad for two four-day games against New Zealand for disciplinary reasons. Gowtham had left India Red in the Duleep Trophy citing health issues, but was seen playing in the Karnataka Premier League T20 tournament two days later. BCCI CEO Rahul Johri called Gowtham's behaviour a "gross insult to the system".
