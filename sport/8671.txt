MS Dhoni made many out-of-the-box on-field captaincy decisions, which were questioned initially but paid off. In the 2007 T20 World Cup final against Pakistan which India won, Dhoni gave the last over to Joginder Sharma despite Harbhajan Singh having one over left. In the 2016 World T20 match against Bangladesh, Dhoni set the field specifically to execute a last-ball run-out.
