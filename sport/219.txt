Former India captain MS Dhoni got angry at non-striker Manish Pandey after the first ball of the last over of India's innings during the second T20I against South Africa on Wednesday. Dhoni angrily asked Pandey to focus towards him while he is batting instead of looking elsewhere. The 36-year-old went on to smash the subsequent ball for a six.
