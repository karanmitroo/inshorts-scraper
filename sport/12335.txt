Dove has released an ad campaign in association with former gymnast and Olympic gold medalist Shawn Johnson, against the sexist portrayal of sportswomen in the media. The ad is aimed at encouraging the media and the general public to focus on the athletic ability of women in sports, instead of their appearances, physical attributes, â€‹and attractiveness.
