During the second India-Sri Lanka ODI in Mohali on Wednesday, a fan invaded the field and touched former India captain MS Dhoni's feet while he was keeping wickets. The fan managed to surpass the security and ran straight towards Dhoni, who tried to stop him from touching his feet. The man was then escorted out by a security person.
