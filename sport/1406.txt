Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes took to Twitter to share a picture of himself drinking lassi in Jaipur and called it the secret behind Yuvraj Singh's six-hitting power. Yuvraj, who hit six sixes in an over in the World T20 in South Africa, replied calling Rhodes "flying Jonty Singh" and wrote, "And also the secret of your legendary catches."
