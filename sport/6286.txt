Brazilian sports club Sport Recife's Diego Souza scored with an overhead scissor kick following two of his teammates' bicycle kick attempts against Uruguay's Danubio FC on Friday. The first player's bicycle kick looped towards the far post, where another player attempted a bicycle kick which was deflected by a defender. Souza then struck the deflected shot towards the fast post.
