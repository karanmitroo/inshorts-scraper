Football traces its origins to China, where a military exercise in second and third centuries BC consisted of kicking a leather ball filled with feathers and hair into a small net fixed onto bamboo canes. The use of hands in the exercise was disallowed. Modern Football's history, however, began in 1863 with the formation of the Football Association in England.
