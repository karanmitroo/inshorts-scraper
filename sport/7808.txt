Ukrainian footballer Roman Zozulya, who was loaned to Spanish second-tier club Rayo Vallecano, was forced to return to his former club after Rayo fans called him pro-Nazi. Fans protested at the player's only practice session at the club, holding a placard saying it was "not a place for Nazis". The rumour reportedly started after an erroneous report in a newspaper.
