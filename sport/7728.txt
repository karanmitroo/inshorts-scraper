Honduras-based football club Olimpia drew their match against Motagua on Sunday, after they scored while a pitch invader distracted the opposition's keeper with another ball. Home side Olimpia were trailing 1-2, when an invader came into the box and scored with another ball at the same time as Olimpia's striker. The referee allowed the goal despite appeals by the opposition.
