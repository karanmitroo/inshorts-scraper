Olympic gold medalist Nadia Comăneci, who was the first ever gymnast to achieve a perfect score in gymnastics at the Olympics, hailed Dipa Karmakar for introducing the sport in India. "It's great to see a gymnast like Dipa, who was able to inspire a generation in a country where you were only talking about cricket," Comăneci said in an interview.
