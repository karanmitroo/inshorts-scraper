Former Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson termed the Umpire Decision Review System a 'failure' after another controversial decision. Mitchell Marsh, who was batting on 26, was given not out by the on-field umpire before South Africa successfully reviewed the decision. The ball-tracking technology showed the ball was hitting more than 50% of leg stump, enough to overturn the on-field decision.
