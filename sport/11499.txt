West Indies coach Phil Simmons was sacked by the West Indies Cricket Board on Wednesday citing "differences in culture and strategic approach". Simmons, who moved into the role after the 2015 World Cup, led the West Indies cricket team to the World T20 title in April. Former West Indian fast bowler Joel Garner will act as the team manager.
