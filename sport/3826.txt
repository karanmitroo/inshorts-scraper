Reacting to Ravi Shastri's praise of Indian team following second Test win, ex-Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin said Shastri is being disrespectful to himself. Shastri had said the Virat Kohli-led team has already done things that a lot of Indian teams couldn't do. "I don't know why people make such comments. He's been part of past sides as well," Azharuddin added.
