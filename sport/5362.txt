World number two Serbia's Novak Djokovic has appointed former world number one Andre Agassi as his new coach, after having parted ways with another former world number one Boris Becker earlier this year. Djokovic had earlier also parted ways with his coaching staff, which included coaches from his childhood. Notably, Agassi will join Djokovic ahead of the French Open.
