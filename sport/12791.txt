World number 27, Serbia's Viktor Troicki abused umpire Damiano Torella during his second round Wimbledon match on Thursday over a call given in favour of his opponent, Spain's Albert Ramos-Violas. Troicki was heard saying, “You’re the worst ever. Do you know what you did? You’re an idiot”. Troicki ultimately lost the five-set match and faces a fine for unsportsmanlike behaviour.
