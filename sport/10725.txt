The International Olympic Committee may shift some of the events of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to South Korea in an attempt to reportedly cut costs involved in hosting the event. The South Korean city of Chungju, one of the venues for the 2014 Asian Games, is being considered for hosting the rowing and canoeing events of the 2020 Olympics.
