Former Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Akhtar claims that match-fixing was its peak in 1996, but he himself refrained from indulging in such activities. "The atmosphere of the Pakistan dressing room was very strange. Trust me it was the worst possible dressing room," Akhtar said during an interview. Earlier former Pakistani cricketer Javed Miandad had accused Shahid Afridi of match-fixing.
