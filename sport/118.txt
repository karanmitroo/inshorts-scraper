Australian spinner Brad Hogg, who is also Indian chinaman Kuldeep Yadav's mentor, said that the Indian spinner would be a perfect role model for a son he would want. He added it took him four years to convince Kuldeep to call him 'Hoggy' over 'Sir'. Hogg also claimed Kuldeep is ready to play as India's lone spinner in away Tests.
