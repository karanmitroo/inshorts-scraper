BCCI has threatened to withdraw team India from next year’s Champions Trophy in England after being excluded from ICC's recent finance committee meeting in Dubai. BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke termed the exclusion as "humiliation" while announcing that India could even pull out of the tournament if the ICC doesn’t "amend this". Reportedly, 70% of ICC’s income comes from the BCCI.
