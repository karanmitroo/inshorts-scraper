After Ravindra Jadeja became sole top-ranked Test bowler, former captain Sourav Ganguly said that Jadeja has started to come out of the shadow of Ravichandran Ashwin. "Ashwin has 250 Test wickets... and is the fastest to the mark, but Jadeja in this series has taken the responsibility... He has gone ahead of Ashwin," added Ganguly.
