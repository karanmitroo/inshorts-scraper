Pranav Dhanawade, the 16-year-old Mumbai boy who became famous by scoring more than 1,000 runs in an innings, said he was abused by the police prior to his arrest on Saturday. "We requested them to allow us few minutes to stretch...but they didn't listen and instead became abusive," said Pranav, who was arrested for not leaving the ground.
