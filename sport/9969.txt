Footage of South African captain Faf du Plessis applying saliva to the ball with mint in his mouth, during the second Test against Australia at Hobart has surfaced online. As per cricket laws, a fielder may polish a ball "provided that no artificial substance is used". Notably, Australian keeper Peter Nevill was out on the very next ball.
