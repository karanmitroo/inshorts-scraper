Prior to team India's selection meeting for the upcoming Test series against New Zealand, supporters at the Duleep Trophy final, held a 20-feet-long banner, seeking the return of Gautam Gambhir into the Indian team. After seeing the banner, the 34-year-old opening batsman reportedly told the ground officials to provide the supporters with water bottles.
