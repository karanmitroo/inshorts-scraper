Former Pakistani pacer Wasim Akram picked former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar as his most prized wicket. Akram said, "If anyone is keen to learn proper batting technique, then one should watch Gavaskar who batted without a helmet and was always right on top." Akram also praised Sachin Tendulkar, calling him a true master of the game.
