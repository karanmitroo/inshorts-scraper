Ahead of the India-Australia limited over series, Australian captain Steve Smith has said that keeping Virat Kohli "quiet" would help them succeed on the tour. Smith further said that he was not too concerned about the differences between him and Kohli. Notably, Kohli had accused Smith of cheating when the Australian team visited India for a Test series in March.
