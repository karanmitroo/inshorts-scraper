Sports Minister Vijay Goel has said he will meet tennis players Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi and try to sort their differences. The two players got into a public spat after Paes accused Bhupathi of not informing him about his exclusion from India's Davis Cup squad. Bhupathi retaliated by leaking a WhatsApp chat between the two to defend himself.
