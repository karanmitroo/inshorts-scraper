Indian cricketer S Sreesanth approached the Kerala High Court on Friday, as the BCCI is yet to give him an NOC to play in the Scotland League. The HC had lifted the ban imposed on him by the BCCI on August 7, but BCCI is reportedly seeking to challenge the order. Sreesanth was banned after the 2013 IPL spot-fixing case.
