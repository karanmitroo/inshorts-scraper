Indian tennis star Sania Mirza will not be playing at the Australian Open 2018 due to a condition called 'jumper's knee' in her right leg. Mirza, who won the title in 2016 with Switzerland's Martina Hingis, has been told to take a couple of months off. The Australian Open is set to begin on January 15.
