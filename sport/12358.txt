Australia's Olympic Committee staff refused to move its contingent ​into Rio's Olympic Village, after finding “blocked toilets, leaking pipes and exposed wiring” inside the complex, which is reportedly the biggest in Olympic history. The staff has since been staying in nearby hotels. Rio officials promised that crews “will be working 24 hours a day until the issues are resolved”.
