Former South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs on Thursday trolled ICC for making a typo in the tweet wishing him on his 43rd birthday. ICC had tweeted, "6,167 Test runs, 894 ODI runs, 400 T20I runs. Happy Birthday to former South Africa batsman @hershybru," to which Gibbs replied, "Think I might have got a few more ODI runs than that."
