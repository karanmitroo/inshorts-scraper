Former cricketer Rahul Dravid has been given an extension and offered a new two-year contract with the U-19 and India A teams. Dravid is yet to accept the contract as the terms and conditions, including the remuneration, are yet to be finalised. The decision was taken by the Cricket Advisory Committee, comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman.
