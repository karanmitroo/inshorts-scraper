Following Australia's loss in the fourth Test on Tuesday, Australian captain Steve Smith said, "At times, I have been in my own bubble and have let my emotions slip. I apologise for that". "I have been pretty intense throughout this series", Smith added. Smith was seen swearing after the third umpire overturned a Murali Vijay-catch on the third day.
