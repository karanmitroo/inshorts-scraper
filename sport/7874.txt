Tanveer Hussain, a 24-year-old athlete from Kashmir, has been denied a US visa, with the embassy attributing it to "current policy" of the American government. Hussain was scheduled to travel to New York for the World Snowshoe Championship and reportedly possessed requisite documents. However, the US embassy said Indian citizens are not affected by President Donald Trump's recent travel ban.
