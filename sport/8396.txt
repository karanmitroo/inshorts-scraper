Arsenal players Aaron Ramsey, Alex Iwobi and Per Mertesacker teamed up with British acrobatic team Dunking Devils to perform trick basketball shots. The players used a springboard and a football instead of a regular basketball, with the footballers controlling the ball and the Devils' members dunking it. The interaction was held ahead of the NBA Global Games in London.
