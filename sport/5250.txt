The French Open, the second of the four annual Grand Slam tournaments, is also referred to as the Roland Garros and gets its namesake from the Roland Garros stadium in Paris. The tournament has been held at the stadium since 1928. Notably, Roland Garros was a French aviator who was killed in combat during the World War I.
