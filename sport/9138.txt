Pakistan batsman Salman Butt has claimed that corruption will always be a part of cricket. Butt, who was suspended for spot-fixing in 2010 said, "Complete elimination is not possible because it requires...one moment of weakness...to destroy yourself with corruption." Butt, however, added that since 2010 ICC has put a lot of deterrents into place which has made a difference.
