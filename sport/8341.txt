Sydney Thunder's Carlos Brathwaite and Fawad Ahmed emulated the iconic Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba's dab celebration during their Big Bash League match against Sydney Sixers. The duo performed the dab after Brathwaite took a catch to dismiss Sean Abbott off Ahmed's bowling. Ahmed took four wickets helping Thunder win, and he was adjudged Man of the Match.
