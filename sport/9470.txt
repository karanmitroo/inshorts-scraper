Juventus forward Mario Mandzukic helped his team's defence by saving two shots from going inside the goal within 4 seconds in the first half of the Serie A match against Atalanta. Mandzukic first blocked a long Remo Freuler volley with his chest before quickly clearing Alejandro Dario Gomez's shot through a header.
