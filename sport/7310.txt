Stating that he is good friends with some Australian cricketers, Indian captain Virat Kohli said, "I know where to draw the line of friendship as well. When you step onto the field, I could be playing against my real brother (but) it doesn't matter." Kohli added that his team wasn't treating the Australian side in a different manner.
