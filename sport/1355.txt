BCCI's chief selector MSK Prasad has said that wicket-keeper MS Dhoni will not be replaced till the 2019 World Cup because none of the younger keepers match the former Indian captain's level. "There is no comparison and I don't see any wicket-keeper who can even come closer to him in world cricket, leave alone Indian cricket," said Prasad.
