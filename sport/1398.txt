Following his two catches in the India-Sri Lanka T20I on Wednesday, former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took his tally to 133 catches to equal Kumar Sangakkara's record of most catches by a wicketkeeper in T20 cricket. Further, Dhoni became only the second cricketer to effect 200-plus dismissals in T20 cricket as a wicketkeeper after Kamran Akmal.
