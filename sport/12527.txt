Nineteen-year-old Welshman Aneurin Donald hit a 123-ball double century in an English county match on Sunday to equal Ravi Shastri's record for the fastest double ton in first-class cricket. Interestingly, Shastri's knock had come in the same innings in which he had hit six sixes in an over. Moreoverâ€‹, Donald reached the landmarks of 100, 150 and 200 with sixes.
