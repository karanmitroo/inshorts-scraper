Former Manchester City and Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli missed the opening two minutes of his team Nice's Ligue 1 match against Nantes after he struggled to loosen his shoelaces by himself. Balotelli, who was walking out to start the match, went towards the bench for assistance and was helped by a coach who loosened his laces.
