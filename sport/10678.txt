Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the rest of the 2016 season, in order to recover from his left wrist injury. Nadal pulled out of the French Open midway and missed the Wimbledon earlier this year, but won the Olympic gold in Rio along with Marc LÃ³pez. Nadal added he will begin "preparing intensively" for the 2017 season.
