The Mongolian wrestling coaches who had protested at the Rio Olympics by stripping off their clothes have been suspended for three years. Coaches Tserenbaatar Tsogbayar and Byambarinchen Bayaraa both stripped off and hurled their shoes after their wrestler Mandakhnaran Ganzorig lost out on the bronze medal. The Mongolian national federation has also been given a fine of approximately $50,000.
