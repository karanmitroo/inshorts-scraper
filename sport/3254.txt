Sri Lanka Cricket was slammed after it uploaded a video with referee Andy Pycroft's amplified voice to clarify India-Sri Lanka T20I toss confusion. "Is all people in board [deaf]...go for ENT specialist and check your ears," a user tweeted. Earlier, a video had surfaced which suggested India was wrongly awarded the toss after miscommunication between Pycroft and presenter Murali Kartik.
