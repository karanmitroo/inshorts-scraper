Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has been fined 50% of his match fee and has been given three demerit points for breaching ICC's Code of Conduct during the third Test against New Zealand on Sunday. The all-rounder was found repeatedly running on the protected part of the pitch, which also resulted in a five-run penalty for team India.
