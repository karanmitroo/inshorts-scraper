Pranav Dhanawade, the 17-year-old Mumbai schoolboy who scored record 1009* runs in a match in 2016, has decided to return the scholarship given to him by Mumbai Cricket Association. Pranav's father wrote to MCA stating they took the decision as Pranav hasn't performed up to expectations. Pranav was asked by his teams to look for new sides, following underperformance.
