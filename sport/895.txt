In his message for recently retired 2005 Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi said that football will never forget his smile. "I learnt a lot by your side. I'll always be grateful...for how easy it was that you did everything to me when I got to the dressing room," he added. Ronaldinho had assisted Messi's first-ever senior goal at Barcelona.
