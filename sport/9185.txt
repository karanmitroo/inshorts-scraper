Former English cricketer Geoffrey Boycott has said Virat Kohli won't become a better player than past players like Sachin Tendulkar "by breaking records". "He won't break all records..It won't matter, even if he does...Records are there to be broken...What he has to do is carry on scoring runs and winning Test matches for his country," said Boycott.
