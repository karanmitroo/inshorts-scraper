Australian cricketing legend Don Bradman, playing his final Test innings on August 14, 1948, was dismissed for a duck which left his Test average stuck at 99.94. Facing English leg-spinner Eric Hollies' second delivery, Bradman missed a googly that went on to hit his middle and off stumps. Notably, Bradman's 99.94 is the highest batting average in Test cricket's history.
