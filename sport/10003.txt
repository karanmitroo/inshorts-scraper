Over 11,000 people attempted the Mannequin Challenge at the Perth Arena in Australia during a basketball game of the local Perth Wildcats team on Sunday. The 11,658-strong crowd included spectators, players, cheerleaders and referees freezing for the minute-long video in varying positions. The Mannequin Challenge involves people standing still, while a video is being shot, with background music.
