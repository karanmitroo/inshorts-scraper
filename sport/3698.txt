World's most expensive footballer, Brazil's Neymar Jr has become a goodwill ambassador for Handicap International on Tuesday. "Millions want their rights, they want to be treated better. That's what we are here for and that is what our aim is," Neymar said. He stood atop a 39-foot chair-shaped sculpture, erected 20 years ago, calling for a ban on anti-personnel landmines.
