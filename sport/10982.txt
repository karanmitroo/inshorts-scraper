The Mumbai Cricket Association has accepted Sachin Tendulkar's suggestion to have 14 players in a side during inter-school tournaments. While only 11 players will field at any point in a match, the new rule allows for the players in the squad to be used for batting and bowling through rolling substitutions. The rule will be implemented from the upcoming season.
