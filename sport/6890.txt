Indian boxers will miss the Chemistry Cup in Germany owing to a delay in procuring the visas. The sport's national federation has assured that the boxers will be compensated by being sent for another event soon. Federation officials came to know that visa applications have to be directed from the regions players belong to instead of the Delhi-based centralised process.
