England's Jonny Bairstow got injured while making his way to the pitch to begin the day's play on Saturday in the Vizag Test. Bairstow was jogging onto the ground when he suffered an apparent muscle pull, after which he started limping and made his way back to the dressing room. He was back later and scored a half-century.
