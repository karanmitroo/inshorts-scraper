Belgian club Anderlecht's Algerian midfielder Sofiane Hanni dribbled past five KV Oostende defenders covering around 35 yards in eight seconds to score the decisive goal in their Belgian First Division A match on Sunday. Hanni broke through Oostende's defence in the 48th minute before finding the net with a left-footed shot from just inside the box.
