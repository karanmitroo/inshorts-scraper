Before India-England 2011 World Cup match, former Australian spinner Shane Warne had put out a tweet predicting that the match would end in a tie. Warne's prediction came true when England scored 338/8 in reply to India's 338, and he was termed a 'genius' by then England captain Andrew Strauss. Many Pakistani cricketers demanded ICC to investigate Warne's 'prediction'.
