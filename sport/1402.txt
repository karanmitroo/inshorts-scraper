India coach Ravi Shastri has said that captain Virat Kohli is the "boss" of Team India while he just gives suggestions. "[The] equation is great. We are both strong minded, both play to win at all costs...We don't go there to do time-pass," he added. Shastri further said that Kohli could go on to captain India for another six-seven years.
