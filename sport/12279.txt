Australia won the 2016 Quidditch World Cup held in the German city of Frankfurt last week. Competitors played the sport with sticks between their legs to represent broomsticks, while the 'snitch' was embodied by a player with a tennis ball swinging from his trousers in a sock. Notably, Quidditch is played by witches and wizards in the Harry Potter series.
