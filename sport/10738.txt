West Indies spinner Devendra Bishoo produced a career-best performance of 8-49 against Pakistan in the ongoing day-night Test between the sides on Sunday. The 30-year-old spinner, who was introduced early in the attack, produced the best ever bowling figures by a visiting bowler in Asia and the fifth best bowling figures ever by a leg-spinner in Tests.
