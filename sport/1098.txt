Wriddhiman Saha has become the first-ever Indian wicketkeeper to effect 10 dismissals in a Test, achieving the feat against South Africa on Monday. Saha overtook MS Dhoni, who had recorded 9 dismissals (8 catches, 1 stumping) against Australia in 2014. All of Saha's 10 dismissals were catches, making him the first Indian wicketkeeper to take 10 catches in a Test.
