Champagne is set to return as the beverage being sprayed by winning drivers on the Formula One podium, replacing sparkling wine which was used last season. Champagne maker Carbon has been announced as the replacement for sparkling wine producer Chandon, which was introduced in 2015 after a 15-year partnership with champagne maker Mumm ended. Moet was the supplier before Mumm.
