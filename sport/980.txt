The karting circuit where ex-Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher started his career is set to close. The ground under the track, which is reportedly co-owned by Schumacher, will be torn up for coal as it lies on the edge of a planned mining area. Schumacher's brother Ralf and four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel also began their careers there.
