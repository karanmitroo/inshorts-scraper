A five-day-long cricket match between two teams is called a Test match, as it is considered a complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance. The name comes from the five-day-long match being a "test" of the relative strengths of the two sides. The world's first officially recognised Test match began on March 15, 1877 between England and Australia.
