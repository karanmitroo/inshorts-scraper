Aaron Finch, who top-scored for Australia with 42 runs in the first T20I on Saturday, described his dismissal by Kuldeep Yadav as a 'brain fade moment'. "The ball that I got out on was a little bit of brain fade, I went to sweep and just tried to chip him on the onside for one, and missed it," Finch said.
