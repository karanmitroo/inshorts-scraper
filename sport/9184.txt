Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Shaharyar Khan has said BCCI is ready to play Pakistan, but the Indian government is not allowing a series. "They can't do anything as their government is not giving clearance. Even our hands are tied...We are not begging India to play with us...A Board has to pursue its own interests in a diplomatic manner," said Khan.
