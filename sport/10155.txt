The English cricket team celebrated its performance on the first day of the first Test against India in the team's hotel in Rajkot on Wednesday. The celebratory cake, which was cut by the team after the day's play, had Joe Root's 124 and Moeen Ali's 99* written on it. The cake was designed as a cricket ground.
