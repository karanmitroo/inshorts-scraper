Colombian midfielder Edwin Cardona was caught making a 'slant eye' gesture towards a South Korean player during the teams' friendly match on Friday. The incident happened during a scuffle between both sides in the second half of the match. "I am sorry that something that happened during the game has been misinterpreted," Cardona said, denying allegations of racism.
