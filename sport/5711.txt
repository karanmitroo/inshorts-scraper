British middle-distance runner Roger Bannister became the first person to run a mile in less than 4 minutes on May 6, 1954. Bannister, who completed the race in 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds at the Iffley Road track in Oxford, held the record for just 46 days. Bannister, who later became the neurologist, also took part in the 1952 Olympics.
