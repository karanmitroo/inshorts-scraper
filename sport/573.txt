South African batsman Quinton de Kock remained not out after he defended a delivery by India's Jasprit Bumrah, with the ball rolling on to hit the stumps without dislodging the bails. A similar incident occurred with Bumrah when Pakistani batsman Mohammad Hafeez got a reprieve after a delivery hit the stumps only for the bails to fall back in place.
