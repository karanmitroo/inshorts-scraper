Bangladesh captain and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim missed stumping Wriddhiman Saha after failing to dislodge the bails twice during the Hyderabad Test on Friday. Saha, batting on 4, was well outside the crease when Rahim collected the ball, but failed to knock off the bails. When he did dislodge the bails on the third attempt, Saha was back in the crease.
