Australia defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in the fourth ODI at Dambulla on Wednesday, to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Aussie pacer John Hastings' career-best bowling figures of 6/45 helped restrict the Lankas to 212. Later, Aaron Finch's 18-ball 50, the joint-fastest for an Australian, helped the visitors achieve the target in 31 overs.
