The ICC had requested Indian fans to sell the tickets they purchased for the first semi-final between England and Pakistan, in case they do not plan to attend the match. Indian fans had reportedly purchased 30% of the tickets before the teams were decided, and the ICC fearing that the seats will go vacant, requested the resale.
