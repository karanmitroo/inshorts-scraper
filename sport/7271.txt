Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has appeared in a promotional video for Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Department, urging people to visit the "incredible" valley for its "amazing" hospitality. "This is my third visit to Kashmir and this is the longest I have been here...I learnt to snowboard on the hills right behind me," Rhodes said in the video.
