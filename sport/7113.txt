MS Dhoni, who is captaining Jharkhand in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy, recently met Thomas, owner of a tea stall, which he used to visit daily while he was working as a ticket collector in Kharagpur. Thomas had come to Kolkata to get a glimpse of Dhoni, who not only recognised Thomas but also hosted him for dinner.
