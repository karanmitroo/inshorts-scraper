Argentine football legend Diego Maradona attempted to recreate his 'Hand of God' goal, that knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, in a charity match in South Korea. The five-a-side match's referee gave Maradona a yellow card for handling the ball. Later, the 56-year-old had scored off a rebound after failing to convert a penalty during the match.
