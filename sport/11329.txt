Rome's new mayor Virginia Raggi has cancelled the city's bid to host the 2024 Olympics, saying organising the event "would bury the city under mountains of debt and tonnes of cement". This comes after Boston and Hamburg also abandoned their 2024 bids. Reportedly, the withdrawal would deprive the city of $1.7 billion-worth investments and the creation of nearly 200,000 jobs.
