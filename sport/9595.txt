Pakistan Hockey Federation has said the country's ouster from the junior World Cup, to be held in Lucknow in December, was pre-planned by the International Hockey Federation. "Pakistan did not delay any scheduled obligation, and it's all India's fault to not issue visa to Pakistan's delegation before deadline," said PHF. FIH had earlier withdrawn their invite for Pakistan on Tuesday.
