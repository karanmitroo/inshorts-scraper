Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao says he took various kinds of drugs as a teenager but fully supports President Rodrigo Duterte, whose anti-drugs campaign in the nation has claimed over 3,000 lives. Pacquiao, now a senator and an ally of the President, said Duterte was anointed by God to discipline Filipinos and his authority must be respected.
