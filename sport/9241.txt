AB de Villiers stepped down as South Africa's Test captain on Monday, ahead of SA's series against Sri Lanka. De Villiers has been ruled out of the three-Test long series as he continues to recover from an elbow injury. De Villiers endorsed Faf du Plessis as his replacement, whose appointment as the captain has been confirmed by Cricket South Africa.
