Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a new contract with Real Madrid, keeping him at the Spanish club until 2021. No details of Ronaldo’s contract were released but the club administration said that an “official event” for the renewal would take place on Monday. Notably, last month Gareth Bale became Real’s best-paid player with a £150 million six-year deal.
