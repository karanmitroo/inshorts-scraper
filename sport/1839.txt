Formula One championship is without a Brazilian driver for the first time in 48 years after Felipe Massa ended his career at the season's final Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi. "Brazil is a very important country for F1; so many titles, so many drivers," said Massa, who won 11 races from 2006 to 2008 during his stint at Ferrari.
