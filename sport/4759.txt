After Anil Kumble blamed Virat Kohli for his resignation as Team India coach, Kohli has said the team tried to maintain the "sanctity of the dressing room throughout". "Anil bhai has expressed his views...we respect that...we have created a culture over the last 3-4 years...what happens in the change-room is very sacred and private to all of us," said Kohli.
