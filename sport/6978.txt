Needing to win with at least a five-goal margin to progress, Barcelona defeated PSG 6-1 (6-5 on aggregate) and became the first team to overturn a 0-4 first leg deficit in Champions League history. Barcelona needed three goals with 2 minutes of regulation time left before Neymar produced a brace and Sergi Roberto scored the winner in the dying seconds.
