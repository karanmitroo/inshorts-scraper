Indian team management had instructed the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) officials to create a rank turner for the first Test match in Pune, according to reports. MCA officials reportedly claimed that preparations of the wicket had been "hijacked" days before the match began to dry out the turf and remove most of the grass in order to aid spin bowling.
