Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis said that he regrets the strained relationship he shared with teammate Wasim Akram during their playing days. "Yeah, we had issues. He didn't only have issues with me but we had issues in the team those days, which... I do regret at times because it did not really help Pakistan cricket", said former Pakistan coach.
