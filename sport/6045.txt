Wrestler Babita Phogat slammed the government on Twitter after BSF jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav, who released a video showing poor quality of food for jawans at border posts, was dismissed from service. Babita mentioned the recently launched 'Bharat ke Veer' app, saying at one point the government takes such initiatives, while on other occasions, mistreats whistleblowers.
