After winning a six-pack challenge on SmackDown Live on Tuesday, Indo-Canadian wrestler Jinder Mahal has emerged as the new No 1 contender for Randy Orton's WWE Championship title match. The 30-year-old will face Orton for the title at the SmackDown-branded event Backlash on May 21, if Orton wins his 'House Of Horrors' match at Payback on April 30.
