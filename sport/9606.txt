Gareth Southgate was named as Englandâ€™s permanent manager on a four-year contract on Wednesday following his four-match stint as the team's interim coach. The 46-year-old succeeds Sam Allardyce who departed 67 days into the job. Southgate, a former England Under-21 manager, has led England to two wins and a draw in the team's three 2018 World Cup qualifiers so far.
