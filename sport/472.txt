Tonga's Pita Taufatofua appeared shirtless at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games on Friday. The 34-year-old athlete rose to fame after he oiled himself and went topless at the Rio Olympic Games in 2016. Taufatofua is taking part at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang as Tonga's first cross-country skier.
