All India Football Federation's website was hacked on Tuesday, with hackers posting that they will send Kulbhushan Jadhav's "dead body back" to India. The hackers, who identified themselves as "Zero Cool", posted other anti-India messages including, "You even don't know the difference between Snapchat and Snapdeals". The site was later restored, with AIFF calling it a "reckless sliding tackle".
