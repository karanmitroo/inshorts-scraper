Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal has been dropped from the India Davis Cup squad, which is scheduled to face New Zealand next month, on disciplinary grounds. The 19-year-old reportedly missed morning practice sessions during a competition last year citing hangover. According to officials, Nagal also brought his girlfriend to a camp without informing the management.
