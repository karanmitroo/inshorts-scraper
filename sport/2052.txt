With his first-ball duck in the first Test against Sri Lanka, KL Rahul became the sixth Indian batsman to be dismissed on the opening delivery of a Test. This was the first instance of an Indian getting out on Test's first ball in 10 years. Ex-Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar has been dismissed off the first ball of a Test thrice.
