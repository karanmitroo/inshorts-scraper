Former English bowler John Lever, was accused of ball-tampering after he used a gauze strip coated with Vaseline on his forehead during the 1976 Madras Test. England denied the allegations, arguing that the Vaseline gauze was used to channel sweat away from the eyes. Despite 'traces of vaseline" being found on the ball, England's defense was accepted by the authorities.
