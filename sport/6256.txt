Indian Davis Cup team's non-playing captain Mahesh Bhupathi has claimed that his former doubles partner Leander Paes should not 'sulk' as he was conveyed in advance that his inclusion in the final four was never confirmed. Bhupathi picked Rohan Bopanna ahead of Paes to play against Uzbekistan and defended his decision saying that Bopanna is India's best doubles player.
