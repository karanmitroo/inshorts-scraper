The United Kingdom has become the world's first country to officially recognise parkour as a sport. Parkour, also known as freerunning, is similar to military obstacle training and involves a participant getting from one point to another, tackling terrain using only his/her natural body strength. The sport has been considered controversial since it uses minimal protection gear.
