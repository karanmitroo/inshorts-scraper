Adelaide Strikers' Ben Laughlin and Jake Weatherald combined to pull-off a relay catch to dismiss Melbourne Renegades' Dwayne Bravo in the BBL on Monday. Bravo hit a lofted drive which was caught by sprinting Laughlin, who was about to touch the boundary rope. Laughlin threw the ball inside before crossing the boundary as Weatherald completed the catch 30 metres away.
