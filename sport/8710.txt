Former Australian PM Bob Hawke emptied his glass of beer in one go during Australia's Test against Pakistan on Wednesday. Australian skipper Steve Smith and coach Darren Lehmann were seen enjoying the 87-year-old's effort. During his youth, Hawke drank 2.5 pints of beer in 11 seconds at University College, Oxford, which was reportedly a world record at that time.
