India failed to chase down the target of 208 runs as South Africa emerged victorious in the first Test of the three-match series in Cape Town on Monday. This was India's first Test loss in 10 matches, with the previous defeat coming against Australia in February 2017. The Indian cricket team has never won a Test series in South Africa.
