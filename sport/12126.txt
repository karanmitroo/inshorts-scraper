Chandan Nayak, an 11-year-old footballer from Odisha, has been selected to train at a football camp at Bayern Munich. Earlier, Chandan was not being allowed to play in the selection round at an all-India competition at Pune because he was considered ‘too short’. However, after convincing his coaches, Chandan was selected for the all-expenses-paid junior football camp to Munich.
