Nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal did not know about his uncle Toni Nadal's departure from his coaching staff until he read about it in the news. Toni, who had been coaching Nadal since he was a child, revealed he would depart from the team after the 2017 season. "We arrived at the point where I decide nothing", Toni said.
