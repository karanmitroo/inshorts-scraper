Wrestling coach Mahavir Singh Phogat reportedly got ₹80 lakh from the makers of his biopic 'Dangal' and invested some of that amount in buying buffaloes. Dangal is the highest-grossing Hindi movie ever and also the fastest Bollywood film to earn ₹300 crore, crossing the figure in 17 days of its release. Phogat is reportedly satisfied with the amount he received.
