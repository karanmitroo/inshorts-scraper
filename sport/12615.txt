In 1974, Sunil Gavaskar got a haircut from the umpire while batting against England at Old Trafford. Gavaskar, who wasn't wearing a helmet as it was uncommon for batsmen back then, found his hair getting in his eyes, and asked the umpire, Dickie Bird, to trim his hair. Bird honoured his request, and Gavaskar went on to score a century.
