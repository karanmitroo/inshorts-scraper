Indian cricketer Kedar Jadhav has been ruled out of the three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka due to a hamstring injury. Eighteen-year-old Washington Sundar has been called up as his replacement, thereby earning his maiden ODI call-up. Earlier this month, the Tamil Nadu all-rounder had also earned his maiden call-up for the T20I series against Sri Lanka.
