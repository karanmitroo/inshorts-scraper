Indian captain Virat Kohli has alleged that the Indian team's physiotherapist Patrick Farhart's name was being called by Australian players while he was treating Kohli's injury. "They started taking Patrick's name. I don't know why...His job is to treat me," said Kohli. Steve Smith later denied Kohli's accusation and said, "I didn't actually do anything...It was probably the exact opposite."
