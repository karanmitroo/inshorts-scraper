BCCI has reportedly refused to give a discount on the rates of archived match footage to the makers of Sachin Tendulkar's upcoming biopic, 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams'. Production house 200 Not Out said they were negotiating with BCCI, while footage had already been procured from other boards. However, Sachin's farewell speech has been provided for free to the makers.
