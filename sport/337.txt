After becoming the oldest men's singles world number one, twenty-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer tweeted, "Apparently I'm the oldest tennis player with a number one ranking. Somebody might have mentioned that to me already but I had a hard time hearing." Federer had become the world number one for the first time in February 2004 as a 22-year-old.
