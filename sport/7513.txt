Pacer S Sreesanth is set to defy the BCCI life ban imposed on him by playing a first-division two-day league match for Kerala-based Ernakulam Cricket Club on February 19. Sreesanth alleged there was no official correspondence about his life ban, which was only announced in the media. Sreesanth was earlier denied a no-objection certificate by BCCI to play in Scotland.
