Indian hockey team captain PR Sreejesh has dedicated the Asian Champions Trophy win to the Army. "They fight for our safety at the borders. The best part of any game is that we forget all that happens outside the field when we play," said Sreejesh. India defeated Pakistan on Sunday to win the title for the second time.
