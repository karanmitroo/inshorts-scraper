Pakistan's 23-year-old pacer Hasan Ali said that his style of celebration resembles the 'bursting of a bomb' and he wants to do this "at least three-four-five times" against the Indians. The 23-year-old, who is the highest wicket-taker in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 so far, has picked up 10 wickets at an average of 17.2.
