India's Rio Olympics bronze medalist Sakshi Malik has said she would like a biopic being made on her life. "I'd like a biopicâ€¦ But if someone doesn't make one, it's okay. I don't watch many films, so I don't know the works of too many directors," said Sakshi. Actor Sonakshi Sinha earlier said she'd love playing Sakshi in a film.
