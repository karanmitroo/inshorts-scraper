Following India's rise to become the top-ranked Test team, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said that for the Indian team to be real number one, they must win abroad. "Wherever India go, to England, Australia, South Africa, that will be the tough time. These numbers will only be held in high esteem once the numbers overseas go up", added Ganguly.
