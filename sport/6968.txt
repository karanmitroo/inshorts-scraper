Sri Lanka's Kusal Mendis, while fielding at short-leg, was turning around in self-defence when the ball driven by Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman went on to hit him in his groin and he managed to catch it without looking at it. The catch helped Sri Lanka dismiss Bangladesh for 312 runs and take a 182-run first innings lead as a result.
