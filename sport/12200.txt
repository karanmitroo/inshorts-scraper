The 11th Olympic Games, played in Berlin, Germany, in 1936, were opened by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. He initially allowed only Aryan Germans to represent Germany, but later added one Jewish athlete when other nations threatened to boycott the Games. The 1936 Games, which introduced the torch relay, were also the first to be televised.
