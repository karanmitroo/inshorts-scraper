Australian vice-captain David Warner said he and some of his teammates suffered "mental breakdown" over a lack of resting period between Ashes and last month's ODI series. He, however, added, "We're never going to put our hand up to say we need a rest, that's for sure." Notably, Warner is the only Australian to play all formats since November 23.
