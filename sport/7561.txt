Sima Azimi, a 20-year-old Afghan girl, has formed a club to train young Afghan girls in Wushu, an ancient Chinese martial art. Sima learned the sport in Iran and came to Kabul to form the Shaolin Wushu club a year ago. The club's members belong to a Shi'ite group called Hazara, which has been targeted by IS in the past.
