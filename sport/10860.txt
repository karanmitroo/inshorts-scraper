Tennis player Andy Murray has hit out at TV crew, after cameras zoomed in inside his kit bag to reveal tactical match notes during the China Open final last week. "I just asked this week... I don't mind the camera being on me at the change of ends but just not be right inside my bag, if possible," said Murray.
