Brazilian footballer Kaka was sent off for alleged "violent" conduct during the final minutes of his side Orlando City's MLS match against New York Red Bulls. The former AC Milan and Real Madrid player was trying to diffuse the situation after a scuffle broke out on the touchline, and jokingly tussled with his opponent and former teammate Aurelien Collin.
