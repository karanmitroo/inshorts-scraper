UAE's Football Association is offering free entry at their team's 2018 World Cup qualifier against Australia in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. UAE won its previous match, an away game, 2-1 against Japan and a win against Australia will boost the team's chances to qualify for the tournament. UAE has featured only once in the FIFA World Cup, in 1990.
