Rising Pune Supergiant player Ben Stokes dismissed Delhi Daredevils' Mohammed Shami by taking a catch at the boundary on Friday. Shami played a short towards the deep midwicket boundary where Stokes caught it before losing his balance. He threw the ball in the air, hopped across the boundary to regain balance, and caught the ball again.
