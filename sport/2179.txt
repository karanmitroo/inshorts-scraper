Bangladesh cricketer Mashrafe Mortaza said he is donning jersey number 0 in the Bangladesh Premier League to make a "fresh start". He added he changed his jersey initially from 20 to 2 and now from 2 to 0 to "complete the circle". Mortaza said he was inspired by ex-South Africa batsman Herschelle Gibbs, who used to wear jersey number '00'.
