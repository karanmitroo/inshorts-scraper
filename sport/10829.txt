Mixed martial arts fighter Holly Holm won the Guinness World Record Trophy as she is the only professional boxer and mixed martial artist to capture world championships in both sports. The 19-time boxing champion won the UFC belt in November 2015, when she knocked out former champion Ronda Rousey with a high left head kick at the UFC 193.
