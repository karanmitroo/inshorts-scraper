A football referee pulled out a gun while officiating a match in Brazil's Passos after being allegedly hit by a player. The referee, who works as a police officer, jogged to the sideline and retrieved his gun and handcuffs. He said, "I made the decision to act in my capacity as an officer and arrest a citizen who assaulted me."
