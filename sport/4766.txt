After Virat Kohli publicly said that he respected Anil Kumble's comments post his resignation, Kumble has refused to comment further on the issue. Kohli had said that what happens in the dressing room is "sacred" and the team respects its sanctity. Kumble then said, "I've said what I wanted to...I am too seasoned. You will get nothing out of me."
