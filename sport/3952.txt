Eight-time Olympic gold winner Usain Bolt, who won the 100m heats at the world championships in London on Saturday, described his performance as "very bad". The 30-year-old registered a timing of 10.07 seconds and is looking to add to his 11 world championship titles. The Jamaican blamed the starting blocks used at the event for his bad start.
