In addition to awarding medals to the top three performers, the International Olympic Committee also gives diplomas to the best eight athletes in each event. This tradition has continued since the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, where only the top 2 performers received a diploma, in addition to the winner being crowned with an olive wreath.
