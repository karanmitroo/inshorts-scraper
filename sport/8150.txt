East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan has said he will impose a fine on himself for unprofessional behaviour, after two players of the team missed practice due to miscommunication. "I did not inform Jackichand (Singh) to come for practice...Rafique went to Central Park as he thought the practice was there...I will impose a fine on myself for the mistake," said Morgan.
