Responding to a user's question on a Twitter Q&A session, Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi said the player he hates the most is Gautam Gambhir. The all-rounder further added that he 'will never' be friends with Gambhir. The two cricketers were notably involved in an altercation in an ODI in 2006 when Gambhir ran into Afridi while running between the wickets.
