A video captured by a drone explores the height drop along China's Mount Hua skywalk, which is called "the world's most dangerous" hike. The skywalk's network of wooden boards runs along the 2,160-metre mountain in China's Shaanxi province. According to UNESCO, the area contains over 300 stone tablets and 570 rock inscriptions, some of them over 1,000 years old.
