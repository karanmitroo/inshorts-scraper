Former West Indies captain Sir Viv Richards' 189-run knock, played against England on May 31, 1984, was named the "greatest ODI innings of all time" by cricket magazine Wisden. During the innings, Richards set two records, which remain unbroken till date. His runs constituted  69.48% of the team's total, which is the highest percentage of runs in a completed innings.
