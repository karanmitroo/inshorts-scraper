Pakistan's hockey team, which faces India in the Asian Champions Trophy in Malaysia on Sunday, has been asked to not talk about the game. "Given the existing tensions between the countries, we've asked our players to not only avoid statements on the match but also keep calm and cool no matter what the result," a Pakistan Hockey Federation official said.
