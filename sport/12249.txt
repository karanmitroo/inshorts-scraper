A two-minute video features two of the ten refugees, Popole Misenga and Yolande Mabika, selected for the first ever Olympic refugee team to compete in Rio de Janeiro. Both the athletes fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo and will be competing in Judo in the 2016 Olympic Games. "I am fighting because I am representing the refugees," Yolande said.
