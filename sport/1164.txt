Former Pakistani captain Javed Miandad has said that Pakistan's cricket will not die if they don't play with India. "[India] don't want to play with us so be it. We should move on and forget about them," he added. India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012-13 owing to political tensions between the two countries.
