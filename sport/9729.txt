South Africa's stand-in captain Faf du Plessis, who was fined 100% match fees for ball tampering in a recently-concluded Test, has scored an unbeaten 118 on the first day of the Adelaide Test against Australia. He had pleaded not guilty to the ball tampering fine, saying, "I feel I've done nothing wrong....not like I was trying to cheat or anything."
