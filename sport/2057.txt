Coach Ravi Shastri has backed MS Dhoni, saying those criticising the two-time World Cup-winning former skipper should first look back at their own careers. "It is the duty of the team to back the legend," Shastri added. Shastri's comments come after ex-cricketers like Ajit Agarkar and VVS Laxman raised questions about Dhoni's T20I future.
