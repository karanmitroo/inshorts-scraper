Australian captain Steve Smith on Tuesday wished South Africa's Hashim Amla for his 100th Test. Smith said Amla has been incredibly consistent and he is everything one wants in a Test cricketer. The 27-year-old further added that he has always hated captaining against Amla as he's so hard to set the field to.
