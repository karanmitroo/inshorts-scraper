A nightclub in London, which allegedly barred a group of American football NFL players for being "too urban", is being accused of racial profiling. The New Orleans Saints team members had booked a table at the club, but on arrival, the bouncer turned them away for being "too urban", a phrase often used as a euphemism for black.
