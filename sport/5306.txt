Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar had to leave for Mumbai due to his father's death after playing one match in the 1999 World Cup. Tendulkar rejoined the team after spending just four days at home and scored 140* on return against Kenya to lead India to victory. The batsman later dedicated the century to his father.
