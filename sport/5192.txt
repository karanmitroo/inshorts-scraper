The Champions Trophy 2017 is the first major ICC tournament that West Indies will not participate in. The Caribbean side failed to qualify as they were not among the top eight ODI teams as per ICC rankings on September 30, 2015, the cut-off date for the tournament. Bangladesh ranked seventh, and Pakistan, placed eighth, qualified for the eight-nation tournament.
