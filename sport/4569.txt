Phil Simmons, who led the West Indies to their second World T20 title in 2016, has applied for the position of the Indian cricket team's head coach. Simmons, who has also coached Ireland and Zimbabwe, was sacked by the West Indies Cricket Board in September 2016 due to "differences in culture and strategic approach".
