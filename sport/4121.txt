Ross Whiteley, playing for first-class English county club Worcestershire, smashed six sixes in an over on Sunday, becoming the first ever Englishman and sixth player overall in professional cricket to achieve the feat. Playing in the NatWest T20 Blast clash against Yorkshire, Whiteley scored 65 runs off 26 balls but failed to help his side win the match.
