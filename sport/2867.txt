A Sikh student in Pennsylvania, US, was barred from playing a high school-level football match by a referee for wearing a turban. The referee reportedly cited National Federation of High School Soccer rules that state, "Illegal equipment shall not be worn by any player." The school officials have opened a probe to find if the player's religious rights were violated.
