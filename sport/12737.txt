Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has voiced his concern with the use of large light-weight bats, which is making the game of cricket more one-sided in favour of the batsmen. Ponting claims that large light-weight bats provide an undue advantage to batsmen. He, however, believes that such bats may be used for shorter formats.
