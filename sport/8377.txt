Pakistan Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq has criticized former Australian skipper Ian Chappell for publicly asking Cricket Australia to not invite them for future tours. "If we apply Chappell's comments to Australia, does that mean if they continue to get whitewashed on the subcontinent on a regular basis then they should also not travel there?," Misbah wrote in a column.
