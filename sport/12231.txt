Aftab Farook, who captained Italy’s under-19 cricket team, was reportedly arrested for plotting an IS-related terror attack, and subsequently expelled from the country. Farook, who hails from Pakistan, was caught on a wire-tap speaking about attacking targets in Milan and Bergamo. Italy’s Interior Minister said there was evidence against Farook, who planned to travel to Syria.
