British Olympic champion Adam Peaty won 100m breaststroke gold at the European Short Course Championships before giving away his medal to a fan. Peaty, who set a new European record in the process in Copenhagen, later posed for a photograph with an empty medal box. Notably, Peaty had won the gold medal in the 100m breaststroke at the 2016 Olympics.
