Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma took to Instagram to troll Yuzvendra Chahal after the latter shared a picture of himself standing with a golf club. Rohit commented on the picture, writing, "Khud mat ud jayiyo golf stick ke saath," to which the leg-spinner replied, "@rohitsharma45 haha stick hoti to shayad udd jata but it's called a golf club bhaiya."
