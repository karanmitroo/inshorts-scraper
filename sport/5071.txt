Bangladeshi cricketer Arafat Sunny has been denied bail after his second wife accused him of hiding his first marriage from her. Sunny's second wife is demanding a divorce, but the cricketer wants to keep both wives, as Bangladeshi law allows four wives. The spinner was arrested in January after his second wife accused him of demanding dowry and torturing her.
