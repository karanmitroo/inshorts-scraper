The Ultra-edge technology, which is a part of the Decision Review System (DRS), helps in discerning between the sounds created by the bat, pads, and clothing during the run of play. The technology uses the stump microphones to differentiate clearly between the sounds created by different sources, which helps in deciding the close-calls in LBWs and bat-pad situations.
