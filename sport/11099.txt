BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said the Lodha Panel's order to banks to 'block BCCI accounts' ruined the Board's reputation. "Is this how you treat the world's richest cricket body which has run the sport so efficiently? It has completely destroyed our hard-earned reputation," said Thakur, adding, a final decision on the ongoing India-NZ series will be taken on Tuesday.
