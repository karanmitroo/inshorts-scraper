Spanish football giant Barcelona have sacked Pere Gratacos, a director at the club, who said forward Lionel Messi would not be a good player without his teammates. His statement came after Barcelona's victory in Copa del Rey last 16. "He's very important but it was the team who won... Without others, he wouldn't be such a good player," Gratacos said.
