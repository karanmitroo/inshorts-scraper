India's Thirush Kamini became the first woman cricketer across formats to be given out for obstructing the field, during an ODI against West Indies on Sunday. A batsman is given out if he or she deliberately blocks the ball to avoid a runout. Among male cricketers, Ben Stokes is the most recent to get dismissed in this manner in 2015.
