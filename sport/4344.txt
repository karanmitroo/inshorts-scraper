World number one Andy Murray corrected a journalist's comment, which was termed to be 'casually sexist', at Wednesday's press conference following his Wimbledon exit. The reporter was pointing out to Murray that his quarter-final opponent Sam Querrey was "the first US player to reach a major semi-final since 2009", following which Murray interrupted the reporter and said, "Male player."
