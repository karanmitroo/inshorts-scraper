Windies' batsman Shai Hope has become the first-ever cricketer to register a double-digit score in each of his first 20 ODI innings. Hope achieved the feat during the fifth ODI against England on Friday, surpassing former Australian batsman Michael Bevan, who had scored in double-digits in all of his first 19 ODI innings.
