There have only been two instances of both teams scoring 400+ in an ODI. India and Sri Lanka's Rajkot ODI on December 15, 2009, was the second such instance, with India winning by three runs after posting 414. Incidentally, the first such occasion coincided with the first-ever 400+ ODI score, when Australia and South Africa combined for 872 runs.
