Australian pacer Jackson Bird clean bowled Pakistan's Younis Khan with a delivery that came back in slightly after pitching, in the ongoing Boxing Day Test. Bird set up Younis with a few deliveries going away from the batsman and managed to produce a gap between bat and pad with the wicket-taking ball. The Pakistani batsman was dismissed for 21.
