Hobart Hurricanes' Clive Rose hit a full-length delivery over point for a six during Big Bash League on Sunday. Sydney Thunder's Pat Cummins had given just three runs off the first four balls of the last over before Rose, who tried to guide the ball over point, timed it well enough to cross the boundary.
