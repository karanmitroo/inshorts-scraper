Ravichandran Ashwin has said New Zealand's Luke Ronchi was someone whom he wanted to get out "pretty badly". "Ronchi hit me through the covers throughout the series quite frequently, so much that it took a hit on my pride and ego," said Ashwin, while dissecting his seven-wicket haul. He finished with a career-best 7/59 in the final Test at Indore.
