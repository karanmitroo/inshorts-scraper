The Pakistani junior hockey team did not play in either edition of the Junior Hockey World Cup won by India. India's first title came in 2001 when Pakistan failed to qualify for the tournament after losing in the playoffs, while the Pakistani team were absent from the 2016 edition after missing the visa application deadline.
