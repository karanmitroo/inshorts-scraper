Australian club Melbourne City's Tim Cahill was sent off by the referee before he could step on the field as a substitute in the match against Melbourne Victory. The player was protesting against the decision to award the opponents a goal which was earlier flagged as offside. Interestingly, City continued with 11 players as the substitution had not taken place.
