Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni slammed a 145-ball 183*, the highest-ever individual ODI score by a wicketkeeper, batting at number three against Sri Lanka on October 31, 2005. Dhoni, who smashed 15 fours and 10 sixes in his knock, overtook ex-Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who had scored 172 against Zimbabwe in 2004. The century was Dhoni's second ODI hundred.
