Kashmiri footballer Ishfaq Ahmad, who represented India for 14 years, was given a government job as a physical education teacher and was asked to teach dance to school children. “I am a footballer and they want me to teach cultural activities to school kids…its like asking an aeronautical engineer to assemble a cycle,” said Ahmad, who has threatened to quit.
