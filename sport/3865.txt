An Indian ultramarathon runner, who took up a challenge of running 10,000 kilometres in 100 days in Mumbai, fell short of the last 36 kilometres after falling sick. Samir Singh, also called the 'Faith Runner', lived on just â‚¹200 a day, with donated clothes, a GPS tracker and an emergency phone. The 44-year-old is now preparing for a 40,000-kilometre run.
