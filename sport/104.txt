The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has revealed that cricketers of three teams playing in the ongoing edition of the Pakistan Super League were approached by two bookies via social media websites. The cricketers thwarted the bookies' attempts by reporting the matter to PCB's Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU). The two bookies reportedly belong to Bangladesh and India respectively.
