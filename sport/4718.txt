After Jaipur Traffic Police, Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah was trolled by Pakistan's Faisalabad Police for his no-ball in the Champions Trophy final. Faisalabad Police shared the poster with the same message which Jaipur Traffic Police had shared for road safety. The poster showed Bumrah overstepping, with the caption, "Don't cross the line. You know it can be costly."
