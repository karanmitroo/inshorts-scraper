A former coach of the Uttar Pradesh Ranji team has said Suresh Raina has become a "reluctant cricketer" after marriage. "His priorities have changed...I have noticed he has not been concentrating on his game...He just played three Ranji matches for UP this season and didn't turn out for Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare tournaments," the coach was quoted as saying.
