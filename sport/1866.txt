All of Indian captain Virat Kohli's five Test double centuries have come against different oppositions. Before his 213 against Sri Lanka on Sunday, Kohli had scored double tons against Windies, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. The 29-year-old's double ton against Sri Lanka in the second Test is also the 50th double ton by an Indian batsman.
