At an event in Delhi recently, former British PM David Cameron was asked why the English cricket team 'sucked', in reference to their recent losses against India. "They say, pride can come before a fall," replied Cameron, adding, "We've seen ups and downs...but, the exciting thing is India are ranked one and England second...It's going to be a good contest."
