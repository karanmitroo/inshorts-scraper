Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said that he will never forgive former teammate Chris Cairns and hopes to never cross paths with him again. McCullum had testified against his former teammate during a perjury trial in London in December 2015, which found Cairns to be not guilty of charges relating to alleged match-fixing.
