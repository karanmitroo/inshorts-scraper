Sachin Tendulkar refused to shoot for a soft-drink advertisement which would show him smashing cricket balls with a fly swatter. The cricketer reportedly told the film-maker, "That would make me greater than the game," after which the ad was modified and Sachin was shown hitting the cricket balls with a stump. Tendulkar retired from international cricket on November 16, 2013.
