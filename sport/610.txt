Manjot Kalra, whose unbeaten 101 helped India win the Under-19 World Cup final on Saturday, became only the second Indian after Unmukt Chand to score a ton in a 50-over ICC World Cup final. India have played three men's, two women's and six Under-19 World Cup finals so far. Chand had slammed 111* in the 2012 Under-19 World Cup final.
