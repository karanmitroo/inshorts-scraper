Adelaide Strikers' 35-year-old fast bowler Ben Laughlin pulled off a "flying" catch to dismiss Perth Scorchers' Michael Klinger in the Big Bash League on Saturday. Klinger scooped a Michael Neser delivery towards mid-off, where Laughlin jumped towards his right and caught the ball with both hands. Ben Laughlin is the leading wicket-taker in Big Bash League's history.
