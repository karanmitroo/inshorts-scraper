Afghanistan's teenage spinner Rashid Khan got "angry" at Colin Munro, who had attempted a reverse sweep shot off his bowling in the Caribbean Premier League match between Guyana Amazon Warriors and Trinbago Knight Riders. Following Munro's shot, which landed near the fielder at point, Rashid walked up to him and gave him a stare. Rashid recently claimed CPL's first hat-trick.
