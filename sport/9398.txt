Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag recalled that he once advised Sachin Tendulkar to step out while batting against England spinner Ashley Giles, which resulted in Sachin getting dismissed stumped out. "Tendulkar said that only once in my career I have got out stumped in Test cricket and that's because of you," Sehwag said about the incident.
