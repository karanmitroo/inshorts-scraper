Speaking about MS Dhoni's early career, ex-India coach John Wright said the right-hander's 148-run innings in Vizag against Pakistan "made someone like Sehwag look rather pedestrian". Wright also spoke about Virat Kohli's appointment as team's captain, adding, "Virat has the right people around the team. Hope he will leave a little better when he finishes than when he found it."
