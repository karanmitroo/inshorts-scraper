Boxer Floyd Mayweather will use the money he gets from his upcoming bout with MMA fighter Conor McGregor to pay his taxes from 2015. Mayweather reportedly filed a tax petition on July 5 with USA's Internal Revenue Service, which stated, "The taxpayer has a significant liquidity event scheduled...from which he intends to pay the balance of the 2015 tax liability."
