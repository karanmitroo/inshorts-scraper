Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was trolled on Twitter for posting an endorsement tweet for a Chinese smartphone brand using 'Twitter for iPhone'. Ashwin used his 'carrom ball' reference to endorse the phone, at which a user tweeted, "Carrom ball one day me fail ho gayi issliye australia series se bahar." Another tweet read, "Quality bowler supporting a Chinese brand???"
