American tennis player Coco Vandeweghe gave her broken racquet to a fan during her second round match against France's Pauline Parmentier in the Australian Open. Vandeweghe had frustratedly smashed her racquet into the court thrice after losing a point during the second set. Vandeweghe, then, gave the racquet to a young fan who was sitting in the stands.
