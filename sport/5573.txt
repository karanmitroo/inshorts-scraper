Chelsea players Diego Costa and David Luiz stormed the post-match press conference after sealing the Premier League title, and dragged manager Antonio Conte away to celebrate. Luiz and Costa shouted, "Champions, thank you," and signalled at the journalists to leave. Chelsea secured their fifth Premier League title on Friday with a 1-0 win over West Brom.
