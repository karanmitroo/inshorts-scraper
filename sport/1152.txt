Debutant Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah bowled South Africa's AB de Villiers to take his maiden Test wicket on Friday. Bumrah took the wicket on the last ball of his 11th over, with a 140kmph delivery that took the inside edge and hit the off-stump. Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, and David Warner were Bumrah's maiden dismissals in IPL, ODIs, and T20Is.
