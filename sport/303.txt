Team India captain Virat Kohli is the only Indian cricketer to score a century on World Cup debut. Kohli achieved the feat by slamming 100*(83) as a 22-year-old against Bangladesh in India's World Cup opener on February 19, 2011. The hundred was Kohli's fifth in international cricket and helped India beat Bangladesh by 87 runs.
