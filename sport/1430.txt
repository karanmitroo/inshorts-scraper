Several Pakistani fans photoshopped India captain Virat Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma's honeymoon selfie and added Pakistani locations in the background. The original picture, which has a snow-filled background, was reportedly taken in Finland. In the photoshopped pictures, the couple is seen posing in front of iconic monuments of Pakistan and also in front of shops.
