The official Instagram account of sports merchandise group Yonex was hacked on Saturday, with the hackers posting fake news of the group parting ways with Indian shuttler PV Sindhu. Yonex immediately fixed the account and apologised to the Indian shuttler. "I accepted their apology for this incident...Iâ€™m going to stay with Yonex without any problem," Sindhu later said.
