Marylebone Cricket Club's World Cricket Committee has disapproved Sachin Tendulkar's 'two-balls, two-pitches' theory for first-class matches. Tendulkar had suggested playing Ranji games on two pitches to prepare a better team for overseas tours. "We talked about the conflict between using first-class matches as training and the fact that they are a proper competition," the committee Chairman said.
