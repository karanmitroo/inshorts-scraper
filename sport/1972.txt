The BCCI has changed the start timings of the first and second ODI between India and Sri Lanka scheduled for next month owing to the dew factor and forecasted cold weather conditions. The matches, scheduled to be held in Dharamsala and Mohali on December 10 and December 13 respectively, will start at 11:30 AM instead of 1.30 PM.
