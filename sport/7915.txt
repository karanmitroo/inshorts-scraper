Former Indian women's team captain Diana Edulji is the only ex-cricketer to be a part of the four-member panel appointed by the Supreme Court to run the BCCI. The 61-year-old Edulji represented India in 20 Tests and 34 ODIs between 1976 and 1993. "I'm really shocked that I'm the only player on this committee," said the former cricketer.
