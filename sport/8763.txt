Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne, along with teammate Mark Waugh, was found guilty of accepting money from a bookmaker in 1994 in exchange of leaking information. The leg-spinner was also banned from international cricket for a year for failing a drug test before the 2003 World Cup. Warne later claimed the drug was given by his mother for weight loss.
