Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq indirectly advised Pakistan's current Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq to step down from the position. "I haven't given any advice to the PCB over the captaincy issue but I think the perfect man for the job is one who can lead in all three formats," said Inzamam. Notably, Misbah led Pakistan to the top rank in Test cricket.
