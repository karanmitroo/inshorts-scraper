According to ICC rules, if umpires deem a pitch to be dangerous, they can stop play and ask both captains if they want play to be resumed. If the decision is not to resume play, officials should consider if the pitch can be repaired. If the existing pitch cannot be repaired, the match is to be deemed abandoned as drawn.
