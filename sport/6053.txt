West Indies legend Brian Lara broke Sir Garfield Sobers' world record of Test cricket's highest individual score by scoring 375 against England on April 18, 1994. Lara batted for almost 13 hours and struck 45 fours while facing almost 90 overs himself. Notably, six weeks later Lara scored the highest score in first-class history while playing for Warwickshire against Durham.
