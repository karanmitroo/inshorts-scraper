Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar took to Twitter to pay tribute to late actor Tom Alter, who took the batsman's first-ever TV interview. "Through my first ever TV interview, met a true sports lover and a good human being. You will live in our hearts forever. RIP #TomAlter," Sachin wrote. Besides an actor, Alter was also one-time sports writer.
