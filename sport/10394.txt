World number two Andy Murray has said his emotional outburst after losing the Wimbledon 2012 final made people respect him more. "In my younger years...moments of anger or frustration would spill out...but when I cried on the centre court after losing to Roger Federer, people saw me in a different light," said Murray, who is working on mental health awareness.
