Brazilian surfer Italo Ferreira recorded a 540-degree mid-air spin at the World Surf League in Gold Coast, Australia, on Friday to get a perfect score. Ferreira completed one full spin and more than half of another before landing on a wave and winning his second-round heat. "Occasionally, we see moments of just amazing brilliance," head judge Rich Porta said.
