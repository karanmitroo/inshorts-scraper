Former hockey player Ajit Pal Nandal on Wednesday adopted 21 girls from a government school in Rohtak, after being inspired by cricketer Gautam Gambhir. Gambhir had announced he would bear the education expenses of the children of CRPF martyrs killed in Sukma last month. Nandal also invited other girls to train in sports at his academy free of cost.
