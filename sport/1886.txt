Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma was seen playing with the spider cam while fielding during the first day of the second Test against Sri Lanka on Friday. Sharma grabbed the camera, blocked its view and also jumped to hold it when it was going upwards. Spider cams were first used in Tests in India in September last year.
