Indian captain Virat Kohli has deleted his tweet from 2016 welcoming Anil Kumble as coach of the team. After Kumble's appointment, Kohli had tweeted on June 23 last year that he was looking forward to Kumble's tenure and "great things" were in store for Indian cricket. After stepping down, Kumble said Kohli had reservations with his coaching style.
