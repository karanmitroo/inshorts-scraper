Boys' doubles top seeds, Hungary's Zsombor Piros and China's Wu Yibing, were asked to change their non-white underwear at Wimbledon on Wednesday, because it was not compliant with the all-white dress code. The boys were checked by the umpire during their match and given a pair to change into. On Thursday, another player was checked for wearing a non-white underwear.
