Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea reacted in 0.24 seconds to pull off a save just before halftime against Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday. Sevilla's Luis Muriel was over 6 yards away from the goal when he bulleted an over 75-kmph header towards the goal before De Gea saved it. De Gea made eight saves in the match.
