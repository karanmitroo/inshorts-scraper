The coin was tossed twice in the 2011 World Cup final, which India won against Sri Lanka six years ago on April 2. MS Dhoni and Kumar Sangakkara both thought they had won the toss in the first attempt. Referee Jeff Crowe said he had not heard Sangakkara's call, after which the toss was redone and won by Sri Lanka.
