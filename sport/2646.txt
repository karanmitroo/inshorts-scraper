India's U-17 football team goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh had to rely on his grandmother to buy him football shoes and kits as his parents were "dead against" him pursuing football. Dheeraj's father revealed the goalkeeper was a class topper in school and he didn't want him to play football. Dheeraj is now the most capped Indian player in this age group.
