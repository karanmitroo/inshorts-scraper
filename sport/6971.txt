English footballer Dele Alli, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, has set the Guinness World Record for most figure-of-eight nutmegs in 30 seconds. Alli pulled off eight successive figure-of-eight nutmegs to break the existing record of seven. 20-year-old Alli achieved the feat in his third attempt with his teammate Georges-KÃ©vin N'Koudou serving as dummy.
