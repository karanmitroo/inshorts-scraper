New Zealand pacer Lockie Ferguson became the second player to take two wickets off the first two balls of his T20I career, accomplishing the feat against Bangladesh on Tuesday. Ferguson removed Sabbir Rahman and Soumya Sarkar in the sixth over of the match, which the Kiwis won by six wickets. Former Australian cricketer Michael Kasprowicz accomplished the feat in 2005.
