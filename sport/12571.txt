Indian ODI captain MS Dhoni surpassed India's Test captain Virat Kohli to top the list of 10 sports stars with highest commercial air-time. Dhoni had previously occupied this position but was overtaken by Kohli in 2015. Commercial airtime is calculated based on the amount of time a player appears on television per second.
