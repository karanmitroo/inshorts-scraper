Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that he had not planned to hit a maximum to win the 2011 World Cup final against Sri Lanka. "I wasn't looking for a fairytale finish. It just came. I swung the bat...it went over," Dhoni said. He added it took a little time for him to realise the match was over.
