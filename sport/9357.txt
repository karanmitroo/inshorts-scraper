Romanian weightlifter Gabriel Sincraian and Russian boxer Misha Aloian have been stripped of their 2016 Rio Olympic medals by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after failing dope tests. Sincraian, who won bronze in the men's 85 kg event, tested positive for exogenous testosterone, while Aloian, silver medallist in the 52-kg boxing event, failed a test for tuaminoheptane, a stimulant.
