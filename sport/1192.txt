Basketball player Manu Ginobili attempted a pass from behind the three-point line which went through the basket but was overlooked by referees and several players during an NBA match. The ball was retrieved by an opposing player who started dribbling before Ginobili pleaded with officials to review the play. The referees eventually credited the basket to Ginobili after watching replays.
