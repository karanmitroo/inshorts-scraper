Following his inclusion in India's T20I squad for the series against Australia, 38-year-old pacer Ashish Nehra said, "Ashish Nehra accha karega toh bhi news hai, accha nahi karega toh woh aur bhi badi news hai. If I am in the team, definitely, I must be contributing something." Nehra has taken 34 wickets in 26 T20Is.
