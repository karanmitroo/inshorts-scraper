Following Zaheer Khan's dig at Virender Sehwag saying that he would gift a hockey stick to Sehwag's wife Aarti, Sehwag has replied that she has a "belan" instead. Sehwag had trolled Zaheer after the latter's engagement to actress Sagarika Ghatge, who played the role of a hockey player in Chak De! India, tweeting, "please Hockey nahi dena rakhke".
