South African cricketer JP Duminy, who plays for the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League, has withdrawn from the 10th edition of the tournament, which begins in 16 days. "It has been a very difficult decision for me to make, but it was for purely personal reasons," Duminy said about the withdrawal.
