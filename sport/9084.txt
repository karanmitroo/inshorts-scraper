Workers at the 2022 FIFA World Cup construction sites in Qatar will be provided hats which lower their body temperatures by up to 10ÂºC. The hats, which have been in production for two years, use solar-powered fans to cool the body and are likely to be released next summer. Qatar's workers will be the first to use the technology.
