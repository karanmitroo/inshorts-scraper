Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who scored a 40-ball 41 in the 4th ODI against Australia, hit a six that resulted in a lip rupture for 24-year-old spectator, Tosit Agarwal. Tosit had tried catching the ball as it sailed into the stands, before mistiming his effort and getting hit by it on his lips and teeth.
