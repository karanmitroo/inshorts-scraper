West Indies cricketer Marlon Samuels has said he would want to be a part of the Pakistan Army, after playing the Pakistan Super League final in Lahore last week. In a video, Samuels said, "I am a Pakistani at heart...I wouldn't mind coming to Pakistan if I get a metallic badge on my shoulder. I'm just waiting for the metals."
