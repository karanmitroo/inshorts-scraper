Suvarna Raj, a wheelchair-bound international para-athlete, has claimed she slept on the floor of a train after not getting the lower berth on the Nagpur-Delhi Garib Rath. Suvarna, who suffers 90% disability, was allotted an upper berth in the coach reserved for handicapped people, after which she approached authorities. They denied her request, forcing her to sleep on the floor.
