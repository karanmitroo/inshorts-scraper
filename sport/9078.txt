Karun Nair, who became India's second triple centurion in Tests against England on Monday, chipped his bat and gave the broken piece to the umpire. Karun, who was playing only his third Test innings, was on 109* when his bat chipped. He gave the broken bit to the umpire to collect it later as remembrance of his maiden Test century.
