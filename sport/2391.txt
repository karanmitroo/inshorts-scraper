American golf star Tiger Woods has pleaded guilty to reckless driving in Florida and agreed to enter a diversion programme, thereby avoiding jail time. Woods will spend a year on probation and pay a $250 fine and court costs. Since Woods was intoxicated with several drugs, according to court records, he will also be required to undergo regular drug tests.
