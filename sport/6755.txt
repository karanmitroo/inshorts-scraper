Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja bowled out Aussie captain Steve Smith by uprooting the off stump after pitching the ball outside leg, during the Ranchi Test on Monday. Smith misread the line, padding up to the ball, which spun past him and hit the off-stump. Smith was out for 21, with Jadeja dismissing Smith for the third time in this series.
