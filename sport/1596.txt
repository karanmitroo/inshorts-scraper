Belgium hockey team players caused a security scare at Bhubaneswar's Kalinga Stadium after they tried to sneak into the stadium late night with their faces painted black, reportedly for luck for their fifth-sixth playoff match. The players scaled the hotel's boundary wall before walking almost 3 km to the stadium. Police later convinced the players to return to their hotel.
