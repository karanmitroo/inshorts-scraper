Chief selector MSK Prasad has said all-rounder Hardik Pandya may be "hyper", but is a better bowling option than Stuart Binny. "He has worked hard under Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble…We all have been trying to find an all-rounder after Kapil Dev…Pandya is a better bowling option than Stuart Binny," said Prasad, while announcing the squad for the England Tests.
