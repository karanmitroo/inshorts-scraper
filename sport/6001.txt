Gujarat Lions skipper Suresh Raina has expressed disappointment at the manner at which MS Dhoni was removed from Rising Pune Supergiant's captaincy before the start of IPL 2017. "He has done so well for the country as well as for the IPL teams. He should be respected every time. It's not about me saying, it's the world saying," said Raina.
