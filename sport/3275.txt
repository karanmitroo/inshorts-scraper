The Lord's pitch was affected by a fungal infection known as 'Fairy Rings' ahead of the third Test between England and Windies. The infection caused unusual markings to appear on the pitch, with a spokesperson saying it was a natural phenomenon which would not impact play. Windies captain Jason Holder said he hoped the rings would not be visually distracting.
