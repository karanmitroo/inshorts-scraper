Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal credited coach Pullela Gopichand for her victory over PV Sindhu in the nationals final on Wednesday. "I would like to thank Gopi sir and the team for working on my movement...They have played quite an important role in this win," she said. Nehwal had reunited with Gopichand in September, three years after having parted ways.
