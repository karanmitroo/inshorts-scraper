Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has said the currency notes' demonetisation has not affected players of his era. "We took only singles and twos..we are not of 20-20's...so this has not affected players like me", he said and further added, "the way this demonetisation has happened to other players...if most people are happy with this move, then I am also happy,"
