Shooter Jitu Rai is "disappointed" with the international shooting body's decision to drop the 50-metre pistol event from competitions. The move, announced by ISSF Athletes Committee chairman Abhinav Bindra, is to make the sport gender-neutral, with a team event comprising both men and women replacing the 50-metre event. Rai is a Commonwealth and Asian Games gold medalist in 50-metre pistol.
