South African cricketer AB de Villiers has said that he will not return to assume wicketkeeping duties for the teams he plays for as it will affect his health negatively. "I'll miss the next five years if I start keeping again. My back won't allow that," De Villiers said about the prospect of wicketkeeping again.
