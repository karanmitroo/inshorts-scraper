Female cricketers will feature on the Lord's honours boards for the first time after MCC approved the decision to introduce boards for men's and women's ODIs. The decision comes after England won the Women's World Cup at Lord's, helped by Anya Shrubsole's six-wicket haul. Currently, the honours boards at the stadium are only for five-wicket hauls and centuries in Tests.
