Speaking to the media on the eve of the 3rd Test, Australian captain Steve Smith rubbished Virat Kohli's allegations that he cheated more than once while taking DRS calls in Bengaluru. "I obviously came out and said I made a mistake... In regard to saying we do it consistently... I think he was wrong in his statement," added Smith.
