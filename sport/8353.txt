Boxer Floyd Mayweather has called Dana White, President of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a "f***ing comedian" after the latter offered $25 million each to Mayweather and UFC Champion Conor McGregor for a bout. Mayweather also showed off his luxury Hublot LaFerrari watch, saying it alone costs over $200,000. Mayweather had earlier demanded $100 million to fight McGregor.
