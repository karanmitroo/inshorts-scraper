Pakistan's Asad Shafiq broke former West Indian cricketer Sir Garry Sobers' 42-year-old record of eight Test tons while batting at number six, scoring his ninth at the position against Australia on Sunday. Shafiq, who got his career's 10th Test century, had only scored 58 runs from his previous seven innings, which included three ducks.
