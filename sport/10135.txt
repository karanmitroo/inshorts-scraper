Qatar has banned alcohol in streets and other public places during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in the countryâ€™s capital, Doha. The organisers are also seeking a ban on alcohol in World Cup stadiums during the tournament. Consumption and sale of alcohol are restricted in the nation, with foreign nationals requiring a license to allow them to drink alcohol.
