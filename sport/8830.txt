The Sports Ministry on Friday temporarily suspended the Indian Olympic Association over its decision to appoint Suresh Kalmadi and Abhay Singh Chautala life presidents. The deemed recognition to the IOA has been suspended until it reverses its decision, Sports Minister Vijay Goel tweeted. IOA Associate Vice President Narinder Batra had earlier resigned from his post over the issue.
