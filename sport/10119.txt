Cheteshwar Pujara, who scored a hundred against England at Rajkot on Friday, was given out LBW before reaching his century. In the 71st over, Pujara was batting at 86 when he was adjudged LBW by on-field umpire Chris Gaffaney. Pujara sought a review, and the third umpire overturned the decision, since the Hawk-Eye showed the ball was missing the wickets.
