American distance runner Fernando Cabada has been cleared of doping charges after the United States Doping Agency (USADA) ruled he had ingested banned drug clenbuterol by eating contaminated meat. Cabada had tested positive for the banned substance as the result of an out-of-competition urine sample he provided on December 6, 2016.
