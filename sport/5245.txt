Former Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik was criticised for referring to Indian pacer Mohammed Shami's religion during a live Twitter session. Malik picked Shami as his favourite Indian bowler and said it was "not because he's a Muslim guy." Responding to it, a user tweeted, "Would've agreed with him had he not entered religion on it."
