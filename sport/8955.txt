Australian captain Steve Smith has said that in order to win, the Australian team will look to make Indian Test captain Virat Kohli “a little bit angry” during the upcoming four-Test match series. In the recently concluded series against England, Kohli scored 655 runs at an average of 109.16 and has been ranked second in Tests behind Smith.
