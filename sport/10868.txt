England's Bernard Bosanquet, the man credited with inventing the 'googly' in cricket, was born on October 13, 1877. It is said Bosanquet invented the delivery while playing billiards with some friends. The googly's first ever use is said to have been in Australia in 1903-04, when Bosanquet's delivery took out Victor Trumper's middle stump.
