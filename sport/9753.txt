Australian captain Steve Smith defended his South African counterpart Faf du Plessis on ball-tampering sanction, and said, "We along with every other team around the world shine the ball the same way." The South African captain, who was declared guilty for ball-tampering, said the Aussies will not talk about it because "they know it's part of their team as well."
