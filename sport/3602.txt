West Indies' Kieron Pollard stopped short of doing a Mankad, in which a bowler runs out the non-striker if he is outside the bowling crease before the delivery, during a CPL T20 match. Pollard stopped his run-up to signal to the non-striker that he was out of the crease, when the opposition required eight runs to win from 10 balls.
