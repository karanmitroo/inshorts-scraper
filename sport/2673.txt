Facing a possibility of missing out on a 2018 FIFA World Cup spot, Argentina's captain Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick to help his team defeat Ecuador 3-1 on Wednesday and qualify for the tournament. Messi's hat-trick came after his side conceded a goal in the game's very first minute. Argentina came into the match after going winless in four matches.
