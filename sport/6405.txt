Mark Beaumont, a British adventurer and endurance athlete, is attempting to cycle around the world in 80 days and set a world record by smashing the current record of 123 days. Beaumont's plan is to spend 75 days on his bicycle, leaving three days for flights and two days as contingency days in case something goes wrong.
