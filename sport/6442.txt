Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas made two critical saves in quick succession, thereby salvaging a draw for his team FC Porto against their rival club Benfica in Portugal's Primeira Liga on Saturday. The former Real Madrid captain first saved a shot by diving to his left before using his body to deflect the second attempt on goal off the rebound.
