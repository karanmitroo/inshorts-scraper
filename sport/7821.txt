Australia and New Zealand cricketers including Glenn Maxwell, Trent Boult and Adam Zampa recreated the underarm bowling incident which took place in 1981. Maxwell is seen advising Zampa to bowl an underarm ball to restrict New Zealand from scoring six runs off the final ball. In the video, Boult expresses disbelief and says, "They're Australians mate, they're our neighbours".
