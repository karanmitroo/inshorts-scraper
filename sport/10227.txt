India's Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid put up a 331-run stand, ODI cricket's then highest partnership, against New Zealand on November 8, 1999. Tendulkar remained not out in his 186-run innings which included 20 fours and three sixes, while Dravid scored a run-a-ball 153, with 15 fours and two sixes. The stand is now the second highest partnership in ODIs.
