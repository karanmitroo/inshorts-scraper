England's Jason Roy took a catch at the boundary, stepping just inches away from the ropes to dismiss Australia's Glenn Maxwell in the Champions Trophy on Saturday. Roy jumped full stretch to take the catch before throwing the ball in the air and stepping outside the boundary rope and jumping back inside to catch it.
