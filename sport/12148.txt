Shooter Abhinav Bindra, who finished 4th in the 10-metre air rifle event in Rio on Monday, replied to socialite Shobhaa De’s tweet on India’s Olympians. Bindra wrote, “@DeShobhaa that's a tad unfair. You should be proud of your athletes perusing human excellence against the whole world.” Earlier, De had tweeted saying Indian athletes are “clicking selfies and wasting money.”
