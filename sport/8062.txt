Indian team's chief selector MSK Prasad has said that it is too premature to discuss MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh's inclusion in World Cup 2019's squad. "We can't talk about something that is 800 or more days away," the chief selector said. "As far as Pandey, Rayudu are concerned they will have to wait for their opportunities", Prasad added.
