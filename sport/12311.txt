Australian researchers have developed a gene doping test to detect if athletes have artificially adjusted their DNA to enhance performance. Once approved by WADA, the test will be used on Rio Olympics' samples after its conclusion, IOC's medical director said. "We will absolutely not experiment at the Olympic Games. We will use tests that are validated by WADA", he added.
