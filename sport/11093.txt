Following ex-Pakistani cricketer, Javed Miandad's comments against India, BCCI President Anurag Thakur said Miandad "remains to be in shock for not being able to beat India even once in World Cup history". Thakur further said Miandad, who is related to gangster Dawood Ibrahim, should tell Dawood to come back to India, since he's "so confident about his own people".
