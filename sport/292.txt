Predicting Test cricket's future, former England captain Kevin Pietersen tweeted that in the next 10 years only England, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Australia will continue playing Test cricket. "The rest will all be white ball cricketers! Just remember this tweet!" Pietersen further wrote. Recently, England cricket team coach Trevor Bayliss said T20Is should be abolished.
