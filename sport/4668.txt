Twenty-three-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams has revealed that her "heart dropped" after she got to know of her pregnancy. Williams, who said that she had planned to win the Wimbledon 2017 title, took six home tests to finally believe her pregnancy. "I don't know what to do with a baby...I've done absolutely nothing for the baby room," she said.
