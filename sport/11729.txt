Cricketer Stuart Binny's wife and TV presenter, Mayanti Langer on Wednesday posted a letter on Twitter, responding to people who trolled her after Binny bowled a 32-run over in the first T20I against West Indies. "Taunting me with suicide is shameful. I hope no one demands the death of your loved ones or sends images threatening the same," wrote Langer.
