Football fans were forced to drink water from toilets as they were not allowed to carry water bottles inside Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium during India's FIFA Under-17 World Cup opener on Friday. According to reports, stalls were not put up to provide water. There was also a delay in bringing a carrier containing water bottles due to security checks.
