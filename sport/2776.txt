Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has sold a replica of one of his four Ballon d'Or trophies for approximately ₹4.6 crore (£530,000) at an auction to raise funds for charity. Ronaldo's 2013 trophy replica was bought by one of Israel's richest persons, billionaire Idan Ofer, with the proceeds going to kids with life-threatening or terminally ill medical conditions.
