Poker player Walter Fisher, who was under a $100,000 debt, lost over 31 kgs after a fellow poker player bet that he would give Fisher $1 million if he could reduce his body fat to under 10% in six months. Fisher underwent intensive weight loss training and consumed around 1,000 calories a day in order to win the bet.
