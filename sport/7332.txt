Despite the Committee of Administrators barring disqualified BCCI officials from attending the IPL auction, Rajiv Shukla addressed the franchise owners as the IPL Governing Council's chairman. Shukla, however, stood disqualified after having already served 9 years with the UP Cricket Association, according to reports. The officials were asked to self-assess their eligibility to attend the auction.
