Austrian MMA fighter Wilhelm 'The Amazing' Ott hit multiple punches at the referee, who failed to stop the fight after Ott had tapped out in his match against Nihad Nasufovic. Nasufovic performed a rear choke on Ott, who submitted while the referee looked on instead of breaking the two fighters apart. The referee was left defending himself against the cage.
