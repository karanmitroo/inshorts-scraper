The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to test the validity of the life ban imposed on pacer S Sreesanth. The apex court has demanded the cricket board to come up with a justification in four weeks. The 34-year-old was handed a life ban by the cricket board after he was named in the Indian Premier League spot-fixing case.
