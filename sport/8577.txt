Former New Zealand player Dennis Smith took a wicket with the first ball of Test career, against England. Smith, who was born on January 8, 1913, was unable to pick up another wicket in his career as he played only a single Test match. The only other bowler to hold the unique record is South Africa's Hardus Viljoen.
