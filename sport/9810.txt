England pacer Stuart Broad has said he learnt tricks about bowling on subcontinent tracks from former Indian pacer Zaheer Khan. "I remember Zaheer Khan was very good...bowling slightly off pace and then really surprise you with a quick inswinger. That's something Jimmy (Anderson) and I talked about," said Broad, who claimed four wickets in India's second innings in Vizag Test.
