Three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray mocked US President Donald Trump after he said he "took a pass" on being named Time's Person of the Year. Trump claimed he turned it down as he didn't want to do an interview. Murray jokingly cited Trump's excuse for why he wouldn't be able to accept BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award.
