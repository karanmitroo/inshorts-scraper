A supporter group of Bengaluru FC has started 'Beds for Traveling Fans' campaign, to provide accommodation for the fans travelling to watch India's AFC Asian Cup qualification match against the Kyrgyz Republic in Bengaluru on Tuesday. "No need to check into hotels brothers, just walk into our houses. We will host you," said a member of the supporter group.
