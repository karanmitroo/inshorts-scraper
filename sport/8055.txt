Former cricketer Virender Sehwag shared a picture of a sketch of MS Dhoni, made by Sehwag's elder son, Aaryavir. Sehwag tweeted, "Pic 1 is a sketch of @msdhoni made by my elder son Aaryavir. Even in this sketch, Maahi maar raha hai. #JaiNataraj." "Maahi maar raha hai" is a dialogue from Dhoni's recently released biopic 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story'.
