After Hardik Pandya got run-out in the second Test after failing to ground his bat, a user tweeted, "When you think that your salary has got you covered for the month #SAvIND #Pandya." Other tweets read, "Mondays are hard", "Me trying to fulfill my responsibilities. #SAvIND", and "Me: Sirf ek night padhke exam pass kar lunga! Result: #INDvSA".
