After ex-Australian pacer Brett Lee shared a picture of Sachin Tendulkar's 'biggest fan' who had his tattoo on the shoulder, Sachin replied, "Thanks Binga! You've at last yorked me here...A big thank you to the fan for...his support." Reacting to it, Lee wrote, "Haha Even though...I yorked you, you'd probably find a way to deflect it down a third man."
