Melbourne Stars' Glenn Maxwell pulled off a rebound catch after stopping the ball with one hand to dismiss Melbourne Renegades' Tim Ludeman in BBL on Friday. After Ludeman slashed the ball towards off-side, Maxwell, fielding at point, jumped and got his right hand to the ball before diving behind to complete the catch. Maxwell took four catches in the match.
