Haryana Ranji captain Amit Mishra tweeted a photo on Sunday that showed the Lahli ground in Rohtak covered in smog ahead of the final day of their Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan. "This is the condition today @Lahli. Hope we will get some play today," tweeted Mishra. Poor visibility has delayed the start of several Ranji Trophy matches.
