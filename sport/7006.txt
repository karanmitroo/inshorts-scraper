Under new cricket laws, the bat need not be grounded when the bails are dislodged during a runout if it was already grounded beyond the crease once. In such cases of bat bouncing off, the batsman will be not out. Additionally, the modes of dismissal have been reduced to nine, with 'handled the ball' being subsumed into 'obstructing the field'.
