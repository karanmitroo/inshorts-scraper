Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag has said that if the International Cricket Council wants cricket to be included in Olympics, the sport should be played in more countries. "I think it is ICC's call...Twelve teams (full members) are not enough," Sehwag added. The only time cricket was part of Olympics was in the 1900 Paris Games.
