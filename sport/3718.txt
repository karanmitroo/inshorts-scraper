Tennis player Maria Sharapova has revealed in her autobiography that Serena Williams called her "a little b***h" after the former won the Wimbledon in 2004 aged 17. "What I heard when I came in to the locker room was [Serena] bawling," wrote Sharapova. She further said that her poor head-to-head record against Serena was because she "heard her cry".
