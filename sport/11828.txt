Indian tennis player Mahesh Bhupathi has said that the Indian men's doubles duo of Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna didn't practise together enough to have a decent chance of winning a medal in Rio. "[Medal] was never going to happen in doubles. Our best bet was mixed (doubles), but unfortunately we came close, but it did not happen,” added Bhupathi.
