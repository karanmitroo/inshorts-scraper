Tea was taken mid-over during the India-England Test at Vizag on Thursday after a dog invaded the pitch. The animal ran onto the ground after the second ball of 57th over, with officials trying to chase him away. However, he continued running around the ground with the officials following him, while the players looked on before walking off the field.
