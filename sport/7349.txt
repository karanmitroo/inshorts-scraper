Kevin Pietersen has suggested that this year's Indian Premier League player auction was "another slap in Test cricket's face". "A T20 specialist becomes one of the current England team's richest players," said Pietersen. His comments come after England pacer Tymal Mills, who only plays T20 cricket, was bought for  â‚¹12 crore by the Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise in the auction.
