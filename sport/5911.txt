James Beattie, a former England footballer and current coach of Leeds United, rescued two children and their mother from a yacht stricken by a ferry in Dorset, England, on Sunday. Beattie, along with three other people, jumped a barrier when they heard the women crying for help. The yacht's lines were stuck in the ferry's workings, which risked crushing it.
