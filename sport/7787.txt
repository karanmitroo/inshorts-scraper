The 'Big Three' model, which was adopted by the International Cricket Council in 2014, gives the major share of ICC's revenue to three countries, namely India, England, and Australia. The allocation is based on the three countries' contribution to the council. Accordingly, India would get 20.3%, England 4.4%, and Australia 2.7% of the total revenue for the 2015-2023 cycle.
