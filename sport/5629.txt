Linesman Andrew McWilliam was jokingly shown a red card by referee Craig Thomson after he threw up near the corner flag in a Scottish Premiership match between Dundee United and Kilmarnock last Saturday. The linesman was seen vomiting while being cheered on by the crowd before the referee's red card. McWilliam continued with the match, which Dundee won 1-0.
