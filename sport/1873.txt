Australian pacer Mitchell Starc damaged England captain Joe Root's helmet with a 144 kmph bouncer during the third day of the first Ashes Test on Saturday. Root took his eyes off the ball and could not duck before the ball hit his helmet's grille. After an assessment from the doctor, Root continued and was unbeaten on 5 at stumps.
