Use of profanities during energy intensive tasks like weight lifting and cycling boosts performance, psychologists have found. When people repeatedly cursed during a half-minute bike challenge, their peak power rose by 24 watts on average, according to the study. Further, in a 10-second grip task, the swearers were found to boost their strength by an equivalent of 2.1 kg.
