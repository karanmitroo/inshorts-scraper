The BCCI's acting president CK Khanna said, "If 20,000 people in the stands did not have a problem and the Indian team did not face any issue, I wonder why Sri Lankan team made a big fuss." Khanna also said that he will ask the BCCI secretary to write to the Sri Lankan cricket board about the incident.
