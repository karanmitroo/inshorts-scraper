Former England spinner Graeme Swann has said that Australian quick Mitchell Starc's 'ball of the Ashes' would have claimed Sachin Tendulkar's wicket "1,000 times out of 1,000". Swann claimed that the ball was unplayable and would have also dismissed Don Bradman and Steve Smith. "That is the best ball I have seen live in Test cricket," Swann further said.
