Belgium's top-ranked tennis player David Goffin was forced to retire in his Rotterdam Open semifinal against Grigor Dimitrov after he was hit in his left eye by a ball which bounced off his own racquet. World number seven, Goffin, had hurt his ankle at last year's French Open after tangling with a cover at the back of the court.
