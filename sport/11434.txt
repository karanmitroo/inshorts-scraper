South African captain AB de Villiers has revealed in his autobiography that his childhood friend Gerrit Deist, who’s older to him by 11 years, is the toughest bowler he’s faced. He describes Deist as a ‘tall, strong fast bowler’ who once took away his favourite cap autographed by Jonty Rhodes, after de Villiers dropped a catch off his bowling.
