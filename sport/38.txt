Nisar Ahmed, a 15-year-old Indian sprinter who underwent a three-week training stint in Jamaica, said he took eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt's autograph on his running shoes. "It will remind me to do hard work and reach the next level in near future," said Nisar, whose father is a rickshaw-puller. Nisar was among 13 athletes who trained in Jamaica.
