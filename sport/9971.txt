Footballer Paul Pogba's dab celebration has been used in a maths problem by a French teacher. The problem states, "A perfect dab is only if the triangles represented in the figure below are rectangles. Is Paul Pogba's dab perfect?" The question is followed by a graphic with Pogba in his trademark pose, with two triangles with measurements marked out.
