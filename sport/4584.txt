Reacting to Indian women's team's Smriti Mandhana being called 'Female version of Sehwag', Virender Sehwag tweeted that instead of being that, Smriti is the first of her kind and unique. "She is the first version of Smriti and is really special. Every Indian who loves sports will be proud of her. Wish her and the team the best," tweeted Sehwag.
