Sports Minister Vijay Goel conducted a surprise check at Delhi's Indira Gandhi stadium, venue of the Asian Wrestling Championships, and cleaned the toilet himself after finding it dirty. Goel's visit came after international wrestlers reportedly complained about dirty washrooms, saying they had to relieve themselves in the open. Goel also pulled up Sports Authority of India officials at the venue.
