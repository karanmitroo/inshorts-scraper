American football side Portland Timbers have signed a five-year-old cancer patient, Derrick Tellez, as the team's goalkeeper, as part of non-profit organisation Make-A-Wish's campaign. Derrick, who is on the Timbers roster for this weekend's match against Orlando City, has had three surgeries to treat a cancerous brain tumour. The kid has been given the number 100 jersey.
