Retired boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr threw a birthday party and gifted his son, Zion, a Mercedes-Benz car on the latter's 16th birthday. Zion posted pictures from the party on his Instagram account, which showed American rapper Young Thug performing at the party. Zion and his friends flung around fake dollar bills, with the party having bottle service and dancers.
