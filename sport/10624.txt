Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri missed out on winning his career's first PGA Tour title after he finished third at Malaysia's CIMB Classic on Sunday. Justin Thomas successfully defended his title second time in a row at the $7 million competition. This was the 29-year-old Indian golfer's best finish on the PGA Tour.
