Roll Ball is a team sport that combines aspects of roller-skating, basketball and handball. Each team in Roll Ball consists of 12 players, 6 on the field and 6 in reserve. All players are on roller skates and can hold the ball in single or both hands, even when passing the ball, which should be repeatedly bounced.
