Sydney Sixer's Nic Maddinson timed his jump perfectly to complete a catch at the boundary line before losing his balance and crossing the rope. Maddinson, however, threw the ball up to keep it in the game before stepping back inside the fence and completing the catch to dismiss Brisbane Heat's Alex Ross in the Big Bash League on Tuesday.
