South African spinner Tabraiz Shamsi celebrated dismissing Jamaica Tallawahs' Glenn Phillips by taking off his shoe and using it as a phone while playing for St Kitts and Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League. Phillips holed out to deep mid-wicket following which Shamsi picked up his shoe and mockingly dialed a number on it.
