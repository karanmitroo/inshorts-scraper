Retired NBA professional, Kobe Bryant has penned a letter to his 17-year-old-self, advising him to invest in his family instead of giving material things like money. "You were adding material things to their lives, but subtracting the most precious gifts of all: independence and growth", he wrote and added, "put them in the best position to realize their own dreams".
