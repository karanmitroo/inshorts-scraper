The first ever Wimbledon competition, held in 1877, was organised in order to raise enough funds to get the Wimbledon tennis club's maintenance roller repaired. The tournament's inaugural edition, which saw participation from 22 players, made a profit of Â£10, with which the pony roller was repaired. Notably, the winner of the tournament was awarded 12 guineas.
