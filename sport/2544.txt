An Italian footballer has been banned for five matches for urinating on the pitch towards rival fans. Giovanni Liberti, a 21-year-old midfielder, allegedly made obscene gestures before urinating in the direction of the away stand. Liberti later explained he had been drinking water from a fountain before coming onto the pitch and was simply tucking his jersey into his shorts.
