NSW became the first team to use Cricket Australia's new concussion substitute rule, after opener Daniel Hughes was struck on the helmet in a domestic league game. The rule allows a team to replace a player who suffers a concussion, with a "like-for-like" player who is allowed to bat, bowl and field. The rule is only applicable in CA-conducted competitions.
