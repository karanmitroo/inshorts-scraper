On Sourav Ganguly’s 44th birthday, cricket expert Harsha Bhogle wrote a tribute for the former India captain on Facebook. “Few players in the history of Indian cricket can claim to have exerted as much influence on it as Sourav has. His finest may be ahead of him. It is in the future. But I believe it is inevitable,” wrote Bhogle.
