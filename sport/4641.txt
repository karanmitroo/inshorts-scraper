Barcelona are set to host Brazilian club Chapecoense for a friendly match on August 7, to pay tribute to the 71 people, including 19 Chapecoense players, who died when Chapecoense's plane crashed last November. The plane carrying the squad crashed near Medellin, where Chapecoense were set to play the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional.
