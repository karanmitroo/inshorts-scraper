Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh was trolled by fellow cricketers Harbhajan Singh and Rohit Sharma on Instagram after he posted a shirtless picture of himself captioned, "Mood". Rohit wrote, "@yuvisofficial please define what you mean when you say 'Mood' because it's not very clear." Harbhajan commented, "Sallu Bhai", on the post comparing him to Bollywood actor Salman Khan.
