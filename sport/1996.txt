Peruvian fans' celebrations after the nation qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup caused several earthquake-detection apps to send earthquake warnings in the country's capital, Lima. One of the apps reported that a tremor had been felt in Peru but later clarified that the alarm detector was activated due to Peru's goal celebration against New Zealand in the playoff.
