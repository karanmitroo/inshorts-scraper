Professional wrestler Bill Goldberg returned to the WWE after a gap of 12 years. The 49-year-old has been challenged to fight Brock Lesnar following the release of WWE 2K17 game's promotional video, where Goldberg was reportedly mocked for being a "supportive player" only. Goldberg and Lesnar last met in the ring in 2004, with Stone Cold being the special referee.
