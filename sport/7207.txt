French football club Olympique Lyon are reportedly set to sue a 15-year-old who ran onto the pitch to take a selfie with Lyon forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Memphis Depay. The fan ran onto the pitch after Lyon scored their fourth goal against Dijon FCO in their French league match. The 15-year-old said, "I was so happy, I didnâ€™t really think."
