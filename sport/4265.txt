Wimbledon's official pigeon scarer Rufus, a Harris hawk, had predicted that Roger Federer and Garbine Muguruza would win the respective singles titles at the Wimbledon this year. Rufus, who got the predictions right, had picked his winners by choosing the ball tins with pictures of Federer and Muguruza. The hawk has been the chief pigeon scarer at Wimbledon since 2007.
