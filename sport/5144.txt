Cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said Pakistani player Shahid Afridi's mind has not developed according to his age. Responding to Afridi's earlier accusation that Gambhir was never friends with any Pakistani cricketers, Gambhir said he had very good relations with Shoaib Akhtar and Kamran Akmal. "Everyone knows that Afridi's mind does not grow, just like his age," Gambhir added.
