After fetching â‚¹5 crore at the IPL auction, New Zealand pacer Trent Boult said he may just buy a pair of jeans and nothing more from his earnings. "I'm not going for the money. The experience of playing there in front of thousands of people is the most exciting part," added Boult. The pacer was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders.
