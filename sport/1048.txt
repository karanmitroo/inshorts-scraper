Playing in Australia for the first time, Sachin Tendulkar's son Arjun picked up four wickets and slammed 48(27) in a T20 match for Cricket Club of India against a Hong Kong-based side. Arjun took three of his four wickets in just one over. The 18-year-old will next play at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where Sachin has slammed four international tons.
