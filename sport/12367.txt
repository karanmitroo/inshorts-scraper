Retired basketball player Michael Jordan, for the first time, issued a statement against racial tensions in the US, on Monday. Addressing the shootings of African-Americans by law enforcement and targeting of police, he said, "I know this country is better than that and I can no longer stay silent". Jordan also donated $2 million to two organisations promoting police-community relations.
