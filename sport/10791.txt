Pakistan became the seventh Test-playing nation after taking the field in their first ever Test against India in Delhi on October 16, 1952. While the Green Army lost that match by an innings and 70 runs, they registered their first ever Test win in the next match of the same series. The series eventually ended at 2-1 in India's favour.
