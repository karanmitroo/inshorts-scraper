Tennis star Serena Williams wrote a personal essay in which she demanded equal pay for black women. In the essay, Williams said that for every dollar earned by men in the United States, black women earn just 63 cents. "The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the Grand Slam titles record," Williams wrote.
