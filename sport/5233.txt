Virat Kohli is the only Indian player to feature in former England captain Michael Vaughan's dream team for the Champions Trophy 2017. "I know his (Kohli's) record in England is not great but he is a better player than when he came here last time," Vaughan stated. Vaughan described England's Ben Stokes as the best all-rounder in the world.
