Nick Gooden, an Australian domestic cricketer who plays for Yallourn North, took a triple hat-trick, claiming five wickets in as many consecutive balls, on his way to taking eight wickets for 17 runs against Latrobe. Gooden, who was playing his first cricket match after a year-long injury layoff, said he was in a hurry to drink beer after the match.
