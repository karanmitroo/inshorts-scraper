The Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) has rejected the latest pay offer from their cricket board. Cricket Australia had proposed to share the surplus revenue of the board with only male international players, while female cricketers and domestic male players would be given fixed amounts. The ACA said the proposal is "a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket."
