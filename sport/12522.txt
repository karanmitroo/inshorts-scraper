England captain Alastair Cook surpassed former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar to become the highest run-scorer as an opener in Test cricket's history. Cook, who is the 11th highest Test run-scorer, overtook Gavaskar’s 9607-run record as an opener, during the Lord's Test against Pakistan on Saturday. Cook recently beat Sachin Tendulkar’s record of being the youngest to reach 10,000 Test runs.
