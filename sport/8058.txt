To promote the 2014 Winter Olympics, a subway station in Moscow, Russia, allowed passengers to do 30 squats as payment for a train ticket. A person was to complete at least 30 squats within two minutes to get the free ticket. A special ticket machine was introduced as part of the squat-to-ride campaign.
