Kabaddi is played in standard and circle style formats. While kabaddi mats measuring 13m x 10m form the playing court in standard style, the circle style has a circle with a radius of 22 metres. The standard format allows seven players below 80 kgs with five substitutes, the circle style has eight players with equal substitutions but no weight limit.
