Renault's British Formula One driver Jolyon Palmer has said he has burnt his 'unlucky underpants' ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix next week. Palmer, who was sidelined at the British Grand Prix, is yet to score a point in 10 races this season. "I'm not superstitious, but... this run of bad luck has to end", Palmer said.
