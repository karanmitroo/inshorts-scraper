A British surfer broke his back after getting crushed by a nearly 60-foot wave, while surfing off a beach in Nazare in Portugal. Andrew Cotton was thrown from his board and slammed back-first into the water at high speed after being engulfed briefly by the monster wave. "It was a split second of misjudgement," said the 36-year-old.
