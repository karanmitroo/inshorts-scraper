An ODI match between India and the West Indies in Visakhapatnam on November 7, 1994 had to be curtailed to 44-overs-a-side after luggage including the kits of the Windies' players was wrongly routed to Madras. Beyond that, the West Indies were also docked an over for their slow over rate which proved crucial as they lost by just four runs.
