Thanking Virender Sehwag for increasing his follower count in 2016, British journalist Piers Morgan tweeted, "You got me trending in India for days & 1000s of new followers. Thanks mate." Sehwag and Morgan were engaged in a Twitter battle earlier this year when the Indian batsman trolled Morgan for England's failure to win a World Cup.
