A fan of French club Olympique Marseille, who was called on for a ceremonial kick-off before the club's match against Toulouse, took the ball and beat the Toulouse goalkeeper to score a goal. Kamel Zaroual ran as the Toulouse defenders looked on before scoring into the bottom right corner. Zaroual ran in celebration before getting a hug from Marseille coach.
