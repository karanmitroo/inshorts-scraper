Brazilian forward Neymar said he will step down as the national team's captain, after leading Brazil to its first-ever Olympic football gold on Sunday. "Today I have been proclaimed a champion and I hand over the armband as captain," Neymar said, after scoring the winning penalty of the final against Germany. Neymar was appointed captain in September 2014.
