Australian batsman David Warner's 2-year-old daughter, Ivy May Warner, was seen running towards a life-size poster of her father placed next to a television set before giving it a hug. Warner's post on Instagram read, "This brought a tear to my eye this morning. When your daughter spots you from a distance and runs to give you a cuddle."
