Talking about Suresh Raina, who recently made his Team India comeback, coach Ravi Shastri said he batted against South Africa like he was never out of the side. "He's vastly experienced and he showed what experience can do. What I liked the best was he was fearless," he added. Raina made 89 runs in the T20I series against South Africa.
