South Africa's Test captain Faf du Plessis has said his teammate Hashim Amla could be the last cricketer to play 100 Test matches for the Proteas. Du Plessis added that the game has evolved and players will not play for long as there is much more cricket now. Amla is set to play his 100th Test on Thursday.
