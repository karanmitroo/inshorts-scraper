Irish striker Anthony Stokes has been asked to pay €230,000 (₹1.6 crore) in medical expenses to an Elvis Presley impersonator for headbutting him in a nightclub in 2013. The footballer had already received a two-year suspended prison sentence earlier this month for the offence. This is the second payout for Stokes after he was sued in the Dublin High Court.
