Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah held onto a catch after he fumbled and almost dropped Australian batsman Aaron Finch during the fifth ODI in Nagpur on Sunday. Finch had lofted a Hardik Pandya delivery wide of mid-off where Bumrah grabbed the ball but it popped out of his hands and rolled over his legs before he held onto it.
