Speaking about his sledging battle with Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, Ravindra Jadeja said, "I just told him, once you lose and are free, we will have dinner together." The all-rounder also spoke about the match situation, adding, "The ball was swinging and deviating after hitting the cracks. If you noticed, they had lost three wickets before the deficit was erased."
