The Indian women's ice hockey team registered its first ever win in an international ice hockey match on Thursday by beating Philippines 4-3 at the Challenge Cup of Asia in Bangkok. The Indian team had to rely on over 3,000 donors who contributed through a crowdfunding platform to pay for the team's accommodation, training, visa, air fares, equipment and jerseys.
