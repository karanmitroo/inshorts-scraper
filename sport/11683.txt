Jonathan Boyer, the father of Jean-Bernard Boyer, â€‹cyclist in the France's Tour Cycliste Antenne Reunion, knocked off the leaders of the race's opening stage off their bikes on Sunday. Jean-Bernard Boyer, who pulled road barriers into the racers' route, was aggrieved that they did not wait for his son to rejoin them after having fallen in the race's opening stages.
