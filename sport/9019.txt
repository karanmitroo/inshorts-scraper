Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja currently occupy the top two spots in the latest ICC bowlers rankings, making it the first time in 42 years of two Indians at the top two positions. The only other instance of two Indians leading the rankings was in 1974 when Bishan Singh Bedi and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar occupied the first two positions.
