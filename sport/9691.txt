India's head coach Anil Kumble was the captain of the team when wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel last played a Test for India. Parthiv, who was recalled for the Mohali Test against England after eight years, last played a Test against Sri Lanka in August 2008. Fourteen players from the current Indian squad made their Test debuts after Parthiv's last match.
