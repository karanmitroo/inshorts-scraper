The official theme song of the Rio Olympics, titled ‘Alma e Coração’ (Heart and Soul), was released on Sunday. The song has been composed by Samba star Thiaguinho and rapper Projota, both Brazil natives, and features shots of Rio’s Olympic Aquatics Stadium and Leblon beach. Four children, whose stories have inspired the song, are also featured in the music video.
