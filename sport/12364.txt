One-time Olympic Gold medal winner Roger Federer announced through a Facebook post that he will "not be able to represent Switzerland" at the upcoming Rio Olympics. The 17-time Grand Slam champion will also miss the rest of the 2016 tennis season citing the need for more extensive rehabilitation following his knee surgery which he underwent earlier in 2016.
