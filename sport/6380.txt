Referring to his debut Dharamsala Test against Australia, India's Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav said he did not think of how the wicket will behave after bowling his first delivery. "The wicket does not matter to me. When there is no assistance, I have to bowl with more patience and keep trying to turn the ball," Yadav added.
