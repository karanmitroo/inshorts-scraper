A 750-metre-long chain consisting of 508 sleds has set the Guinness World Record for the longest chain of sleds. The record was set at the Wildkogel Arena Neukirchen ski resort in Bramberg, Austria. The participants, led by Austrian luge double world champion Lea Geiger, were required to stay connected while sledging down a snow-covered slope.
