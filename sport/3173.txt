Former Australian pacer Jason Gillespie has warned the Australian cricket team to not sledge Indian captain Virat Kohli during the upcoming ODI series against India. "The best way to put him under pressure is through disciplined bowling," Gillespie said. Notably, Kohli has so far amassed 1,002 runs in 23 ODIs against them at an average of 55.6.
