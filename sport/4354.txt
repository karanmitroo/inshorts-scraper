Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney scored a long-range goal 34 minutes into his first game back for his childhood club Everton, while playing a friendly against Tanzanian side Gor Mahia on Thursday. Rooney received the ball 40 yards out before taking a couple of touches and unleashing a long-range shot that flew into the goal's far post.
