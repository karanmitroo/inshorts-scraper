Rio's silver-winning shuttler PV Sindhu has said that she feels Pullela Gopichand is her â€œbest coach". The statement comes after Telangana Deputy CM Mahmood Ali said the state government will provide her with a "very good coach to make sure she will get a gold medal". However, Ali's office later said it was a "generalised statement" made by the Minister.
