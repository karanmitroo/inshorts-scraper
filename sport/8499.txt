WBA middleweight champion and cancer survivor Daniel Jacobs will compete against undefeated title-holder Gennady Golovkin for four world championship belts in New York on March 18. In May 2011, Jacobs was left partially paralysed after being diagnosed with a form of bone cancer. He returned to boxing in 2012 and won the WBA middleweight title two years later.
