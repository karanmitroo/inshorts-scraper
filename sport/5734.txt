A footballer's 'Spiderman celebration' video has gone viral on the internet. The footballer is seen scoring a goal and running towards the fence where he flings himself onto the fencing and tries to grip onto it sideways like the superhero character 'Spiderman'. After the jump, the player is seen rebounding onto the gravel in front of the pitch.
