India defeated Australia by eight wickets to win their fourth ICC Under-19 World Cup, the most for any nation. For the first time, an Indian was the top wicket-taker in the tournament after spinner Anukul Roy finished the 2018 edition with joint-highest 14 wickets. India, who remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, also won the title in 2000, 2008 and 2012.
