The Law Commission of India has sought suggestions from the public on legalising betting and gambling in the country. The Commission has asked the public if legalising the two will be "morally correct" and how gamblers can be guarded against bankruptcy. In 2016, the Supreme Court had asked the Commission to study the possibility of legalising betting in India.
