Wrestling coach Mahavir Phogat has revealed he received a scholarship during his student days, following his response to Javed Akhtar's "hardly literate" comment on Virender Sehwag and Yogeshwar Dutt. "It (scholarship money for academics) was not more than ₹51. May be ₹31. But it was enough to take care of five to six months of pocket money," said Phogat.
