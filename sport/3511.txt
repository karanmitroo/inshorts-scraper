Former Australian PM Malcolm Fraser once visited Nelson Mandela in Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison in 1986, with one of Mandela's first questions being, "Tell me, Mr Fraser, is Donald Bradman still alive?" Bradman, whose 109th birth anniversary was celebrated on Sunday, signed a bat for Mandela, reading, "To Nelson Mandela in recognition of a great unfinished innings".
