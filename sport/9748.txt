The fielding side rubs the cricket ball to make it smooth and shiny on one side and leaves it rough on the other side, so as to generate reverse-swing. The ball tends to swing in the air towards the shinier side. Reverse-swing becomes important because the ball loses conventional swing as it gets old, especially in unresponsive conditions like India.
