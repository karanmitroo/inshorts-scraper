England captain Alastair Cook claims that England will be underdogs in the Test series against India, which takes the pressure off them, making the series competitive. "It’s a big challenge. Any time you play the No. 1 or No. 2 ranked team in their backyard, who are very comfortable in their conditions, it’s a huge task for us", added Cook.
