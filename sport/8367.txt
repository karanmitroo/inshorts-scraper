Indian cricket board BCCI has released a minute-long video showing skipper Virat Kohli playing with security dogs in the stadium. The 28-year-old can also be seen giving water to the dogs with his hands. Talking about his own pet dog, Kohli said it does not care whether he performs or not when he goes back home.
