Former Indian sprinters Milkha Singh and PT Usha came together with Rio Olympics' gold medalist Asafa Powell at the 'Ignite Delhi' event at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi to promote running as a sport in India. A relay race was later held between four teams named after the sprinters, after which Powell took to the track in an exhibition run.
