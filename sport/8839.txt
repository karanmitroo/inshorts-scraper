A footballer named Moussa Camara, during an Azam Rwanda Premier League match, allegedly performed witchcraft by placing a small object against the opposition post. Camara was chased by the goalkeeper and other opponents after the act and was shown a yellow card by the referee. Interestingly, Camara scored the equaliser just a few minutes later.
