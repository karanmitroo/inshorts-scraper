The first India-Sri Lanka Test at the Eden Gardens was the first instance of Indian spinners failing to take a single wicket in a home Test. Spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja bowled combined 10 overs without taking a wicket, while pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav took all 17 wickets, the most for Indian pacers at home.
