Indian pacer Mohammed Shami, whose father passed away recently, reacted angrily after a Pakistani cricket fan sledged Indian players following Pakistan's Champions Trophy win against India on Sunday. The Pakistani fan was heard saying, "Baap kaun hai?", which is when Shami lost his cool and turned back towards the Pakistani fan and stared at him before MS Dhoni held him.
