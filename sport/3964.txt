Valentin Costache, a 19-year-old Romanian midfielder, missed an open goal from two metres out after hitting the post during his team Dinamo Bucharest's match against Viitorul Constanta. Costache had received the ball after the opposition goalie misplaced the clearance and left the goal open. Costache managed to score a goal later in the match, helping his side win 1-0.
