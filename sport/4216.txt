Cricketer Umar Akmal, who was recently not given a central contract by the Pakistan Cricket Board, was trolled after he posted a picture on Twitter posing alongside a Bentley. "He's showing off because rest of the players are getting free cars and he's not," posted a user. Another tweet read, "Work Hard to get a job as a Cab Driver."
