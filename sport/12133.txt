A video by YouTube channel 'DNews' explains the physics behind the 'perfect dive'. The video describes the importance of "forward velocity" during take-off. It explains how "divers can squeeze four and a half flips into a second and a half". Further, the video talks about positions like "tuck" and "pike", which are used to increase spin speed.
