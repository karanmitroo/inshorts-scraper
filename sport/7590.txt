Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has said pacer Umesh Yadav's spell on day three of the Hyderabad Test was the "best he's faced in Tests". "He was moving the ball both ways and some of the deliveries were unplayable. The best I could do was to hit the deliveries that I could...I was lucky I survived that spell," said Shakib.
