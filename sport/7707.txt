A series of hacked emails have revealed former England footballer David Beckham reportedly used his charitable work to get a knighthood. The emails, exchanged between Beckham and his publicist, reveal the footballer called the knighthood-awarding committee "a bunch of c***s" after he was overlooked in 2013. Beckham's team alleges the emails are doctored and were used as a blackmail bid.
