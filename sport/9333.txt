Indian skipper Virat Kohli narrowly escaped getting injured while fielding in the Mumbai Test. Kohli was chasing the ball near the third-man boundary when his knee got stuck in a soft patch of grass while sliding. The cricketer lost his balance and fell over, but got up after checking his knee and continued for the rest of the England innings.
