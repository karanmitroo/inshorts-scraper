England batsman Joe Root, while speaking at the end of day press conference, said England would have liked to play an extra spinner in the Mumbai Test. "Leading into the game, we thought there might be a bit more in it for the seamers," Root added. Notably, spinners have taken 16 of the 17 wickets in the match so far.
