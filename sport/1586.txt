The Afghanistan cricket team, which was recently made a Test-playing nation, will play its first-ever Test match against India in India. "Afghans were scheduled to play their first Test in 2019 versus Australia but considering the historic relationship between India and Afghanistan, we decided to host their first Test," BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary said.
