In a recent interview, Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir said, "Everybody knows if you get Kohli, India is 50% out of the game...if you give him a chance, he won't score less than hundred." Amir, who dismissed Indian captain Virat Kohli on five runs in the Champions Trophy final, added, "When Kohli was dropped, I thought half the game was gone."
