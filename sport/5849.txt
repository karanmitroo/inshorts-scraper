Pakistan have called off their tour to Bangladesh after the country rejected an invitation to play two T20Is in Pakistan this year. Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Shaharyar Khan said the team cannot tour Bangladesh for a third straight time, since the latter failed to reciprocate. Pakistan travelled to Bangladesh in 2011 and 2015, while Bangladesh last toured Pakistan in 2007-08.
