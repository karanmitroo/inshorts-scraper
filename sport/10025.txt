Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath claims that Australia's obsession with pace doesn't account for fast-bowlers' other skills. McGrath, who picked 563 wickets in 124 Tests, said that he always depended on bounce instead of pace. "If I could have bowled 100 miles per hour I would have bowled at 100 miles per hour, there's no doubt about that," McGrath added.
