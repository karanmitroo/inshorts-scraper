Zee Media outlets including Zee News, Zee Hindustan, WION, DNA and others are not covering the ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Pakistan. Zee said it is boycotting the match coverage in support of Indian soldiers. "Bat, ball and bombs cannot go together," tweeted Zee News Editor-in-Chief Sudhir Chaudhary.
