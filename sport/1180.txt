The first-ever One Day International was an impromptu one, played between England and Australia in Melbourne on January 5, 1971. The 40-overs-per-side (eight balls per over) match was played on what would have been the fifth day of the washed-out third Ashes Test. It was played to appease the crowd and recover financial losses for the Don Bradman-led Australian board.
