BCCI has said the Lodha Committee has cleared payments for players and officials in board-organised tournaments, announcing they can be paid directly under existing terms. The announcement comes after BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke wrote to the Committee seeking clarification on the cash-strapped Rajasthan Cricket Association. The Board had been barred from releasing funds by the Supreme Court.
