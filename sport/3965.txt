Donald De La Haye, a University of Central Florida football player, lost his place in the team and his scholarship, due to his YouTube channel, called "Deestroying". The channel, with over 90,000 subscribers and 5 million views, got his scholarship scrapped as it hosts athletics-related videos on a monetized account, which is not allowed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
