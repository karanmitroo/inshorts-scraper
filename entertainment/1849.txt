Kangana Ranaut, while responding to reports of her not supporting Shabana Azmi's 'Deepika Bachao' campaign, said, "Deepika has all my support but I'm...wary of Shabana's investment in left wing vs right wing politics." Kangana added that she is capable of supporting who she likes without anyone else's support. Azmi had started a petition following the threats against Deepika over 'Padmavati'.
