'Jab Harry Met Sejal', starring Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma, "is predictable... like most Bollywood movies are," wrote India Today. NDTV called it "cinema's equivalent of a shiny bauble that glitters wholly in vain." Times of India wrote, "The script...has been done to death by Imtiaz Ali." The film was rated 1/5 (India Today), 2/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (TOI).
