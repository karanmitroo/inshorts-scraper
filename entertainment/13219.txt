As per reports, actor Amitabh Bachchan will star in the Bollywood remake of the Rajinikanth starrer 'Kabali'. The film is reportedly being planned as Rajinikanthâ€™s Tamil films do not perform well when dubbed in Hindi owing to the dialogues and culture being specific to the Tamil community. Notably, Amitabh and Rajinikanth have worked together in films including 'Geraftaar' and 'Hum'.
