John Abraham has said his upcoming film 'Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran' does not show anything overtly political. The film is based on the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests conducted when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was India's Prime Minister. John added, "Atal Ji was one of the greatest Prime Ministers we had, but this is (a) film... it has to be entertaining."
