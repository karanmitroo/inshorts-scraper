Hollywood actor Mahershala Ali, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Moonlight', couldn't get through the audition for HBO series 'Game of Thrones'. He had auditioned for the role of Xaro Xhoan Daxos, which was eventually played by actor Nonso Anozie. "[H]ow could I have ever turned down Mahershala Ali?" said GoT casting director Nina Gold while expressing regret.
