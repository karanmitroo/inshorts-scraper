Actor Hugh Jackman has revealed he was considered for the role of 'James Bond' after Pierce Brosnan's tenure as 'Bond' ended but he rejected the film. "I just felt at the time that the scripts had become so unbelievable and crazy...I felt like they needed to become grittier and real," he added. The role was eventually played by Daniel Craig.
