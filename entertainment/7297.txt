According to reports, actor Shahid Kapoor wanted to be called a 'superstar' and not a 'star' by a magazine for which he did a photoshoot. Shahid reportedly said if the magazine team didn't want to make the change, he wanted the entire story removed. The team made the change but later altered the title following the release of 'Rangoon'.
