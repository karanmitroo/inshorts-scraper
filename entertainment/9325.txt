Hollywood actress Emma Stone has revealed that she left ninth grade to become an actress at the age of 14. She convinced her parents to let her go to Los Angeles, despite having no exposure to movie or television cameras. "It's nuts that they agreed... I don't condone it. Everybody should go to high school and graduate," she added.
