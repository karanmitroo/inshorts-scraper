Cafe Liquiteria, an eatery in Pakistan, photoshopped actress Mahira Khan's picture in which she was seen smoking a cigarette with Ranbir Kapoor for an advertisement, and morphed the cigarette into a straw. Reacting to it, a user tweeted, "Cheap Marketing," while another user wrote, "Every Publicity Is Not...Good Publicity." A user called it "some serious trendy marketing" by the cafe.
