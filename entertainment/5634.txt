Actress Nargis Fakhri has said she doesn't react to online trolls as they don't pay her bills. "They don't have any significance in my life. I give love back to fans. They're the ones that mean something to me...," added Nargis. She also said that celebrities don't care when they're body-shamed because they're paid "big bucks" for what they wear.
