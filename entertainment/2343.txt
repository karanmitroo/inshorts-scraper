Responding to former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah's statement that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir belongs to Pakistan, actor Rishi Kapoor tweeted, "Totally agree with you, sir. J&K is ours, and PoK is theirs (Pakistan's)." Rishi further said that this is the only way to solve the issue, while adding that he wants to see Pakistan before he dies.
