In a bid to engage and enthuse fans, a promo of Aamir Khan's popular show Satyamev Jayate will be released on Twitter. The promo will follow a 'Tweet to Unlock' scheme, for users to access exclusive scoops "when the ticker reaches 100". To popularize the show's philosophy, '#MumkinHai' will be used, to involve audiences in the social movement.
