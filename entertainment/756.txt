Responding to actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi's reaction to her open letter on 'Padmaavat', actress Swara Bhasker said, "Funny that in a 2440 word article making fairly comprehensible arguments they only remember the word Vagina!!!" Swara had earlier written an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, saying that after watching the finale of his movie, she felt "reduced to a vagina".
