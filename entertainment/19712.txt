Farhan Aktar, enjoying success of his 100-crore-club movie “Bhaag Milkha Bhaag”, will be seen next in 'Rock On-2', the sequel to hit 'Rock On’. Like its prequel it will also be produced by Farhan and Ritesh Sidhwani's company but might not be directed by Abhishek Kapoor who directed ‘Rock On’. Shooting for the movie is expected to start by year-end.
