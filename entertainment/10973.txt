Sridevi and Boney Kapoor's daughter Jhanvi Kapoor will make her Bollywood debut in a Karan Johar film. "Karan has been talking to us about a film for Jhanvi and we've given consent. But we don't know which project it would be," Kapoor said. He added it is being presumed that Jhanvi would be launched in remake of Marathi film 'Sairat'.
