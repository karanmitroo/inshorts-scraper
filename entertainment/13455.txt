Actor Salman Khan on Friday failed to appear before the National Commission for Women (NCW) in New Delhi in accordance to summons issued by the NCW earlier. The commission has only received a response from the actor's legal team. The 50-year-old actor was summoned following his remarks where he compared himself to a 'raped woman' while training for 'Sultan'.
