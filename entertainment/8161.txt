Actress Huma Qureshi has slammed body-shamers in an advertisement for a clothing brand. "Body shaming is as harmful as anything else; as an actor you...have to have a really thick hide," she said. Huma added, "Whoever I am today is because of the fact that I don't fit in... Who wants to blend in when they can stand out?"
