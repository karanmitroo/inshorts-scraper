While referring to the song 'Ghoomar' from 'Padmavati', Heena Singh Judeo, a member of Jashpur's royal family, said that no Rajput queen ever danced in front of anyone and filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali shouldn't play with history. She added, "They (the films) always show Rajputana love story, they never show whatever they have done (sacrifices). And...Bhansali always does this."
