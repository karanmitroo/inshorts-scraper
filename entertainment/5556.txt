Anurag Basu, director of upcoming film 'Jagga Jasoos', has said that the breakup of the film's lead actors Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif never affected the film's shoot. "I realised that they're trying to concentrate more...be professional and after that it was fine," added Basu. Ranbir and Katrina reportedly started dating while shooting for 'Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani' (2009).
