Talking about item songs like 'Fevicol Se', Shabana Azmi said, "When you say 'main tandoori murgi hu, gatka lo mujhe alcohol kay saath' and a four-year-old girl is dancing on it, you are leading to...sexualisation of children." She added, "The parents who are enjoying it, people who are encouraging her are just as responsible."
