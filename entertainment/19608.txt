Director Anurag Kashyap, who is known to be bold enough to air his views publicly, has apparently deleted his Twitter account. Reportedly, the reason is Anurag's frustration over selection of Gyan Correa's 'The Good Road' as official entry to Oscar. Anurag not only questioned the selection-committee's choice but allegedly threatened them by tweeting,"...it better make it to the final five."
