Actor Randeep Hooda, who will be seen essaying the role of Sarabjit Singh in the upcoming biopic 'Sarbjit', has said that the film has brought about "a certain sense of gloom" to him. "I have to keep telling myself, that look, you did not go through 23 years of your life in prison", the 39-year-old actor added.
