Actor Ranbir Kapoor, while talking about Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan, said, "Inn bando mein dum hai" (These guys have the spunk). "Earlier, I could brashly and immaturely say that I'm going to be better than them. But it's not easy to be better than them... I bow down to them," added Ranbir.
