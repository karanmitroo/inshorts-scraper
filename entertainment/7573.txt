Comedian Raju Srivastava has claimed that Sunil Grover told him he won't return to 'The Kapil Sharma Show', even if Kapil mends his ways. Sunil told Raju, "It's not like I am arrogant or I need popularity. But I have been wronged." Reports of Sunil quitting the show emerged after Kapil assaulted him on a flight.
