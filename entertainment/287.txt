The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Friday issued a notice to singer Papon and TV channel &TV over Papon kissing a minor girl on the sets of a show which is aired on the channel. "We felt this is a provocative case. Necessary legal action will be taken," said an official from the child rights body.
