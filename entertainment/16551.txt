Actor Shah Rukh Khan recently said that a movie starring the three Khans of Bollywood, namely Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, "might not be a problem". "We have to choose a film in which all three of us are equal. We should do Ghostbusters (1984). That film has equal roles for all the three heroes", SRK said.
