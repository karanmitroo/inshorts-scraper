The Arjun Kapoor and Anil Kapoor starrer 'Mubarakan' which released on Friday "shows some witty character sketches before losing its charm", wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV wrote, "The film goes overboard with its excessive cheeriness...into the realms of inanity", while Times of India called the film's three actresses "decorative set-pieces". It was rated 2.5/5 (HT), 2/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (TOI).
