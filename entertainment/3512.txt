Priyanka Chopra has slammed Vanity Fair magazine's October cover, featuring her friend and actress Meghan Markle, for being sexist and making the cover story on Meghan revolve around her boyfriend Prince Harry. "She's an actor, she's an activist, she's a philanthropist. I mean, she does so much more," she said. "A woman is not just a plus one," added Priyanka.
