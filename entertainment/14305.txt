YouTube channel Being Indian on Monday released a video featuring Sonu Nigam singing on the streets of Mumbai disguised as a beggar. He sang some of his hit songs at a Juhu locality. The move was part of a social experiment conducted by Being Indian to see how "Indians react to beauty when it is just around the corner".
