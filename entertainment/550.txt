Denying accusations of copying his 'Baadshaho' song 'Piya More' from the 2014 song 'Nasha Sar Pe Chadke Bole', music director Ankit Tiwari said, "I'm a musician, not a thief." He added, "Every music composer has his...own distinct style...two of my songs, Boond Boond and Qatra Qatra are similar too." Tiwari further said "copying" and being "similar'" are two different things.
