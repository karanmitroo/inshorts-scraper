Actress Bipasha Basu, who recently confessed of being "petrified of lesbians", is being criticised on social media for being homophobic. "For Valentineâ€™s Day, one lesbian had bought me a diamond necklace. She was in love with me. I freaked out", Bipasha had said. The journalist who interviewed her is also being criticised for calling such a situation "uncalled for".
