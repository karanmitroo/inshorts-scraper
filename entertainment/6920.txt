Actor Hrithik Roshan has said he doesn't get jealous of another actor's success.
He added, "I recently saw Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and I absolutely loved Ranbir (Kapoor) and Anushka (Sharma). But I never felt like I could've done a role better." In an earlier interview, Hrithik had said he's ready to do a film which has even ten heroes.
