Actress Swara Bhaskar, while speaking on 'formula films' in Bollywood said that "the presence of big stars in a movie no longer guarantees a hit" and even Salman Khan "is also looking for good stories first". "The clear distinction between art and parallel cinema that was there in the 70s or 80s is a thing of past now," added Swara.
