Self-styled critic Kamaal R Khan has threatened to commit suicide if Twitter doesn't restore his account within 15 days. He had earlier alleged that his account was suspended because Aamir Khan wanted it to be suspended, after he gave a negative review of 'Secret Superstar'. "(I) am depressed because they (Twitter) have cheated me," read KRK's press release.
