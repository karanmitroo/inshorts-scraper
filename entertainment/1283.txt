Actor Salman Khan, while speaking about doing action scenes in films, said, "My body is like a diesel engine, ek baar garam ho gaya toh chalta rahega." "I can't do handstands or put my body upside down. But, apart from that, I can easily pull off quick movements, like forward and backward somersault, or floor rolls," he added.
