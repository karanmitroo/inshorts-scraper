Actress Lily Collins has slammed the fashion industry for casting 'extremely small girls' in shows. "A lot of them are really young and haven't become women yet. It's like their body shape hasn't changed. Some girls look like they're about to pass out," she added. Lily further said it is important to have a conversation about the health of models.
