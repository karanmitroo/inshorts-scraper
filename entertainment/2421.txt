Actor Sumeet Vyas has said that Bollywood is like a local train which is crowded as hell. "But if you manage to squeeze in, at some point you will find a window seat...in this crowded train called film business," added Vyas. He further said that he doesn't wish to glorify his hardships as he feels everyone has their share.
