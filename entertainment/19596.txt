The nomination of Gyan Correa's directorial-debut, 'The Good Road', as India's Oscar entry for 2013 has resulted in a protest by intellectuals and documentary-filmmakers who claim that the movie shows Gujarat in bad light. The National Award winning Gujarati film was selected by Film Federation of India over films like 'The Lunchbox', 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', 'Ship of Theseus' and others.
