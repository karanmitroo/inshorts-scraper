Kamal Haasan has been criticised for naming the survivor in the Malayalam actress abduction case. "It doesn't matter if I've used the name... Don't hide the name as there is nothing wrong with it... Don't refer to her as 'a female'," he explained. Haasan further said it is not just about the safety of actresses, but of women in general.
