Aamir Khan has become the second superstar after Shah Rukh Khan to lose his security cover. The actor was given a police cover first in 2001, after he refused the extortion demands of the underworld on the success of film ‘Lagaan’. SRK regained his security cover last month after he spoke up against our neighbouring country's government.
