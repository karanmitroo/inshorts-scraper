The decomposing body of struggling actress Kritika Chaudhary was found in her apartment in Mumbai on Monday, the police said. The police believe the 23-year-old, who had worked in Kangana Ranaut-starrer Rajjo and several Balaji production TV shows, was allegedly murdered 3-4 days ago. Her room was found locked from the outside while the AC was switched on.
