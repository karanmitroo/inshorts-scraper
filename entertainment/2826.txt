Actress Kate Winslet has revealed that she refused to thank Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in her speech while receiving the Best Actress award at the Oscars in 2009. She added, "For my whole career, Harvey Weinstein, whenever I've bumped into him, he'd grab my arm and say, 'Don't forget who gave you your first movie.' Like I owe him everything."
