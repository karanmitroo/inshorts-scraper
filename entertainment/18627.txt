The already controversial Aamir Khan’s upcoming movie PK’s poster, is a copy from a Portuguese musician named Quim Barreiros who had a similar poster to promote his album in 1973. In the poster Aamir was seen standing with only a vintage boombox covering his modesty. Also Quim is standing nude withholding nothing but a musical instrument.
