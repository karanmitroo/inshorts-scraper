NASA and Disney are reportedly planning a special screening of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the Earth 400 km away. ISS astronauts typically get movies as digital files and can play them on a laptop or a projector, a NASA official said. Hollywood film 'Gravity' has previously been screened aboard ISS.
