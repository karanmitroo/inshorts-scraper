The Zareen Khan and Gautam Rode starrer 'Aksar 2' is "an out and out borefest", wrote Times Now. "Enduring the expressionless Zareen Khan is as much punishment as you could endure in a day," wrote SpotboyE while Koimoi wrote, "It includes...tedious subplots puncturing the narration of the film." It was rated 0.5/5 (Times Now), 1/5 (SpotboyE) and 2/5 (Koimoi).
