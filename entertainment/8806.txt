The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has denied a certificate to late Om Puri's film 'Rambhajjan Zindabaad'. According to the Board, the film is not suitable for public exhibition for showing "rape, abusive language, direct-indirect references to politics of Uttar Pradesh and provocative lines related to caste". The film's release was postponed to February following Puri's demise.
