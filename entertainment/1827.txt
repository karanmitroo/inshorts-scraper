UK-based broadcaster BBC mistakenly aired footage of Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor in a segment on Shashi Kapoor's demise. It has been slammed by the late actor's fans for the error. A user tweeted, "#BBC News hire proper researchers!" Another user commented, "Poor man can't even rest in peace because the BBC credited another 'brown person' with his work."
