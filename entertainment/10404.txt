Actress Twinkle Khanna has asked why she is obliged to feel patriotic during the national anthem in a cinema hall before watching Ranveer Singh in his tight red underwear in the film 'Befikre'. Twinkle was referring to Supreme Court's new rule where viewers were ordered to stand during the National Anthem, which will be played mandatorily at all cinema halls.
