A Hollywood casting director, who had allegedly said that Asian actors were more difficult to cast because they were "not very expressive", has been slammed on Twitter. A user wrote, "Seriously Hollywood you're gonna have to come up with a better reason than that." Another user tweeted, "Sorry Hollywood, but...Kristen Stewart had the same expression throughout the entire Twilight series."
