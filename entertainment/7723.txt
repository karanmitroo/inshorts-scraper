Comedian Krushna Abhishek has said that it is difficult to do comedy nowadays as it is not in the Indian system and blood to take jokes on themselves. "But few people love it. A few of them love roasts and do not mind jokes on themselves," he added. Krushna further said that people appreciate and laugh more on 'filmy' jokes.
