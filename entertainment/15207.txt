Playback singer Mohammed Rafi's son Shahid Rafi on Monday said that his father never got a Bharat Ratna 'probably' because he was a Muslim. "My dad was a very secular person. He sang many bhajans. He was for everybody," Shahid added. Shahid also clarified that he had never claimed that Muslims were feeling insecure under the current Modi-led government.
