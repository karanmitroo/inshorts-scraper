The police on Friday arrested two restaurant bouncers for beating up photographers who were taking pictures of Shilpa Shetty and her husband Raj Kundra as they were leaving the restaurant. The couple were getting inside their car when the bouncers allegedly pushed the photographers and later manhandled them. Shilpa later issued a statement condemning the incident.
