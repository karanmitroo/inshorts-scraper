Actor Kamal Haasan has been summoned by a Tamil Nadu court in connection with the alleged derogatory remarks he made about the Mahabharata in March this year. The actor has been asked to appear in court on May 5. Haasan had said that India respects a book like the Mahabharata, which revolves around men gambling away a woman (Draupadi).
