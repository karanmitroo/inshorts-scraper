The shoot of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan-starrer 'Jazbaa' was Sunday cancelled by the authorities of Wankhede Stadium due to the IPL match. According to filmmaker Sanjay Gupta, they had booked the venue for the whole of Sunday but were told about the cancellation only this afternoon. "I... donâ€™t know when will we comeback to shoot the same sequence again," he said.
