Responding to Indian Ocean singer Rahul Ram's satirical song 'Aisi Taisi Democracy', which focuses on the similarities between the people of India and Pakistan, Muhammad Hassan Miraj, a Major in the Pakistan Army has written a song called 'Aisi Taisi Hypocricy'. The social-satire too talks about how the people of both nations have more in common than the perceived differences.
