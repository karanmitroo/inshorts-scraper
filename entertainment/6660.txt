Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has said that he is not making a biopic on martial arts legend and actor Bruce Lee while adding, "I actually said it for fun". RGV had earlier tweeted, "Just because of my devotional worship of Bruce Lee I am going to make his biopic and release it same time as Shekhar Kapur's authorised one."
