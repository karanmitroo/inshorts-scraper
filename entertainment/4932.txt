The director of Game of Thrones season 7's premiere episode, Jeremy Podeswa, has defended Ed Sheeran's cameo and said he did a "lovely job". "He was appropriate for the part because he needed to sing. If people didn't know who Ed was, they wouldn't have thought about it twice," he added. Jeremy further said people interrogated the cameo too much.
