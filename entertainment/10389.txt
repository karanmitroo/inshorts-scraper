DC Comics character Wonder Woman will be removed from her position as an honorary UN ambassador for women empowerment on Friday, following protests over her appointment two months ago. UN staff members protested over her "overtly sexualized image" and slammed the UN's inability to "find a real-life woman" who would champion the rights of women on issues of gender equality.
