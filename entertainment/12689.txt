Actress Parineeti Chopra has said that she has been "obese" and "battled" her weight since childhood. "It has been a personal desire for me to be fit, thin... for years now... It has nothing to do with me being an actress," added Parineeti. She further said that at one point, 'curvy' had become a "default adjective" for her.
