'The Dark Knight' star Christian Bale will play the role of Steve Jobs in director Danny Boyle's new biopic. Bale was finalised for the role after Leonardo DiCaprio dropped out of the film. Scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin has confirmed the news. Calling Bale a "phenomenonal actor", Sorkin said it was an extremely difficult role and Bale "is going to crush it".
