Sushant Singh Rajput has said he's writing a book titled 'A Book About Nothing', in which he'll put together 'thousands of thoughts' he has written over the years. "The thoughts may not be connected...the pages can be read in any order...it would still be thought-provoking," added Sushant. He further said the book is not a biography or a self-help guide.
