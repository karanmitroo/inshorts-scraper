Ariel Winter, who appears in American television series 'Modern Family', revealed she was called a slut and fat hooker when she was 13 for the way she dressed. "It really took so much of my self-esteem," she added. Ariel further said, "The only person that matters is yourself. If you're happy, if you're confident, that's all that matters."
