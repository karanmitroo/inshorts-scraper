As per reports, counterfeit drugs, which contained fentanyl, were found in singer Prince's estate in Paisley Park. Prince died in April, reportedly due to an accidental overdose of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than heroin. The drugs were said to be falsely labelled and put in bottles found in suitcases and bags, one of which Prince carried with him.
