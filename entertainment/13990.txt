Actor Amitabh Bachchan has called Hollywood films a "competition" and said that "wherever it (Hollywood) has gone, it has destroyed the local film industry". "Be it United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain or Japan, everywhere they go they just take over and thatâ€™s what is happening here," said Bachchan. Notably, some Hollywood films have been outperforming Bollywood films at India's box-office.
