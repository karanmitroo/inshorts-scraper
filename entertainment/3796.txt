Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said celebrities endorsing fairness creams should be ashamed of themselves. "You're promoting fairness creams in a country where 90% of the people are brown-skinned. You're giving them an inferiority complex; theyâ€™re unable to feel confident about themselves," he added. Nawazuddin had earlier revealed that he has often been discriminated against because of his skin colour.
