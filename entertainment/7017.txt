Sonu Nigam, while denying a report that he asked Kamaal R Khan (KRK) to tweet in his support, tweeted, "Swear on my Departed Mother, I didn't. We don't know each other personally at all." The report claimed that Sonu wanted KRK's support over the Azaan row. Meanwhile, KRK also denied the report and slammed the news website for false reporting.
