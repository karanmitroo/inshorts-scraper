Bollywood actor Tom Alter, who passed away on Saturday, took Sachin Tendulkar's first TV interview in 1989, when the cricketer was a 15-year-old and was yet to make his international debut. "[Sachin was] innocent and soft-spoken. Though a little shy in front of the camera, the boy was very confident without being a show-off," Alter had said about the interview.
