Effigies of Rajinikanth were burnt in Tamil Nadu and protestors from pro-Tamilian groups including Thamizhar Munnetra Padai (TMP) termed him Kannadiga. The protests were in response to the actor hinting that he might join politics in a meeting with fans. TMP leader Veeralakshmi said Tamil political leaders were capable and the state doesn't need someone (referring to Rajinikanth) from Karnataka.
