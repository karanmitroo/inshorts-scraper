Actor Shah Rukh Khan's manager Pooja Dadlani has said that the actor almost punching anchor Ramez Galal over a prank was staged. She added, "He was aware and was acting as if he was angry." Ramez, inside a reptile-like costume, crawled towards Shah Rukh's vehicle to scare him, after it got stuck in quicksand, as part of the prank.
