Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali on Wednesday said that he has cancelled all his future concerts scheduled in India. While announcing the same, he added that he will not return to the country "until things are settled down". Notably, Ali's decision came after his Mumbai concert was cancelled by the organisers in October as the Shiv Sena threatened to hamper it.
