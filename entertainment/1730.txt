A member of the Norwegian royal family has accused Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey of sexually harassing him by groping him in his private parts. Ari Behn, who is the former son-in-law of the King of Norway King Harald, said that the 'House of Cards' actor tried to grope him after a Nobel Peace Prize concert ten years ago.
