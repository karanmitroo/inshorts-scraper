Priyanka Chopra's upcoming Hollywood debut film Baywatch has been given an 'A' certificate by the CBFC because of bikini scenes and strong language. Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani said that bad language was allowed in several dialogues as cutting them would take away the intention of words. The film has reportedly been recommended five cuts, one visual and four verbal.
