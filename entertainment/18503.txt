The director of previous year's Bollywood blockbuster 'Ye Jawaani Hai Deewani', Ayan Mukerji, is undergoing treatment for dengue at his residence, after he refused to be treated at a hospital. "The doctor was confident that Ayan didn't need to be hospitalised. He is responding well to the medication and should be fine by this weekend," said father Deb Mukerji.
