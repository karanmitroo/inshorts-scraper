Actor Shahid Kapoor has said filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali is like a drug and people get addicted to him. "He's a mad genius, who drains and sucks everything out of you... He's difficult for people who are not ready to work hard. He's easy for people who want to excel and push themselves," he added.
