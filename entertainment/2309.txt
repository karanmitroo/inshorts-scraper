Hollywood actress Ellen Page has alleged that rape-accused filmmaker Brett Ratner outed her as gay when she was eighteen, when he told a woman, "You should f**k her to make her realize she's gay." Page added, "He said this about me during a cast and crew "meet and greet" before we began filming, 'X Men: The Last Stand'."
