'Dangal' director Nitesh Tiwari has said it's unfortunate that in India a film's budget is decided on the basis of who is starring in it and not on the basis of the script. "A same script with a bigger star will have a higher production budget," added Tiwari. He further said this is because producers always think about market recovery.
