Model-actress Lisa Haydon attended an event by non-profit organisation AmfAR during the ongoing Paris Fashion Week, just a month after delivering her first child. She wore a red gown with a thigh-high slit by French fashion designer Alexandre Vauthier, paired with strappy heels and a clutch. Lisa's husband Dino Lalvani also attended the event.
