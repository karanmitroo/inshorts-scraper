American singer Selena Gomez's Instagram account was hacked on Monday and the hackers posted several nude pictures of her ex-boyfriend singer Justin Bieber. Selena's team later regained control of her account and the nude photos were deleted. The nude pictures shared were taken by the media during Bieber's vacation in Bora Bora in 2015.
