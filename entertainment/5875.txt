Filmmaker Ketan Mehta has filed a complaint with Mumbai Police against Kangana Ranaut, accusing her of cheating. Mehta claimed in the complaint that after filming parts of his movie on Rani of Jhansi, Kangana left the film abruptly, and began shooting for 'Manikarnika', another movie based on a similar theme. This resulted in a loss of â‚¹9 crore, claims Mehta.
