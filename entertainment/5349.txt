The release date of the Arjun Rampal starrer 'Daddy', which is a biopic on gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli, has been postponed from July to September 8. Gawli's daughter Geeta asked for the shift in release as Arun, who's currently in prison, is expected to be released on parole in September. Co-written by Rampal, the film has been directed by Ashim Ahluwalia.
