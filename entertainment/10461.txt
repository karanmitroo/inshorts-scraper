Actor Tom Hardy has revealed that he'll get a tattoo that says 'Leo knows everything' in Leonardo DiCaprio's handwriting after he lost a bet. Earlier this year, DiCaprio bet that Hardy would receive an Oscar nomination for 'The Revenant' though Hardy was certain he would not. If DiCaprio predicted correctly, Hardy would have to get a tattoo that DiCaprio chose.
