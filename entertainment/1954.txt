Alia Bhatt has said that she gets uncomfortable when people while praising her work start comparing her to yesteryear actresses like Madhubala, Nargis and Waheeda Rehman. "It sort of disrupts me and changes my thought process, so I never allow such thoughts to come to my mind," added Alia. She further said that her parents have always kept her grounded.
