Actor and former wrestler Dwayne Johnson, also known as The Rock, tweeted about a fifth-grade student who wrote similarities between him and a real rock. Johnson, tweeting the student's work, wrote, "Very cool and creative 5th grader who will become a future science leader. Unlike myself in 5th grade who got suspended for using middle finger in class."
