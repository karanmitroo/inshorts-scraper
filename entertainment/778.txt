Ranveer Singh has revealed he locked himself in his house for 21 days to prepare to play Alauddin Khilji in 'Padmaavat'. "I...isolated myself, marinated into the character because I can't relate to Alauddin Khilji, I can't relate to that level of greed and ambition," he added. Ranveer further said he had to tap into "dark experiences" to play Khilji.
