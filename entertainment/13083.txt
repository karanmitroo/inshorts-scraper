Actor Sanjay Dutt will play a "43 or 44-year-old father" in filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar's upcoming film. "He will play a Punjabi man but not a Sardar... The film has elements of humor and he is good at comedy, he does it best,” said Manjrekar. The film will be a Hindi language​ remake of the 2008 Marathi film 'De Dhakka'.
