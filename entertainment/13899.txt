Actor Hrithik Roshan’s former wife Sussanne Khan has spoken about their divorce in 2014 saying that it is "important to be aware and not be in a false relationship". "We had reached a stage in our lives where I decided that it’s better we weren’t together," said Sussanne. She added that they put aside their differences for their two sons.
