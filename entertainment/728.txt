Actress Neetu Chandra, while responding to Sidharth Malhotra's apology on Twitter over his remark on Bhojpuri language, said, "He apologised generally...So I can't acknowledge it." She added that Sidharth had not tagged her in his tweet. Sidharth had made the remark 'Latrine wali feel aayi bolte hue but accha laga' after delivering a dialogue in Bhojpuri on a reality show.
