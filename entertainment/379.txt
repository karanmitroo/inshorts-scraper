Actress Emma Watson has donated £1 million (₹9 crore) to the UK Justice and Equality Fund, which is aimed at helping those affected by sexual harassment. The donation comes after over 200 female celebrities, including Watson, signed an open letter calling for an end to sexual harassment at work. Actresses Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley have also signed the letter.
