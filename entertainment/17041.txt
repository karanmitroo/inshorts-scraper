Bollywood actress Vidya Balan on Sunday came in support of Madhuri Dixit who has been served a legal notice for endorsing Maggi noodles which is under scanner for excess lead and MSG levels. "It's not Madhuri's fault that today researchers have found wrong things. How would she know? We are not involved in research," she said.
