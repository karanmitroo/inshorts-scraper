Actress-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt while sharing her opinion on Karan Johar's row over Ae Dil Hai Mushkil with MNS chief Raj Thackeray called it "bullying" and not "nationalism". "It is schoolyard bullying at its best and worst," tweeted Bhatt. She was responding to a tweet by journalist Barkha Dutt, which read, "Nationalism or Blackmail? @karanjohar bullied, Raj Thackeray emboldened."
