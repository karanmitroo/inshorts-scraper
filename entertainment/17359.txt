Indian Kathak maestro Pandit Birju Maharaj will be choreographing Deepika Padukone for a solo number in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming directorial 'Bajirao Mastani'. He was earlier supposed to choreograph a song featuring Priyanka Chopra and Deepika together. The act is set on a "more contemporary adaptation of one of my own performances set on an Avadhi-Brijwasi thumri", said Birju Maharaj.
