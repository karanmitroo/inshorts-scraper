False reports of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan committing suicide emerged online on Sunday citing 'family quarrels' over her intimate photo shoot with Ranbir Kapoor. Further, a Pakistani news website attributed her death to "marital woes". The rumours were put to rest when the actress along with her husband Abhishek Bachchan attended fashion designer Manish Malhotra's birthday party on Monday night.
