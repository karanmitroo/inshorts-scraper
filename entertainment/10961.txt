A bat was spotted flying in singer Adele's concert venue in Mexico on Tuesday. On seeing the bat close to the stage, Adele ran around in a circle flapping her arms and screamed, "There's a bat." Further, she pointed towards the audience and said, "There's a bat by your head. He landed right by your head."
