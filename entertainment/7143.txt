Singer Mika Singh has asked Sonu Nigam to change his house instead of changing loudspeakers. He said this in response to Nigam's criticism of using loudspeakers for broadcasting sermons, including Azaan. "U me...all singers have done lots of jagrans in our past life and that time we were also too loud," read one of Mika's tweets which was deleted.
