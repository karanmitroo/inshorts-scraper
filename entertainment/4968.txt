Nawazuddin Siddiqui, in a tweet, wrote, "Thank you for making me realise that I cannot be paired along with the fair & handsome because I'm dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that." Earlier, Siddiqui starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz's casting director said how they couldn't cast "fair and handsome people" with Siddiqui as it would look weird.
