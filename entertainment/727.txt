While talking about Swara Bhasker, who had criticised 'Padmaavat', Ranveer Singh said, "I got a message from (her) just yesterday...She loved my performance in the film." Swara had earlier written an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, saying that she felt "reduced to a vagina" after watching his film 'Padmaavat'. Ranveer played Sultan Alauddin Khilji in the film.
