Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone-starrer 'Tamasha' which released on Friday is an experience high on emotion, said India Today. Tamasha is at best a one-time watch because of its leads, said NDTV. Calling it watchable, Mid-Day said the film was unnecessarily stretched. The Imtiaz Ali directorial has been rated 3.5/5 (India Today, Mid-Day), 3/5 (Zee News) and 2.5/5 (NDTV).
