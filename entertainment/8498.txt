Actor Randeep Hooda praised former cricketer Virender Sehwag's tweet which was in response to Kargil martyr's daughter Gurmehar Kaur's tweet. She had earlier posted a photo holding a placard that said, "Pakistan did not kill my dad. War killed him." Virender's tweet showed him holding a placard which read, "I didn't score two triple centuries, my bat did".
