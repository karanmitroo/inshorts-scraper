Ghostbusters, the reboot of the 1984 film by the same name, which released on Friday, "is an improvement", wrote Indian Express. Hindustan Times called the film a "quirky, goofy, loud, immature tribute" to the earlier film while The Times of India wrote, "Ghostbusters also takes a clear potshot at sexism in general". It has been rated 3/5 (Indian Express, HT and TOI).
