Former censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has claimed that Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani was responsible for his removal from the post. I think I was thrown out because I was not clearing the movie 'Indu Sarkar' without cuts, he said. "To this day, I haven't been officially told by the minister that I've been replaced," he added.
