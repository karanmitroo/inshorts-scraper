Actress Kangana Ranaut, while talking on 'Koffee With Karan' about how moody her 'Rangoon' co-star Shahid Kapoor is, said, "He would look at me as if I'm some suicide bomber." She added, "So his good days are like very good, he would get breakfast for the entire crew and be so nice. But the bad days are equally bad."
