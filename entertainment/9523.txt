Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he tried his best to shift the release date of his upcoming film 'Raees'. "We were initially supposed to come on Eid in June... [but even then] it would have still clashed with 'Sultan'.There were 200 films and just 52 weeks, so then some will have to come together," he added.
