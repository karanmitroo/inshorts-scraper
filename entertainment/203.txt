Speaking about marriage plans with girlfriend Patralekhaa, Rajkummar Rao said, "It's not like both of us don't think about marriage, but we don't get stressed about it." "More than marriage, I think a relationship is about two people being happy...with each other," he added. Rao further said, "Our families would want us to get married, though they've never pressurised us."
