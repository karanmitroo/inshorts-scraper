Rajkummar Rao and Alia Bhatt have been named the Hottest Vegetarians of 2017 by animal rights organisation PETA. "Alia Bhatt and Rajkummar Rao are fit, hot, and compassionate, and they're setting a great example," said Sachin Bangera, PETA's Associate Director of Celebrity and Public Relations. "Both of PETA's winners prove that there's nothing sexier than compassion towards animals," he added.
