Television producer Vikas Gupta has said he will give ₹3 lakh each to his Bigg Boss 11's co-contestants Arshi Khan and Jyoti Kumari from the prize money of ₹6 lakh he received for becoming the show's second runner-up. Vikas added, "Jyoti stood by me like a rock when the whole house was against me... Arshi, too, was protective of me."
