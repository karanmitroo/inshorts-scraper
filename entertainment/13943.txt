Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley has said that film certification norms have to be liberal and that “some very radical changes” will be announced over the next few days. This comes amid the row over censorship in ‘Udta Punjab’, a film that portrays the problem of drug addiction in the state. Jaitley added that he was “not satisfied” with the existing system of film certification.
