Actress Parineeti Chopra has said that she would never date a guy like Aditya Roy Kapur. She attributed the reason to him being a fitness freak, who "refuses to get off her back" about working out, eating healthy and managing weight. Parineeti and Aditya starred together in the 2014 film 'Daawat-e-Ishq'.
