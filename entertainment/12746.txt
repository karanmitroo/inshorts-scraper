Singer Kesha, who had earlier accused producer Lukasz Gottwald, better known as Dr. Luke, of sexually abusing her, has dropped her sexual assault case against him. She has dismissed the allegations as she is "focussed on getting back to work". The singer has not been able to release new music with the label since 2012 owing to the legal battle.
