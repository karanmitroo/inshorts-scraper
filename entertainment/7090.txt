Pro-Kannada outfits called off their protest against the release of 'Baahubali 2' on Friday after actor Sathyaraj, who plays 'Katappa' in the film, apologised over his remarks made during the Cauvery row nine years ago. The organisations have, however, warned that if Sathyaraj tries to provoke Kannadigas again, his movies will not be allowed to release in Karnataka.
