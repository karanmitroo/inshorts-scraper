Bollywood actress and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai has praised the move of removing the swimsuit round from the international Miss World competition. “When I became Miss World, I was definitely not the best beach body of all the 87 contestants. I can vouch for it…I can put a stamp on it. And yet I won the title,” said Aishwarya.
