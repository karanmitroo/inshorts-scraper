Arshad Warsi and Amit Sadh-starrer 'Guddu Rangeela' that hit the screens this week "refuses to rise above the average level", says HT. "In their comic scenes, Warsi and Sadh are brilliant, even when they mouth horrible PJs," says India Today. The Subhash Kapoor directorial, also starring Aditi Rao Hydari, has been rated 2/5 (India Today), 2.5/5 (HT) and 3/5 (NDTV).
