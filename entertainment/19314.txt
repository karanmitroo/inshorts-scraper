Aiming to make its brand more youthful, PepsiCo Foods has roped in actor Ranbir Kapoor to endorse its Lay's potato chips. However, the company is not clear if it will renew its contract with actor Saif Ali Khan, who has been endorsing Lay's for at least eight years now. Interestingly, Ranbir is already the face of PepsiCo's flagship beverage Pepsi.
