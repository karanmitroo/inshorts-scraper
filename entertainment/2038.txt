Addressing the death threats and controversy around the film 'Padmavati', actress Deepika Padukone said, "It would be nicer to feel safer or protected at this point." She added, "Cinema has the power to bring the people together, to unite people and to spread love. It is disheartening sometimes that people don't recognise that." Deepika termed the protests "hurtful".
