In a recent magazine interview, actress Priyanka Chopra has said that she has "never dated" but has "always been in relationships". Explaining the difference, she added, "You like someone, you court each other, you get into a relationship. You’re answerable to each other. Whereas the non-answerability of dating, my god, I don’t know if I would ever be able to.”
