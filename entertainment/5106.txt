Actor Ranbir Kapoor said that if his film fails and he's making money out of it, he'll pay back the distributors. He added that it's a healthy exercise, but depends from film to film. "Like when 'Mera Naam Joker' released, distributors incurred losses. So when 'Bobby' released, my grandfather [Raj Kapoor] gave...a bigger share to distributors than exhibitors," added Ranbir.
