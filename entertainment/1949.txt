Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activist Amit Goswami has offered â‚¹1 lakh to anyone who would chop off the arms of Sunil Singh, who directed 'Game of Ayodhya'. Goswami claimed the film wrongly shows that a statue of Lord Rama was deceitfully installed in the mosque by Hindus. "I'll kill him (director Singh) if I see him anywhere," Goswami added.
