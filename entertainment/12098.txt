Musician Bruce Springsteen has described Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump as a "moron" and "tragic" during an interview with the Rolling Stone magazine. He said, "The republic is under siege by a moron, basically... it's a tragedy for our democracy." Springsteen added, "The absurdity is beyond cartoon-like. But he's gotten close enough so it can make you nervous."
