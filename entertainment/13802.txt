Filmmaker Karan Johar has revealed that he is often called gay and 'chakka', a Hindi term for eunuch, in a write-up where he talked about his experience on social media. "I've tried to figure out what's behind the nonstop trolling... I am probably as sad as you, the troller," said Johar while speaking about how he is "not emotionally privileged".
