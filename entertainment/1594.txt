The members of Pro-Kannada group Karnataka Rakshana Vedike Yuva Sene has threatened to commit suicide if Sunny Leone's New Year gig in Bangalore is not cancelled. Protesters said that her participation in the event is an assault on the culture of the land. "If she wears saree and takes part, even we'll go watch her," said the organisation's state president.
