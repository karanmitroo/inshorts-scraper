The first-ever UN sponsored study of female characters in popular films across the world revealed India leads in showing attractive women in its movies and 35% of them are shown with some nudity. Furthermore, Indian films have a higher prevalence of sexualisation of female characters. These films feature female characters in less than one-quarter of all speaking roles.
