Television actor Mohsin Khan, known for serials like Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai, went live on Instagram from a police station as he claimed a cop asked him for a bribe for jumping the signal. "I knew I did not jump but would rather pay the fine. Went live for all to see guy who was behind it," tweeted Mohsin.
