London's Warner Bros Studios will open from May 27 to June 6 the Dursleys’ home '4, Privet Drive' where the character of Harry Potter grew up in the book and film franchise. The house will reportedly have “ugly sofas, terrible tiles and vulgar curtains” and will open to mark 15 years since the first Harry Potter film released.
