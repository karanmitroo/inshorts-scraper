American band OK Go's new music video 'The One Moment' has been made from just 4.2 seconds of footage. The 4.2 seconds were extended into the song's full length of 4 minutes, with some of the footage being slowed down by 20,000 percent from real time. "I've always had a fascination with slow-mo footage," said the band's vocalist Damian Kulash.
