Actor Naseeruddin Shah, while talking about the controversy around 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', said that one needs to ask a psychiatrist why the Censor Board is afraid of female sexuality on screen. He added, "It's very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn't like."
