Actress Raveena Tandon has said that she would advise adoption over surrogacy. "I believe that making someone a part of your life through adoption provides a deeper sense of gratification," said Raveena. She added that though she believes people can go ahead with having biological children, adoption is the greatest gift that one can give any child.
