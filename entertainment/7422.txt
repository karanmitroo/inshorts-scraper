A multiplex in Bengaluru has been accused of discrimination by some audience members who claimed that the air-conditioning was switched off in the theatre where a Kannada film was being screened. As per reports, when the audience asked for the AC to be switched on, the multiplex staff said they do not normally use the AC during a Kannada film.
