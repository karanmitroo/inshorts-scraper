Actor Heath Ledger's New York apartment, where he was found dead on January 22, 2008, was filled with research material on 'The Joker', the DC character which he portrayed in the Batman film 'The Dark Knight'. He had kept numerous Batman comic books, research on the origin of the Joker and clowns and recordings of him practising the character's voice.
