Pakistani musician Atif Aslam on Saturday stopped his concert mid-way in Karachi to reprimand men who were eve-teasing a girl, as seen in a video on social media. "Tumne kabhi ladki nahi dekhi? Tumhari maa-behen bhi ho sakti hai yahaan par," he is seen saying in the video. The singer then asked security personnel to escort the girl to safety.
