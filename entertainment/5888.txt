Actress Jacqueline Fernandez, when asked if she will star opposite Salman Khan in Remo D'Souza's upcoming dance film, said, "Fingers crossed. Pray for me." Salman will reportedly play a trained dancer, who's father to a 13-year-old girl in the film. In an earlier interview, Salman revealed that although this a dance-based film, it's not a sequel to 'ABCD 2'.
