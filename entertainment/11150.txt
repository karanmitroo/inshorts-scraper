American documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has shared a post, titled 'Morning After To-Do List', following Donald Trump's election as US President. He asked Democratic politicians to "step out of the way", unless willing to "fight and resist" Republicans. People must stop saying they're "stunned" as it means they were in a "bubble", inattentive to fellow Americans' despair, he wrote further.
