The Bombay High Court on Thursday acquitted Bollywood actor Salman Khan of all charges in the 2002 hit-and-run case wherein a homeless was killed. "Because of various shortcomings in investigations, and on the basis of prosecution's evidence, Salman cannot be convicted," the High Court said. Earlier, Khan was awarded five years sentence in the case by a sessions court.
