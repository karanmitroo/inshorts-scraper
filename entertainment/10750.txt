Filmmaker Farah Khan has said she is not making a sequel to the 2004 Shah Rukh Khan starrer film 'Main Hoon Na'. "I did not announce anything officially on that. 
I'm working on a script but... the story is very different," she said. "Many times, we chat or joke about something and that goes all over (the media)," Farah added.
