Deepika Padukone's father Prakash Padukone has said whatever she's today is because of Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan. "It was a great feeling to see our daughter on screen... We never expected anyone from the family to get into Bollywood," he added. Deepika made her Bollywood debut with SRK starrer 'Om Shanti Om', which was directed by Farah Khan.
