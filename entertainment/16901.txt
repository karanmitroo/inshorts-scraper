The Harry Potter stage play, 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child', will open in London's West End in the summer of 2016, writer JK Rowling has announced. The play will tell the "untold part" of Harry Potter's life, including the story of the lives of his murdered parents. The play, however, will not be a prequel.
