Actor Ben Affleck, while speaking on the sexual harassment allegations against various Hollywood filmmakers and actors, said that he's examining his own behaviour and making sure he's part of the solution. Affleck further said that sexual harassment also has to be "a men's issue" where men call out inappropriate behaviour. He had earlier apologised for groping an actress in 2003.
