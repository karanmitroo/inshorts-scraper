Parineeti Chopra has responded on Twitter to accusations by classmates that she lied about being poor. She said her statements were being misconstrued in reference to something "very irrelevant" about her having a car or not. While Parineeti had said that she cycled to school as she was poor, her classmate claimed he remembered her father had a car.
