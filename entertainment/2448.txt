Producer Sajid Nadiadwala has said a part of his upcoming film 'Housefull 4' will be set in the Baahubali era, where all the characters will get into costumes. "(It'll) be set in two time zones. One will be in...current times," added Nadiadwala. He further said they will bring back the entire cast from the earlier 'Housefull' films.
