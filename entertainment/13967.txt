A Delhi court on Tuesday rejected an FIR filed against actors Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, who were spotted wearing shoes on the sets of a temple during a shoot for 'Bigg Boss 9'. The complainant had accused them of disrespecting Hinduism. Meanwhile, 'Colors', which airs the show, clarified that there was no intention of hurting religious sentiments.
