Actor Aamir Khan has said that the correct title for him is not 'Mr. Perfectionist' but it should rather be 'Mr. Passionate'. "That's what I am and perfection according to me doesn't exist," added Aamir. The 51-year-old actor has often been referred to as 'Mr. Perfectionist', mainly by the media, for remaining 100 percent dedicated to every film he does.
