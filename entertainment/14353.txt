Singers Sonu Nigam, Sunidhi Chauhan and Sukhwinder Singh did not charge money for singing the tracks in the upcoming film 'Sarbjit'. "I sang for free in Sarbjit due to the love I have for the entire team and the topic," said Nigam. The film is based on Sarabjit Singh, an Indian prisoner who died in a Pakistan jail in 2013.
