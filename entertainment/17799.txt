In much relief to AIB and Bollywood figures Karan Johar, Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor, the Maharashtra government has said that it will only check for clearances for the AIB Knockout. Maharashtra Culture Minister Vinod Tawde tweeted that the government won't do any "moral policing" on the show, and if all clearances were taken, it won't be stopped.
