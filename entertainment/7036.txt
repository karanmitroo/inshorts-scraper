Akshay Kumar, while reacting to the criticism he faced over receiving the National Film Award for Best Actor, said, "I've won this after 26 years (but) take it back if you feel like it." He added, "I've been hearing it for past 25 years, whenever someone wins there is some discussion around it...Someone or the other always creates a controversy."
