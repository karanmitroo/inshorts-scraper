The third episode of 'Game of Thrones' season 6, which aired on Monday, "gets closer to the wars to come," wrote India Today. Hindustan Times wrote that the episode featured "inconsequential scenes" and termed it "a disappointment" for its lack of "great debates, conversations or even a powerful dialogue". Meanwhile, Vox called the episode "a crisp, lean, nicely paced episode".
