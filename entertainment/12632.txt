As per reports, the television serial 'Sasural Simar Ka' will be going off the air. The decision is reportedly owing to the 20-year leap in the show's timeline, which resulted in low TRPs. The channel 'Colors' first removed the show from the prime time slot of 7:30 pm shifting it to 6:00 pm. Notably, the show recently completed 1600 episodes.
