Fashion designer Marc Jacobs has named late rock star Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love's daughter Frances Bean Cobain the new face of his label. "I first met Frances Bean when she was 2 years old at a dinner with her mom... I have always wanted to work with Frances," wrote Marc. Frances will feature in the label's Spring/Summer 2017 campaign.
