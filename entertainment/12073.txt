Zee and Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra has said that Zee is considering stopping programs from Pakistan on its channel 'Zindagi'. Chandra further tweeted that artists from Pakistan should leave reiterating the demand earlier made by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena for these artists to leave India within 48 hours. 'Zindagi' has aired shows like 'Humsafar', which starred actor Fawad Khan.
