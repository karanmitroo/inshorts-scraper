The shooting of the John Abraham-starrer film 'Force 2' was halted by the film wing of the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). The MNS wing alleged that foreign artists were working on the film set without valid documents. They further said that the police should do a verification of foreign artists as it is a matter of national security.
