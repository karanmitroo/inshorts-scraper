Kangana Ranaut has said she doesn't subscribe to "papa's ghar and then husband's ghar" kind of cycle of life. "I just wanted to be an independent girl. But now...at 30, I've earned a lot more than that," she added. Kangana further said she isn't scared of anything as she's among the most successful and highest paid actors in the industry.
