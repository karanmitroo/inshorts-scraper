Actor Aamir Khan, while speaking on the issue of sexual harassment, said, "I think sexual harassment is a very sad thing to happen to anyone, irrespective of what your sex is." "I understand that people are free to be romantically involved with whoever they want. But you cannot pressure a person into being with you physically," he added.
