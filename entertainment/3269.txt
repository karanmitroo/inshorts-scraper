Marco MÃ¼ller, producer of the Iranian film 'Secret Ballot', which is alleged to have "inspired" the Rajkummar Rao starrer 'Newton', has said the Indian film is not a copy of his movie. Secret Ballot's director Babak Payami said that "thematic similarities are just that". The plagiarism row began after 'Newton' was selected as India's official entry at Oscars 2018.
