Actor-filmmaker Farhan Akhtar has said that he has "a lot" on his mind about the sequel to the 2001 film 'Dil Chahta Hai', which marked his directorial debut. "It (a sequel to 'Dil Chahta Hai') is something that I would like to do. It's too early to say if anything is happening or not, only time will tell," said Farhan.
