Late actor Robin Williams’ widow and children have reached a settlement to an almost year-long dispute over his estate that included about 1,200 items. Williams’ widow Susan Schneider Williams got the house she shared with Robin among other things, while the three children got over 50 bikes, 85 watches and “thousands of never-disputed items like Robin Williams' Academy Award statue”.
