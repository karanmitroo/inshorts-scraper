The first Titanic movie 'Saved from the Titanic', which was based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912, featured a real life survivor, Dorothy Gibson. In the short film, Gibson wore the same clothes she wore the night the ship sunk. The movie debuted in theatres on May 14, 1912, just a month after the real incident.
