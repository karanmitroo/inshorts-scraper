Producer-photographer Atul Kasbekar has said that news these days has become a reality television show and a joke. "What is right and what is wrong, I will figure it out myself, but first tell me what has happened with the version you know," added Kasbekar. He further said that everyone just provides the fodder which is no longer news.
