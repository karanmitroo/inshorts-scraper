The Kerala High Court has rejected the second bail plea of actor Dileep who is an accused in the Malayalam actress abduction and assault case. In the second bail plea, Dileep's lawyer stated that the actor had been wrongly implicated. The prosecution however emphasised that if let out on bail, Dileep could tamper with the evidence.
