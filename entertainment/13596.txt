Actor Irrfan Khan has said that Rajinikanth’s film 'Kabali' "stole" the poster of his film 'Madaari' but said it was no big deal. "Watch his film and watch our film, too,” said Irrfan. While the 'Madaari' poster is the official poster for the film, the poster mentioned by Irrfan for 'Kabali' is reportedly a fan-made poster, according to Rajinikanth’s fans.
