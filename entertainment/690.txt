Actor Jim Carrey won't face trial over the suicide of his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White in 2015 as the charges against him have been dismissed. Cathriona's estranged mother and ex-husband had filed a lawsuit against Carrey, accusing him of giving her prescription drugs and multiple sexually transmitted diseases. "Jim's looking forward to moving on with his life now," said his spokesperson.
