Shilpa Shetty, who turned 42 on Thursday, became the first Indian to participate in and win the British reality show Celebrity Big Brother in its fifth season in 2007. The show, which inspired the Indian version Bigg Boss, became controversial when housemate Jade Goody and two others were accused of being racist and bullying Shilpa. Later, Jade apologised to Shilpa.
