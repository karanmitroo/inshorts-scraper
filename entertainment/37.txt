Amitabh Bachchan took to Twitter to share pictures of a fan who came to see him at his residence. "This little one braved the Sunday crowds and came through the gates...just for a wave...! So cute...!" he wrote. Amitabh makes an appearance at his house's gate every Sunday to wave to fans waiting outside, as part of his 'Sunday darshan'.
