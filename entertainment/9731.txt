Actress Parineeti Chopra deleted a video which showed her taking a stroll along a beach as a man carried her luggage and held an umbrella over her head; after she was criticised for it. "Holding your own umbrella wouldn't make you any less of a star," commented a user. "The umbrella must have been a 100 kilos," read another response.
