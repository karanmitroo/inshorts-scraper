As per reports, Indian origin British filmmaker Gurinder Chadha may direct former 'One Direction' band member Zayn Malik in a film soon. "We've met and spoken. He trained as an actor first then became part of the band. So I think what he'll be doing is staying true to his heart...", Chadha was quoted as saying.
