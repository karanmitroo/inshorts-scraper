Ayushmann Khurana-starrer 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' has a "story" which is hard to find in Bollywood these days, says Indian Express. It's a sweet tale of a good-looking but good-for-nothing guy who marries an overweight girl under family pressure. The film, which makes you believe that 'love-comes-in-all-sizes', has got 3.5/5 (NDTV, Indian Express), 4/5 (Zee) and 3/5 (India Today) ratings.
