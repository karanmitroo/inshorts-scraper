Kushan Nandy, director of upcoming film Babumoshai Bandookbaaz has said that actress Chitrangada Singh didn't return the fee she charged for the film after quitting the project mid-way. He added, "I don't want it back as well...I've no expectations from her for anything." Chitrangada left the project citing discomfort shooting intimate scenes but Nandy denied her claims.
