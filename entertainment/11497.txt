Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that there should not be a ban only on Pakistani artistes but there should also be no import and export between India and Pakistan. "[O]ur film association body IMPPA was also there whose committee members don't make films but to gain mileage they said 'we will ban Pakistani actors'," added Nihalani.
