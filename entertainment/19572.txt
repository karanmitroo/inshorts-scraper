Ranbir Kapoor starrer 'Besharam', which will be released in at-least 3600 screens in India, is set to become the biggest release in Hindi film history, beating record of SRK's 'Chennai Express' (3500-screens). Reliance Entertainment, distributor of 'Besharam', said they planned 4000 screens initially but lost some screens in South India to Pawan Kalyan's Telugu film 'Attarintiki Daredi'.
