Guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant of the rock band 'Led Zeppelin' on Tuesday will appear for the trial over copyright issues in their track 'Stairway to Heaven'. The band has been sued by Michael Skidmore, the trustee of Spirit's guitarist Randy Wolfe. Skidmore claims that the opening for Zeppelin's track is a copy of Spirit's instrumental track 'Taurus'.
