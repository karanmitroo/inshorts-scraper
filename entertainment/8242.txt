Actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh's concert in Delhi University's Hansraj College was stopped midway after a leak occurred in a cylinder near the stage. Following this, the audience was asked to evacuate the area, which resulted in a stampede. The crowd had reportedly broken barricades and gathered around the stage. Some students also suffered injuries during the stampede.
