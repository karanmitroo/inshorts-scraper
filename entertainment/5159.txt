Anushka Sharma has been cleared by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the electric installation case. BMC issued a notice after one of Anushka's neighbours filed a complaint about her having installed an electric junction box in the common area of the building without permission. The neighbour is now claiming that Anushka is being given preferential treatment as she's an actress.
