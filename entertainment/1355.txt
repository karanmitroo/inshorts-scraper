Rajput organisation Karni Sena's member Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi said the committee formed to review Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati' had opposed the film but the Central Board of Film Certification decided to certify it under pressure from the underworld. "Our people will be outside cinema halls and each hall which shows the film will be vandalised," the organisation's member added.
