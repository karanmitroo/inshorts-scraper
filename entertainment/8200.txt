Amitabh Bachchan has revealed that a scene in the 1975 film 'Sholay' took three years to shoot. "There was a particular kind of lighting required for that shot... we waited for three years for one flash of a shot," said Bachchan. He added that director Ramesh Sippy said the shot would not be filmed until the correct lighting was there.
