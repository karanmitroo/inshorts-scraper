The song 'Saat Samundar Paar' from the 1992 film Vishwatma is inspired by a 1988 English song 'Heart' by synthpop duo Pet Shop Boys. The Hindi version starred late actress Divya Bharti, and was later used in Salman Khan's 2014 film 'Kick'. The original song 'Heart' was on top of the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in its year.
