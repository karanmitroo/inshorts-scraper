Reacting to 'Newton' not making it to the new shortlist at Oscars 2018, director Hansal Mehta tweeted, "Oscars or no Oscars, it remains one of the finest films made in our country in a long time." Rajkummar Rao, the lead actor of 'Newton', earlier worked with Mehta in 'Aligarh' and will be seen in his upcoming film 'Omerta'.
