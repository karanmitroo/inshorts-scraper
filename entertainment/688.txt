Actress Amy Schumer has said she was "flat-out raped" while talking about her first sexual encounter. She added that her first sexual experience, which was when she was in her late teenage years, wasn't a good one. Recalling another instance, Amy said, "I had another time with a boyfriend where I was saying: 'No, stop'...and it was just completely ignored."
