In his appearance on Koffee with Karan, actor Varun Dhawan said he'd pick Tiger Shroff, when asked by host Karan to choose a partner in a same-sex relationship. "Because he'll be very flexible and show me positions (in bed) which I don't know," added Varun. Actors Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh and Sidharth Malhotra were the other options given to him.
