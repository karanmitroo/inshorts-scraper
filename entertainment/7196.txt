TVF CEO Arunabh Kumar, an accused in sexual harassment case, has reportedly said in his statement to the police that he only clicked a selfie with the alleged victim. "I neither massaged her nor communicated with her through any electronic medium," Arunabh claimed. "I have never stripped in front of her nor did I pose any wrong gestures," he added.
