US-based artist and upcycler Gabriel Dishaw has used old Louis Vuitton bags to create sculptures of characters like Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and Stormtrooper from the 'Star Wars' franchise. Dishaw also used materials like braided wire and computer chips for his creations. The LV Stormtrooper sculpture was displayed at the Indiana State Museum at the entrance of IMAX Theater.
