Television host Jimmy Kimmel recently shared a video on Facebook, featuring a "special bonus edition" of the 'I Told My Kids I Ate All Their Halloween Candy' prank. The prank, which was started six years ago, requires parents to film the reaction of their children by telling them that they ate all the Halloween candy while the children were asleep.
