Sonakshi Sinha said she wouldn't wear a bikini, as she had to face her parents, and didn't feel comfortable being seen in one. Sonakshi also opened up about the intimate scene with her co-star Ranveer Singh, saying that the script had a full-fledged kissing scene, but director Vikramaditya Motwane replaced that with an aesthetically shot intimate scene on her demand.
