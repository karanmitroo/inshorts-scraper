Kareena Kapoor was supposed to make her Bollywood debut as lead actress opposite Hrithik Roshan in the 2000 film 'Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai' but later opted out of the film. However, a scene she shot in which she can be seen wearing blue sweater and jeans, was retained in the final cut of the film. Kareena turned 37 on Thursday.
