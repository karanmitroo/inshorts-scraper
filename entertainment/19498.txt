After SRK, It is Salman khan now who has joined the charitable bandwagon. Salman has taken responsibility to pay all the hospital bills of a background dancer named Vinay Rajput who is currently hospitalized due to kidney failure. 100 dancers from 'Jai Ho', Salman's home-production, also donated their day's pay for the hospital bills.
