The makers of Rajinikanth's yet-untitled next Tamil film have clarified that it is not based on Haji Mastan's life. "It's not even a biopic. It's just a fictional story set in Mumbai," added the makers. Earlier, reports of Rajinikanth portraying a don, who lived in Mumbai between 1926 and 1994, lead to speculations that the film was based on Mastan.
