Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has said a film cannot be tagged as commercial just because it has a big star in it. Citing examples, he added that Shah Rukh Khan's 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' and Salman Khan's 'Tubelight', which did not perform well at the box-office, cannot be called commercial films. Rohit further said a good commercial film will always work.
