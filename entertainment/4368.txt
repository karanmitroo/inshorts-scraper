Actor Akshay Kumar has said that his upcoming film 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha' has been given three verbal cuts by the CBFC. "I have read [the] news that the film has got eight or nine cuts from the censor board, but this is wrong," he added. Akshay further said one of the cuts required the removal of the word 'haraami'.
