In emails that surfaced as part of police investigation, Kangana Ranaut allegedly wrote to Hrithik Roshan that she asked RK, who is said to be Ranbir Kapoor, if he'd be interested in a physical relationship with her. The email further reads, "He got a little intimidated and asked why not a regular relationship...I said because I'm in love with someone."
