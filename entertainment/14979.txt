Bollywood actor John Abraham recently said that he doesn't go to award function because he feels they are just circus ads. When asked about Riteish Deshmukh saying 'John can never learn acting' at an award function, John said, "Riteish is a friend and... people crack jokes there, so, I take it in good spirits. I donâ€™t take such things seriously."
