Hollywood actor Brad Pitt will not face any charges over an incident in which he was reported to have been abusive towards one or more of his children in a mid-September plane incident, as per an FBI spokeswoman. He was cleared earlier this month by the Los Angeles officials. The FBI will not pursue further investigation into the matter.
