Actress Amy Jackson, while commenting on Taapsee Pannu being hit by a coconut on her midriff for a Telugu film scene, said, "If someone did that to me, I will throw the coconut right back at them." She further requested makers to please stop this. Telugu films often show actresses being hit by objects like flowers on their midriffs.
