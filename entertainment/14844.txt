Punjabi singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh's film 'Ambarsariya' has been banned in Pakistan for allegedly making references to the intelligence agency RAW. "[T]he movie is primarily about RAW and editing would have affected its story", Mobasher Hasan, chairman of the Censor board said. The film revolves around a man who lives a dual life as an RAW agent and an insurance agent.
