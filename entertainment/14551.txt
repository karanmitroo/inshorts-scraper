Sussanne Khan, former wife of Hrithik Roshan, on Wednesday came out in support of the actor in relation to his ongoing legal fight with actress Kangana Ranaut. Sharing a picture with Hrithik, Sussanne wrote, "Pictures are photo shopped and untrue stories carry too much weight... I support Hrithik in this".
