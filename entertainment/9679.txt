Actress Kalki Koechlin, when asked in an interview about performing nude, said that the body is the least naked part of hers. "That (performing nude) took nerves, just to be in front of an audience and forget myself," the 33-year-old actress added. She further said that once she's in character, it's almost like it's not her on stage.
