Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani said that veteran actor Amol Palekar hardly has any experience in the field of censorship. This comes after Palekar moved the Supreme Court seeking relaxation in the censorship of films. Pahlaj added, "[Palekar wants] films should be given censor certificates without any cuts or without even viewing. He has no idea what he's talking about."
