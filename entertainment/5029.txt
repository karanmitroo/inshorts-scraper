Madhur Bhandarkar, while tagging Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi's Twitter handle, asked if he can have his freedom of expression. Bhandarkar's tweet came after promotions for his upcoming film 'Indu Sarkar' were disrupted by Congress workers in Pune. The filmmaker had tweeted that he and his team were "stranded like hostages" in the room after Congress workers "barged in" the hotel.
