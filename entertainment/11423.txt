Actress Katrina Kaif has said that she does not believe in the popular classification of roles as glamorous and deglamorous. "For me, (a role), is just a role," the 33-year-old actress added. "Glamour comes from who you are," she said, further adding that her role in 'Rajneeti' was a "completely deglamorous character" for her.
