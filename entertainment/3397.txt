A real dead body was found on the sets of British TV show 'Rellik' as the crew arrived to film with their own fake dead body and were sent back by the police. Actor Paterson Joseph, who plays a psychiatrist on the show, said, "It was bizarre, fact being stranger than fiction." Notably, the show revolves around a serial killer.
