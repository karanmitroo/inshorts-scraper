The Diana Penty starrer 'Happy Bhag Jayegi' has been banned in Pakistan. The country's Censor Board had issues with a scene showing Pakistani leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah's portrait​ and the character of a Pakistani policeman, played by Piyush Mishra. While the Board had earlier asked only for minor cuts, a ministry in Pakistan​ reportedly objected to the film.
