Actor Varun Dhawan has choreographed some action sequences in his upcoming film 'Badlapur'. Most of the scenes between him and co-actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui have been choreographed by him. The sequences would come naturally to Dhawan, who was completely absorbed in his character 'Raghu'. Director Sriram Raghavan allowed him to call the shots to lend a real feel to the scenes.
