US rapper Pitbull sent his private plane to Puerto Rico to bring cancer patients to the US for chemotherapy after Hurricane Maria struck the island last week, causing widespread destruction. "Thank God we're blessed to help. Just doing my part," Pitbull said. Earlier, singer Jennifer Lopez donated $1 million to the relief effort in Puerto Rico.
