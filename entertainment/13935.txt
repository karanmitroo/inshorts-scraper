Singer Ed Sheeran is facing a $20 million lawsuit over accusations that his song 'Photograph' is a copy of the 2012 song 'Amazing'. The writers of 'Amazing', Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, have claimed that the chorus of 'Photograph,' contains "approximately 70 percent of the notes" identical to or substantially related to notes in the chorus of their song.
