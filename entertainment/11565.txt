A Marathi film industry body on Wednesday backed the calls for a ban on Pakistani film artistes working in India. The Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal said it opposed the release of films featuring Pakistani artistes till relations between the two countries improved. "If such films are released, there would be tension during the festive season," it said.
