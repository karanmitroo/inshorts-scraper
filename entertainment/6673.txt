Parineeti Chopra has said when people criticised her older appearance, they were right. Talking about her old photos, she said, "I know that's not me. I'm a very self-assured person which is what makes me real. I'm not showing off by doing so." Parineeti added, "I knew when I lose the weight, everybody will say that she looks so good."
