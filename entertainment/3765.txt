Saif Ali Khan has said the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) is a magical place where films are sent and they come out with lesser or no cuts at all. His upcoming film 'Kaalakaandi' is under the Tribunal's review currently. Earlier, it was reported that the film had been given 73 cuts by the Censor Board.
