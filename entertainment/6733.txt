Nicki Minaj has offered to pay tuition fees for about 30 fans, provided they have A grades that can be verified by the school. The singer was previously running a contest to pay the international airfare for a fan to attend the upcoming Billboard awards. Nicki extended the contest to fees, when a user tweeted she needed help with it.
