Actress Pooja Batra is set to play the role of an astronaut modeled on Kalpana Chawla, India's first woman in space, in the upcoming Hollywood film, 'One Under the Sun'. The film stars Batra as astronaut Kathryn Voss, the sole survivor following a disastrous space shuttle mission. The actor reportedly opted for black, shoulder-length hair to look similar to Kalpana.
