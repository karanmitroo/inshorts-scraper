The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has opposed the release of the Marathi dubbed version of the Sushant Singh Rajput starrer 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' in Maharashtra. "By dubbing such movies in Marathi, you are creating competition for local films," said MNS Chitrapat Karmachari Sena President Amey Khopkar. The film was being dubbed to target the regional language film industry.
