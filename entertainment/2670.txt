Harvey Weinstein, who was fired from The Weinstein Company over rape allegations, has sued the company as he wants access to his personnel file and email account which could help him defend himself. The lawsuit further says he needs the information to prevent the company from being harmed by unjustified legal settlements. Notably, Weinstein had co-founded the company in 2005.
