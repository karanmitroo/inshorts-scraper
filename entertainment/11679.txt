Actress Kangana Ranaut said that she is perhaps the "only top actress" in Bollywood who has done B-grade films. "I haven't set any standards that I have to do this work or this is where I have to go. I don't put that kind of pressure on myself," added Kangana while speaking on the kind of projects that she picks.
