American actor-comedian Kevin Hart revealed that he found it "weird" when a fan got a tattoo of his face on his lower back. "I was like, 'I don't know what you did that for, sir. I don't know why it's there. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do after seeing that. I guess thank you," added Kevin.
