The 'I will never let you down' singer-actress Rita Ora chose to go bare in a photograph she shared with her followers on Instagram. She stripped off to just a pair of red high heels, sitting on the chair with her legs crossed. Ora posted another photograph which suggests she is now in the process of making her second album.
