Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he would rather have his son Aryan assist American filmmaker Steven Spielberg than him. He added, "That's a billion times better. Then, he can come back to India, make a film and take it international." He jokingly said further, "But...you never know, you might hear that Karan Johar is launching him."
