When asked what Karan Johar offers to guests on his talk show 'Koffee With Karan', actress Kangana Ranaut jokingly responded, "Zeher pilata hai, mujhse puchho (Karan serves poison to his guests)." Kangana said this during the shooting of the TV show 'India's Next Superstars', where Johar is a judge while she had been invited as a guest.
