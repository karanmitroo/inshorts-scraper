Following the row over actress Swara Bhasker's open letter opposing the alleged glorification of the practice of jauhar in 'Padmaavat', she jokingly tweeted, "I like being in the limelight, hence I create controversy." In the open letter which  Swara addressed to 'Padmaavat' director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, she wrote that she felt "reduced to a vagina" after watching the film.
