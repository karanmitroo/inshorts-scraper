Actor Dhanush walked out of a television interview when the journalist asked him questions about the Suchi leaks controversy regarding private pictures of celebrities, including Dhanush, being leaked through RJ-singer Suchitra's Twitter account. The journalist asked him about the allegations and how his family life was at stake. "This is a really stupid interview," said Dhanush as he walked out.
