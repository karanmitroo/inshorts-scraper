Kangana Ranaut, who addressed the 'Women in the World Summit' in London on Monday, said that some Bollywood films do objectify women. Further, saying that women should not seek others' approval, Kangana added, "It’s a lot more important for women to accept themselves as opposed to others’ approval of them. Others’ opinion will always shift, their perspective will change".
