Actress Hema Malini has revealed that during the initial days of shooting for the 1971 film 'Andaz', Rajesh Khanna would behave strangely with her. "He was the reigning superstar and women would adore him for his charm. But I didn't give him any special bhaav as a co-actor," added Hema. She further said, "I thought...he was too full of himself."
