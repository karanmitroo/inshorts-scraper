Actress Sonam Kapoor has revealed that her father Anil Kapoor cut her off when she turned 18. She added that this was one of her father's best decisions as she learnt to become responsible as an adult. "[E]very decision that I made in my career, every misstep and every triumph has all been my own," said Sonam.
