Actor Amitabh Bachchan has said that former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju's statement about the actor having nothing in his head is true. Katju had earlier criticised Bachchan by saying, "Apart from being a good actor, what is there...? Has he any scientific ideas for solving the countryâ€™s massive problems?" Bachchan and Katju studied in the same school in Allahabad.
