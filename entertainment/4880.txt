RJ Malishka, following the criticism by Yuva Sena leaders on her pothole song, tweeted that she has composed six more songs. The leaders wanted Mumbai's civic body BMC to file a â‚¹500 crore defamation case against her for maligning the civic body's image. BMC also sent a notice to Malishka's mother over breeding of dengue mosquitoes at her Mumbai home.
