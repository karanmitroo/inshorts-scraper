After a 7-year-long engagement and 14-years of togetherness, the "Big Eyes" actress Amy Adams married her boyfriend Darren LeGallo in California on Saturday. The couple was engaged in April 2008, two years before the birth of their daughter, Aviana, who turns 5 next month. Amy and Darren swapped vows in very hush-hush fashion, with presumably a small gathering.
