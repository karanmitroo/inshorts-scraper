Singer Sonu Nigam on Tuesday tweeted, "Guys, in favour of me and in opposition, let's agree to agree and disagree. No need to fuel this anymore... Prayers". He offered to apologise if his tweets were found to be "anti-Muslim". Nigam, who on Sunday posted a video of Azaan, had criticised "forced religiousness" after being woken up by the Azaan.
