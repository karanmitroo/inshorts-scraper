UK's Prince Harry himself designed the engagement ring for American actress Meghan Markle using a central stone from Botswana and two other diamonds which belonged to his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. The couple dated for over an year before announcing their engagement on Monday. The yellow-gold ring was made by the official jewellers to UK Queen Elizabeth II.
