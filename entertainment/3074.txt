Aamir Khan has said he wants to document each and every moment of his life in his autobiography but doesn't want it to release when he's alive. "I'll be extremely honest...in my autobiography, which is why I don't want to be around when it's published," added Aamir. He further said he'll hand his autobiography to his lawyer before his death.
