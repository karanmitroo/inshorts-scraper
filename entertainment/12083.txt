Indian entertainment startup Paper Weight has released a short film titled 'Keh Ke Lengey Funding' as a proposal for the investors to raise funding. Made on the lines of Bollywood movie Gangs of Wasseypur, it features the startup's team members and takes jibes at rivals AIB and TVF. The startup has dedicated the short film to filmmaker Anurag Kashyap.
