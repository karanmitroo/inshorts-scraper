Sonakshi Sinha's brother Luv Sinha has asked if Armaan Malik and Amaal Malik can point a finger at Salman Khan and Amitabh Bachchan for singing. He added, "Armaan, Amaal should think about how they perform...when they try displaying their 'acting' skills in music videos." This comes after Sonakshi and Armaan got into a Twitter argument over actors turning into singers.
