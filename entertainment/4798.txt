The producers of the Tom Cruise starrer 'American Made' are being sued by the families of two men, who died in a September 2015 plane crash on the film's set. They have alleged that the production companies ignored safety procedures before the flight in order to save time and money. The families hope their lawsuit establishes stricter regulations on safety.
