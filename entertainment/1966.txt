Actress Rani Mukerji has said she finds it hilarious that stylists dress actors for the airport. "Actors are constantly judged even when they are going on a flight," she added. Rani further said, "Earlier, when you had to go to the airport, you preferred comfortable clothes...people wanted to wear slippers and go but today you cannot imagine anyone wearing slippers."
