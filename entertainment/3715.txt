MM Keeravani, who composed music for the 'Baahubali' films, has been trolled for tweeting that the song 'Jai Balayya' from Telugu film 'Paisa Vasool' has become synonymous to 'Jai Hind'. "It's the worst comparison from a legendary music composer," commented a user. "It's correct to play National Anthem before every movie. Keeravani should learn to respect nation," wrote another comment.
