Actress Esha Gupta, while speaking about being an outsider in Bollywood, said, "I wish I didn't have this surname but that surname (referring to being a star kid)." "I'm still treated like an outsider...by the so-called industry people," she added. Esha further said, "I can't blame them because even I haven't made an effort to be a part of them."
