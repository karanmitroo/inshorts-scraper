Bollywood legends Amitabh Bachchan and Sridevi may be seen reuniting on screen for a sequel of their hit 1992 film Khuda Gawah. The actors will be approached once the script for the sequel, which could go on floors in 2014, is complete, said producer Manoj Desai. The original movie was about an Afghan Lord caught between love and revenge.
