Rajput organisation Karni Sena has called for a bandh in Chittorgarh ahead of the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati'. Reportedly, the locals are also supporting the bandh by the Karni Sena. The opposition from the organisation comes based on claims that Bhansali has distorted historical and cultural facts about the Rajput queen.
