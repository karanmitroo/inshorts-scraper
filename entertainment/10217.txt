Former J&K CM Omar Abdullah, while reacting to people trolling the name of Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor's newborn baby, said that their opinions do not matter. "The only people who get to decide a baby's name are the parents of said baby & the ones they ask... May #TaimurAliKhan have a happy & healthy life," he tweeted.
