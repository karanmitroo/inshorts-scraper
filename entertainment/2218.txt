Singer Shaan has said that he is not out of work if he is not getting any film music. "I do live shows. I travel. I focus my energies elsewhere," added the 45-year-old singer. Shaan further said, "I survived for 20 years in the industry because I sang songs differently, even if they were of the same genre."
