Irish police investigating English comedian Stephen Fry for potential blasphemy have dropped the case citing lack of a substantial number of people 'outraged' by his 2015 comments in which he called God "stupid" and "selfish". Former Justice Minister Dermot Ahern had previously stated that the Irish blasphemy law was constructed to make it "virtually impossible" to prove intent to hurt.
