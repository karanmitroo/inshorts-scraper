Shatrughan Sinha, while speaking about the row on 'Padmavati', tweeted, "People are asking why the legendary Amitabh Bachchan, most versatile Aamir Khan and most popular Shah Rukh Khan have no comments." "How come our I&B Minister or our most popular Hon'ble PM...are maintaining silence," he added. Shatrughan further said he'll comment only after director Sanjay Leela Bhansali speaks up.
