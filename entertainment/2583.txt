Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey's brother Randall Fowler has revealed that he was raped by their father throughout his adolescence. Randall added, "There was so much darkness in our home it was beyond belief. It was absolutely miserable." This comes after Spacey came out as gay while apologising for making sexual advances towards actor Anthony Rapp when he was 14.
