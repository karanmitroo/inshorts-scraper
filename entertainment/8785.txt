An old video of Pakistani actress Saba Qamar calling Salman Khan a 'chichora' (indecent) on a talk show has surfaced online. Qamar was asked by the show's host to give reasons for rejecting hypothetical film offers with Bollywood actors. For not working with Salman, Saba jokingly gave the reason, "Bahut chichore hain...choreographer ka koi bhi style nahi hai inmein."
