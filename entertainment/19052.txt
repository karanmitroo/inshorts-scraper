Actor Sanjay Dutt's third month of continuous parole ends Friday and he is heading back to Yerawada jail (Pune). The actor didn't seek further addition as he had exhausted his two legally permissible extensions. Dutt is serving out a 5-year sentence of imprisonment for illegal possession and destruction of an AK-56 rifle before the 1993 Mumbai blasts.
