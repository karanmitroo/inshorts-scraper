The first look poster of the Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon starrer film 'Raabta' has been unveiled. "I wonder if she felt the same way I did, like there was something more, some unexplainable connection, a #Raabta," tweeted Sushant while sharing the poster. The film, scheduled to release on June 9, has been directed by Dinesh Vijan.
