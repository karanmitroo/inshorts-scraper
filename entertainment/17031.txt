Hollywood actor Tom Hanks has sent a personal note to co-star Irrfan Khan as they shoot 'Inferno', an adaptation of Dan Brown's book, together. The note reads, “This will be most pleasant movie to make, I think, provided you and I have a few more scenes together! If not, we will just have to save the world as is!”
