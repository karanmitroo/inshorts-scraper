Sidharth Malhotra and Manoj Bajpayee starrer 'Aiyaary' has failed to get a clearance for release in Pakistan. The film has been banned reportedly due to its premise which is set against the backdrop of Indian Army. Notably, this is the third film directed by Neeraj Pandey to be banned in Pakistan, after 'Baby' and 'Naam Shabana'.
