Actor Salman Khan has said that he expected critics to give -3, -4 ratings to his recently released film Tubelight. "But they gave 1, 1.5 apparently, so I'm very pleased," added Salman. In an earlier interview, Salman said that his films are critic-proof and added, "I'm telling them (critics) now: go give my film minus 100 stars, why just zero."
