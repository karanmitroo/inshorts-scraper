Responding to Bombay High Court's verdict regarding his early release from prison in the 1993 serial bomb blasts case, actor Sanjay Dutt said, "Truth prevails." "This is a big relief. The honourable high court has quashed all baseless allegations," he added. The judicial bench of Bombay HC had dismissed a petition citing favouritism showed towards Sanjay Dutt by the state.
