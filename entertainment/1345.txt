Maharajkumar Vishvaraj Singh, the 76th Maharana of the Mewar dynasty and a former Lok Sabha member, has slammed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for agreeing to certify the film 'Padmavati' without his consent. "Cosmetic changes like the proposed change in name will not change the fact that the movie refers to real places, my ancestors," said Vishvaraj.
