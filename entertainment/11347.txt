Actor Ranbir Kapoor, referring to his statement "mauke pe chauka maar diya" regarding his intimate scenes with Aishwarya in 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', has said his comments were taken in "bad taste". "Aishwarya is one of India's most talented and respected women. I couldn't have disrespected her like that," he clarified, adding that the conversation was "blown out of context".
