The TIME magazine has named singer Beyoncé as one of the Person of the Year 2016 runners-up. "Beyoncé publicly embraced explicitly feminist blackness at a politically risky moment," TIME stated. It added Beyoncé was selected as "she offered a recipe for transforming the bitter politics of 2016 into the sort of lemonade Southern black women have been making for generations."
