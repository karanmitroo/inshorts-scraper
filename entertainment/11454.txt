Actress Priyanka Chopra has revealed she was once asked to sign a contract with a corporation which could be terminated if she got pregnant. "Their logic was I wouldn't be able to deliver the project on time," the actress said. "If I can deliver (pregnant), and you donâ€™t want me to, I've the right to terminate," Priyanka told the corporation.
