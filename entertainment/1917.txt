When asked to comment on the ongoing row over the film 'Padmavati', filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said, "My opinion will not solve the issue." He added, "Constant talk on the topic is creating more fear in our mind...By asking the question, media did not solve the issue but paid attention to some regional groups. They are taking advantage of it."
