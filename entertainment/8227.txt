A police complaint was filed against Ram Gopal Varma for his tweet on International Women's Day which read, "I wish all women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives." In the complaint, activist Vishakha Mhambrey has claimed that the "objectionable tweet insults women's prestige". Further, Mhambrey has requested that Varma's Twitter account be blocked permanently.
