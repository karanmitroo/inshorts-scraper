A collection of letters written by late British actress Audrey Hepburn has sold at the Bonhams auction for £11,250 (approximately ₹10 lakh), more than twice the estimate. The letters were written between 1951 and 1960 by Audrey to her mentor Sir Felix Aylmer. They reveal Audrey's journey from being an unknown ballerina to becoming a Hollywood star.
