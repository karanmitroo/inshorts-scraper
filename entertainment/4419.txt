Actress Anushka Sharma has said that diversifying roles, like that of 'Sejal' in Imtiaz Ali's 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' (JHMS), is very simple as the girl is either bubbly or serious. She added that Imtiaz and Shah Rukh Khan have also said that 'Sejal' is similar to her. However, Anushka said she finds her personality and the character "quite dissimilar".
