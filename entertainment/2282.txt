Discussing the controversy over the release of the film 'Padmavati', Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has tweeted that the education of Rajasthani women is more important than their "ghoonghats". He further wrote, "The Padmavati controversy is an opportunity to focus on the conditions of Rajasthani women today & not just of queens six centuries ago. Rajasthan's female literacy among lowest."
