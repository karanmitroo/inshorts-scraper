Singer Ed Sheeran, responding to accusations of not performing live during his Glastonbury concert, tweeted, "Never thought I'd have to explain it, but everything I do in my live show is live...it's a loop station...not a backing track." Sheeran was accused of using backing tracks after he wasn't seen playing the guitar while its sound was heard during the concert.
