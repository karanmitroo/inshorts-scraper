Shah Rukh Khan, who is returning to TV with quiz show 'India Poochega Sabse Shaana Kaun', has said that 'Bigg Boss' is not his cup of tea. SRK, however, appreciated show's hosts Salman Khan and Farah Khan for their work. He said, "I'm open to seeing it...but, as a host, I don't think I will be very good at it."
