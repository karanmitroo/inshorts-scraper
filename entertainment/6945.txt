Hollywood actor Chris Pratt said his four-year-old son Jack likes Spiderman over Star-Lord, the superhero character portrayed by him in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. "I don't know if he fully understands what makes Star-Lord great because Star-Lord doesn't really have any superpowers," he added. Chris further explained that his son is more into super powers.
