Hollywood actress Salma Hayek has revealed that rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein forced her into doing a lesbian sex scene in the 2002 film 'Frida', of which he was the distributor. Calling Weinstein a monster, Salma added, "It was clear to me he'd never let me finish this movie without him having his fantasy one way or another."
