Hollywood actress Anna Faris, while narrating her experience of facing sexual harassment, said, "I was doing a scene where I was on a ladder...and he (the director) slapped my a** in front of the crew." Faris added, "All I could do was giggle...But it made me feel small. He wouldn't have done that to the lead male."
