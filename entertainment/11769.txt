Travel magazine Cond√© Nast Traveller has issued a statement responding to the criticism over its cover featuring Priyanka Chopra. "[W]e believe... the opening up of borders and the breaking down of walls can help us... open up our minds and hearts. So... we had actress Priyanka Chopra wear [the] T-shirt... [I]t's not about privilege or fashion," read the statement.
