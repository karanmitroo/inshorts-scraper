Pakistani actress Mahira Khan said that her 'Raees' co-star Shah Rukh Khan has spoilt her for life. She added, "He used to tell me to do things this way...that way (while shooting 'Raees')." When Mahira asked SRK if she's not doing it right, he said, "Do it your way but...when you see yourself onscreen...don't say, why didn't you tell me!"
