Bollywood actress Zareen Khan has claimed that she has turned down an offer given to her by a weight loss pill company to endorse their product. She was reportedly offered ₹1 crore for the same. "I cannot endorse something I don’t believe in... there are no shortcuts to weight loss," the 29-year-old said in a statement.
