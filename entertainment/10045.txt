Broken Heart Syndrome, also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a temporary heart condition that is often triggered by stressful situations, such as the death of a loved one. The Broken heart syndrome is often preceded by an intense physical or emotional event. In a notable example, actress Carrie Fisher's mother passed away a day after her death.
