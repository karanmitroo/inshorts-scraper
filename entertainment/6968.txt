Around 100 Kanye West fans on Thursday set up camp for two nights outside a store in England to purchase a pair of £150 (₹12,500) Adidas Yeezy Boost trainers designed by the rapper. The first campers arrived last weekend with tents, chairs and sleeping bags. Meanwhile, Danish police are searching for thieves who robbed a truck delivering the trainers.
