The Lahore High Court on Thursday banned the release of the Saif Ali Khan and Katrina Kaif starrer “Phantom” in Pakistan upon hearing a plea filed against it by JuD chief and alleged Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed. Saeed alleged that the film, set on post-26/11 attacks contains “filthy propaganda” against him and his outfit.
