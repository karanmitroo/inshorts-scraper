Music composer-singer Pritam has said 'Jagga Jasoos' took time as it was a complicated project. "It's not easy to take up a subject like that and live with it for over four years," he added. Earlier, Rishi Kapoor slammed director Anurag Basu for delaying the film and blamed Pritam while saying, "Pritam probably delivered the music only a week before".
