Actress Rituparna Sengupta has said that her role in the Bengali film 'Rajkahani' can not be compared to Vidya Balan's role in the Bollywood film 'Begum Jaan'. Both the versions were directed by Srijit Mukherji. "I own my character Begun Jaan in me. Nobody will forget Rajkahini's Begum Jaan. Who was the first and second choice doesn't matter," said Rituparna.
