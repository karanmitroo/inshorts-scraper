Reacting to the Censor Board's decision of dropping all references to Punjab from the movie 'Udta Punjab', Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that the move will not fix the state's drug problem. "Punjab has a crippling drug problem. Censoring #UdtaPunjab will not fix it. The government must accept the reality and find solutions," Gandhi tweeted.
