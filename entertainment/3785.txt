In a promotional video for 'Aap Ki Adalat', Kangana Ranaut can be seen demanding an apology over the row with Hrithik Roshan, which took place after she called him a "silly ex" in an interview. Referring to leaked mails which Hrithik alleged were sent by Kangana, she said, "I've suffered so much humiliation. I wept all night. I couldn't sleep."
