Secret Intelligence Service's Chief has said that fictional British Secret Service agent, James Bond, would never get a job at the real MI6. He further said that MI6 officers did not take "moral shortcuts" and "always have respect for the law- unlike Mr Bond." "A strong ethical core is... the first qualities we look for in our staff," he added.
