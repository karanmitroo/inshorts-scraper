Singer Sona Mohapatra has said that she has nothing personal against Sonakshi Sinha and if the actor sings well, she will be the first person to clap for her. This comes after Sonakshi recently blocked Sona on Twitter. Reportedly, Sonakshi blocked Sona after criticism for being "condescending" to musicians who expressed displeasure over Sonakshi's performance at the Justin Bieber concert.
