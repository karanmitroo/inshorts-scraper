Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that although she was offered the Salman Khan starrer film 'Sultan', she didn't do it as she didn't want to demote herself to something which wasn't offering her much. "[I had just come from] a double role space (Tanu Weds Manu Returns) and [done] so much more in my earlier films," she added.
