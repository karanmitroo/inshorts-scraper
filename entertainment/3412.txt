A Navratri-themed condom advertisement featuring Sunny Leone has led to protests by Surat-based group Hindu Yuva Vahini. The message in Gujarati on the hoarding translates to 'This Navratri, play but with love'. "The insinuation on the hoardings from a condom brand insults the religious sentiments of Hindus," said the leader of Hindu Yuva Vahini.
