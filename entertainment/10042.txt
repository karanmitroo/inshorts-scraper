Actor Arjun Kapoor has received a notice from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) over illegal construction at his residence in Juhu, Mumbai. The BMC said that Kapoor had encroached on the terrace of the apartment by constructing a 30-by-16 square feet brick room without permission. He has been asked to allow the municipal staff to demolish the unauthorised structure.
