Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar has said that he expected Amitabh Bachchan to win the Best Actor National Award for his lead role in 'Pink'. Shoojit, who co-produced Pink, added, "Without Mr. Bachchan's presence, it (Pink) wouldn't have had that reach." He thanked the National Award jury and Pink's entire team for the film winning 'Best Film On Social Issues' National Award.
