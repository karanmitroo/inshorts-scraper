Late television actress Pratyusha Banerjee's boyfriend, Rahul Raj Singh, referring to a copy of the chargesheet, has said that Pratyusha was upset about her father calling her a prostitute. "I never had a clue (about this). If I had, I would have definitely done something," Singh added. This comes after Banerjee's lawyer alleged that Singh had forced Pratyusha into prostitution.
