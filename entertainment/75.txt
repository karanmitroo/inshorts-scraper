Actress Rita Moreno wore the same gown she wore to the 1962 Oscars at the Oscars 2018. The 86-year-old actress slightly modified the gown, changing the neckline to a strapless version and accessorised the ensemble with a gold necklace, long gloves and a gold bracelet. Rita had won the Best Supporting Actress award for 'West Side Story' at Oscars 1962.
