Kapil Sharma, while denying reports of him throwing a shoe at Sunil Grover during their brawl in a flight, said he felt bad that members of The Kapil Sharma Show didn't deny the rumour. "Sunil got angry because I shouted at someone in the flight," he added. Following the fight, Grover and other members including Ali Asgar quit the show.
