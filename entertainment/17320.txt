Former Miss World and actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's new jewellery advertisement has sparked a controversy for depicting a black-skinned child as a 'slave'. In the ad, the little boy is seen holding a big umbrella to keep Aishwarya under its shade. Many activist groups have slammed the ad for being racist and promoting child slavery.
