Actor Gulshan Grover, who turned 62 on Thursday, said he is still the cool person that he used to be. "Age is just a number. Turning 62 doesn't change an iota of anything," he added. Gulshan, who is known as the 'Bad Man' of Bollywood, has appeared in films like 'Sadma', 'Mohra, 'Raja Babu' and 'Sabse Bada Khiladi'.
