Anurag Kashyap has defended 'Newton', India's official entry for Oscars 2018, over reports of it being a copy of the Iranian film 'Secret Ballot'. Anurag tweeted, "Newton is an award winner from Berlin Fest and I can promise you those curators watch more films in a year than rest of us do in a lifetime."
