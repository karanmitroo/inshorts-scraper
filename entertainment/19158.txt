TV actress Shweta Tiwari, who was offered both 'Comedy Nights with Kapil' and Sunil Grover's 'Mad In India' together, has chosen to be part of Sunil's show. "The characters in 'Comedy Nights with Kapil' are doing really well. I was not sure how well a new character would do if it's brought in. But Sunil's show is new," Shweta said.
