The release of the Riteish Deshmukh and Vivek Oberoi-starrer sex comedy 'Great Grand Masti', which was scheduled to hit the theatres on March 25, has been postponed. The Censor Board has refused to certify the theatrical trailer of the film due to excessive vulgar content. The new release date will soon be announced by the team.
