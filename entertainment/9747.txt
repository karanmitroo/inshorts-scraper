American actor George Clooney has said that he doesn't support President-elect Donald Trump and hopes that he does not destroy everything. "When the President of the United States fails, really terrible things happen," he added. Further, responding to Trump calling Meryl Streep an "overrated actress", he joked, "But seriously, aren't you (Trump) supposed to be running the country?"
