Sidharth Malhotra, while talking about the biopic on Kargil martyr Param Vir Chakra awardee Captain Vikram Batra, said, "The character that I'll be playing next is very sensitive and his story is also quite touching." He further said, "A biopic is not a fictitious story...It is based on a real person...one needs to handle that with a lot of sensitivity."
