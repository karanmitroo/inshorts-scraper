A promotional picture for an upcoming film showing South Indian actress Varalaxmi tied to a bed with the caption #VaralaxmiGotKidnapped has been slammed on Twitter. "So now they have used actress kidnapped as a promotion, will they scream rape next?" tweeted a user. "So much for all the female empowerment talks. Tacky promotions," read another tweet.
