According to reports, Censor Board's modification asking 'Padmavati' makers to delete all references to historical places has resulted in 300 cuts in the film. Other modifications suggested by the Board include changes in the song 'Ghoomar' and adding a disclaimer that the film doesn't glorify the practice of Sati. The film's title is also likely to be changed to 'Padmavat'.
