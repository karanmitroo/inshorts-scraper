Sohail Khan, while talking about working with his brother actor Salman Khan in the upcoming film Tubelight, said, "I never felt overshadowed by bhai, because in this film, he is not playing 'The Salman Khan'". Sohail added that one shouldn't compete in a scene to get more eyeballs because the moment one tries that, one ends up spoiling the scene.
