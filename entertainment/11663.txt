Filmmaker Ritesh Sidhwani has refuted the rumours of replacing Pakistani actress Mahira Khan in his upcoming film 'Raees'. "I do not understand where all this is coming from. I would only say one thing - I have shot with the girl for 45 days and finished the film, I hope that clarifies things," said Ritesh.
