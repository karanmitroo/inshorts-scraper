American rap group Run-DMC's Founder Darryl McDaniels has sued Amazon and Walmart for selling clothes and accessories bearing the group's name without permission. McDaniels is seeking $50 million in damages from the retailers over the alleged sale of products that infringe the Run-DMC trademark registered in 2007. He said the retailers are confusing customers and trading on the group's goodwill.
