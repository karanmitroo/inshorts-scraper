Music composer-singer Pritam has said he'd want to auction a guitar gifted to him by Shah Rukh Khan for charity. SRK wrote on Instagram that he gifted it to Pritam before Jab Harry Met Sejal's shooting and Pritam gifted him the film's "beautiful music" in return. "To pass on the goodness, I'd put this on auction for charity," commented Pritam.
