Poet-lyricist Javed Akhtar tweeted an apology as he misspelt the word 'singer' as 'sinner' in his condolence tweet on Thumri singer Girija Devi's demise. Akhtar, in the condolence tweet had also called the singer a "national treasurer" instead of treasure. He later tweeted a tribute note in which he wrote, "With Girija Devi, an era has come to an end."
