Punjab govt on Saturday decided to ban the controversial movie 'Messenger of God', featuring Dera Sacha Sauda Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, in the state. The govt's step comes in the wake of tense scenes in Bhatinda and Amritsar on Friday over the release of film. The movie had also sparked protests in several states.
