To mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death, women from a theatre group in New York staged a naked version of the play 'The Tempest' with an all-female cast. “We want the audience to see it through fresh eyes as something rich and strange, the way an audience 400 years ago would have,” said the play's director Alice Mottola.
