Aamir Khan jokingly said that he isn't a box-office king but only his wife Kiran Rao's king. "I never signed a film on the basis of its capability to do business. I prefer to choose films from my heart," he added. Aamir also revealed that the team of 'Dangal' had never predicted the film to be such a big hit.
