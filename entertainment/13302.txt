Actor Siddharth has tweeted that stalking in real life is encouraged by its depiction in films. "When a woman stalks a man in our films she's a vamp. When a man does it he is a hero," tweeted Siddharth. He added that showing men getting the women they want by just "wanting her enough" is a wrong notion.
