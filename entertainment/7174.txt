The Maulvi, who had issued a statement against singer Sonu Nigam, has refused to give â‚¹10 lakh reward after Sonu shaved his head, saying the singer has fulfilled only one of his three conditions. He added that he will give the amount only after Sonu puts a garland of old torn shoes around his neck and parades around the country.
