Some of the last pictures of Marilyn Monroe, taken just before her sudden death in 1962, are to be auctioned, starting March-10, by Heritage Auctions Texas. The prints include those taken by Bert Stern for Vogue, and some by George Barris, that were taken for a book on the icon. They are expected to garner 4,000 pounds apiece ($6,100).
