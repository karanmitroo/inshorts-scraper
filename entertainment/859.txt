Delhi-based garment retailer People Tree has accused French luxury goods brand Christian Dior of plagiarising the design of an outfit worn by Sonam Kapoor on the January cover of Elle India. Orijit Sen, who co-founded People Tree, said the design was originally created by him 18 years ago. "I speak up as an aggrieved artist," added Orijit.
