'Black Maria', which was built in 1893 on the grounds of American inventor Thomas Edison's laboratories in New Jersey, is known to be the world's first film studio. At the studio, Edison made short films for use in his Kinetoscope, a peep-show machine. The studio, which could revolve to face the Sun's direction, cost about â‚¹41,000 ($637.67) to build.
