Hollywood actor George Clooney surprised Pat Adams, a fan who stays at a care home in the UK, with flowers on her 87th birthday. Adams had previously taken part in the home's 'Wish upon a star' programme, which encourages residents to make a wish that staff then attempt to fulfil. Adams wished for a meeting with George Clooney.
