Reacting to how a dead body was found with slogans against 'Padmavati', actress Alia Bhatt has tweeted, "This is what happens when violent threats are allowed to (be) made openly without punishment!" Earlier, a man was found hanging at Jaipur's Nahargarh Fort with a message inscribed on rocks next to the body which read, "We don't just hang effigies."
