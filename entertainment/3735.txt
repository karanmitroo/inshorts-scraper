Actress Chloe Bennet, who was born as Chloe Wang, wrote on Instagram that she changed her Chinese surname due to the prejudice prevalent in the industry. "Hollywood is racist and wouldn't cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable," she added. Chloe further said, "Changing my last name doesn't change the fact that my blood is half-Chinese."
