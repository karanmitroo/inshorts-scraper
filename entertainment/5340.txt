Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has announced that he will be directing a biopic on Telugu actor and former Andhra Pradesh CM Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR). RGV revealed that he watched NTR's film Adavi Ramudu 23 times but as he did not have money to take the bus to the theatre, he walked ten kilometres every time.
