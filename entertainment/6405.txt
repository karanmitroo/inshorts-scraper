Novelist Twinkle Khanna, while speaking about her writing style in blogs, said that humour is like a deodorant. She added, "You can live without it, but if you use it you help not just yourself but others around you!" Twinkle further said that she wraps her message with entertainment as she wants people to laugh and notice ridiculousness around themselves.
