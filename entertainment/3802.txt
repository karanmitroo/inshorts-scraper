RJ Malishka has called the recent Mumbai rains an 'eye-opener' for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Malishka had released a parody song 'Sonu Song Pothole mix' last month in which she criticised the BMC for the abundance of potholes on the streets. She further said, "If I make another song, then you can't blame me."
