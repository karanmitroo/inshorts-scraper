Music legend AR Rahman has turned script writer and producer for an untitled film. Previously, there were reports that he is planning to direct a film. However, dismissing such reports, the two-time Oscar-winner said, "I am not thinking about directing. I am scripting a film and also co-producing it. It's in the process."
