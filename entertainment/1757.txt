Talking about nepotism, actress Saiyami Kher said, "No doubt it helps being Anil Kapoor's son (Harshvardhan) but it has been proved time and again that whoever's son or daughter you are, the audience decides your fate." Saiyami added that she thinks the nepotism debate has been taken too far. She made her Bollywood debut opposite Harshvardhan Kapoor in 'Mirzya'.
