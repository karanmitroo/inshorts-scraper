Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that it is good that filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma doesn't like actor Tiger Shroff. She added, "Whoever Ramu doesn't like, does very well." This comes after Varma, while tweeting a photograph of Tiger on the occasion of his birthday, had called him a 'bikini babe' and compared him to actress Urmila Matondkar.
