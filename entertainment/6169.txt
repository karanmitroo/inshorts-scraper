A video shows Judwaa 2's director David Dhawan smashing a bottle on his son actor Varun Dhawan's head. Varun captioned the video, "The director says "he's been a naughty actor but a good actor" then smash. Check out the madness as the countdown begins." Varun has a double role in Judwaa 2, which is scheduled to release on September 29.
