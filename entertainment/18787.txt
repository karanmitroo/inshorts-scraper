Sajid Khan's latest directorial venture 'Humshakals', which was severely criticized by the critics, has made the third highest opening day collection at the box office on Friday, earning Rs. 12.5 crore. The movie has totalled Rs. 25.09 crore in two days. Since there are no other Bollywood releases this week, 'Humshakals' is likely to make a decent box office earning.
