Kavita Kaushik has slammed Shilpa Shinde for staying quiet for a year on the alleged sexual harassment by Sanjay Kohli, husband of 'Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai!' producer Binaifer Kohli. She said, "If you don't raise an alarm (as a public figure), you're setting a bad example for all women." Kavita added that the "woman card" should be used carefully.
