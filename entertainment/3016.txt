Vidya Balan, who is a member of the reconstituted Censor Board, has decided not to be part of the screenings of films which will be produced by her husband Siddharth Roy Kapur and star her brothers-in-law Aditya and Kunaal. "It was a conscientious move which was welcomed by the board members," a source was quoted as saying.
