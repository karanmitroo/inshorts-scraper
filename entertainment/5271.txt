Reacting to Hollywood actor Andrew Garfield's 'I'm gay without the physical act' remark, a user tweeted, "In that case, I'm a lesbian without the physical act because I watch Ellen." Another user wrote, "Former #SpiderMan #AndrewGarfield has a very limited view of what being gay ACTUALLY is. #LGBTQ." Meanwhile, another user tweeted, "Straight actors, please stop this nonsense."
