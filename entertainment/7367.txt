Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma tweeted that actor Vidyut Jammwal will run away if Tiger Shroff challenges him for a "hand to hand, kick to kick fight in real". "Am super sure that @VidyutJammwal will never have the guts to take on @iTIGERSHROFF's challenge," he added. RGV later said to Vidyut, "Jokes apart you are the greatest on-screen fighter".
