Actor Shah Rukh Khan was fined ₹1,93,784 by the BMC for constructing an illegal ramp outside his bungalow ‘Mannat’ in Bandra, an RTI query revealed on Thursday. Activists had alleged that the ramp constructed by Khan encroached on a portion of public land. A noticed was slapped on the actor in February 2015, following which the ramp was demolished.
