Actor Kunal Kapoor has said that the sort of impact the 2006 film 'Rang De Basanti' made cannot be recreated. Kunal added, "I remember I was just starting out my career and Aamir Khan told me that I should enjoy the phase, as such things happen probably once in an actor's career." Kunal played the character 'Aslam' in the film.
