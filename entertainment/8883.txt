Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that the fear of repercussions was one of the reasons for not adapting author Amish Tripathi's Shiva Trilogy, which began with 'The Immortals of Meluha'. Further speaking on how people get offended by a film's content, Johar added, "We even have to consider if people will be offended by the lyrics of songs."
