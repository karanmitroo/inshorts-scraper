Actor Tiger Shroff received a fifth degree honorary black belt from the Kukkiwon - World Taekwondo headquarters, an organisation established by the South Korean government. "This is far more than I deserve and I will work even harder to live up to this honour so I can wear this belt with pride!!" he wrote in his FB page post.
