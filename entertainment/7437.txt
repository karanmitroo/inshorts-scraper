National Film Awards jury chairman Priyadarshan said it was pointless giving the National Award to Aamir Khan as he doesn't accept awards or attend award shows. He said this when asked why the award was given to Akshay Kumar and not Aamir. Priyadarshan added, "It would've been insulting to the government if we honoured an actor who doesn't...receive the honour."
