Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali's music launch event in Mumbai, scheduled for January 29, was cancelled on Wednesday following protests from the Shiv Sena. The event was for the film 'Ghar Wapsi', directed by Suhaib Ilyasi, wherein Ali has also acted along with singing a patriotic song. Calling it 'unfortunate', Ilyasi said that Ali was also sad about the happenings.
