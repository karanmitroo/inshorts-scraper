A 99-year-old veterinarian who was caught by police with deer skin in his house has claimed that actor Saif Ali Khan's grandfather Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi gifted it to him 50 years ago when he was employed at the Pataudi Estate. The veterinarian was not arrested due to his old age but a case has been registered against him.
