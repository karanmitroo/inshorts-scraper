The Emraan Hashmi starrer film 'Azhar', which released on Friday, is "a dull, dispirited tale", wrote Indian Express. Emraan "is the only one who seems to make any sense in this forgettable movie", Mid-Day wrote. "The courtroom drama in the second half is almost unbearable", said NDTV. The film has been rated 1.5/5 (Indian Express), 2.5/5 (NDTV) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
