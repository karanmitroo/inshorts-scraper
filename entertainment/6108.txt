Actor and honorary Qantas Airways pilot John Travolta is donating his Boeing 707 to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society in Australia. The 1964 Boeing 707 was originally part of Qantas' fleet but was converted to private use later. Outfitted with double beds, dining rooms and leather chairs, Travolta said he hoped the plane would "fly well into the future."
