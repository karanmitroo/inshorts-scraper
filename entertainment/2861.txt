'The Big Bang Theory' actress Mayim Bialik has been slammed for allegedly shaming sexual assault victims in an article she wrote. Mayim had written that she makes "self-protecting" choices to "dress conservatively" and not "act flirtatiously with men". Responding to this, a user wrote, "Mayim congratulates herself for not having been sexually assaulted as though it's a matter of choice."
