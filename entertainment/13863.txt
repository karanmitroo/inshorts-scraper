Writer and filmmaker Zeishan Quadri has confirmed that a third film in the 'Gangs of Wasseypur' film franchise, which will be a 'part 1.5', is being planned. "I'd call it a mid-equal... we aren't calling it part 3... It will tell a parallel story between the two films," said Quadri. Howeverâ€‹, he added that it would be a new storyline.
