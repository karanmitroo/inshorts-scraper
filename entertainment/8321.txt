Russian MP Vitaly Milonov has called the government to put a ban on the release of the new Disney musical Beauty and the Beast as it features a gay character and love scene. He described the film as "a blatant, shameless propaganda of sin and perverted sexual relationships." Notably, giving minors information about homosexuality is illegal in Russia since 2013.
