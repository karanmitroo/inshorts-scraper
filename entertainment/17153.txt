A Mumbai woman named Anjali Palan, who reportedly is a Hindu Janajagruti Samiti worker, has filed an FIR against actress Sunny Leone alleging that she is promoting obscenity by distributing obscene content on web. "No immediate action will be taken in the case as first the Thane police's cyber cell will look into the matter," police said.
