According to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 1950 agreement, Oscar winners are banned from selling their Oscars before offering to sell the award to the Academy for $1. However, Oscar trophies can be auctioned after the initial offer, for example the Best Picture trophy for 'Gone With the Wind' was sold to Michael Jackson for over â‚¹10 crore.
