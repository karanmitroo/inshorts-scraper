Singer Sonu Nigam has said that having to prove his secular state of mind during the Azaan row was a joke. He added that while it was interesting he wasn't allowed to give an opinion, a group of people were allowed to hurl abuses at him. Nigam had tweeted about being woken up by Azaan and called it "forced religiousness".
