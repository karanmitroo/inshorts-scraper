Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly's 21-year career at the news network ended on Wednesday amid allegations of sexual harassment and an advertising boycott. An investigation had revealed that Fox and O'Reilly had paid $13 million in settlements to five women who accused the host of sexual harassment. However, in a statement, O'Reilly had called the allegations "completely unfounded".
