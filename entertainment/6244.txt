Akshay Kumar has revealed that regardless of whether it's bullying, he follows wife Twinkle Khanna's instructions on what to wear. He added, "My mother-in-law [Dimple Kapadia] is a style icon and wouldn't have me any other way. I have no option but match up to the ladies in the family." Akshay and Twinkle married in 2001 and have two children.
