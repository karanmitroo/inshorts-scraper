Sonakshi Sinha and Sidharth Malhotra starrer 'Ittefaq', which released today, is a "decent crime story that will keep you hooked, and guessing," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). The film "is a tedious and uninvolving murder mystery," said NDTV while The Indian Express called it a "smart, gripping whodunit." It has been rated 3/5 (HT, The Indian Express) and 1.5/5 (NDTV).
