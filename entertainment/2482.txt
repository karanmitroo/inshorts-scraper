Sonakshi Sinha, while talking about women coming forward about facing sexual harassment, said that nobody deserves to be made to feel unsafe especially while working. "I think it's very important and this stir should have been made long back," added Sonakshi. She further said she's glad that women are speaking up, but feels the debate should have started long back.
