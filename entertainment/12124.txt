The Vegetable Orchestra from Vienna, Austria, performs using instruments made from fresh vegetables. Founded in 1998, the group of musicians has held concerts all over the world. A two-minute video shows how the musicians turn vegetables into instruments and later use the vegetable scraps to make soup, serving it to the audience at the end of each performance.
