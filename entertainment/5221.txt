Actor Ranbir Kapoor has said that it is a good thing there was no Twitter when he was in school as he doesn't know what his father Rishi Kapoor would've tweeted about his grades. He added, "I'm actually the most educated member in my family. I got 56% in my 10th boards and my best of five... was 60."
