While talking about the evolution of Indian films, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, "I think only the heroes can become stereotypical, not actors." "The Bollywood hero who sings and dances with a heroine by his side, fights but still manages to look good after a beating...has become a stereotype. An actor can never become a typecast," he added.
