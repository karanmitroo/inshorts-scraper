Actor Varun Dhawan on Tuesday shared a video to promote Akshay Kumar's upcoming film 'Rustom'. In the video, Varun sported a man bun to imitate Akshay's look in 'Dishoom'. He acted out Akshay's dialogue, "Your father must be a baker cause you have perfect buns." 'Rustom', also starring Ileana D'Cruz and Esha Gupta, is scheduled to release on August 12.
