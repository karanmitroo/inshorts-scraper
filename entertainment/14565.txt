Former athlete Milkha Singh on Tuesday said that the Indian movie industry has not done him a favour by making his biopic. "If an ambassador is required, we have many great sportspersons," added Singh on Salman Khan's appointment as India's ambassador for Rio Olympics. Earlier, Salman's father Salim Khan tweeted that Bollywood had 'resurrected' Singh from "fading away in oblivion".
