Director Srijit Mukherji has said that his upcoming film 'Begum Jaan' will renew the focus on sex workers. He added, "They're human beings who have...families, relationships...it's very unfair to discriminate against them or put them aside as marginal sections." The film, set in 1947, features actors Vidya Balan, Naseeruddin Shah, Ila Arun, and Gauahar Khan among others.
