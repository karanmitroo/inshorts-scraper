The Indian Censor Board has given clearance to 'MSG' and the film will hit the theatres on February 13. "We have been told the Censor Certificate will be issued to us before the release date", spokesperson for 'MSG' Aditya Insaan said. 'MSG' was earlier rejected by the Examining Committee that felt Ram Rahim Singh was performing miracles without substantiating them.
