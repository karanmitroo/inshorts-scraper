Google has released a series of short films '#transvoices' to share stories of transgender people as "regular people, doing regular things", as part of 'Transgender Awareness Week'. One of the films is about Jasmine, who was the first transgender to open a tattoo shop in Philadelphia. Notably, many of the crew who worked on the films also identified as transgender.
