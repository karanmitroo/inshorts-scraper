Comedian Sunil Grover, while supporting singer Sonu Nigam on his tweet about the use of loudspeakers in temples, mosques and gurudwaras, has asked people not to give it a "religious tinge". Sonu Nigam had tweeted on Monday that he is not a Muslim and still has to be woken up by the Azaan in the morning.
