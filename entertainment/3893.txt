An NGO has filed a written complaint with Mumbai Cyber Police against actor Rishi Kapoor for posting an 'indecent' picture of a child. "Rishi Kapoor has more than 2.6 Million followers on Twitter...This means this pornographic image material got circulated to more than 2.6 Million people," read the complaint. Rishi reportedly removed the post within a day of posting it.
