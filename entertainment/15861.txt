Miss Philippines Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach, 26, was on Monday named Miss Universe 2015 at the 64th edition of the beauty pageant held in Las Vegas, USA. Colombia's Ariadna Gutierrez-Ar√©valo and USA's Olivia Jordan occupied the second and the third spots respectively. Miss Colombia was mistakenly named the winner by the pageant's host Steve Harvey, who later apologised for the mix-up.
