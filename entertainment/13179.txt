An encrypted copy of 'Dishoom', starring John Abraham and Varun Dhawan, has been submitted to the Censor Board. 'Dishoom' became the first to opt for such means following the recent online leak of films, which were allegedly Censor Board copies. Producer Sajid Nadiadwala sent the film in DCP-KDM format, which allows only someone with due authorisation to access the file.
