The official Twitter handle of 'Aiyaary', while taking a dig on sharing its release date with 'Pad Man', wrote, "Good to have you back!" Earlier, 'Aiyaary' had moved its release date from January 26 to February 9 to avoid a clash with 'Pad Man'. However, 'Pad Man' shifted its release date again to the same day as 'Aiyaary'.
