Priyanka Chopra has spoken up for the first time on the controversy about the dress she wore while meeting PM Narendra Modi in Germany. "For me trolling is not news, it never has been. Trolling is just someone's opinion and who cares about that?", she said. Priyanka was trolled for wearing the "indecent" dress as her legs were visible.
