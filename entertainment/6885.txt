Celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos has filed a $100 million lawsuit against Fyre Festival organisers for alleged fraud, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. The suit says the "festival's lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees". Guests were forced to stay in disaster relief tents after the festival was cancelled.
