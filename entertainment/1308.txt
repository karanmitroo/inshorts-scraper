Vidya Balan has revealed filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra once asked her to get her nose 'fixed' through plastic surgery. "I was so scared to...say anything to him because I thought, 'What if you throw me out of the film if I said no,'" she added. However, Vidya further said she didn't undergo plastic surgery as she's not okay with it.
