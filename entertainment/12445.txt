The late comedian George Carlin's stand-up comedy special titled 'I Kinda Like It When a Lotta People Die' which was shelved following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre, will be released on September 16. The show had been shelved because of a joke about Osama bin Laden getting blamed for a potent fart which blew up a plane.
