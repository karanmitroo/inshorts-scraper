The music album of Sultan, which released on Tuesday, does not feature any song by singer Arijit Singh. The album features the song 'Jag Ghumaya', sung by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. The song was originally recorded by Arijit. Notably, Arijit had last week issued a public apology to Salman on Facebook, requesting him to not remove his song from 'Sultan'.
