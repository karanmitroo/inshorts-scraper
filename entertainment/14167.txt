Actress Priyanka Chopra was not featured in the poster of her Hollywood film 'Baywatch' as she will reportedly feature solo in a separate poster. As per reports, the decision to not feature her was strategic as the film's makers have a promotional plan where they want to launch Priyanka, who plays a villain in the film, "in a big way".
