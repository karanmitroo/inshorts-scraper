Harvard University has announced that it will offer a medieval history course inspired by Games of Thrones. Students will study the HBO TV show that "echoes and adapts, as well as distorts the history and culture of the 'medieval world' of Eurasia." A lecturer said the course will explore "archetypal characters" like "the king" and "the good wife."
