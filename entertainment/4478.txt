Sonu Sood will play a warrior in the upcoming film 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi', which will star Kangana Ranaut in the lead role. "It's challenging to play a real life character because you know it existed in the history and you have certain parameters to follow," said Sonu. Directed by Krish, the film will release on April 27, 2018.
