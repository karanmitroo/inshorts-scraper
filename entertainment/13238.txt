Actor and singer Ayushmann Khurrana has said that actors can never overpower "pure singers" even though there is an increasing trend of actors lendingâ€‹ their voice for songs in Bollywood films. However, the actor added, "An actor singing a song helps to grab some eye balls. We consume music visually, so there is no harm in that."
