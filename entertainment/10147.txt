Veteran actress Zeenat Aman has said that she is "glad" that her songs 'Laila O Laila' (Qurbani) and 'Dum Maaro Dum' (Hare Rama Hare Krishna) have been remixed. "A whole new generation gets the chance to hear it," said Zeenat. While Laila O Laila's new version featured Sunny Leone, the recreated version of 'Dum Maaro Dum' featured Deepika Padukone.
