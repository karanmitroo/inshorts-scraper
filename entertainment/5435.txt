Actress Ridheema Tiwari, who portrays the character 'Maldawali' on the show 'Ghulaam', has said some men cannot get over words like cleavage and breasts. "They should understand that for an actress to do bold roles is difficult and if you can't compliment her, at least don't objectify her," she added. Ridheema was trolled for wearing 'revealing' outfits on the show.
