Late TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee's mother has said that the actress wasn't in a live-in relationship with boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh. She added, "He conspired, separated our daughter from us, and then started staying at her place calling it a live-in relation." Rahul has been accused of abetment of suicide, after Pratyusha was found hanging in her apartment last year.
