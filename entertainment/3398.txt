Nishant Malkani has denied reports that he was sexually harassed by co-star Riya Sen while shooting an intimate scene for 'Ragini MMS Returns'. "To make [the scene] real...we were improvising. Riya pulled my track pants down, and that too just a bit," he added. Nishant further said he would have admitted to it if he would have been sexually harassed.
