Sussanne Khan on Monday stated that she will never reconcile with her former husband Hrithik Roshan. She tweeted, "I request people to stop speculating. There will never be a reconciliation with @iHrithik. But we will always be good parents." The two were spotted having lunch with their sons recently. Sussanne and Hrithik separated in 2014, after fourteen years of marriage.
