The makers of 'Tubelight' have said they hope to release the film in Pakistan, but haven't confirmed a release date. They added, "We respect the law of the land and judiciary if they decide otherwise." This comes after reports said 'Tubelight' won't release in Pakistan as distributors were apprehensive of acquiring the film's rights to avoid competition for Pakistani films.
