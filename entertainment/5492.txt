Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met the cast of X-Men: Dark Phoenix in Montreal. James McAvoy, who portrays Professor X, while sharing a picture from the meet, wrote, "Just met "the dude". Thank you Canada for such a progressive, impressive and somewhat suggestive real life superhero." Sophie Turner (Jean Grey) and Tye Sheridan (Cyclops) were also seen in the picture.
