German police have recovered more than 100 items, including diaries, prescription glasses and a cigarette case belonging to late The Beatles' singer John Lennon. Police officials said a 58-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of handling the stolen goods. The items were stolen in New York in 2006 from Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono.
