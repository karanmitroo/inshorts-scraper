The clash between actor Salman Khan and photographers reportedly came to an end on Friday, after they attended the wedding reception of Salman's baby sister Arpita and Aayush. Earlier, photographers had refused to cover Salman's films and outings, as they were manhandled by his security guards, according to reports.
