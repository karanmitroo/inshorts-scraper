Ujjwal Chatterjee, who is directing Priyanka Chopra's production 'Nalini' on Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, has agreed to remove an intimate scene from the film. Earlier, West Bengal's Visva Bharati University objected to kissing scenes in 'Nalini'. Ujjwal said, "There are no problems regarding the decisions of the committee formed by the varsity to look into the authenticity of research."
