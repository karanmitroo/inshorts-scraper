Kannada actress Sanjjanaa Galrani, whose deleted "nude" scene from a film was leaked online, has said she was not fully nude in the scene while adding she'll never go 100% nude even for a James Bond film. Sanjjanaa added, "My body parts (were) covered up with a towel...what is...seen in the film is the result of computer colour grading."
