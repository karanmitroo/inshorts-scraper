Hollywood actor Vin Diesel and Deepika Padukone were welcomed to Mumbai this week by a group of women riding Royal Enfield motorcycles. The women wore traditional Maharashtrian sarees in red with yellow turbans and boots. The ladies also applied 'tilak' on Diesel's forehead as Marathi folk music played in the background.
