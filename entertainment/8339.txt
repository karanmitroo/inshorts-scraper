Disputing Arnold Schwarzenegger's announcement that he was quitting as the host of reality show 'The Celebrity Apprentice', US President Donald Trump said Schwarzenegger was not voluntarily leaving and instead has been "fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings." Notably, Schwarzenegger, who replaced Trump as the host of the show last year, blamed Trump's ongoing role as a producer for low ratings.
