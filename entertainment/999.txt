Actor Prakash Raj has claimed that BJP workers used cow urine to 'clean and purify' the stage where he recently delivered a speech in Karnataka's Sirsi. "Will you continue this cleaning and purification service where ever I go," Raj tweeted. This comes after the actor reportedly criticised Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde during his speech at the programme.
