Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said that actors can't take their position in the film industry "for granted" as every Friday is "different". "Acting is such a profession that you can never feel secure. Everything here is short-lived," Sidharth added. He also said he doesn't plan for the future as the "good" done in past won't keep him going for life.
