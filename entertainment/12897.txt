Television actor Sharad Kelkar has lent his voice to Vin Diesel's character in the Hindi dubbed version of the upcoming film 'xXx: The Return of Xander Cage'. "[Vin] has a gruff and slightly rough voice. Since my voice is clear and deep, I had to put in a lot of effort to emulate his voice," said the 39-year old actor.
