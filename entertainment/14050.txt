Stand-up comedian Tanmay Bhat, who is associated with 'AIB', has shared a Facebook post saying, 'Drought hit farmers wondering what they have to do to get some airtime'. Bhat's comment was on how his Snapchat video clip where he used insult humour on Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar made it to news channels instead of issues like the Maharashtraâ€‹ drought.
