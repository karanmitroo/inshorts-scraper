Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt recently opened up about her previous box-office failure 'Shaandaar'. "I was not happy, obviously. It was a clear no-show... I will not say we made a good film and it didn't do well," she said. "But, I will not blame anyone either. I will take full responsibility for it... I still have no regrets," Alia added.
