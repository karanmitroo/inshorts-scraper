Actor Varun Dhawan has said that actress Priyanka Chopra being trolled on social media over her dress during her meeting with PM Modi in Berlin is stupid. "She is someone we all should be proud of...she's making our country proud abroad," added Varun. Users on social media had slammed Priyanka for "exposing her legs" and sitting cross-legged during the meeting.
