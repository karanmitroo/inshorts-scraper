Actor Hrithik Roshan took onto social media shunning alleged reports about her ex-wife Sussanne's claim for Rs. 400 crore as divorce alimony. The actor stated "Sussanne has not demanded a single penny so the question of 'Alimony' does not arise!" He also tweeted "Fabricated news articles. Demeaning my loved ones. Testing my patience."
The duo split early this year.
