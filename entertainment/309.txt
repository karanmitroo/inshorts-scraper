Several women associations have launched a 48-hour hunger strike in Visakhapatnam against Vizag police for not filing an FIR against filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma over his film 'God, Sex And Truth'. The movie portrays women in an objectionable manner, they said. One of the protesters alleged RGV had asked her to act in his next porn movie, during an interview.
