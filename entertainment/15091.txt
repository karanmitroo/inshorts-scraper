Hearing a PIL filed by an activist on the use of 'Satyamev Jayate' in Aamir Khan's TV show, the Bombay HC on Friday sought a reply from the actor for the same. The HC also questioned the Centre's earlier explanation on the issue wherein it said the use of phrase 'Satyameva Jayate' was not violative of relevant Act and rules.
