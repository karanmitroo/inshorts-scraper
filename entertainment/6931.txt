Singer Ankit Tiwari, known for songs like Sunn Raha Hai Na Tu and Galliyan, was acquitted in a rape case registered against him in 2014. "I always had faith in the Indian judicial system. I'm feeling relieved...I never let it affect my work," said Ankit. He sang for films including Airlift and Roy even when the case was under process.
