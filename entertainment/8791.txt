In an ongoing Twitter spat with Harry Potter author JK Rowling, British TV personality Piers Morgan criticised her for sharing praise saying "#humblebrag...Nobody plays the celebrity game more abusively...than you". Twitter users later pointed out that Morgan had written the praise himself in his March 2010 list of “the 100 British celebrities who really matter”.
