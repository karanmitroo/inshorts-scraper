On the 31st death anniversary of veteran actress Smita Patil on Wednesday, Amitabh Bachchan tweeted, "She had...premonition of my 'Coolie' accident a night before it happened...called and told me of it." "Memorable films with her 'Shakti' and 'Namak Halaal'," he added. Amitabh was hospitalised for several weeks and was in a coma-like state following the accident on Coolie's sets.
