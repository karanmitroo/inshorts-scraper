Ajay Devgn said when he entered the film industry, he never had ego clashes with other actors he worked with. "I've worked with Salman, Aamir and other heroes. All of us used to work together...Nobody was insecure about what the other person was doing," he added. Ajay further said the same can't be expected from the newer generation of actors.
