Author Salman Rushdie recently confronted a parody Twitter account that tweeted under the handle '@RushdieExplains'. "I'm tired of having your opinions ascribed to me. Pls tweet under your own name", Rushdie tweeted. The owner of the handle, Rohit Chopra, immediately changed the name to '@IndiaExplained'. However, after the incident, many Twitter users accused Rushdie of lacking a sense of humour.
