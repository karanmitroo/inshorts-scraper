The Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) has directed Sony channel to shift the serial 'Pehredaar Piya Ki' to the 10 pm slot and run it with a disclaimer which says it does not promote child marriage. The serial, which began airing last month, revolves around a nine-year-old boy and his marriage to an 18-year-old woman.
