Bollywood celebrities are divided over the Supreme Court's ruling that National Anthem must be played in theatres before film screenings. Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar "welcomed" the decision and actor Randeep Hooda supported the ruling. Meanwhile, filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma mocked the ruling in a series of tweets. He said that respect has to be "felt" and if enforced, it is "fake".
