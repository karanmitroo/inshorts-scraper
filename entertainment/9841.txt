Sofia Hayat, an ex-contestant on the reality show Bigg Boss has accused the host Salman Khan of abusing women. She criticised Salman for giving work to Armaan Kohli, whom she had previously accused of assault. "Salman had an opportunity to show the public that abusing women is wrong. He chose not to because he himself has abused women," she said.
