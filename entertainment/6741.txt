Singer Sonu Nigam has said the government should take action against people who issue fatwas. "I don't like this mentality, when any one issues fatwa against any other person... We live in a civilised... democratic country," he added. Earlier, Sonu had shaved his head after a cleric supposedly issued a fatwa, announcing â‚¹10 lakh reward for anybody shaving Sonu's head.
