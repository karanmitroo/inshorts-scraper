Friday's release 'Kaagaz Ke Fools' has failed to satisfy critics as it has a "poor script and a tedious execution", and "amidst all the chaos and disagreements, you keep looking for a reason behind the story but fail to find one", writes TOI. Starring Vinay Pathak and Mugdha Godse, it's been rated 1.5/5 (TOI), 0.5/5 (Indian Express) and 1/5 (mid-day).
