The Supreme Court has slapped a fine of â‚¹10 lakh on former Bigg Boss contestant Swami Om for filing a plea, which challenged Dipak Misra's appointment as the next Chief Justice of India (CJI). The court stated the fine was imposed to send across a message to similarly placed people to deter them from filing such 'motivated' and 'frivolous' pleas.
