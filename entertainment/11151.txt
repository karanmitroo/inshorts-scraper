Film producer Mukesh Bhatt, while praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to scrap ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes said that the move would not impact the film industry. "The film industry has been completely corporatised and cleaned of all cash dealings. From the year 2000 onwards, the industry doesn’t deal with cash money," added Bhatt.
