A gangster named Lawrence Bishnoi from Rajasthan has said that he will kill actor Salman Khan in Jodhpur. Bishnoi's death threat is being linked with the black buck killing case of 1998, which was brought up after the Bishnoi community registered a complaint against the actor. "Salman will come to know about our real identity," added Lawrence.
