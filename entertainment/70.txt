Arjun Kapoor's sister Anshula Kapoor, while defending their half-sisters Janhvi and Khushi against trolls, commented on one of her posts, "I'm requesting you to refrain from using abusive language especially towards my sisters." "I do not appreciate it and have therefore deleted your comments," she further replied to the troll. "Let's please spread joy and good vibes," Anshula added.
