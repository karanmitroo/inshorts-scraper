Actress Aishwarya Rai has said that signing the film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' was an "act of friendship," adding that she took up the film as she "liked the role". "The truth is Karan is a friend... I'd always meant to work with Karan; there were many missed opportunities, and I didn't want this to be one again," said Aishwarya.
