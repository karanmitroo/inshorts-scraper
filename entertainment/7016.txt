Singer Sona Mohapatra shared a screenshot which revealed that she has been blocked on Sonakshi Sinha's Twitter account. This comes after Sonakshi clarified that she is not performing at Justin Bieber's concert in India. Sona asked her why she didn't just say so instead of getting involved in a Twitter spat with Armaan Malik over Bollywood actors turning into singers.
