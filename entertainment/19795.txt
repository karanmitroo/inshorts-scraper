Following footsteps of Bhatt, Filmmaker Guddu Dhanoa is ready to take SRK starrer Deewana ahead. "We are making a romantic film but it is a completely different story. We are using the title 'Deewana' but something would be added to it. It is like how Bhatt's are making films like 'Murder', 'Jannat' I am also doing something similar," Dhanoa said.
