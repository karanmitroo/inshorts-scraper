Kings XI Punjab players Marcus Stoinis, Eoin Morgan and Darren Sammy played a prank on team co-owner Preity Zinta, with Sammy posting a video on Instagram. Stoinis and Morgan convinced Preity that Stoinis has a "dog jaw", to which she responded, "Do such things happen to humans?" Preity went forward to feel Stoinis' jaw at which he "barked" at her.
