The Supreme Court, Friday, stayed a Delhi HC order directing entertainment channel 'Comedy Central' to go off air for six days. As a result of the court's ruling, the channel, which has been off air since Wednesday, can now air again. The HC had upheld a decision by I&B Ministry and banned the channel for broadcasting "vulgar and offensive" content.
