Karan Johar has said that Shah Rukh Khan was the first person he called after his fall out with Kajol. "He had nothing to do with the problem. But I still called him because somewhere Shah Rukh, Kajol and I have been so close," said Johar. He added that despite ups and downs, SRK will always be family to him.
