A freelance journalist has filed a complaint against 'Nach Baliye 7' hosts, Rithvik Dhanjani and Karan Patel, for allegedly passing objectionable comments on national heroes and India’s Constitution in a video clip which has been circulated online. “I don’t think that they (the actors) have done this, but let me check and get back to you,” said show's producer Ekta Kapoor.
