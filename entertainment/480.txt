Actor Irrfan Khan said that a dating site is a "cool platform" to find someone who you think you're compatible with, while adding, "There shouldn't be any stigma or any taboo around it." He further said, "Love can happen in the most unexpected ways to people...some meet their partners and spouses through friends, an arranged marriage set-up or matrimonial sites."
