Actor Riteish Deshmukh shared photoshopped posters of films including Dangal, Tubelight and Begum Jaan to promote his upcoming movie Bank Chor on Twitter. The Tubelight-inspired poster read, "Inki tubelight toh kabhi nahi jalegi." He also morphed his face on Vidya Balan in Begum Jaan's poster, which read "Mah life. Mah Bank. Mah Rulez."
