Eighty-four-year-old actress Debbie Reynolds passed away after a severe stroke on Wednesday, a day after her daughter, Star Wars' actress Carrie Fisher, died. Fifteen minutes before her stroke, she told her son, "I miss her so much, I want to be with Carrie." Reynolds, who was hospitalised while planning Fisher's funeral, became famous after the movie 'Singin' in the Rain'.
