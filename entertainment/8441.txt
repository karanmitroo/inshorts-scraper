Actor Dhanush appeared before the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday in a paternity claim case to get his birthmarks verified. The verification of identification was carried out on Dhanush's body to see if they matched the couple's contention that they are his biological parents. Dhanush was accompanied by his mother to the court.
