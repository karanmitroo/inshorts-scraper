Miss India 2013 Sobhita Dhulipala has said that the beauty pageant made her feel like it doesn't matter what one feels or thinks as what sells is beauty and sex. "Miss India did more damage to my self-esteem. It took me more away from me because you're reduced to someone who's entertaining, who is pleasing," added Sobhita.
