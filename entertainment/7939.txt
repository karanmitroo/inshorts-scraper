The producers of 'Ocean's 8' have reportedly hired a therapist to prevent fights among its female cast, including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Rihanna and Anne Hathaway. According to sources, there've been a few arguments on sets 
and the makers want to finish the film on a good note and set the stage for promotions. The film will release in 2018.
