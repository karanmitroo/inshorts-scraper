Huma Qureshi, while speaking about being body-shamed by fashion bloggers, said that she's an actor and not a clothes' hanger. She added, "I have stopped reacting to this [body shaming comments]. I'm not doing something to make them happy or to get friendly with them." Huma further said that she loves dressing up for the red carpet.
