'The Godfather' actor Al Pacino recently said in an interview that he was almost fired from the iconic 1972 film. Pacino added that the team of the film didn't like the way he was portraying the character. However, when they saw the final footage he shot with innocence in a crazy way, they liked it and decided to keep him.
