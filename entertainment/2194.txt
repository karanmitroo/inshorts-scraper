Ajit Andhare, Chief Operating Officer of Viacom18 Motion Pictures, has called the rumours of the release date of their upcoming film 'Padmavati' being postponed as completely baseless. The film is currently scheduled to release on December 1. Earlier, it was being reported that the Censor Board was delaying certification to the film over incomplete submission of documents.
