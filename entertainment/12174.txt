'Game of Thrones' actress Sophie Turner got a matching tattoo with her co-star Maisie Williams, which reads '07.08.09'. The date is significant for them as it is the day when they landed their roles as onscreen sisters Sansa and Arya Stark in the series. Sophie, who plays the elder sister 'Sansa', revealed her tattoo at this year's Emmy Awards.
