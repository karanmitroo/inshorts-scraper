Twinkle Khanna has taken a dig at Arnab Goswami after Republic's promos showed him penning letters to politicians Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi. In an Instagram post, Khanna's daughter is seen wearing a mask and waving a plastic knife. The post says, "Instead of writing letters perhaps Arnab should try incorporating these less ambiguous moves in his next video #CutCutCut."
