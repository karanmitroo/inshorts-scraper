Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have apparently found their way back together, as both of them were spotted riding Segways on Thursday near Calabasas (California). The former couple, who haven't been seen together in months, were photographed by some passersby. Notably, Bieber and Gomez had split around New Year's last year after a big fight.
