Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, who stars in Oscar-nominated film 'The Salesman', has said she will boycott this year's Academy Awards ceremony over US President Donald Trump's reported plans for a ban on Muslim immigrants. "Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest," she tweeted.
