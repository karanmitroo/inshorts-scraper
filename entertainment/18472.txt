In an oddly interesting incident, Canadian researchers on Monday found that, a person who had become completely unresponsive after a brain injury 16 years ago and was in a vegetative state, could follow an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Using brain-scanning techniques, they found that the person, showed the same brain activity patterns as normal persons while watching the film.
