Shah Rukh Khan met Shyam Bahadur Rohidas, a cobbler fan who had put up a banner with a dialogue from 'Raees' at his shop in Mumbai. Shyam Bahadur also gifted him a pair of handcrafted shoes. "I am really happy that he has made this pair of shoes... I will wear them with the pathani (suit) next time," said SRK.
