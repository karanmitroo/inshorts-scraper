The Censor Board has cleared the upcoming Punjabi film 'Dhee Punjab Di' which deals with the issue of drug problems and female foeticide. The film's director Baljeet Singh said that his film has been given a 'U' certificate and he was only asked to cut "a scene where a young boy snorts drug". Meanwhile, he called 'Udta Punjab' "anti-Punjabi culture".
