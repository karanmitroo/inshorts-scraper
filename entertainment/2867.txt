The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Saturday expelled producer Harvey Weinstein with immediate effect after over 30 women, including actresses like Angelina Jolie, accused him of sexual assault. The Academy, which presents the Oscars, said that the decision was taken to send a message that "sexually predatory behaviour and workplace harassment in our industry is over."
