Singer Katy Perry revealed that as a teenager she was taught to "pray the gay away at Jesus camps". Katy added, "I'm just a singer-songwriter, honestly. For instance, I kissed a girl and I liked it. Truth be told, I did more than that." She said this while accepting the National Equality Award at the 2017 Human Rights Campaign Gala.
