After being slammed for her tweet wherein she described the morning Azaan played on loudspeakers as "extreme imposed religiosity", singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi said that after Sonu Nigam's tweet, the azaan in her area has become louder. "It's almost like retaliation," added Suchitra. She further said that bhajans in a temple or church bells playing loudly aren't right either.
