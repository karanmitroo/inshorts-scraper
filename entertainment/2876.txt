Bob Weinstein, American producer Harvey Weinstein's brother and CEO of The Weinstein Company, said business is continuing as usual at the company, even after co-chairman Harvey was fired over rape allegations against him. "Our banks and shareholders are fully supportive of our company...it's untrue that the company or board is exploring a sale or shutdown of the company," Bob added.
