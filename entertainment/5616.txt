Late ghazal singer Mehdi Hassan's sons have requested the Indian government to help them build a mausoleum dedicated to the singer in Pakistan. Hassan's son said that the Pakistan government had promised to build it after Hassan's demise five years ago. "We've run out of patience...we request the Indian government...as Hassan saab enjoyed a huge fan following across the border."
