Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said a film where alcohol scenes are essential would require an Adult (A) certificate. "Merely putting a ticker warning at...corner of the screen whenever there is smoking or drinking shown, is not enough any more," added Pahlaj. He said superstars should set an example in societal behaviour.
