Preity Zinta has said she had thought of quitting Bollywood but it was her husband Gene Goodenough who pushed her back. "I am lucky... I am married to a person who actually pushed me into doing a movie. I thought I didnâ€™t want to do any more movies," she added. Preity will be seen next in the film 'Bhaiyyaji Superhitt'.
