Actor Naseeruddin Shah has said that the '₹100 crore club' has poisoned filmmaking sensibility in India. "You cannot expect a guy who plies a rickshaw or works on the road all day to go and see films like ‘Waiting’. He will not. He will go and see a ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ or... ‘Happy New Year’ because he needs that," said Shah.
