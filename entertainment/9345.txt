Actor Rana Daggubati has said his upcoming film 'The Ghazi Attack' will be the first film to glorify the Indian Navy. "I took up this film because I felt the naval force also deserves equal glory and space in our history for the war they fought," he added. The film is inspired by true events from the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war.
