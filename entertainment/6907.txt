In a recent tweet, Mumbai Police posted two questions citing the release of 'Baahubali 2: The Conclusion', to highlight traffic discipline. The picture, shared with the hashtag #BahubaliOfTrafficDiscipline, asked the questions "Katappa ne Bahubali ko kyu mara?" and "Why don't people follow traffic rules?". It further read that the second question "can be answered only by you".
