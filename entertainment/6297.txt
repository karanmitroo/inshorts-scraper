A non-bailable warrant has been issued against eight Tamil actors including Baahubali's Sathyaraj for not appearing in court over a defamation case filed by a journalist. In 2009, a Tamil daily carried a report wherein an actress had accused certain actors and actresses of being involved in a prostitution racket, following which these actors had reportedly insulted the journalists.
