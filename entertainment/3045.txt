Singer Udit Narayan, while referring to the incident wherein his son Aditya verbally abused the staff of an airline said, "If Aditya has misbehaved it is wrong...I'll have him issue a public apology." "Right now, he's very scared and nervous. Making it worse is the attack from all corners as though he has committed a major crime," Udit added.
