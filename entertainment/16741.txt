A complaint has been filed against Bollywood actor Aamir Khan for calling policemen 'thulla' in his 2014's superhit film 'PK'. The FIR was lodged on Sunday by short filmmaker Ullhas PR in the New Ashok Nagar police station (Delhi). Ullhas said that if a complaint can be filed against CM Arvind Kejriwal for using the term then why not Aamir.
