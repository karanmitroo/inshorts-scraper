Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee said today at the Lit-O-Fest that he only reads his scripts typed in Hindi. Calling Hindi language his 'strength', Bajpayee added, "I am very passionate about the Hindi language... The day I realised I am in a position to make demands, I decided not to read any directorâ€™s script if it is not typed in Hindi."
