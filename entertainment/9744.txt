Singer Madonna has said that President-elect Donald Trump winning the elections is comparable to "being dumped by a lover" and "being stuck in a nightmare." She added that the election night "was just like watching a horror show." Madonna further said that Trump's win means she has to become more vocal and a little bit less mysterious.
