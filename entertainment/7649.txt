'Acrush', a new boy band in China consists of five androgynous girls, who are in their late teens and early twenties. They will reportedly avoid using either 'boy' or 'girl' to refer to their members, instead using the word 'handsome youth'. One of the band members has revealed that female fans also send 'love letters' to her.
