Actress Jacqueline Fernandez has said she doesn't have the guts to do a niche film as she's not from the country and isn't very good with the language. Jacqueline added, "I'm very careful to be part of films where I know I'll get cushioning and padding.... (and) support." She further said, "It's very daunting...carry an entire film on your shoulder."
