Singer Lana Del Rey has hinted that she will be joining witches who are planning to put a spell on US President Donald Trump. She tweeted that ingredients for the spell, including an unflattering photo of Trump, could be found online. The said protest against Trump will begin on Friday at midnight by casting a spell under the crescent moon.
