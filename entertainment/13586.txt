Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that her equation with actress Deepika Padukone has not changed but is the same as it was earlier. "Earlier you all (media) used to write we are BFFs (best friends forever) so why and how did this change. You only said it has changed," said Priyanka while denying rumours of a rift with Deepika.
