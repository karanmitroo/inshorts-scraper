'Simran' producer Shailesh Singh claimed that Kangana Ranaut's name for additional story and dialogue before the main writer Apurva Asrani on the film's poster is a printing error. He added it'll be changed in the next poster. Referring to Asrani's Facebook post claiming Kangana is lying about co-writing the script, he said, "Apurva seems to be doing this for publicity."
