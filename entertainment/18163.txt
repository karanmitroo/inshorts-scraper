Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, who will be soon seen in Zoya Akhtar's "Dil Dhadakne Do", has said she is not insecure working in the multi-starrer as the role matters more than anything else. "...Priyanka's role is bigger in the film but I think the film matters. I said yes to Zoya the moment I heard the role," Anushka said.
