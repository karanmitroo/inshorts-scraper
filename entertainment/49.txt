Speaking at the inauguration of former CM MG Ramachandran's statue at a Chennai university, actor Rajinikanth has said he knows politics is not easy and there are thorns and snakes in it. He added that he trusts himself to govern the same way that AIADMK leader MGR did. The present government and politicians are not doing their job, he said.
