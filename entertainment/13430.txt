A fan threw a bra at singer Rihanna while she was performing at a concert in Copenhagen for her Anti World Tour. The singer picked up the bra and remarked that it was too big for her breasts. Her current tour is for her eighth studio album 'Anti', which will end with her final concert in Abu Dhabi in December.
