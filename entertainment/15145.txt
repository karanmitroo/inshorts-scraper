Veteran actor Manoj Kumar, who was chosen on Friday to be awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, has called the announcement a 'pleasant surprise'. "I was sleeping, and I started getting calls from my friends. I thought they were kidding, but when I read the news myself, I realised that itâ€™s for real," he added.
