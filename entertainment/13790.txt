Miss Great Britain Zara Holland has been stripped ofâ€‹ her title after she appeared to have sex on national television, as pageant organisers said Holland could not be promoted as a "positive role model". Holland is currently a contestant on reality show 'Love Island', wherein contestants are encouraged to 'couple up' and are eliminated if they remain single.
