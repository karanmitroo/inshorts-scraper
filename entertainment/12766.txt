An Indian rendition of the popular 'Guns Nâ€™ Roses' song 'Sweet Child o' Mine' has been created by Baiju Dharmajan in collaboration with Girish Pradhan from Sikkim-based band 'Girish and the Chronicles'. The version is titled 'Sweet Indian Child of Mine' after the American song which featured on the band's debut album 'Appetite for Destruction' in 1987.
