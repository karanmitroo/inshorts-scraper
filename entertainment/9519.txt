Actor Bobby Deol has revealed he was the celebrity guest and not the DJ at the Delhi event in August 2016. "You go for an event and if you're the actor (they) are going to play your music," he added. Earlier, reports had emerged that Bobby had only played songs from his 1997 film 'Gupt' on loop throughout the evening.
