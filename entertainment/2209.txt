Actor Rajkummar Rao has said sex comedies are not his favourite and as an audience, he is more of a fan of subtle humour. "I enjoy watching comedy on-screen as long as it's not stupid and is making some sense," he added. Rao further said, "[I prefer]... situational [comedy] where you are not forcing something on me as a viewer."
