Ajay Devgn and Tabu starrer film 'Drishyam', that hit the theatres on Friday, is an "edge-of-the-seat, shocking, engrossing" thriller, HT said. However, the film is not as good as the original Malyalam version, it added. The film is replete with surprises, said NDTV. 'Drishyam' has been rated 3/5 (NDTV), 3.5/5 (HT) and 3.5/5 (Mid Day).
