Comedian Kiku Sharda, while talking about Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's conviction in two rape cases, jokingly said, "I went to jail for a day and now sir has gone for 20 years." He further said, "Justice happened and it was bound to happen, it's karma. But whatever violence took place (following Ram Rahim's conviction) was really sad."
