Actor Shahid Kapoor has said he hopes that Kangana Ranaut gets along with co-stars in future. He added, "Kangana has a thing for one-liners. I don't believe in publicising a film or myself through this...activity." During the promotions of their film 'Rangoon', Kangana had said that it was a nightmare sharing a cottage with Shahid for the film's shoot.
