In remembrance of the 17th anniversary of the fictional Battle of Hogwarts on May 2, JK Rowling apologised to fans for killing the character of Fred Weasley in the seventh part of the Harry potter series. She wrote, “Today I would just like to say: I’m really sorry about Fred. *Bows head in acceptance of your reasonable ire*.”
