Music composer Anu Malik has said that for recreated songs to work, the cast is very important and one needs big stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan in the film. Anu added, "They'll make sure that the song is taken to a different level." Recently, Malik's 'Tan Tana Tan' and 'Oonchi Hai Building' were recreated for 'Judwaa 2'.
