Saif Ali Khan jokingly said he should've added a disclaimer like in films while naming Taimur, his first child with wife Kareena Kapoor. Reacting to people criticising them for the name Taimur, he said, "...to look at medieval history, make value judgments is ridiculous." Saif jokingly added that Kareena thinks Taimur is a lot like him- a cranky, farty yeller.
