Anand Kumar, the founder of Bihar-based coaching centre Super 30, has said that he wonders how a handsome man like actor Hrithik Roshan will play him in his biopic. He added, "I am happy that a star as talented and popular as Hrithik Roshan is playing me." Directed by Vikas Bahl, the film will be Hrithik's first biopic.
