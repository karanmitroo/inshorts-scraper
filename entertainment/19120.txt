Finding most visuals of the film as disturbing, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has reportedly refused a censor certificate to the controversial film – ‘No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka’. It is a documentary on the last phase of the war between Sri Lankan forces and the LTTE in early 2009.
