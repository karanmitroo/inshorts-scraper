Actor Preity Zintaâ€™s lawyer clarified to a media channel on Monday saying, "We have not mentioned sexual molestation or even the word 'molestation' in the FIR." This came after the Mumbai police asked Preity to appear in person within a week and share her account of how ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia allegedly molested and abused her.
