Vidya Balan will recreate Sridevi's 'Hawa Hawai' from 'Mr India' (1987) in her upcoming film 'Tumhari Sulu'. Talking about it, director Suresh Triveni said, "I am elated to have such a cult number in the film. It plays a key role...and is not just a remix for the end credits." He said it is a tribute to the original song.
