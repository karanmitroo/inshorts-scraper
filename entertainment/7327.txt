Actor Vidyut Jammwal has tweeted a phone conversation between him and filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma, who in a drunken state referred to Tiger Shroff as 'transgender'. He added that Vidyut is the greatest man while Tiger is the greatest woman he saw in his life. However, RGV tweeted that Vidyut would run away if Tiger challenges him to a fight.
