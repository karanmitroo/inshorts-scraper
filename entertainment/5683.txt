Actor Anupam Kher shared pictures with Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro on Twitter. "And when #GodOfActing #RobertDeNiro takes a pic where he is doing the same gesture that you are doing, it is time to faint. What an honour," read the caption alongside the picture. Notably, Kher and De Niro worked together in the 2012 film 'Silver Linings Playbook'.
