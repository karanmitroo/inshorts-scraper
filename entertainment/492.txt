Director-producer Vikram Bhatt has said that filmmakers are a low-hanging fruit for controversies while adding, "Anybody, who wants to make news, the film industry becomes an easy target." He added cigarettes are sold in India without a proper ban on selling but if one person is seen smoking in a film, people want to come down heavily on that.
