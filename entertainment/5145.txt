Actress Sonam Kapoor, who will complete ten years of her Bollywood debut this year, said that she has been a tortoise and her journey so far has been slow and steady. Sonam added, "It's about... doing things you believe in, trudging on, working hard... because winning is not important, what's important is being the best version of yourself."
