Actress Shenaz Treasury, while speaking about nepotism, said we live in a very classist society. "Nepotism exists. Not just in Bollywood but in every profession in India," she added. Further, speaking about Kangana Ranaut who called filmmaker Karan Johar 'flagbearer of nepotism', Shenaz said, "People like Kangana have to work a million times harder than someone from a filmy family."
