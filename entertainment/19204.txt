On the occasion of their 25th wedding anniversary on Jan-14, Govinda and his wife Sunita Ahuja remarried in a private ceremony in London. However, their children did not attend the wedding as Sunita believes "kids are not supposed to see their parents getting married."  This time around, I was more excited, said Sunita.
