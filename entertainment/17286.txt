Hollywood star Pamela Anderson, who is an active member of PETA, has written to Kerala CM Oommen Chandy and Cochin Dewaswom board president against parading elephants at the Thrissur Pooram to be held Wednesday. Elephants can be replaced with papier-mache versions, she suggested. Anderson also offered to bear the cost of 30 life-sized portable elephants if her proposal is accepted.
