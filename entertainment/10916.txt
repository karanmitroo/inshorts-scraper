Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday quoted Nobel laureate Bob Dylan to defend the government’s decision to demonetise high-value banknotes by saying, “the times they are a-changin”. He further asked people not to criticise “what you can’t understand”. Quoting lines from Dylan's song he added, "Elders must learn from these words of wisdom."
