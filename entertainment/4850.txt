Singer BeyoncÃ©'s wax statue at Madame Tussauds, New York has been modified after fans of the singer said it was 'too white'. Earlier, it appeared to be thinner and lighter-skinned than the singer is in real life. Madame Tussauds said in a statement that the statue was back on display after adjustments to "the styling and lighting of her figure".
