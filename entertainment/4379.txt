Filmmaker Aanand L Rai, while discussing rumours of an alleged fight with actress Kangana Ranaut, said, "Kangana and I are still good friends who care for...each other." He added, "But we'll wait till we find a happy, meaningful space to work together." Rai also said there weren't conflicts while shooting 'Tanu Weds Manu Returns' but she had a different perspective.
