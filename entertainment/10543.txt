Actress Katrina Kaif has said that women should speak up about marital rape while addressing the 'WeUnite' conference by United Nations India. "I know of educated women, who remain silent in the face of violence because they are afraid to confront societal norms," said Katrina. The conference marked UN Women's partnership with the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
