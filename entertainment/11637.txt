Actor Irrfan Khan has revealed that if actors are not up to the mark, they could be removed from Hollywood. "It's an unforgiving industry. You have to keep reinventing yourself," the 49-year-old actor said, further adding that Hollywood "keeps you on your toes." The actor was last seen in the Tom Hanks-starrer 'Inferno', which released on October 14 in India.
