Actor Varun Dhawan will star in director Shoojit Sircar's next film titled 'October'. Talking about the film, Shoojit said, "It's not a love story... It's again an out-of-the-box kind of story... it is a very unusual, unconventional kind of a story in the slice-of-life and romance space." Notably, this will be Varun's first film with Shoojit.
