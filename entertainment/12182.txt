Actress Kangana Ranaut, when asked about her legal controversy with actor Hrithik Roshan, has said that no case was filed against her. Kangana added, "There was (a) lot of media drama, threats, lot of slut shaming... There was a sudden feminist pressure on me to fight. And talk about the sob story I had. But I didnâ€™t have that."
