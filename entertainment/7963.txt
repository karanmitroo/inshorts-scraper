A male actor played the female lead in India's first full-length feature film 'Raja Harishchandra' (1913), as acting was not considered a profession for women. The director of the film, Dadasaheb Phalke, cast actor Anna Salunke to play the role of Harishchandra's wife, Queen Taramati. Female actresses were later introduced in Phalke's second full-length feature film 'Mohini Bhasmasur'.
