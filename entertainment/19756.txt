Bollywood's "bad man" Gulshan Grover will be seen playing role of a gay dance teacher for the first time in "Baat Bann Gayi". According to a source, Gulshan got so carried away with a scene that he actually ended up kissing a man during the shot. He did not even realise when it happened and literally went red with embarrassment.
