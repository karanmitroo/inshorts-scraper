Vidya Balan has said people don't want to see a woman having an opinion or being intelligent as it's a threat to the status quo. "The perception is as an actress, you're expected to be seen as desirable and desirable women aren't intelligent, articulate and progressive," she added. Vidya further said, "We are angry goddesses and we need answers now."
