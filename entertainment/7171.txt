Activists in Karnataka have called for a bandh across the state on April 28, the release date of 'Baahubali: The Conclusion', to protest the screening of the film. They have asked actor Sathyaraj, who plays the role of 'Kattappa', to apologise for a remark he made nine years ago on the Cauvery issue. Sathyaraj had reportedly spoken against pro-Kannada groups.
