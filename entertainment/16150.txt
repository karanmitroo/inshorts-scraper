Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh, who is rumoured to be dating actress Deepika Padukone, has said that the latter looks hotter with him than Ranbir Kapoor who is the actress' former boyfriend. When asked the question, Singh said, "Obviously me... Is this even a question?". Notably, Padukone had refused to answer the same question earlier on talk show 'Koffee with Karan'.
