Padma Bhushan awardee historian Irfan Habib has said that Rani Padmavati is an imaginary character. "Though Alauddin Khilji had won Chittor, during that period there is no mention of any character as Padmavati," added Habib. Discussing the controversy over the film 'Padmavati', he said, "If any film producer makes movie on historical facts, he will fail in entertaining the audience."
