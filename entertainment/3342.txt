The Supreme Court has denied anticipatory bail to Bollywood producer Karim Morani, who was booked for allegedly raping a 25-year-old woman. The victim's advocate Karuna Nandy tweeted, "(He) must surrender today... Some days law wins over money and muscle power." She further wrote that Morani blackmailed the victim and threatened her with "elimination by underworld".
