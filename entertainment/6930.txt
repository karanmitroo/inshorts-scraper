A theatre in Bengaluru on Friday played the second half of 'Baahubali: The Conclusion' first. Viewers reportedly realised this after the climax scene and asked the theatre to play the movie again from the beginning. A user tweeted, "I was there...Thought if u have this much great war sequence in First half how it is going to be in second."
