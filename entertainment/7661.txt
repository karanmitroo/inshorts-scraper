The Gujarat High Court on Thursday stayed the summons issued by Gujarat railway police to actor Shah Rukh Khan in connection with a man's death at Vadodara railway station. The man died of suffocation when Shah Rukh's arrival caused a stampede at the station. The actor was travelling from Mumbai to Delhi by train to promote his film 'Raees'.
