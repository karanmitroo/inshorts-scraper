Singer Justin Bieber is auctioning a painting he made to raise funds for people affected by the recent wildfires in California. His painting, which has been titled 'Calvary', shows the cross rising in an overcast sky. The California fire, which burnt down over 700 houses, had also threatened homes of several celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Ellen DeGeneres.
