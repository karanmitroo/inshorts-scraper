Actor Rajkummar Rao has denied rumours of hiking his fee following the success of his films like 'Newton'. He said, "This is just speculation. It's just that I have got a little busy." Rajkummar added, "I want to do good films... Success is accidental, it can change overnight. So, I don't let it go to my head."
