Actress Deepika Padukone’s 'The Live Love Laugh Foundation' (TLLLF) has launched 'More Than Just Sad', an awareness programme on mental health for general physicians. “We believe the programme... will assist them (physicians)... to provide the right diagnosis and guidance to patients who could be struggling... with mental health issues including depression, stress and anxiety,” said Deepika.
