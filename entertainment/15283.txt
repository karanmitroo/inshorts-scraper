Hollywood actress Emma Watson recently said in an interview that she will take a year-long sabbatical from her acting career to focus on studying and improving her knowledge of feminism. "Work that I do for the UN is all very clearly outlined, but my personal views and opinions are still being defined. So it'll be an interesting time," she said.
