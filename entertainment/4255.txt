Television personality Khloé Kardashian has revealed she was 'body-shamed' as a teenager by her teacher, who posed the question 'Are you sure?' to Khloé when she said Kim and Kourtney are her sisters. "She never said I was fat, but I knew she was referring to my size. Words are the weapon we have, they cut the deepest," added Khloé.
