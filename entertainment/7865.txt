Actor Akshay Kumar said that today he can have a flop and not worry about where his next meal will come from. "[A] decade ago, my family as well as my welfare was dependent on every movie. Now, I don't have that kind of pressure," he added. Akshay further said his family will survive even if he stopped making movies.
