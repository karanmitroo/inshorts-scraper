Television actress Nia Sharma has said she was uncomfortable kissing her female co-star for the web series 'Twisted'. However, Nia added, "Such a thing (two girls kissing) is so common nowadays. I don't know why people are making a big deal about it." She further said that if she can be a 'bahu' on TV, she can do this too.
