A PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court Tuesday, seeking a ban on the release of Deepika Padukone and Arjun Kapoor starrer, 'Finding Fanny'. The petition said the word "fanny" was highly sexually explicit and should be removed from the movie, its songs, posters and banners. The PIL also challenged the UA certificate given to the film.
