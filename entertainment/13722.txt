Police reports on Tuesday revealed that late singer Michael Jackson allegedly possessed a collection of pornographic material, including pictures of nude children, which were seized in a 2003 raid at Jackson's 'Neverland Ranch'. However, the estate of Michael Jackson called the reports "false" further alleging it to be "timed" ahead of Michael's death anniversary, which falls on June 25.
