Right-wing group Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS), on Monday, demanded a ban on MTV's reality show Splitsvilla, saying that it erodes culture. "The impact of such reality shows is so much that it erodes culture and morality in the youth which are the future responsible citizens of this country," said HJS spokesperson. The organisation also demands complete censorship of TV shows.
