Pop star Madonna fell of the stage during her performance at the 2015 Brit Awards held Feb 25. She tumbled down the stairs as one of the background dancers failed to completely remove the cape she was wearing. The 56-yr-old singer later posted on instagram, "...nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up! I'm fine!".
