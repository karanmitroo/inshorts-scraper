Reacting to a picture of a man urinating in front of the poster of Akshay Kumar's film 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha', a Twitter user commented, "Retweet if you haven't seen a bigger irony than this." "Shortest review ever," wrote another user. Meanwhile, another comment read, "Akshay: Don't pee anywhere, pee only when you see a toilet. Citizens: As you wish".
