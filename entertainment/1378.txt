Angad Bedi, who played the antagonist in 'Pink', has said when a big actor refuses a film, another actor is born. He added a lot of people refused his role in the film and eventually the makers approached him. Angad further said no films were offered to him until the release of the 2014 film 'Ungli', which got him noticed.
