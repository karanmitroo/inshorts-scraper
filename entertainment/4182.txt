Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said barring Akshay Kumar, who co-starred with him in the 2015 film 'Brothers', all his co-actors and him have been "items". "It's sad that going out for meals and chilling together has such connotations in this universe," he added. Sidharth further said people in show business aren't given the leeway to be normal.
