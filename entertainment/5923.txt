Filmmaker Onir has said that he didn't work with Pakistani singer Atif Aslam as his upcoming film 'Shab' is a small one and he couldn't afford any trouble. He added, "I really wanted to [but]...things were not great between [India and Pakistan]." The IMPPA called for a ban on Pakistani artistes working in India, following the 2016 Uri attack.
