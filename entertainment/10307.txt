Actress Sonakshi Sinha has said that celebrity kids crave for some kind of normalcy in their lives as "they are always surrounded by so much chaos". "I've had a lovely childhood except for the parts when I was... given more attention than I craved for," added Sonakshi. She further said that it's important for the parents to keep the balance.
