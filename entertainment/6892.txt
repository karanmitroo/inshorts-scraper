Filmmaker Anurag Basu shared a collage with two pictures of Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif on Twitter. In the first picture, Ranbir and Katrina's childhood photos appear to have been morphed while the second one is a recent photo of them holding hands. The collage has been captioned, "Day 1- Jagga Jasoos, Last Day- Jagga Jasoos...How time flies."
