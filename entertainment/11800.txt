Actor Daniel Craig has said that "there is no other job" like playing the role of British spy 'James Bond'. "I've got the best job in the world doing Bond. If I were to stop doing it - just say - I'd miss it terribly," added Daniel. Earlier, the actor had said that he was "done" playing the character.
