The Bombay High Court on Thursday transferred the probe into the death of Bollywood actor Jiah Khan to the CBI to investigate whether her death was a case of "suicide or homicide". The court clarified that it was not expressing any opinion on the merits of the allegations. Suraj Pancholi was arrested and charged for abetting his girlfriend Jiah's suicide.
