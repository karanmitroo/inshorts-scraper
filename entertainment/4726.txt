The Supreme Court has refused to give a hearing date for a plea against the release of Madhur Bhandarkar's film 'Indu Sarkar'. The plea seeking a stay on the film's release was submitted by Priya Singh Paul, a woman who claims to be late Sanjay Gandhi's daughter. The SC bench said, "You give your memo. We will see to it."
