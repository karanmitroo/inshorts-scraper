Actor Matt Damon has only twenty-five lines in his upcoming film 'Jason Bourne'. The film's director Paul Greengrass said, "I think what makes a Bourne movie is the violence and the set pieces... but thereâ€™s a tremendous amount of emotionality in the character." The film will release in India on August 5 in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.
