Actor Amitabh Bachchan has said that he feels embarrassed when he is travelling abroad and foreigners refer to India as a "land of rape" and a "third world" or developing country. "The aim behind making ‘Pink’ was to send its message as strongly as possible. I want people outside to recognise what is happening (in India)," said Bachchan.
