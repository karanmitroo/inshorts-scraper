The family of late flight attendant Neerja Bhanot, on whose life the Sonam Kapoor starrer film 'Neerja' was made, may move the High Court over the film's profit-sharing dispute. Neerja's family has accused the makers of not sharing 10% from the film's net profit with them. They've sent a notice of arbitration to the film's makers for breaching their contract.
