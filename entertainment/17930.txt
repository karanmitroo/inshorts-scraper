Singer Ankit Tiwari's plea seeking to quash the case of rape against him will be heard by the Bombay High Court on Wednesday. Tiwari, known for singing 'Sun raha hai na tu', was arrested in May 2014 after a woman filed a complaint of rape against him. Tiwari had filed the petition in HC arguing that he is being framed.
