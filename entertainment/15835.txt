“Peter and Wendy”, the new film adaptation of JM Barrie’s “Peter Pan” will be shot in London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, to which Barrie had given the book rights in 1929. Barrie's story in the film takes place in a teenager’s imagination, who is a heart patient at the hospital and enters the plot as she reads the book.
