Author Ruskin Bond on Friday slammed the decision to award the 2016 Nobel prize for Literature to singer Bob Dylan saying it was an "insult" to the other winners and those who deserve it. He also said the Nobel committee's decision has not been right on several occasions. However, "there is not much one can do about it", he added.
