The organisers of Cannes Film Festival 2017 have been slammed for allegedly retouching the waist and thighs of Italian actress Claudia Cardinale to make her appear slimmer on the festival's poster. A Twitter user wrote "Appalled that #Cannes2017 felt the need to 'slim' this photograph...insulting & unnecessary." However, the festival's director said that the poster has been "very well received".
