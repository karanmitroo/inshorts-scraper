Akshay Kumar revealed that a fan once told him that his son eats only when he watches Akshay's comedy film 'Hera Pheri' (2000). "...if my film is helping people to digest their food, then where is the problem?", Akshay added. He further said that it's most difficult to make people laugh, and the film industry doesn't give priority to it.
