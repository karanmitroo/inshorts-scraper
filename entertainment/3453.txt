American singer-songwriter Miley Cyrus has said that she doesn't envision marriage as she has too much living to do before she gets married. Miley added, "I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more." Miley announced engagement to her longtime boyfriend Hollywood actor Liam Hemsworth in October last year.
