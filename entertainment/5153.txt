The teaser of a Pakistani television series titled 'Baaghi', based on the life of late model-turned-social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch, has been released. Actress Saba Qamar, who made her Bollywood debut in the Irrfan Khan starrer 'Hindi Medium', will be seen playing Qandeel in the show. Qandeel was murdered by her brother in 2016 for bringing "disrepute to family's honour".
