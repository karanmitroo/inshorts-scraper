Bollywood movie Bhoothnath Returns, starring Amitabh Bachchan, will hit theatres on Apr-11 as per schedule as the Delhi High Court on Friday refused to stay its release and rejected an interim plea of a Hindi writer that the film was copied from his literary work. Bhoothnath Returns, directed by Nitesh Tiwari, is a horror comedy film.
