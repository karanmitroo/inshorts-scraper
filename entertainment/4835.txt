Responding to Saif Ali Khan's letter wherein he discussed nepotism and genetics, Kangana Ranaut wrote in her letter that she'd be a farmer if Saif's point on genetics was true. She added, "Are you implying that artistic skills, hard-work...can be inherited through genes?" Saif had written about people being interested in star kids and if they'll have their parents' genes.
