Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Sunday tagged 'Superwoman' Lilly Singh in a tweet, posting, "You know you are old when your 13 year old says 'Bawse' and you say 'Whatttt?????' @IISuperwomanII". Irani shared a picture of Singh's recently-released book 'How to Be a Bawse'. Singh has described a 'bawse' as a confident person who makes people feel good about themselves.
