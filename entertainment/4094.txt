Karan Johar, while discussing his talk show 'Koffee With Karan', said, "I'd like to call anyone who makes my show rock. Whether it's sensational, controversial...it doesn't matter to me as long as the show works." He added that if it's going to make the show great, he will call his guests back again no matter what they say to him.
