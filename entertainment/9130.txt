Actor Sidharth Malhotra has revealed that he has no pressure from his parents to get married. "At least, it hasn't started yet. My parents are definitely liberal," he added. Sidharth further said, "A household thing or settling down will happen with time. Hopefully, before my 30s end. At least that's the plan."
