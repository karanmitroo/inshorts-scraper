Actress Jacqueline Fernandez has revealed that she was screamed at and made fun of by certain choreographers when she did her first movie. "It was then that I started training in dance because I didn't want to disappoint... with my 'not upto the mark' dancing," said Jacqueline. She has been selected to judge the dance reality show 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa'.
