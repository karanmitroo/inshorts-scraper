Shah Rukh Khan has said he'll miss late filmmaker Kundan Shah just like he misses his mother, who passed away when he was in his 20s. SRK added, "I was 25 when I came to Mumbai, I've stayed in Kundan's house, I've been fed by his family." He further called Kundan's demise one of the greatest losses of his life.
