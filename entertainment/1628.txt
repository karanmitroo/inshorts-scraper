Rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein, while responding to actress Salma Hayek's accusation that he forced her into doing a lesbian sex scene in the 2002 film 'Frida', said he doesn't recall pressurising her. "All of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired," read Weinstein's statement.
