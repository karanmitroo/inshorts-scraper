Arjun Rampal has been trolled for sharing a fake story about a picture of cheetahs hunting a deer, which suggests the photographer went into depression after taking the picture. "Check the internet about the information of this pic," a user commented. "Please research before posting," wrote another user. Earlier, Shahid Kapoor was also trolled for sharing the same story.
