Late actor Tom Alter wanted Mahendra Singh Dhoni to be banned from representing India after he retired from Test cricket, midway of India's Australia tour in 2014. Alter had said that Dhoni not only broke his contract but also a "sacred bond with true Indian cricket lovers" and "didn't give a damn". He further termed Dhoni as "the corporate favourite".
