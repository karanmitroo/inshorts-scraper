Actor Alok Nath will reportedly host 'Sinskari', a web chat show that discusses sex-related issues including pre-marital sex and role-play. "It may come as a shocker that I am part of it because I have been stuck with the Babuji image," said Nath. Reportedly inspired from the chat show 'Between the Ferns', Sinskari's first guest will be actress Mandana Karimi.
