Actor Aamir Khan has said that child actors in his upcoming biographical sports drama film 'Dangal', performed ten times better than him. "I'm not exaggerating.... I've been working in the industry for last 25 years, but these kids are highly talented," he said. Child artistes Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar play Aamir's daughters Geeta and Babita respectively in the film.
