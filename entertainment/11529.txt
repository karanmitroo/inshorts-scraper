Marvel has withdrawn the cover of an upcoming comic featuring the new 'Iron Man' Riri Williams, after it was criticised for 'sexualising' the 15-year-old teenage superhero. The cover, created by J Scott Campbell featured the teenage girl in a revealing crop top. Campbell called the decision "unfortunate" and said that he "simply attempted to draw a sassy, coming-of-age young woman".
