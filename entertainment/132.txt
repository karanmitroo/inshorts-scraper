A statue of rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein, named 'Casting Couch', has been unveiled near the venue where the Oscars will be held on March 4. The statue by artist Plastic Jesus depicts a life-size Weinstein, clothed in a bathrobe, sitting on a golden coloured couch and holding an Oscar. Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 70 women.
