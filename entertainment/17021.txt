Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra has revealed that her family initially resisted when she joined the film industry. "I come from a conservative Punjabi family... But later my parents gave me wings and let me do what I wanted to," Priyanka said after the screening of her recent release 'Dil Dhadakne Do' at the IIFA Weekend and Awards in Malaysia.
