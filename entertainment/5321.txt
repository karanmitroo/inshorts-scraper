Filmmaker Alphonse Puthren wrote in a Facebook post that Kamal Haasan should be the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for a day similar to the storyline of the film 'Mudhalvan'. "[H]ope it happens soon. He would take government to next level with his innovative ideas," he added. Alphonse further said if he has said something wrong he should be forgiven.
