Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has accepted his Nobel Prize for Literature in person in Stockholm, Sweden, over three months after the official ceremony on December 10, 2016. The gold medal and diploma were presented to Dylan at a "private ceremony in Stockholm" with no media presence. Earlier, Dylan cited "other commitments" for being unable to attend the actual award ceremony.
