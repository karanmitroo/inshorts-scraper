A behind-the-scenes video shows the wrestling training of Aamir Khan for the film 'Dangal'. Aamir was trained by Indian Wrestling Team's coach Arjuna awardee Kripa Shankar Bishnoi Beniwal. Aamir went from 97 kgs to six packs for 'Dangal'. "It was big challenge because when you lose weight, and keep wrestling there's a greater possibility of getting injured,' said Beniwal.
