Singer Rihanna has been honoured with the 2017 Harvard Humanitarian of the Year award. She received the award for her work in her native island of Barbados and the charities she has founded over the years. "All you need to do is help one person, expecting nothing in return. To me, that is humanitarian," she said during her speech.
