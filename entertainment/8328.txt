Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that she is not okay with being gossipy and refused to rate people on a segment in the television talk show 'Koffee WIth Karan'. "I don't want to make provocative statements," added Sonam. She further said, "No one needs to know my opinion about any actor. I'd rather reserve them for issues that actually matter."
