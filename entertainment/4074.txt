Aanand and Swati Goradiya, the Hindi dialogue writers of Kajol and Dhanush starrer 'VIP 2', have alleged that despite giving constant reminders since mid-July their payments have not been cleared by the producers. "They claimed that the strike in the South film industry had severely affected them," said Aanand. Soundarya Rajinikanth has directed the film while Dhanush has co-produced it.
