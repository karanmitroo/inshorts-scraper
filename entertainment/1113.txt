Actor Saif Ali Khan, while talking about his son Taimur, said, "Watching him walk for the first time was like watching a drunk baby." He further said, "It's hysterical and so cute...it's a wonderful part of our lives." Earlier, Saif had said that if hiding Taimur from the media would give them privacy, he would not mind it.
