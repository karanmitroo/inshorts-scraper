Rishi Kapoor, while discussing pictures of Ranbir Kapoor and Pakistani actress Mahira Khan smoking together that surfaced online, said his son is a young man and can meet any girl he wants. Rishi added, "How do we know that (there's) something more to this picture? He could have met her...(at the restaurant)." He called it unfair to invade Ranbir's privacy.
