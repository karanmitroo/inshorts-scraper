A new advertisement campaign #DontLetHerGo launched on Wednesday for 'Swachh Bharat' features several actors, including Kangana Ranaut. The ad shows Kangana as Goddess Lakshmi who disappears from the houses or shops of those who litter. Amitabh Bachchan's voice-over in the ad remarks, "Goddess of wealth 'Lakshmi' stays in cleanliness... Think before throwing garbage, Lakshmi may abandon you."
