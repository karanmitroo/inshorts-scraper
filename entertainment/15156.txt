Karan Johar has confirmed that he will be making a sequel to his 2012 film, 'Student Of The Year', during a question and answer session on Twitter. Hinting at section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalizes homosexuality, Johar also said that 'Dostana,' will have no sequel as he will be stopped "377 times" from making such a sequel.
