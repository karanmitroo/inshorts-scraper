Television personality Rob Kardashian's Instagram account was blocked after he posted nude pictures of his ex-fianc√©e Blac Chyna. Responding to this, Blac wrote on Snapchat, "Rob....u beat me up and try act it never happened...I'm supposed to be quiet because you're a Kardashian." Rob and Blac got engaged in 2016 and announced their split in the same year.
