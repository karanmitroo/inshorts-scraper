A custom made Calvin Klein dress, that cost actress Lupita Nyong'o $150,000, was stolen from the London Hotel West Hollywood in Lupita's absence. The dress was worn by the actress at this year's Oscars. The dress, that had 6,000 Akoya pearls hand-sewn on it, was designed by Francisco Costa, and took 25 people 10 weeks to complete.
