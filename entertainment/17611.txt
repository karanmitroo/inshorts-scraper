The Censor Board of India has banned the screening of Hollywood film 'Fifty Shades of Grey', an adaptation of EL James' erotic novel. A Universal Pictures source said the board had objected to the film even after they made voluntary edits and removed all nudity. The film has also been banned in several other countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya.
