Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, who first met on sets of film "Two States", are reportedly dating each other. After the first outing at the screening of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, the pair, Arjun and Alia, recently went very cosy and kept disappearing to corners every now and then on the pretext of talking over phone at Sanjay Kapoor's party.
