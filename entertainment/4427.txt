A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in the Parliament on Friday pointed out anomalies in collection of service tax from actors Salman Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Ajay Devgn, Riteish Deshmukh, and Arjun Rampal. According to the report, services like travel, lodging, and boarding of actors' staff, which were paid for by producers, should have been included in taxable income.
