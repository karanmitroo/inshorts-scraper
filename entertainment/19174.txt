Oscar-winning filmmaker Woody Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow (28), in an open letter, has accused her father for sexually abusing her when she was seven. Allegations of abuse began in 1993, but Allen (77) has consistently denied any wrongdoing. In 1992, Dylan's mother Mia Farrow (68) had filed charges of molestation against Allen, but the case was later dropped.
