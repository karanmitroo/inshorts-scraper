Actor-filmmaker Kamal Haasan on Friday said that he would "join hands" with actor Rajinikanth if he decides to enter politics. This comes after he reportedly claimed that he is thinking to form his own political party. However, Haasan had earlier said that Rajinikanth should not join politics and that the actor-filmmaker himself would not enter politics in haste.
