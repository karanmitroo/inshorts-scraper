London-based toymaker Propel RC has launched a lineup of four hand-painted laser shooting drones inspired from sci-fi movie 'Star Wars'. The remote-controlled drones can fly at speeds of 80 kmph and perform mid-air stunts like backflips and 360-degree rotations. The drone lineup includes an X-Wing, a Millennium Falcon, a TIE Fighter and a 74-Z speeder bike.
