A ban has been imposed on the shooting of commercial films in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the gurudwara. The move was attributed to film shoots creating disturbance in the gurudwara complex. The shooting of only religious movie and documentaries would be allowed, as per SGPC President Avtar Singh Makkar.
