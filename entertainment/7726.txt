The 1964 film 'Yaadein', which was directed and produced by Sunil Dutt, is known as the world's first feature film to star only one actor. While the movie starred Dutt, his wife Nargis Dutt featured only as a silhouette in the final scene. 'Yaadein' was also recognised by Guinness World Records for having the 'fewest actors in a narrative film'.
