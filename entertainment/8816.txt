An FIR has been lodged against Shah Rukh Khan for allegedly "rioting" and "damaging" railway property during his film Raees' promotion at Kota railway station, an official said on Tuesday. He travelled from Mumbai to Delhi in a train to promote Raees last month. One person was killed in a stampede that ensued when the actor reached the Vadodara station.
