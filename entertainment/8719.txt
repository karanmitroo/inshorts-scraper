Actor Ranbir Kapoor, at Randhir Kapoor's birthday celebrations earlier this week, said he's still single while speaking about his relationship status. Reportedly, actress Rekha, who also attended the party, pulled his cheeks and did 'nazar utarna', a practice to protect against the evil eye after Ranbir said this. Reportedly, Ranbir and rumoured girlfriend Katrina Kaif broke up in February 2016.
