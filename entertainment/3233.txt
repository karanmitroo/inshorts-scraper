Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt has said that a Shah Rukh Khan or an Aamir Khan in a film does not guarantee success. He added, "Today, people won't go to enjoy their favourite sensations, be it happy, sad or thrilled, minus a good story." Vikram, who is known for making horror films, further said, "I like peddling fear."
