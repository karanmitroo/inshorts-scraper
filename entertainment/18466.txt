Asha Bhonsle is about to wind up her autobiography titled 'Asha Bhonsle Uncut', which will be released next year, in the original Hindi version and a translated English version. "I will hide nothing in the book. It's been over a year since I began penning down my life, recollecting episodes and narrating incidents," said the 82-year-old singer in an interview.
