Actor Shahid Kapoor has said that just because his wife Mira got married when she was 21, doesn't mean she has no identity. "Whether you're a working woman, housewife, young mother or a woman who chooses to have children at a later stage, it's your decision," he added. Shahid further said that men should respect what women feel like doing.
