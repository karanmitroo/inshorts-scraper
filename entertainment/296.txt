Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said revealing details about his relationships with his ex-girlfriends Niharika Singh and Sunita Rajwar in his biography 'An Ordinary Life: A Memoir' was the biggest mistake of his life. "I shouldn't have taken their names in the biography," he added. Both Niharika and Sunita had accused Nawazuddin of making false claims about their relationships for publicity.
