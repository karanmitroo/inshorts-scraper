The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has adopted the 'F-rating', a category system which highlights films which are written, directed by women or feature women in significant roles. Currently, IMDb has 21,800 films which have been tagged as F-rated. The rating system was first introduced in 2014 by Bath Film Festival executive director Holly Tarquini to "support women in film".
