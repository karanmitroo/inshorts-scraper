Kangana Ranaut, in a recent interview with Anupama Chopra, said, "I don't have ba**s, I have a vagina. Why can't anyone say that word? It's much cooler to say 'You've got ovaries'". She said this while talking about how when she got hurt on the sets of her upcoming film 'Manikarnika', her crew kept saying "You've got ba**s".
