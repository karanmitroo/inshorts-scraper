Actor Kamal Haasan has said that he will be forced to quit films if 28% Goods and Service Tax (GST) is applied to films. "I'm supposed to pay income tax over and above this. I see this as punishment," added Haasan. He further said that this GST would kill regional cinema and urged the Centre to reduce it to 12-15%.
