Tiger Shroff has said that from his father Jackie Shroff's films, he would love to be in Parinda's remake. "I don't think I'd be able to do it like my dad did...those are such big shoes to fill," said Tiger. He added that he'd like to be in Shiva Ka Insaaf remake so that he can play a superhero again.
