According to Mid-day, Salman Khan apparently ridiculed Ranbir's latest-movie Besharam saying critics had initially given the Ranbir-starrer just one-a-half stars and later deducted that one star too. Salman was chatting with guests Sharman Joshi and Jaaved Jaaferi, promoting their film-War Chodd Na Yaar on Big Boss 7.  Apparently, the show-makers have decided not to air this portion to avoid controversies.
