The hashtag #OscarsSoWhite was coined by journalist April Reign in 2015 to highlight the absence of actors of colour among the 20 key nomination categories for the Oscars. The hashtag became viral when the same issue emerged with 2016 Oscar nominees. Actor Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee were among those who boycotted the Oscars in 2016.
