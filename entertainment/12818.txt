Actor Robert De Niro has called Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump "totally nuts" while adding that whatever Trump says is "totally crazy" and "ridiculous". "[I]t's crazy that people like Donald Trump... he shouldn't even be where he is, so God help us," said De Niro. The 72-year-old actor made the comments at the Sarajevo Film Festival.
