Mumbai Police will soon file a chargesheet in the Geetika Tyagi-Subhash Kapoor case. The National award-winning director, who was accused of molestation by the starlet, was arrested on Monday evening and later released on bail. The arrest came after representatives of the National Commission for Women met Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria last week and requested him to take action.
