During an interview, actor Ranbir Kapoor said, “I don’t believe in Mother’s Day. A mother is always our first love and our last love, and there’s no greater relationship than a child and mother." The son of veteran actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu admitted that he has been closer to his mother but greatly influenced by his father's energy.
