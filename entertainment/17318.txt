Speaking on the persistent problem of crimes against women, actor Aamir Khan said Thursday that the definition of masculinity in India needs to change along with the balance of power. He also criticised the Indian society for shunning rape victims and not the rapists. "Unless conviction becomes swift and certain, things are not going to change in India", he said.
