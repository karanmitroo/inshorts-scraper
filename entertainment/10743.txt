Shilpa Shetty was trolled online for her remark, which claimed that George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' could be included in the school curriculum as it may help children be compassionate towards animals. Users responded with tweets like, "The Hunger Games is a great series on Karwa Chauth. #ShilpaShettyReviews" and "The Hobbit is good. All children should develop good hobbits. #ShilpaShettyReviews".
