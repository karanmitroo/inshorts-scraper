After Katrina Kaif shared a picture with 'Thugs of Hindostan' co-stars Aamir Khan and Fatima Sana Shaikh, Aamir was trolled for looking taller than both the actresses. A user commented, "Aamir on heels or on a stool?" while another comment read, "This is how Mr Perfectionist has worked hard to increase his height for a perfect picture."
