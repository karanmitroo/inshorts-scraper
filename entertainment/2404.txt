Actor Arjun Kapoor, while speaking on the ongoing row over Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', wrote that yet again a man has to justify creativity because politics and propaganda creates an ugly environment. "He's a fantastic filmmaker (and) his vision must be trusted. I'm sure Rani Padmavati & her story will be depicted with respect by him," added Arjun.
