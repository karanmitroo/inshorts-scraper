Actor Rajinikanth on Twitter on Monday requested the youth to call off their protest against the ban on bull-taming sport Jallikattu. "Some anti-social elements are trying to derail the peaceful efforts...We must trust the Centre, state and judiciary and give them some time," he wrote. Rajinikanth further said that he salutes the way the youth carried out the historic protest.
