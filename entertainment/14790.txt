'The Jungle Book', scheduled to release on Friday, has been passed by the Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with a U/A certificate. Notably, U/A rating is given to a movie which contains mild violence and sensuality, and is unsuitable for children below 12. The 3D effects of the film are "too scary" for children, CBFC chairman Pahlaj Nihalani said.
