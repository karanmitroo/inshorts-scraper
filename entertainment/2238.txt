Mukesh Bhatt has said his comment that some women are blatantly shameless to offer themselves, made in context of sexual harassment, has been misquoted. "I said sexual harassment isn't gender-specific...In some instances, men take advantage of it and in some instances, women take advantage of the same," he clarified. Bhatt added, "Both men and women have fallen prey to this."
