Sonam Kapoor took to Twitter to slam rumours of a catfight on the sets of her upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding'. This was after an article reported the alleged incident without taking any specific names. "Please keep in mind how outdated, irresponsible and harmful your narrative is...for a culture of women who actually want to work together," wrote Sonam.
