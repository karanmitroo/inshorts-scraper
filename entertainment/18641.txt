Actress Nargis Fakhri suffered a minor wardrobe malfunction during the ongoing Bridal Fashion Week. A model stepped on her gown, causing her dress to slit and tear from the middle, while she was going back after the walk. She covered up using the cape of her gown and walked back. Fakhri was the show-stopper for the jewellery brand Azva.
