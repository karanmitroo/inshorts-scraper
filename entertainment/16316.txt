The early morning shows and the overseas premiere of Tamil film 'Puli' have been cancelled, a day after the Income Tax Department raided the houses of the movie's stars and producers. While the actual reasons behind the cancellation have not been unveiled, reports suggest that the producers are yet to clear dues to Qube, a company that provides movie-streaming service.
