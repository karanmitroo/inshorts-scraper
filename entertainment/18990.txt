In ‘Revolver Rani’, Kangana's character is a ‘Manizer’ (female version of womanizer) in the sense that she does to her boy toy, played by Vir Das, what usually men are seen doing to women. Her character is extremely dominating, so much so, that in one of her kissing scenes, she lands up biting his lips leading them to bleed.
