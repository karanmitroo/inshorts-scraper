Kangana Ranaut, responding to Shahid Kapoor's statement that she has a vivid imagination and makes things up, said that Shahid must've borrowed the comment from Hrithik Roshan. In 2016, Kangana had referred to Hrithik as her "silly ex", which had initiated a legal battle between the two. Notably, Kangana and Shahid will be seen together in the upcoming film 'Rangoon'.
