Actress Emma Watson condemned the practice of child marriage during a trip to Malawi, Africa on Monday. "Meeting with young girls who...are struggling with poverty and were pressured into early marriage ... made me realize just how important it is for women to be able to make their own choices," said Watson, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN Women.
