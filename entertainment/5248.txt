Actress Ayesha Takia has said she never felt nervous about people accepting her after her comeback in Bollywood. She added, "I've always been a person, even when I was doing two shifts a day, who'll finish work... just pack up, go home and get disconnected from everything else." Ayesha took a break from films in 2013 after her son's birth.
