Actor Shahid Kapoor has said that there are no issues between him and his co-star Kangana Ranaut. "I read an article somewhere that we might not promote [Rangoon] together. I will be happy to promote the film whenever wherever with Kangana and Saif Ali Khan who is also a very big part of the film," he added.
