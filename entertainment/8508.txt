After actor Warren Beatty mistakenly announced 'La La Land' as the Best Picture instead of 'Moonlight' at Oscars 2017, Miss Universe tweeted, "Have your people call our people - we know what to do." Following the mistake, Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel had said, "Personally, I blame Steve Harvey." American comedian Harvey had announced the wrong winner at Miss Universe 2015.
