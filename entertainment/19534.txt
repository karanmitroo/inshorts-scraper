Red tapism and corruption in India are leading to filmmakers choosing foreign destinations to shoot films, feels Bollywood producer Mahesh Bhatt. Bhatt said that Indian producers are given a red-carpet hassle-free welcome abroad while they need too many permissions (around 76) in India. Moreover, for every permission, they need to cough up money under the table to shoot in India.
