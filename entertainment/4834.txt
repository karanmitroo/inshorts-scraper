Akshay Kumar's 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' has been leaked online about 20 days before its release. Choreographer-director Remo D'Souza notified the film's makers about the leak after he met someone who had the film on his pen drive. Reacting to this, Akshay tweeted that the police is looking into the matter and urged fans to say no to piracy.
