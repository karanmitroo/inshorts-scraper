CBFC has demanded 14 cuts in 'Indu Sarkar', the upcoming film based on 1975 Emergency. The film's director Madhur Bhandarkar tweeted he's "appalled" by the CBFC's suggestions and will approach the Revising Committee. CBFC has reportedly asked to delete words like Intelligence Bureau, Prime Minister, Kishore Kumar, and also demanded deletion of dialogues, some of which feature in the trailer.
