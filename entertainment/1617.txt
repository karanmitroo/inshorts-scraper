Producer Firoz Nadiadwala, while mourning the death of actor-director Neeraj Vora, said, "I've lost the battle to save my brother and friend from the clutches of death." "His health had improved so much. But it deteriorated suddenly," he added. Neeraj, who was battling coma for a year, was reportedly being taken care of at Nadiadwala's residence.
