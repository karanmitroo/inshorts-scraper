New Censor Board Chairman Prasoon Joshi has said he doesn't want to comment on what his predecessor Pahlaj Nihalani has done. "That was his way of working. He is an experienced man and has a different style of working," Prasoon added. He further said, "The way I've fulfilled other responsibilities, I'll give my best to this new task as well."
