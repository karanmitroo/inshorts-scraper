Actor Salman Khan recently stood up for actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is dating Khan's ex-girlfriend Katrina Kaif. When asked about the low that hit Ranbir’s career recently, Salman said, "I can understand what a lean phase can do to an actor. I’ve been there too". "[O]ne flop film doesn’t give anyone the right to write off an actor", he added.
