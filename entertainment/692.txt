Actor Shahid Kapoor, while speaking about Ranveer Singh's portrayal of 'Alauddin Khilji' in the film 'Padmaavat', said he would have played the character differently. "We are two different actors and our style of acting is different," he added. Earlier, Ranveer had said he would have played Shahid's character in the film 'Kaminey' better than Shahid.
