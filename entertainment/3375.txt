'Lipstick Under My Burkha' actress Aahana Kumra has been body-shamed on posting a picture of herself in a bikini. "Need to [lose] some fat from belly," commented a user. "Do workout," wrote another user. Aahana later posted a picture captioned, "Do we shape the world? Or does the world shape us?", which is said to be a response to trolls.
