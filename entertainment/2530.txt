Actress-turned-author Twinkle Khanna wrote a post on Facebook apologising for her comments on the ongoing row between Akshay Kumar and comedian Mallika Dua. "I reacted irrationally with the only tools I have that help me retain my sanity in this fishbowl existence- words and lame jokes," wrote Twinkle. She further wrote, "I'm going...to be a little wiser from now on."
