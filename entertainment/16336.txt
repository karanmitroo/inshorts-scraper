Akshay Kumar-starrer 'Singh is Bliing', which hit the screens on Friday, "is a tiring, immature and half-hearted attempt at filmmaking", wrote HT. The Prabhudheva directorial, also starring Lara Dutta and Amy Jackson, "is a fun-filled affair, only if you choose to abandon your brain", said India Today. The film has been rated 1/5 (HT and NDTV) and 2/5 (India Today).
