Reacting to Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani's demand for 1 lakh public votes to clear the word 'intercourse' without any cuts in Jab Harry Met Sejal, Shah Rukh Khan said his film's makers haven't used disrespectful words to hurt sentiments. He added that when the Censor Board watches the film for certification, they'll understand the context of the word's usage.
