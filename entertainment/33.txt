Bollywood trade analyst Komal Nahta has said his blog on late actress Sridevi and Boney Kapoor, wherein he quoted Boney narrating the details of the night of Sridevi's demise, was not an investigation. He added it was a sequence of all the conversations he had with Boney Kapoor. "It would be wrong to even call it an interview," Nahta added.
