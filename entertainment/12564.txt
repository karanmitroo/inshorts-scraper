Actress Katrina Kaif, while opening up about the failure of her last two releases, the 2015 'Phantom' and the 2016 'Fitoor', has said that she had not given her "100 percent" to the films. "My priorities were slightly different at that point in time... If a person takes things for granted... the film will obviously suffer," Katrina added.
