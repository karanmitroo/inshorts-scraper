Veteran Bollywood actor Dharmendra recently said that if a biopic on him is ever made then superstar Salman Khan should feature in it as he is 'most suitable' for the role. "Salman is a darling… He has some habits like me… You all know Salman and his habits well. He has gone on me," the 79-year-old said.
