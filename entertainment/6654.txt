Reacting to David Beckham making his acting debut in Guy Ritchie's 'King Arthur', a user tweeted, "The only thing I took away from King Arthur is that David Beckham can't act. And I think I already knew that." "Have just seen David Beckham's King Arthur clip. He makes Danny Dyer look like Laurence Olivier," tweeted another user.
