Ayushmann Khurrana, while talking about being bro-zoned by girls as a 'rakhi brother', said, "Friends still have a chance, but if you become a rakhi brother, you are out on a duck." Ayushmann added, "Pre-teen crush is so asexual that you don't mind getting a rakhi tied by her. After hitting teens, you realise- yeh kya galti kar di maine."
