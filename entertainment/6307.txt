Twitter has suspended singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya's account after he used "inappropriate" and "insulting" language in "offensive" tweets directed at female Twitter users including JNU student-activist Shehla Rashid. Abhijeet had previously tweeted, "There is rumour she took money for two hours and didn't satisfy the client... big racket," while referring to Shehla as a prostitute.
