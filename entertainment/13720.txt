Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that actor Salman Khan's remarks, wherein he compared himself to a "raped woman", was a "horrible thing to say". "We all agree that it’s... extremely insensitive", she said. However, the actress added, "[L]et’s not encourage that mentality where we want to point fingers at each other and want to feel greater by running people down".
