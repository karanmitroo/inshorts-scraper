Actor Anupam Kher on Friday said that he pities those criticising his selection for the Padma Bhushan award as a reward from the BJP. He added, "People are criticising me to get attention which they did not have earlier." Kher's alleged ties with the BJP were criticised on social media as being the reason for his Padma Bhushan win.
