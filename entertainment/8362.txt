Hollywood actress Jane Fonda has revealed that she has been fired because she wouldn't sleep with her boss. She added, "I've been raped...sexually abused as a child. I always thought it was my fault. That I didn't do or say the right thing." Notably, Fonda founded the Centre for Adolescent Reproductive Health in 2001, which helps prevent teen pregnancy.
