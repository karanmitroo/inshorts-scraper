American theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who jointly won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, was the scientific consultant and executive producer for the Christopher Nolan film Interstellar. The Caltech professor provided the science behind the wormholes and black hole 'Gargantua' depicted in the movie. Thorne further wrote a book 'The Science of Interstellar', whose foreword was written by Nolan.
