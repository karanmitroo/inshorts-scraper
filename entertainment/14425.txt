The John Malkovich starrer '100 Years' is slated to release in 2115 and thus referred to as 'The Movie You Will Never See'. The film will be locked in a safe and brought to this year's Cannes Film Festival. The safe is reportedly programmed to open automatically in 100 years to ensure that the film remains secure until its premiere.
