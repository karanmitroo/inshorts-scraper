Hollywood studio ABC Tuesday signed Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra to play the lead in its upcoming TV show. Notably, this is the first time that an Indian actress will play a lead role in a US TV show. Before this, 'Lunch Box' actress Nimrat Kaur was roped in for 'Homeland', but that was not for a lead role.
