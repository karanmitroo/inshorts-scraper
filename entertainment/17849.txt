Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan has sung the national anthem for his upcoming film 'Shamitabh'. The song has been filmed at the ancestral home of Rabindranath Tagore, the writer of the anthem. 'Shamitabh' is set to release on Feb 6. However, the decision to include the national anthem in the film was taken just a few days before.
