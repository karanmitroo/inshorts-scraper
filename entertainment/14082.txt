The release of 'Maze Runner: Death Cure' has been postponed to January 12, 2018, from its earlier release date on February 17, 2017. The delay is owing to lead actor Dylan Oâ€™Brien, sustaining serious injuries after an accident during the film's shoot. Notably, the film is the final instalment of the 'Maze Runner' trilogy.
