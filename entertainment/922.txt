On receiving her first Filmfare award for Lifetime Achievement this year, veteran actress Mala Sinha said, "Nowadays there are at least 10-12 award functions...They mean nothing." She added, "My baba (father) always told me I should be happy with the recognition...that I get." She further said, "My best performances in films like 'Dharmputra', 'Dhool Ka Phool'...'Jahan Ara' were never recognised."
