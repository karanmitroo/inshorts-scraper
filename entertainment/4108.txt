Singer Chris Brown, while speaking about physically abusing his ex-girlfriend singer Rihanna, said he felt like a monster. "I look back...I'm just like that's not me. (It's) going to haunt me forever," he added. In 2009, Chris was arrested for physically assaulting Rihanna after she became suspicious of texts he had received from another woman.
