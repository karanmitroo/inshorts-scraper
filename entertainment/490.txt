Actress Kim Cattrall called her 'Sex and the City' co-star Sarah Jessica Parker a "cruel" person while adding, "You are not my family. You are not my friend." She added, "Stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona." Kim was reportedly referring to the recent death of her brother Chris, which Parker discussed at an event.
