After being released from prison, actor Sanjay Dutt requested the media not to write '1993 blasts case' before his name. "I am not a terrorist. I have been acquitted of charges under TADA and conspiracy", he added. "I was in jail under the Arms Act," Dutt asserted. "I waited for this day of azadi (freedom) for 23 years," he added.
