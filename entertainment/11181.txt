The making of Alia Bhatt as a Director of Photography (DOP) in the film 'Dear Zindagi' has been released. "I actually got to operate the camera, shift focus, tilt the camera, zoom in... all of that," said Alia. While thanking DOP Laxman for teaching her the technicalities, Alia added that resting the heavy camera on her shoulders was extremely difficult.
