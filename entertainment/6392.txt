Twitter users have claimed that Katy Perry's new song 'Swish Swish' is about Taylor Swift. Some users also tweeted that it is in response to Swift's 2015 song 'Bad Blood', which is believed to be about Perry. It has been reported that the two singers haven't been friendly, after Swift accused Perry of stealing her dancers for a world tour.
