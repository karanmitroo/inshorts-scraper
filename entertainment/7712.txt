Actress Richa Chadha helped several passengers who were stranded for 18 hours at Abu Dhabi airport when a storm struck UAE leading to delay in flights. She sought help through social media by reaching out to airline authorities. "I did my best... I bought bottles of water for people that didn't have local currency using my credit card," said Richa.
