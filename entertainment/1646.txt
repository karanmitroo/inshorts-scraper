According to reports, the medical reports of television actor Piyush Sahdev suggest that he is guilty of rape. Piyush, who is known for starring in shows like 'Devon Ke Dev...Mahadev' and 'Beyhadh', was arrested by the Mumbai police in November after an actress alleged that she was raped by him. His bail application was also rejected by the court recently.
