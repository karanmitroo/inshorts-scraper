Cartoonist Aseem Trivedi, who shot into fame for his controversial cartoon on anti-corruption in 2011, has said that accepting the offer of the reality show Bigg Boss was his biggest mistake. "I thought I would use the show to propagate my views, but exactly the opposite happened. They used me to ratchet up the show's TRP," he added.
