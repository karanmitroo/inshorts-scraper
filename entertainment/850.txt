Condemning the attack on a school bus in Gurugram over 'Padmaavat', Farhan Akhtar tweeted, "Attacking a school bus is not an agitation. It's terrorism." "Aren't you all ashamed to trade our children's safety for your vote bank politics," wrote Prakash Raj. Shirish Kunder tweeted, "Whatever little honour was left, has also been lost by attacking a school bus of children."
