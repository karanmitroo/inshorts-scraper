A day after a parody Bobby Deol account was suspended by Twitter over a tweet making fun of 'AAP', '#ISupportBobbyDeol' was a top Twitter trend in India on Saturday. A user reacted by tweeting, "@TwitterIndia please unblock @thebobbydeol account. Light humour is always acceptable #isupportbobbydeol". "We need better Twitter rules to save Parody accounts. #ISupportBobbyDeol", read another tweet.
