Actress Rakhi Sawant recently asked reporters not to compare her with Sunny Leone but with international icons Jennifer Lopez and Madonna. When asked if her comeback song will give tough competition to Leone, she said, "Please don't compare me with Sunny Leone because I have achieved (my popularity) by dancing... I never did any adult film to achieve this."
