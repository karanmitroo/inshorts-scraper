The Bombay High Court has put a stay on the release of Raveena Tandon's film 'Maatr'. This comes after a private financial institution petitioned against the film's producer Anjum Rizvi. The institution has claimed that Rizvi owes it an amount of â‚¹2 crore. It had reportedly given the loan to Rizvi in 2014 for a film which never released.
