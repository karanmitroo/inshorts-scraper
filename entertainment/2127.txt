Rajput organisation Karni Sena has threatened that they will thrash lyricist Javed Akhtar on the streets if he comes to Rajasthan over his remark on Rajputs. Akhtar, while speaking about the row on 'Padmavati', had said, "The Rajputs and the Rajwadas never fought against the British and now they are taking to the streets against a film and a filmmaker."
