Actress Alia Bhatt, while speaking on PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation move, said that people will have to be "patient". She said it is a "big change" which will have "some repercussions". "It's easier said than done. The people who have had that kind of loose cash, (for them) it's not available anymore or it's lesser available," added Alia.
