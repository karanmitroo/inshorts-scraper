Veteran filmmaker Shyam Benegal, while commenting on the ongoing protests against the release of 'Padmavati', said, "It's being done to consolidate the Rajput vote." He added, "By raking up the 'Padmavati' non-issue, the Karni Sena hopes to...unite them (Rajputs) over an utterly irrelevant crisis." He further said that people should wait for 'Padmavati' to release and then pass their verdict.
