Manoj Bajpayee retweeted a tweet shared by a journalist who took a dig on Akshay Kumar postponing Pad Man's release. However, Bajpayee later deleted his retweet. The original tweet read, "Under the fear of getting crushed, you (Akshay) moved, then said we gave way to others." Pad Man's release date was postponed to February 9 to avoid clash with 'Padmaavat'.
