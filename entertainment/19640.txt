Aamna Shariff (of Kahin toh hoga fame)and film distributor-turned-produced Amit Kapoor recently got engaged, after being in a relationship for a year. Aamna- who also dated Aftab Shivdasani briefly- was last seen in Hongey Judaa na hum, which didn't do well. Amit is the son of producer Shabnam Kapoor, who had launched SRK. They will tie the knot in December.
