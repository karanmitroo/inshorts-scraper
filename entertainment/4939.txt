Filmmaker Karan Johar said that he is deeply regretful about bringing up Kangana Ranaut's name at IIFA 2017, while adding, "I think we went a bit too far with the Kangana mention." Johar added, "I don't believe that 'nepotism rocks'...only talent rocks." He further said, "I will not speak about nepotism nor Kangana because it would be disrespectful to her."
