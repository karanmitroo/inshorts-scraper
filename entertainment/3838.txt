Veteran scriptwriter Salim Khan has said his son Salman Khan is not a character actor but a star and he has to live with the image. Talking about 'Tubelight' not doing well at the box office, Salim said, "To have an action hero like Salman getting constantly beaten up and crying all the time just didn't work with the audience."
