Wajid Khan, a lawyer from Pune, reportedly filed an FIR against actor Ranveer Singh and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali on Friday. He alleged that the shooting of the movie Bajirao Mastani was being carried out without proper authorisation and that when he tried to object to it, the bouncers manhandled and pushed him.
