Actor Varun Dhawan's pants got torn while he was dancing with a contestant on the sets of television reality show 'Indian Idol'. Host Karan Wahi hauled Varun over his shoulders and carried him off the stage after the wardrobe malfunction. After changing, Varun came back on stage with the torn pant dangling on his neck and also tried auctioning them.
