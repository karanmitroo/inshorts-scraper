Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt in an open letter on actor Kamaal R Khan (KRK) has said that he will get 'filthy' to fight KRK, whom he referred to as 'filth'. Vikram has recently served a defamation notice to KRK. The actor's response to the legal notice was to further allege that Vikram was a pimp trying to "supply" actress Meera Chopra.
