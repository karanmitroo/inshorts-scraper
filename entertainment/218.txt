Actor Anupam Kher had pretended to be Sridevi's long-lost sister Prabhadevi by posing for the cover of Cine Blitz magazine as part of an April Fool's prank in 1991. Sridevi, who was told of the prank beforehand, said, "I found it really very funny... Anupamji's make-up was really mind blowing." This particular Cine Blitz issue was sold out.
