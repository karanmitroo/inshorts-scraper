Reacting to censor board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani's 'cheap publicity stunt' comment, 'Aligarh' director Hansal Mehta on Monday said, "I'd rather sell underwear on streets than use Nihalani for publicity." Mehta added that he was upset 'Aligarh' did not get the certificate it deserved. Nihalani had termed Mehta's opposition to granting an A-certificate to Aligarh's trailer as "cheap publicity stunt".
