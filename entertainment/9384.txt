Actor Pulkit Samrat allegedly attacked a media photographer outside a family court in Mumbai on Monday. "He threatened us...grabbed me by my collar. His security guards and lawyer... punched us," claimed the photographer. Samrat was at the court in connection with his ongoing divorce proceedings from estranged wife Shweta Rohira. The couple, who got married in 2014, separated in 2015.
