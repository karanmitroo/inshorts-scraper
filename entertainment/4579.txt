TV actress Ridhima Pandit, known for playing a humanoid robot on the show 'Bahu Hamari Rajni Kant', has said she will not play "crappy roles like the heroine's behen" in films. Ridhima added, "My demand is more on television. If I can be the queen on TV, why should I go and become a princess in films?"
