Actress Richa Chadha has said that she gets paid equal to her male co-stars and she is quite happy with that. "I do understand that Deepika (Padukone) or Anushka (Sharma) might feel that they are not paid at par with their actors because they are superstars. I don't think it happens at my level," said Richa.
