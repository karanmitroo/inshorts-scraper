To watch the trailer of the Sunny Leone starrer Ragini MMS-2 on YouTube, one needs to log-in to confirm that they are above 18. The move by YouTube has surprised the producers as their earlier films like 'Love, Sex aur Dhokha' didn't encounter any such roadblock. The trailer comes with an interesting disclaimer - 'Some scenes might not contain nudity.'
