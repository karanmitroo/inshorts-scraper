Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobarâ€™s son Sebastian Marroquin has slammed Netflix original series 'Narcos' for glorifying criminals and showing drug trafficking as glamorous. He added, "The show has turned my father into a hero...giving young people the idea that it is cool to be a drug trafficker." Notably, the show's third season is set in the aftermath of Escobar's death.
