Actor Aditya Roy Kapur has said that actors stay mum on rumours because they don't want the world to make a tamasha out of their lives. "In this industry, no matter what you do, your relationship status ends up being the most talked about thing," he added. Aditya has recently been linked with actresses Katrina Kaif and Shraddha Kapoor.
