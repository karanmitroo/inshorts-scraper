Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that the Censor Board misunderstood the context in which the word 'intercourse' has been used in 'Jab Harry Met Sejal'. He added, "We respect CBFC a lot...[but] I don't think there's anything objectionable in the scene." This comes after one lakh votes were received online to clear 'intercourse' on CBFC chief's Pahlaj Nihalani's demand.
