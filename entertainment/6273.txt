Actor Arjun Kapoor said that films are made for audience and not for a limited bunch of people who call themselves critics. "The audience is more open to giving the film space and time to enjoy what it is meant for rather than having preconceived notions," added Arjun. He further said that audience is the most important part of filmmaking.
