Saif Ali Khan has said that the remark on nepotism at IIFA 2017, which had a reference to actress Kangana Ranaut, was just a joke. "But now I feel had we given it more thought, we could've really finished this ongoing public discourse on nepotism more decisively," he added. Saif further said he respects Kangana for what she has achieved.
