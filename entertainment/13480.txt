Actor John Cho has confirmed that his character 'Hikaru Sulu' in Star Trek Beyond is gay. "I liked the approach... which is where I hope we are going as a species, to not politicize oneâ€™s personal orientations," said Cho. The decision to portray the character as gay was to acknowledge openly gay actor George Takei, who earlier played 'Sulu'.
