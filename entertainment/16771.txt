Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's recently launched 'selfie with daughter' campaign, critically acclaimed actress Richa Chadda has said that women's problems cannot be solved by selfie or anything like that. "It was a sweet initiative... there is no harm, but I thought it's an urban initiative... meant for those who have smartphones with them," the 'Gangs of Wasseypur' actress added.
