A local court in Hyderabad has directed Bollywood film producer Karim Morani, who was booked for allegedly raping a Delhi-based woman, to surrender before the Hayathnagar police before March 22. The court cancelled his bail based on the prosecution's arguments. Morani is the co-producer of Shah Rukh Khan's films like 'Dilwale', 'Happy New Year', 'Chennai Express' and 'Ra.One'.
