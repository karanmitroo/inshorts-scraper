Choreographer Vaibhavi Merchant took to Twitter to mock Filmfare Awards 2017 for nominating Salman Khan in the 'Best Choreography' category for the song 'Jag Ghoomeya' from 'Sultan', instead of her. "Why not nominate me as best actor for Sultan if you cud nominate my dearest Salman for best choreographer Jag ghumeya..@filmfare," she tweeted.
