The Australian National Imams Council (ANIC) has backed a campaign to produce an alternative to popular British animated series Peppa Pig, which would be set in a "predominantly Muslim town" and support Islamic values. The ANIC has urged parents to raise $15,000 (over â‚¹10 lakh) to produce Barakah Hills, a "halal cartoon series" proposed as a Muslim alternative.
