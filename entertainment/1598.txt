Talking about Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, the director of 'Raees' Rahul Dholakia said, "Somewhere I feel we have wronged her. Our people forgot that she is an artist, not the enemy!" Mahira, who made her Bollywood debut with 'Raees', had not been permitted to promote the film. This was following a call for ban on Pakistani artistes in India.
