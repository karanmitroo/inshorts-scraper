Karan Johar has said his 2016 directorial 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' is the only film of his that he's completely satisfied with. "That's one film I wouldn't change anything about," he added. Speaking about his other films, Johar further said, "I think there are some cringe-worthy scenes in 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...' is probably too long."
