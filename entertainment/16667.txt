The basic premise of Riteish Deshmukh and Pulkit Samrat starrer 'Bangistan', released this Friday, is interesting in itself, wrote TOI. The comedy film, also starring Jacqueline Fernandez, is a mild, wacky satire on the futility of religious bigotry and does not make too much sense, said NDTV. It has been rated 3/5 (TOI, Mid-Day), 2/5 (NDTV) and 1.5/5 (India Today).
