The much awaited Nana Patekar-starrer 'Ab Tak Chhappan 2', which hit the screens Friday, is a poor sequel of a gripping original, says TOI. The Aejaz Gulab directorial ended up as a waste because of predictable plot, sleep-inducing screenplay and repetitive dialogues, added TOI. The film has been rated 1/5 (Indian Express), 1.5/5 (India Today), 2/5 (TOI) and 2.5/5 (HT).
