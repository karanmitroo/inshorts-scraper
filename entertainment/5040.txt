Actor Vivek Oberoi has said that if his phone still rings to inform about work for him in films, he feels successful. Speaking about his films which didn't perform well at the box-office, he said, "If I start spending time analysing my choices, I won't be able to live my life." Vivek added that success or failure is very relative.
