Assam's Tourism Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has defended actress Priyanka Chopra's outfit on Assam Tourism calendar. "A section of Congress legislators in Assam are trying to get cheap publicity out of the issue," said Sarma. He further questioned, "When we receive felicitation on a stage do we go wearing dhoti, the traditional dress of Assam or wearing pants and shirts?"
