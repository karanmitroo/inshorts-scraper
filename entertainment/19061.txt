Actress Vidya Balan has clarified that her opting out of Sujoy Ghosh's next thriller 'Durga Rani Singh', had nothing to do with pregnancy as she is not pregnant yet. Ever since her marriage to Siddharth Roy Kapur, she had not taken a break and so she has reportedly decided to give herself a couple of months to just holiday.
