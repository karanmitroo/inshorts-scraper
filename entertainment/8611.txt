According to reports, Prince Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, is planning to move to the US following his wedding to American actress Meghan Markle. "It's a logical step for the Royals, too, because he'll be able to up their reputation abroad while still fulfilling duties back at home and overseas," a source was quoted as saying.
