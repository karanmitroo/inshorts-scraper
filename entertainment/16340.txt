Actress Priyanka Chopra on Monday said that the clash of her upcoming film 'Bajirao Mastani' with Shah Rukh Khan's 'Dilwale' was unfortunate. However, Priyanka, who claims to be one of the biggest fans of SRK, added that she thinks both the films will do well as both are different from each other. "I wish luck to team Dilwale," she said.
