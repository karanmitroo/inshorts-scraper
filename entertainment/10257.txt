Actor Anupam Kher in a Facebook post has urged people to take action to stop the carnage against the innocent children in Aleppo, Syria. "I was horrified and stunned at the brutalities," wrote Kher while sharing a video from Aleppo, where the Syrian government and rebel forces are fighting. "We cannot abandon them (the children) to their fates," added Kher.
