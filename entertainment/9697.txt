Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has penned a letter supporting Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes, in which she criticised US President-elect Donald Trump for imitating a disabled reporter. "What you said was great. It needed to be said, you said it beautifully," he wrote. "It is so important that we all speak up," read the letter's concluding lines.
