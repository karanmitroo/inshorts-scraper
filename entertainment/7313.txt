Vidya Balan has said that although she doesn't abuse in real life, she quite enjoyed abusing in the film 'Begum Jaan'. However, she added that she would abuse people when she got groped or pinched on the train she took during her college days. "I have turned around and slapped people and abused them. Angrezi, Hindi jo ho," said Vidya.
