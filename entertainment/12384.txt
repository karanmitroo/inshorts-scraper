Salman Khan will produce a biopic on Somen Banerjee, which will revolve around male striptease artistes. Banerjee was the founder of the male strip club 'Chippendales', who committed suicide in a Downtown jail in October 1994. "The story of Somen Banerjee has all the shades of a gangster film-raw greed, power and violence," said Amar Butala of Salman's production house.
