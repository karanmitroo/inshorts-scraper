Actor Akshay Kumar has said that Twinkle Khanna still tells actress Rani Mukerji "Teri zindagi maine banayi", after Twinkle rejected the role of 'Tina' in the 1998 Karan Johar directorial 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. "She read the script...didn't understand it....(and) she had actually thrown the script, and called it sh*t!" added Akshay.
