Actress Richa Chadha has said she feels sad for those who think she and Ali Fazal are faking their relationship to promote their film 'Fukrey Returns'. "Ali and I never wanted to talk about [our relationship] publicly because we knew this is how people would react," she added. Richa further said people should use their brains before passing comments.
