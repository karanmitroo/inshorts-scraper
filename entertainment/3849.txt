Comedian Kiku Sharda, in a reference to Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh who is known for his 'MSG' films, tweeted, "Enjoying a peaceful Chinese meal with no monosodium glutamate (MSG)." Kiku's tweet was in response to Twinkle's article where she wrote the comedian should enjoy an MSG-free meal while taking a dig at Ram Rahim being convicted for rape.
