Aamir Khan had reportedly offered a sum of Rs 8 Crore to "Oh My God" (OMG) director Umesh Shukla to stop shooting the film. When Aamir and team PK learnt that the storyline of "OMG" is similar to that of "PK", they approached Shukla to discuss the matter. Both the films show people's blind faith in religion, god and godmen.
