Zack Snyder has stepped down as the director of superhero film Justice League to support his family following his daughter's suicide in March. Snyder said he hadn't planned on making the news public earlier but as he was required to shoot for the film in UK, he decided to step down. Avengers director Joss Whedon will direct the remaining scenes.
