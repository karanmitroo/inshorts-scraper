One person died of suffocation while two policemen were injured when actor Shah Rukh Khan's arrival caused a stampede at the Vadodara railway station on Monday night. The stampede occurred when the August Kranti Express, in which Shah Rukh was travelling from Mumbai to Delhi to promote 'Raees', halted at the station. Police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the crowd.
