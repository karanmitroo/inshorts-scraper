Actress Kangana Ranaut was the showstopper for designer Manav Gangwani, who presented his collection 'Begum-e-Jannat', on the final day of the India Couture Week. Kangana wore a maroon embroidered lehenga paired with an off-shoulder choli and a mesh duppatta for the show. "She (Kangana) exudes... a classic yet modern vibe that sets perfectly with my collection this year," said Gangwani.
