Actress Kangana Ranaut has said she will break up with her boyfriend if he is not patriotic. "I love my country. If he can't be dedicated towards his motherland, I don't think he would be dedicated towards me," she added. Last year, the actress had said that she is in a relationship and wants to get married.
