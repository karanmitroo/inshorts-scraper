Singer Sona Mohapatra has slammed Vidya Balan for her comment on sexual harassment faced by women. Vidya had said she has never been propositioned in 12 years of her career. "I've not given anyone the space to say something remotely uncomfortable to me...I made sure I didn't come across as...someone who was desperate to do a job," she had added.
