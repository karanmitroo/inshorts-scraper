Despite reports of below average reviews, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor starrer “ABCD 2” has become the highest opener of 2015. The film reportedly collected Rs. 14.30 crore on Friday to cross the figures of “Gabbar is Back” (Rs 13.05 crore) and “Dil Dhadakne Do” (Rs 10.53 crore). This is also the highest opening yet for a Varun Dhawan film.
