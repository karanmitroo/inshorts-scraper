Malaika Arora Khan has said she'll jump right at the opportunity of doing an item song in 'Dabangg 3'. "It's always been a wonderful association. So, whenever there is something (that comes my way in the Dabangg franchise), I'd do it without batting an eyelid," added Malaika. She further said that Arbaaz Khan refuses to reveal anything about 'Dabangg 3'.
