Two of the four historians named by Rajput organisation Karni Sena in a panel to watch 'Padmaavat' have said the film doesn't hurt sentiments of any community. The historians, however, said it was their personal opinion. Before the film's release, Karni Sena had appointed four historians in the six-member panel and demanded that the film should be screened for them.
