Actress Ileana D'Cruz has said that she keeps joking how she was the "Akshay Kumar of South" Indian film industry as she used to do four films a year. Akshay is known to work on multiple films in a single year. "I was just signing films, there wasn't this thing of 'wanting to do good work'," added Ileana.
