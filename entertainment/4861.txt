The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) will be honouring Priyanka Chopra at a fundraiser event on September 6, a day before the festival's 42nd edition begins. The actress will be honoured for her activism, which includes her role as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. Last year, Priyanka was part of the jury for a short film competition at TIFF.
