Jason Momoa, known for playing 'Khal Drogo' on HBO series 'Game of Thrones', has apologised for a rape joke made by him in 2011 during a Comic-Con panel. Talking about the science-fiction and fantasy genre, Jason had said, "There're so many things you can do...rip someone's tongue out of their throat and get away with it and rape beautiful women."
