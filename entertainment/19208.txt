Sex siren Sunny Leone's designer lingerie has been reportedly stolen from the sets of Ragini MMS-2. The producers had to order another one quickly for INR 50000 as it had to be used again in the shot. A similar incident had taken place on the sets of ‘Kya Super Kool Hain Hum’ where Sarah Dias's designer lingerie went missing.
