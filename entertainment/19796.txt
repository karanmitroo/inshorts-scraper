Director Lawrence D'Souza is all set to make a sequel of his 1991 hit film 'Saajan', which  starred Sanjay Dutt, Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan. "The scripting is done. The basic idea of the film is the same- a love triangle- two heroes and a heroine. We would go with a younger lot of known actors," D'Souza told.
