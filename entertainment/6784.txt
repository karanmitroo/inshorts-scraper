A Royal Enfield engine was used to power the battlefield chariot used by actor Rana Daggubati in 'Baahubali'. "[The] chariot was built around a Royal Enfield engine so that it would get... power and speed... It also had proper car steering and a driver," said production designer Sabu Cyril. The chariot also featured a revolving saw blade at the front.
