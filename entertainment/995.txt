Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn has offered to donate $100,000 to US President Donald Trump's favourite charity if "he'll step on an accurate scale with an impartial medical professional". This comes after White House physician Ronny Jackson said Trump "is healthy and will remain so for the duration of his presidency", following his first physical examination in office.
