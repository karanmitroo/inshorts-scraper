Speaking about the criticism against the sex scenes on HBO series 'Game of Thrones', actress Emilia Clarke said, "People f*ck for pleasure - it's part of life." "I'm starting to get really annoyed about this stuff now because people say, 'Oh, yeah, all the porn sites went down when Game of Thrones came back on'," she added.
