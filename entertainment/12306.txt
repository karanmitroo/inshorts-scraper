Actor Harshvardhan Kapoor, who will make his Bollywood debut with 'Mirzya', has said that Aamir Khan is his inspiration. "Aamir Khan was a very big influence... when my generation was growing up. That time actors were doing so many films at a time... he decided to work more in isolation and focus on one thing at a time," added Harshvardhan.
