Actor Rohit Roy, while discussing about Justin Bieber lip-syncing at his India concert, said, "I mean he was chewing gum and drinking water while singing some songs...it was pretty obvious!" However, Rohit added, "But he tends to do this in some songs, which are layered with his own voice as backup." He further said teens didn't care about the lip-syncing.
