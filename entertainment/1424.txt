Reality television personality Kim Kardashian tweeted a picture where mostly the women and children of her family were seen, which she captioned, "DAY 24- CHRISTMAS EVE." Twitter users speculated that Kim's half-sister Kylie Jenner was missing from the picture because she's pregnant. "Kylie will show up in tomorrow's picture with her baby bump. I...know it," read a comment.
