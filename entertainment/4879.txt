'Lipstick Under My Burkha' director Alankrita Shrivastava has said the censors have a problem with female point of view, while adding, "They're...not comfortable with something that questions...the status quo." She also said that the male perspective which dominates popular culture, has led to discrimination against women and "makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment...abuse of women okay".
