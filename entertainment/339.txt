Talking about the possibility of same release date for 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' and his film 'Gold', Akshay Kumar said, "Yeh clash kya hota hai...You guys use this term as if we're fighting with each other." He added, "We have only 52 weeks...it's not possible for each film to have solo release dates...some films will have to release together."
