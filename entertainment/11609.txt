Actor Amitabh Bachchan (Big B) has said that he feels guilty to see women fasting for their husband's long life on the festival of 'Karva Chauth', celebrated by Hindus. However, he added, "[I]t is a joy to see the devotion and care they (women) take over this festive moment." Amitabh married his 'Zanjeer' co-star Jaya Bhaduri on June 3, 1973.
