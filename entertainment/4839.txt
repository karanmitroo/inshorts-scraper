The upcoming North America tour of rock band Linkin Park, which was scheduled to begin next week, has been cancelled after its lead vocalist Chester Bennington's demise earlier this week. Bennington reportedly committed suicide at his California residence. Formed in 1996, Linkin Park have sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.
