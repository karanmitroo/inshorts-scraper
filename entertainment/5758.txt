All Eyez On Me, the biopic on late rapper Tupac (2Pac) Shakur, "takes us through issues far beyond the realm of music," wrote Hindustan Times. "The... Biggie vs Tupac rivalry is given very little attention," wrote Times Of India while Deccan Chronicle wrote the film had a "poor script". It was rated 3/5 (HT), 2.5/5 (TOI) and 1.5/5 (Deccan Chronicle).
