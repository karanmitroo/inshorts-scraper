Karan Johar said in a note shared on Twitter that he was terrified when he got to know that his twins had health complications, and were underweight due to their premature birth. The twins, Yash and Roohi, were born via surrogacy. While Yash has been named after Johar's father, Roohi is an anagram of his mother's name Hiroo.
