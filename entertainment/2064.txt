Actor Rajesh Khattar, while defending his son Ishaan Khatter against nepotism, said, "There are superstars whose sons are sitting at home and are nowhere." He added, "In Bollywood, what you are selling is yourself. You're the product yourself. If you are not accepted, where will nepotism come?" "You are a star only when the public accepts you," Rajesh further said.
