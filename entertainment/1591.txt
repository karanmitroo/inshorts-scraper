Responding to her upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding' being called a chick flick, actress Sonam Kapoor said, "Don't call it that! It's so bad. There's no such thing as chick flicks." "Do you call a hero's film a stud film? No, right? It's so tacky," she added. Sonam further said 'Veere Di Wedding' is about coming-of-age of women at large.
