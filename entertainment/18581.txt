Priyanka Chorpra's upcoming biopic 'Mary Kom' is unlikely to release in the boxer's hometown, Manipur. The movie, which is a tribute to Mary Kom, will not be screened in Manipur theatres because the state is witnessing a ban on Hindi movies and Hindi TV shows since 2000, according to reports. The movie is set to release on Sept-5.
