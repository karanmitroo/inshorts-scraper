Actress Priyanka Chopra has revealed that she and designer Ralph Lauren's team came up with the idea of removing the 20-foot train from her Met Gala outfit for the after-party three days before the event. After she expressed her concern, Ralph Lauren decided to make a short mini dress under the trench-coat gown. "That was pure genius," added Priyanka.
