Actors Anil and Uday, who drowned on Monday while shooting for Kannada film 'Masti Gudi', had admitted to not being good swimmers, minutes before diving into the lake. "I know a little bit of swimming, but first time Iâ€™m jumping from a height. So that makes me a bit nervous", Anil said. "I'm not a good swimmer either", added Uday.
