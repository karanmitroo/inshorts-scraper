Megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who unveiled the trailer for 'Broken Horses' along with Aamir Khan on Tuesday, says that if given an opportunity to choose between a Bollywood and a Hollywood film, he would pick the former. Echoing the same sentiment, Aamir said, "My relation with my country is very deep and that'll never fade away... Emotionally I am very rooted."
