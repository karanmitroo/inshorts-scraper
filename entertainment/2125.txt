Filmmaker Rahul Rawail has been appointed as the acting chief of the jury for the Indian Panorama section of International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2017 after Sujoy Ghosh's resignation. Sujoy resigned from the post following the controversy over the removal of two films from the final selection. "I'm honoured to be doing the job," said Rawail.
