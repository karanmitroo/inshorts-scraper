Car-maker Porsche has blamed late actor Paul Walker for his accidental death in November 2013 and said Walker knew his car had been “abused and altered” as well as “misused and improperly maintained”. Porsche was replying to a "wrongful death lawsuit" filed by Walker's daughter Meadow Walker who alleged that 2005 Carrera GT had “history of instability and control issues”.
