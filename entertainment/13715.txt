Actress Selma Blair on Monday was removed from a flight after an outburst where she reportedly started shouting statements like "He burns my private parts... He beats me. Heâ€™s going to kill me". Selma was returning from a holiday with her son and ex-partner. She later apologised, attributing her outburst to consuming a mix of alcohol with medication.
