Actress Anushka Sharma has said that she was less affected by the failure of her 2015 film 'Bombay Velvet' as compared to the film's lead actor Ranbir Kapoor. She added, "But it's also because 'Bombay Velvet' was Johnny's [Ranbir's character] film more than Rosie's [Anushka's character]." Anushka further said Ranbir being targeted for the film's failure was unfair.
