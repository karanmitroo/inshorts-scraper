HBO on Saturday confirmed that their series 'Game of Thrones' will end with season eight in 2018. “[T]hey (the makers) have a very specific plan about the number of seasons they want to do,” said HBO's new programming president Casey Bloys. However, he added that if it was his decision, he would get the makers to create "10 more seasons".
