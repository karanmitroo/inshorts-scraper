Actress Anushka Sharma, in an interview to a fashion magazine, said that she has had only one "really big flop" film in her career, which is 2015 period crime-drama 'Bombay Velvet'. Commenting on box office success, she said, "The general advice is to do as many films as possible because you never know what works."
