Twinkle Khanna and Chetan Bhagat have indulged in a Twitter war, which started with Khanna mocking Bhagat judging a dance reality-show. "He gets to judge NachBaliye and I get to judge if that gross thing on my floor is dog puke or poop...", she tweeted. To this, Bhagat replied, "...how do u tell the difference between the two anyway?"
