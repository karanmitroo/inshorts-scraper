Actor Shah Rukh Khan has been given a clean chit by the Mumbai police in connection with a brawl at the Wankhede stadium after an IPL match in 2012. The investigation showed that no 'cognisable offence' was registered against him. The complaint was filed by a local activist, who sought action against SRK for abusing security personnel of the stadium.
