Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her when she was 16. "I kept it to myself...I didnâ€™t want my father to do something that might cause him to go to prison (for life)," she said. Notably, Polanski had fled the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl.
