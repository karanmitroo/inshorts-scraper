Shah Rukh Khan revealed that sometimes, he travels in his car's trunk to meet friends. He also said that though it isn't irritating to see fans outside his house, few things have to be given up. "If my family wants to have dinner, better I don't accompany them as people come...we'll do pictures, one will lead to ten...," SRK explained.
