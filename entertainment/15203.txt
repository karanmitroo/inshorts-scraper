Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha has said that actor Sanjay Dutt, who recently completed his jail term, should follow the path of Gandhigiri which he preached in his 2006 film 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'. Sinha tweeted, "Relieved with release of Sanjay, a dear family friend. Feel happier for late and great Sunil Dutt a true Indian and a staunch nationalist."
