Karni Sena activists on Wednesday unknowingly set fire to their fellow activist's car to protest against the release of the film 'Padmaavat' in Madhya Pradesh's capital Bhopal. Police detained six people in connection with the incident. However, several activists gathered outside the police station demanding the police to not register a case as the car owner wasn't pressing any charges.
