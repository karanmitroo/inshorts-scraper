Popcorn, which became popular during the 1880s, was not allowed inside theatres due to its 'crunchy' sound and to prevent people from littering the place. However, when talkie movies were released, vendors began to sell popcorn outside the theatres. Coinciding with the Great Depression, people wanted cheap entertainment and snacks, and thus, vendors were allowed to sell popcorn in theatres.
