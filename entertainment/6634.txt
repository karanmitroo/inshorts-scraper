Canadian singer Justin Bieber was mistaken for Indian rapper-singer Honey Singh by underprivileged kids during his recent visit to India. In a video which has surfaced online, kids can be heard shouting, "Yo Yo Honey Singh aayo hai," as Bieber interacts with them on a bus. Bieber met the kids before his maiden concert in India on Wednesday.
