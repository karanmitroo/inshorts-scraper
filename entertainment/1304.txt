Late singer Amy Winehouse's father Mitch has claimed that her spirit often pays him a visit in the form of a ghost. "After three years I was thinking...she'll come back in some shape...and she does come back? Not physically, but spiritually all the time," said Mitch. Amy, who is known for songs like 'Rehab', passed away on July 23, 2011.
