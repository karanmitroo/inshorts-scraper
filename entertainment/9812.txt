Filmmaker Karan Johar, in his biography 'An Unsuitable Boy', has said everybody knows his sexual orientation and he doesn't need to scream it out. "I won't only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this," he added. Karan also discusses being traumatised by rumours about him and Shah Rukh Khan in the book.
