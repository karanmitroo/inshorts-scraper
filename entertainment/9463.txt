Aamir Khan received 'Thank You' letters from theatre owners, expressing their thoughts on 'Dangal', which saved them from running out of business. While one letter said that "good cinema" will bring people to theatres, another letter requests Aamir Khan to make more family films like 'Dangal'. The theatre owners revealed they were on the verge of shutting down their theatres.
