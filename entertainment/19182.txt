In a generous move, superstar Salman Khan has reportedly given a cheque of Rs 1 lakh to each and every member (amounting to Rs 2 crore altogether) of 'Jai Ho' cast and crew to thank them for their efforts. The kind gesture comes despite the fact that his movie 'Jai Ho' didn't do well as expected at the box-office.
