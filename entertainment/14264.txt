Model Chloe Goins has named Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby in a fresh lawsuit where she has alleged that the Playboy founder "conspired" with Cosby to drug and sexually assault her. The incident reportedly took place when she was a teenage dancer at Hefner's Playboy mansion in 2008. Notably, Goins had in February voluntarily withdrawn a lawsuit against Cosby.
