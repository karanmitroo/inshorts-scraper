Indo-Canadian Sikh comedian Jasmeet Singh, known on the internet as 'JusReign', was forced to remove his turban at a US airport during a security check. Singh was also denied a mirror to tie back his turban. This comes two weeks after a Sikh-American actor was denied permission to board a flight in Mexico after he refused to remove his turban.
