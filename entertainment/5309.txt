Actor Ranbir Kapoor, while speaking about his cousin Aadar Jain being launched by Yash Raj Films, said the platform he has will spark a debate about nepotism. He added that he's nervous about how Aadar will be accepted as it is a funny industry. Aadar, who is Raj Kapoor's grandson, previously assisted filmmaker Karan Johar in 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'.
