Actress Kangana Ranaut has sent a legal notice to T-series asking them to stop the release of her film 'I Love NY'. The film, also featuring Sunny Deol, was originally scheduled to release in February 2013 but got delayed for unknown reasons. Kangana fears the film would harm her name and image as its trailer had received a poor response.
