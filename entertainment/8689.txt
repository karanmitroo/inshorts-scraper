Following the alleged molestation of a Malayalam actress, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday said Kerala had become cultured and educated, but was losing its values. "This is an India-wide problem and that it is now happening in Kerala too is very sad," he added. Tharoor also slammed people's mentality where people shamed the victim while the accused remained scot-free.
