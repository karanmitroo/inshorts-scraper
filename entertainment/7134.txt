Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that she can't speak for anyone else, but personally, she loves the sound of Azaan. She added, "That's not to say that what Sonu Nigam said shouldn't be considered, whatever he said is his opinion and he should be respected for that." Sonu tweeted about "forced religiousness" and complained about being woken up by Azaan.
