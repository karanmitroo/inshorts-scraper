The World Health Organisation (WHO) has asked all countries to introduce age-classified ratings for films and other entertainment programmes with tobacco imagery. The suggestion has been given to prevent the younger generation from taking up the habit of smoking. The WHO reports cited that 46% of PG-13 (inappropriate for children under 13) certified Hollywood films had smoking scenes.
