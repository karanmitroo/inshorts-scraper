Pakistani actor Osman Khalid Butt recreated Ranbir Kapoor and Mahira Khan's picture of smoking together, which recently went viral. Mahira had been criticised on social media for wearing a dress and smoking. Sharing the picture on Twitter, Osman questioned society's double standards for slamming a woman for smoking while men are never criticised for doing the same.
