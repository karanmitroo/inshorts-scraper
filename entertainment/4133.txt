Social media accounts of American TV network HBO and its shows including Game of Thrones were hacked on Wednesday by a hacking group named OurMine. This came after other hackers released Game of Thrones scripts and company data, demanding an undisclosed amount of ransom. Notably, OurMine previously hacked Twitter accounts of Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Wikipedia Co-founder Jimmy Wales.
