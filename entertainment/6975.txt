Reality television personality Caitlyn Jenner has said that she felt sorry for her daughter Kendall Jenner, who featured in the Pepsi advertisement which was pulled later as it was criticised for 'trivialising' political resistance. "[W]hen it came out online, I [said,] "That is so cool"... I didn't see some of the things that obviously some other people saw," added Caitlyn.
