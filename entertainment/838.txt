Eighteen people were arrested for attacking a school bus full of students in Gurugram on Wednesday over the row on the film 'Padmaavat'. The accused will be brought to Sohna Court later today. Rajput organisation Karni Sena was earlier being blamed for the attack, where stones were pelted at the school bus, but the organisation has denied these claims.
