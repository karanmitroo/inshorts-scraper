As the Maharashtra government Tuesday banned sale and possession of beef in the state, Bollywood celebrities criticized this move on Twitter. Actress Raveena Tandon tweeted, "My only take on beef issue that it should not be enforced, it should be optional...". Similarly, Farhan Akhtar wrote, "...you can have a beef with someone, but you can't have beef with someone".
