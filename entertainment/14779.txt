A video from the sets of the film 'The Jungle Book', without any special effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI), has been released. The film, set in a forest, was shot on a soundstage in Los Angeles. The video explains how actor Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, had to pretend he was talking to animals, which were later generated using CGI.
