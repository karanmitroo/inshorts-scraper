Actor Ranbir Kapoor has apologised for the removal of Govinda's role in his upcoming film 'Jagga Jasoos'. He said, "It's very irresponsible...very unfair to cast a great legend like Govinda and not give justice to his role." Ranbir added that removing Govinda's role is his and director Anurag Basu's fault as they started the film without a complete script.
