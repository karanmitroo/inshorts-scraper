Police in Ireland has launched an investigation into alleged blasphemous statements made by English comedian and actor Stephen Fry during a 2015 interview on Irish television. During the interview, Fry said if God created the misery-filled universe, then God is a mean-spirited, stupid and selfish maniac. Under Irish law, Fry could face a fine of up to €25,000 (₹17.6 lakh).
