Actress Kareena Kapoor's fans have started a contest called #Poutlikebebo on social media to find the 'best looking pout'. Participants will have to upload selfies of themselves pouting on the fan club pages dedicated to Kareena. One of the admins of these fan clubs has reportedly reached out to Kareena's team to ask the actor to help them select winners.
