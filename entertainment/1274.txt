Late music composer RD Burman played a beat on the back of a percussionist for a segment of the song 'Raat Gai Baat Gai' from the 1977 film 'Darling Darling'. The beat was recorded in one take and was later used in the song. Similarly, Burman used beer bottles to compose the opening beats of 'Mehbooba Mehbooba' song from 'Sholay'.
