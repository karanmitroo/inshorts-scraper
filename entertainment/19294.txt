Protesting over the recent parole granted to actor Sanjay Dutt, ABVP activists on Thursday shouted slogans outside the residence of the actor and demanded cancellation of the parole. ABVP alleged that the grounds of ill-health of Dutt's wife Manyata, on which he was granted parole, were not convincing as she was seen attending late-night film parties.
