Singer Rihanna took a dig at actress Deepika Padukone's outfit at the Met Gala 2017. The singer liked a post on Instagram where the text on the photo read, "What the #MetGala theme was VS how everyone showed up". The dress trolled on the right side of the picture is the same one that Deepika wore at the Met Gala.
