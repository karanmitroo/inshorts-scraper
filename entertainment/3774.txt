Gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli has been denied parole to attend the premiere of the film 'Daddy', which is based on his life. The decision was reportedly taken because government authorities fear that Gawli's appearance at the premiere might reflect badly on them. The release date of 'Daddy' was earlier shifted from July 21 to September 8 to coincide with Gawli's parole.
