Ranbir Kapoor, who is currently shooting for Anurag Kashyap's "Bombay Velvet" in Sri Lanka, has been spotted with Katrina Kaif at a coffee shop. Earlier this month, the duo was clicked while holidaying at a beach in Spain. Stardust editor RK Mukherjee says, "I think it's great that they are coming out into the open with their romance now."
