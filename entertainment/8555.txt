Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the CBFC has refused to certify 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' for its content and not because of the word 'burkha' in the title. "[I am] in favour of women empowerment, but the projection [is] not right," he added. The Censor Board earlier said that the film contains sexual scenes and audio pornography.
