A full-page advertisement has been placed in the American newspaper The Washington Post, wherein New Zealand-born singer Lorde has been called a bigot, a week after she cancelled a concert in Israel. The advertisement, which was placed by rabbi Shmuley Boteach's 'This World: The Values Network', was captioned, "Lorde and New Zealand ignore Syria to attack Israel."
