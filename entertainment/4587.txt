Actress Taapsee Pannu has said she was probably the quietest on the day Salman Khan came to shoot on sets of 'Judwaa 2'. She added, "I was just standing there and observing...and watching how everyone is around him." Salman, who starred in 1997 film 'Judwaa', has a cameo in the sequel which will also star Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez.
