American singer-songwriter Donnie Wahlberg took 122 selfies on a cruise in Mexico to set the Guinness World Record for the 'most self-portrait photographs (selfies) taken in three minutes'. Wahlberg achieved the title while aboard his recent New Kids on The Block Cruise. The attempt beat the previous record of 119 selfies, achieved by digital enterprise company Aruba, earlier this year.
