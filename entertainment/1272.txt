Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has been slammed online for comparing Pawan Kalyan to Rajinikanth. "I wish @PawanKalyan will contest all seats in AP like @superstarrajini doing in TN...If he doesn't do, PK's fans will feel he doesn't have guts like Rajinikanth," he tweeted. In response, a user commented, "RGV playing with PK fans, two states and egos of Telugu people."
