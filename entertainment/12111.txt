Actress Sonakshi Sinha has said that Ranveer Singh would be "suitable" to portray her father Shatrughan Sinha if a biopic is made on him, as Ranveer can match Sinha's "energy and personality". "That would be honest and very interesting to watch because I have worked with him in 'Lootera' and he has proved it time and again," added Sonakshi.
