Directed by first timers Tina A Bose and Cyrus R Khambata, 'Yahaan Sabki Lagi Hai' is an unconventional road-movie, with a "big-picture take on Indiaâ€™s deeply entrenched social and belief systems", writes NDTV. It is also described as a small and spirited cinematic essay that takes us by surprise. It's got 3/5 (NDTV) and 1.5/5 (Deccan Chronicle).
