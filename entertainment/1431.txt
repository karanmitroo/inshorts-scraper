Actress Ratna Pathak Shah, in a veiled reference to Sonakshi Sinha, slammed actresses who star in films like 'Dabangg'. Ratna said, "(A woman) is made to be a complete object of lust, and more or less, nothing else." Shah added that actresses need to stand up for themselves and refuse to do roles that objectify women.
