The Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif starrer film Jagga Jasoos "is a far cry from the formulaic Bollywood love stories", wrote The Quint. The film "desires to become a comment on social evils", said Hindustan Times (HT) while NDTV wrote, "Anurag Basu's... ambitious adventure drama... has an oddly bewitching quality". It was rated 3/5 (The Quint, NDTV) and 3.5/5 (HT).
