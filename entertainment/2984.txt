Bigg Boss contestant Zubair Khan has called Salman Khan a puppet who can dance shirtless for money. He added, "I am not Vivek Oberoi who will get scared of him. I'm also not Arijit Singh who will say 'sorry bhai' on social media." Zubair further said he wasn't aware he would be introduced as Haseena Parkar's relative on the show.
