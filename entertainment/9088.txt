Hollywood celebrities including Ridley Scott, Keira Knightley, have sought permission to hold a screening of Irani filmmaker Asghar Farhadi's Oscar-nominated film 'The Salesman' in London on the night of Oscar awards. The screening is intended to be an act of protest against Trump's immigration ban. Notably, Farhadi won't be allowed to enter US to attend the Oscars following the ban.
