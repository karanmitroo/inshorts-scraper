Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan on Wednesday said that he has not been formally approached to be the brand ambassador of government's 'Atulya Bharat' project. He also debunked media reports which stated that the government has decided to discontinue his appointment to the post. Big B called the "speculations" as "not relevant".
