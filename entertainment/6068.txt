Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that he is stepping down from a White House advisory council over US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. "Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are critical to our future, and they aren't mutually exclusive," said Iger. Earlier, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also quit the Presidential councils.
