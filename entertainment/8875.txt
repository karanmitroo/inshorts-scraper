Rajasthan minister Vasudev Devnani said that people of the state won't allow distorting queen Padmavati's history. Referring to Bhansali's film Padmavati's shoot, he added, "If someone doesn't want to shoot their film here, so be it." Padmavati's set was vandalised by Karni Sena following reports of a romantic scene between Padmavati (Deepika Padukone) and Alauddin Khilji (Ranveer Singh).
