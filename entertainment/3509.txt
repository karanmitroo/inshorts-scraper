Kareena Kapoor, while responding to rumours that her son Taimur Ali Khan has a cameo in her upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding', jokingly said, "It's either me or him. (Film's producer) Rhea Kapoor can't afford both." Kareena added, "His (Taimur's) mother is in the film. I think that's enough na?" Co-produced by Ekta Kapoor, the film also stars Sonam Kapoor.
