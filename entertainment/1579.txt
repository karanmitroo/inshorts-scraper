Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that following her squabble with Hrithik Roshan and Aditya Pancholi, her earnings have gone down and she has few advertisements. "The offers haven't slowed but my commercial viability has been affected," she added. Kangana further said that she wants her life to be an inspiration for young girls and not a cautionary tale.
