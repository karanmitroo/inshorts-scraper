Actress Kangana Ranaut, responding to Karan Johar's statement that he's done with her playing the victim card, said that Johar should provide his daughter with the 'victim card', 'woman card', and 'self-made-independent-woman card'. She added, "He should also provide her...a 'badass card' that I flashed on his show." Kangana further said she uses every card possible to fight male chauvinism.
