Kangana Ranaut, who had won the National Award for her performance in 'Queen', recently called herself the 'number one' actress. She also claimed that other actresses who happen to be her contemporaries have had no growth in whatever platform they were launched. "I started from 'B grade films' and today Iâ€™m the number one actress of this country," she said.
