Actor Farhan Akhtar, speaking on link-up rumours with 'Rock On 2' co-star Shraddha Kapoor, said that the minute a woman is involved, one assumes it has to be more than friendship. "It's weird because you're saying men and women, canâ€™t be friends," Farhan said, adding that it's considered "okay" for men to hang out together after working on a film.
