Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan slammed media persons and photographers for reportedly misbehaving at a charity event held in memory of her late father Krishnaraj Rai. The event, held in a hospital, was organised by a charity foundation that provides free cleft and palate surgery to children. "Please show some respect...This is not a [film] premiere," said Aishwarya.
