At a recent event, actor Shah Rukh Khan jokingly said that one can only speak their minds in bathrooms these days. He added, "It's a different world today...so one should be decent, gracious and bow down a little." Shah Rukh also said that he won't give his opinion further as he has promised his family to not get into trouble.
