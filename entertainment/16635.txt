Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray slammed superstar Salman Khan over his 'retracted' tweets that favoured executed 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon. "Salman is a man without brains, while his father is a respectable man. He does not read newspapers and does not know the law and thus went on tweeting in his (Yakub's) favour," Thackeray said.
