Hrithik Roshan, in his first ever statement on the row with Kangana Ranaut, wrote on social media, "This is not a lovers' spat." He further wrote there is no evidence of an alleged 7-year long affair while adding, "Yet we want to believe the other party because- why would a girl lie." He added he has never met Kangana privately.
