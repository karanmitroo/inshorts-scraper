Jaipur-based organisation Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha has signed a petition with blood which will be sent to the Censor Board, demanding a ban on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati'. A Rajput community in Meerut has also announced a bounty of â‚¹5 crore on Bhansali's head. This comes after 'Padmavati' makers agreed to screen the film to quell doubts about its content.
