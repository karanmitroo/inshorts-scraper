Singer Pharrell Williams has recorded a track that will be released after a century in 2117. The song, titled '100 Years', has been recorded on a vinyl made of soil from France's Cognac region and kept in a safe that's only destructible when submerged in water. The song is meant to motivate the population to take action against global warming.
