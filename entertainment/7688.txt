Actress Emma Thompson has said the pressure on Hollywood actresses to be thin is "evil" and it's getting worse. She revealed that she almost quit the 2008 film 'Brideshead Revisited' after another actress was asked to lose weight. "Actresses who are into their 30s simply don't eat," she added. Emma also criticised the fashion industry for its obsession over weight.
