Director Vikram Bhatt has said that "thirty-two "F*#& **#" is just too many" for the Censor Board as it cut half of these F-words from a scene in his film 'Raaz Reboot'. Bhatt said, "The logic is that thirty-two "F*#& **#"... cannot be allowed. But why then is sixteen not too many?" The scene shows a possessed girl swearing continuously.
