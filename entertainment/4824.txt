Actor Shah Rukh Khan revealed that he refused a film once as the director wasn't sensitive enough and wanted to do a love story for the sake of it. He added, "You don't just do a love story; you make it, feel it, live it." Shah Rukh further said that he might not be romantic, but he's a sensitive person.
