Vidya Balan and Emraan Hashmi starrer “Hamari Adhuri Kahani” reportedly collected Rs 5.04 crore at the box office on the first day of its release. The film had released amid high expectations but critics deemed it “stretched and regressive”. While director Mohit Suri might still hope for better numbers, its word of mouth is reportedly not strong.
