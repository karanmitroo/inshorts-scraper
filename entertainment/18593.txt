Actor Parineeti Chopra has clarified that she is not responsible for the change in release dates of her upcoming flick 'Daawat-e-Ishq', to avoid clashes with Priyanka's film 'Mary Kom', releasing September 5. "She is my sister and I love her. She is a senior actress and I can never compete with her," said Parineeti.
