Comedian Kiku Sharda took to Twitter to share a picture, welcoming comedian Chandan Prabhakar back on The Kapil Sharma Show after three months. Prabhakar hadn't shot for the show following Kapil's brawl on a flight with Sunil Grover in March. "Two brothers fight but that doesn't mean they leave each other forever," said Prabhakar on rejoining the show.
