The Radhika Apte and Manoj Bajpayee starrer short film 'Kriti' has been removed from YouTube after a copyright claim was made over the film's plot by Nepali filmmaker Aneel Neupane. He accused director Shirish Kunder of copying the story from his short film 'Bob', which released before 'Kriti'. Refuting the allegations, Kunder has sent a legal notice to Neupane.
