Filmmaker SS Rajamouli has requested organisations in Karnataka not to target 'Baahubali 2', scheduled to release on April 28, for a comment made by actor Sathyaraj on the Cauvery issue nine years ago. "Sathyaraj Sir is not the producer or director of the film... If this movie doesn't release as planned in Karnataka, he has nothing to lose," he added.
