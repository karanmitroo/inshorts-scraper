Actor Abhay Deol has revealed that only one actress called to support him after he slammed Bollywood actors including Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor for endorsing fairness creams. "I received a lot of support from people and media. From corporates and filmmakers, no. Why would they? I am calling them out for their practices," he added.
