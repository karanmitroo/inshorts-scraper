Kajol has said that India's paparazzi culture bugs the crap out of most people including her and she likes some normality. She added, "I went to a mandir...and the paparazzi landed over there, too. I was like, 'Excuse me, what're you doing here?'" Kajol further said she likes it when she doesn't have to play dress up for the photographers.
