Activist and documentary filmmaker Divya Bharathi has left Tamil Nadu after receiving death and rape threats. "I don't think the police will try and track me. I mainly left because of the harassment I received from the caste groups... they went on about rape and acid attacks," said Divya. She has several cases against her over her documentary film 'Kakkoos'.
