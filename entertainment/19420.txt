With Eid releases like 'Wanted', 'Bodyguard', and 'Ek Tha Tiger' proving to be lucky for him, actor Salman Khan has blocked the Eid date of 2014 for 'Kick' (a Sajid Nadiadwala production) and even 2015 for his Being Human production's film. This year on Eid, Shah Rukh Khan had released his movie 'Chennai Express' that entered the Rs.200 crore club.
