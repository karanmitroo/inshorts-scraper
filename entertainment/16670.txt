Kriti Sanon of 'Heropanti' fame has expressed her desire to work in the biopic on yesteryear's popular actress Madhubala. "She is someone who is still alive in our hearts... I feel she had a life which can actually be told," Sanon said. Madhubala, who died in 1969 (aged 36), is best known for her performance in "Mughal-e-Azam".
