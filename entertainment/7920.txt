Two-year-old girl Isla Walton is being called a doppelganger of singer Ed Sheeran after her picture emerged online, even as a user tweeted, "This baby looks more Ed Sheeran than Ed Sheeran." Isla's aunt Stacey, who posted the picture online, said, "Everyone comments saying how she's a mini Ed, and I call her baby Sheeran."
