Tamil Nadu's Finance Minister D Jayakumar has said actor Kamal Haasan should enter politics "if he has the guts". While speaking about Haasan's comments on corruption in TN government departments, Jayakumar said he is indulging in mudslinging. Meanwhile, former TN CM O Panneerselvam, while supporting Haasan, said the ministers should counter the charges with proof instead of threatening the actor.
