Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui revealed that he has played over 2,000 characters in theatre in seven years and said, "I have a lot of 'masala' to show." He added, "I have this confidence, which allows me to try different roles in every film I do." Nawazuddin further said that playing larger-than-life heroes or villain-like characters doesn't interest him.
