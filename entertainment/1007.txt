An article by Yahoo! reporting on the twins of singer Enrique Iglesias and his partner former tennis player Anna Kournikova, mistakenly used Hollywood actress Anna Kendrick's picture while referring to the mother of the twins. Tweeting about the article, the actress wrote, "Dear Yahoo: how do I get to this timeline where I've slept with Enrique Iglesias please."
