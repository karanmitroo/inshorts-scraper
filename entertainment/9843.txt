Filmmaker Shirish Kunder replied to a Twitter user who was asking about his children's religion. The Twitter user, named Fatima Arya, had asked, "Your Kids Hindus or Muslims?" since Shirish is Hindu and his wife Farah Khan is Muslim. Responding to this, Shirish wrote, "Depends on which festival is next. Last month, they were Christians."
