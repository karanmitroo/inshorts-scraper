Several people are taking to Twitter to post photos and videos of babies who look like singer John Legend. "Explain fam," wrote a user while tagging Legend in a picture. Reacting to this, Legend's wife Chrissy Teigen wrote, "For the last time, John looks like a baby so a lot of babies look like him stop sending me John babies".
