Actor George Clooney has married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in a private ceremony in Venice (Italy), a representative of the actor said. The one-line statement from Clooney's long-time representative Stan Rosenfield is expected to be the only communication on the much-anticipated marriage of the actor.
