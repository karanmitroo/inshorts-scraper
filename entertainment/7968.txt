Filmmaker and actress Aparna Sen has said that it is shameful that the film 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' has been denied certificate by the Censor Board. She added, "It is a breach of our democratic right to our freedom of expression." The film, also starring Sen's daughter Konkona Sen Sharma, was denied certificate for the story being "lady-oriented".
