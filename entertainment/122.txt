Amitabh Bachchan took to Twitter to share pictures from Holika Dahan ceremony organised at his home. "The Holika has been burnt and the prayers done...the 'tilak' colours put..the special sweetmeat for the occasion 'gujiya' consumed," he wrote. Bachchan further revealed in his blog that the family did not celebrate Holi this time as Aishwarya's father had passed away last year.
