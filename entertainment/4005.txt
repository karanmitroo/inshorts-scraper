Filmmaker David Dhawan, while responding to the question if he would collaborate with Govinda again, said, "Why not, sure." David added, "Govinda and I have created history in cinema... Govinda has been different, that's it." Notably, David and Govinda have worked in more than a dozen films together including 'Shola Aur Shabnam', 'Aankhen', 'Haseena Maan Jaayegi' and 'Partner'.
