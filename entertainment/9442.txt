Advocate Ajaykumar S Waghmare has filed a petition at the Bombay High Court, asking that the word 'LLB' should be deleted from the title of Akshay Kumar's 'Jolly LLB 2'. He stated that it is an attempt to malign the reputation of the legal profession. He further said the trailer shows the characters playing cards and dancing in court premises.
