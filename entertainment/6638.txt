Shah Rukh Khan in his first TED Talk, which released on YouTube on Thursday, talked about humanity, fame and love. In the beginning, SRK said, "I've been made to understand that there are lots...who haven't seen my work and I feel very sad for you." He further talked about losing his parents and moving to the "sprawling metropolis of Mumbai".
