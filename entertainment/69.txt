Gary Oldman mentioned his 98-year-old mother in his acceptance speech while receiving Best Actor Oscar award. He said, "I say to my mother, thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I'm bringing Oscar home." This was the first time that Oldman won an Oscar. It was for portraying former British PM Winston Churchill in 'Darkest Hour'.
