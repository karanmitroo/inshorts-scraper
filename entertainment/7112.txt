Sushant Singh Rajput has said he didn't take rumoured girlfriend Kriti Sanon on a ride as soon as he bought his new car. "I had taken the car out for a spin alone the day it was delivered. Nobody clicked any pictures then," he added. Sushant further said he and Kriti are good friends and the dating rumours are untrue.
