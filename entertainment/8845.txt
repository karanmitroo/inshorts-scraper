Singer Adele, while paying a tribute to late singer George Michael at the Grammy awards, stopped performing his song 'Fastlove' midway, reportedly due to audio issues, following which she swore onstage. Requesting a restart, she said, "I know it's live TV, I'm sorry for swearing...I can't mess this up for him." The audience cheered as she restarted the performance.
