Nitasha, winner of transgender beauty pageant Miss Trans Queen, said before her transition her father wanted a girl for her, as she was biologically male at that time, but she was sure she wanted to marry a boy. Talking about issues transgender women face in India, Nitasha added, "There are rapes and no family support...the family just throws them out."
