Superwoman Lilly Singh has released a video titled 'A Geography Class For Racist People'. Singh responds to racist comments sarcastically and also takes a jibe at US President Donald Trump in her video. "A trip around the world is a must for trolls to know that India, Pakistan and Afghanistan are actually three separate countries," says Lily towards the end.
