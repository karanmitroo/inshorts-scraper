Actress Vaani Kapoor has said that if there is anything which didn't work in her 2016 film 'Befikre', it is probably her. "I was the biggest risk factor for 'Befikre' because everyone else in the team had...already proven their worth," she added. Notably, 'Befikre', also starring Ranveer Singh, was Vaani's second Hindi film, after the 2013 film 'Shuddh Desi Romance'.
