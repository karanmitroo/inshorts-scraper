In a tribute to Rabindranath Tagore on Republic Day, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan sang the National Anthem at the poet's ancestral home in Kolkata. Bachchan was accompanied by the promotional team of "Shamitabh". The film's director R Balki said it was surprising that no one had filmed the National Anthem at the house of the great poet who composed it.
