MNS leader Shalini Thackeray has said they will oppose Salman Khan's 'Tiger Zinda Hai' if it takes prime-time screens in the state and if Marathi films get fewer shows. Raj Thackeray reportedly also wrote to cinema hall owners warning them that if the Marathi film 'Deva' isn't given a prime time slot, he wouldn't let them run 'Tiger Zinda Hai'.
