Bobby Deol, who will make his comeback after four years with 'Poster Boys', said, "People ask me why I was so choosy (about films)...I tell them I wasn't choosy but people had become choosy about me." "But after 'Poster Boys', I feel they won't be that choosy," he added. The film is scheduled to release on September 8.
