Actor-director Sachin Pilgaonkar, who worked with late actress Reema Lagoo in Tu Tu Main Main, said she wanted to come out of her 'goody-goody mother image'. Sachin added that he offered her Tu Tu Main Main as she wanted to try comedy. Remembering Reema, who passed away on Thursday, he recalled  working with her as child-actor in his first film.
