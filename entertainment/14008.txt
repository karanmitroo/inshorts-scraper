Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma (RGV) has said that a more suitable title for the upcoming film 'Udta Punjab' would be 'Udta India' or 'Udta World'. "For what it actually represents Udta Punjab is diminutive," tweeted the filmmaker. Starring Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh, the film deals with the issue of drug addiction among youths in Punjab.
