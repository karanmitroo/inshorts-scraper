Comedy group AIB, in their latest episode of On Air With AIB, said that they throw only pillows and not 'chappals' on flights, while referring to the brawl between Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover. "Sunil Grover, if you are watching this and you want to work with a smart, funny comedy group...then please call us," said AIB's Ashish Shakya.
