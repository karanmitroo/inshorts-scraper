'Aligarh' director Hansal Mehta has said that those who worked on the film are disappointed for not receiving any recognition at the 64th National Film Awards. He added, "Let's just keep making our films with love and care- awards or no awards. There is no point brooding over the results." However, Hansal said he appreciated the films that were honoured.
