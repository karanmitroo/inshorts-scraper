An Indian music band has posted a video singing an A Capella version of the Pakistani National Anthem 'Pak Sarzamin'. The two-minute video begins with the group members holding up placards that say, “This Independence Day, we’d like to dedicate a song to our neighbours. A song about faith, pride and grandeur, of power, progress and perfection.”
