Actor Sathyaraj, known for portraying 'Katappa' in the film 'Baahubali', has issued a formal apology for his remarks on the Cauvery issue, made nine years back. "I am not against Kannadigas. I will be more careful in the future," said Sathyaraj while reading an apology note. This comes after Kannada groups protested against the release of 'Baahubali 2'.
