Arshad Warsi and Jackky Bhagnani starrer, Welcome 2 Karachi, released this Friday. It is a tale about two Indians who have to get out of Pakistan but don't have their passport. The film is only a maddening mess and is able to make the audience laugh intermittently, NDTV says. It has been rated 2.5/5 (TOI and HT) and 1/5 (NDTV).
