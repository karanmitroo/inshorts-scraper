Singer Rihanna during a recent concert in France told the audience that she does not want them to be playing 'Pokémon Go' during her performance. "I don't want to see you texting your boyfriends or girlfriends," added the 28-year-old singer. Rihanna's warning to her fans comes days after an audience member was spotted playing the game at a Beyoncé concert.
