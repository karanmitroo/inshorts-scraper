Salman Khan, who hosts the reality show 'Bigg Boss 8', Sunday got upset and walked off stage when his joke was not taken sportingly by contestant Karishma Tanna. As Salman joked, Karishma started crying saying that it wasn't funny. 'Bigg Boss' was an entertainment show and they all were having fun, an angry Salman told Karishma before walking off stage.
