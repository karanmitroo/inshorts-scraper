Farah Khan, while speaking about Deepika Padukone, said, "From being from a completely non-filmy background to not knowing acting to becoming the topmost heroine of the country...I'm very proud of her." Farah added, "I think Deepika can dance, look glamorous and also act and a very few people have that." Deepika made her Bollywood debut with Farah's 'Om Shanti Om'.
