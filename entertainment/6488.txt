Alia Bhatt has said she would love to play the role of goddess Sita if a film is made on Amish Tripathi's upcoming book Sita - Warrior of Mithila. She added, "Her story that we get to know about in this book isn't known to many." Amish said Ranveer Singh would be able to do justice to Lord Ram's role.
