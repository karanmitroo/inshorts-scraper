The Mother's Wax Museum in Kolkata has unveiled a wax statue of pop icon Michael Jackson as a part of its expansion plans. Mother's wax museum, inaugurated in November 2014, is reportedly India's first wax museum. This comes after the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum announced plans to open a museum in Delhi by 2017.
