Reacting to Kapil Sharma's bribe allegations against Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation officials, Shiv Sena today said the BMC is not a "comedy stage". "He should tell the name of the person who asked for a bribe... when did he ask and why did he ask," it said. Sena called for action against Sharma alleging he was carrying out an illegal construction.
