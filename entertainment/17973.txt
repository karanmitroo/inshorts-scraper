Actor Sanjay Dutt left his home in Mumbai on Thursday to surrender himself, after prison authorities refused to extend his 14-day furlough. The 55-year-old actor was released on a two weeks furlough by the Pune's Yerawada Central Jail authorities on Dec-24. Dutt is serving five-year jail term for possessing illegal firearm meant to be used during the 1993 blasts.
