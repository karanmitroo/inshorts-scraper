Actor Salman Khan has said that there is no point in comparing his film 'Sultan' and Aamir Khan's 'Dangal' while adding, "Why would Aamir be scared (of Sultan)". “My film is different than his. Both of us knew that the two films are about wrestling. I have heard Aamir’s (film) script and it is outstanding," added Salman.
