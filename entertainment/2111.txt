Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, while speaking about not casting Deepika Padukone in his film 'Beyond the Clouds', said he didn't want to work with Bollywood superstars. "I always wanted to shoot at different locations...It was difficult with Deepika as there was a large crowd and even more curiosity," he added. Malayalam actress Malavika Mohanan was later cast in the role.
