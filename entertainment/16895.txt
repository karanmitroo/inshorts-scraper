The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) crowned Grammy-winning singer Rihanna the recording industry's top digital singles artist on Wednesday, after she became the first artist to surpass 100 million cumulative digital singles certifications. The 27-year-old finished ahead of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, in a "historic feat" that RIAA CEO saw as "a testament to an extraordinary career".
