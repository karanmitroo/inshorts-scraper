Late singer Michael Jackson's daughter Paris took to Instagram to share a childhood picture of herself with Michael to mark his 59th birth anniversary on Tuesday. "Birthday wishes to the love of my life...I will never feel love again the way I did with you," read a part of her caption. Paris was 11-year-old at the time of Michael's death.
