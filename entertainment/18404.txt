Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif starrer Bang Bang, which released on Thursday, has apparently not created the bang it was supposed to at the box office. Hindustan Times has described the film as a 'half-baked product' with a 'mindless script'. The film has been rated 1.5/5 (HT), 1.5/5 (Indian Express), 2/5 (NDTV), 1.5/5 (India Today) and 3/5 (TOI).
