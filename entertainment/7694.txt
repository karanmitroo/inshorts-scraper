Actor Hrithik Roshan has said that 'differently-abled' is not just a polite phrase but the truth, because those whom we think are disabled are our equals and sometimes more. He added, "A blind person can't see but his other senses can be sharper than us." Hrithik further said that differently-abled people don't need our sympathy, but need inclusion and sensitivity.
