The Madras High Court on Tuesday reserved its order on a plea by actor Dhanush seeking to quash an elderly couple's lawsuit claiming him to be their son. The court, however, gave no date to pronounce its judgment. The couple had claimed that Dhanush was a schoolboy when he ran away to Chennai to get into the film industry.
