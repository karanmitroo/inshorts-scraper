'Wonder Woman' director Patty Jenkins, while responding to US politician Hillary Clinton praising the film, said, "It's completely surreal." Hillary had earlier said that the film, starring Gal Gadot in lead role, "was just as inspirational as...a movie about a strong, powerful woman...would be." Jenkins added that she feels honoured that her movie was praised by a person like Hillary.
