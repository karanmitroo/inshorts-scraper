Singer Selena Gomez dedicated her Billboard Woman of the Year Award to her friend Francia Raisa for donating her kidney to Selena. "She saved my life. I feel incredibly lucky," said Selena in an emotional tribute. Selena had revealed in September that she had undergone a kidney transplant due to complications arising from lupus, an auto-immune disease she suffers from.
