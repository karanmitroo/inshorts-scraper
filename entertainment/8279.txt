Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi, while reacting to Karan Johar opting to become a father through surrogacy, said, "Was Karan Johar not getting a girl to marry?" He added that many girls come to the film industry and Johar could have picked someone suitable. Azmi said, "He could have adopted a poor child. This is a joke on poor people."
