Tamil film 'Puli', which also released in Telugu and Hindi this Friday, is an utterly disappointing fantasy adventure, wrote Hindustan Times. The Chimbu Deven directorial is very predictable, said India Today. The film, starring Vijay, Sridevi, Shruti Haasan, Hansika Motwani among others, has been rated 1.5/5 (Indian Express, India Today) and 1/5 (HT).
