Organisers of CCL4 were left fuming after Comedian Kapil Sharma, host of the popular show Comedy Nights with Kapil, refused to host CCL4, reportedly because he didn't get a vanity-van of his own. He showed up 2 hours late for rehearsal leaving no time for rehearsal, and eventually walked off at the last minute.
