Karan Johar has said that he's a fan of  Kangana Ranaut and will call the actress to his next party. He added, "I don't hate Kangana and she doesn't hate me." This comes after the two were recently involved in a row, which began with Kangana calling Johar the "flagbearer of nepotism" on his show 'Koffee with Karan'.
