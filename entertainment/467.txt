Actress Jacqueline Fernandez, while addressing rumours that she is dating Sidharth Malhotra, said, "I'm not a 12-year-old who has to hide her relationships." "I'm a grown-up girl. If I was dating someone it wouldn't be a big deal for me anymore. I would honestly admit to it," she added. Jacqueline further said, "Sid will always remain a close friend."
