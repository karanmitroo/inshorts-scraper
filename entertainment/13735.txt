Priti Sinha, the daughter of Vinay Sinha who produced the 1994 film 'Andaz Apna Apna', has said that the film's remake rights have not been sold to Anurag Kashyap's production house Phantom Films. "The rights of the film remain with Vinay Pictures," said Priti while adding that reports of the film being a remake of the original film were false.
