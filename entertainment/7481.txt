Reacting to Akshay Kumar's Best Actor National Film Award win for 'Rustom' and 'Airlift', a user tweeted, "Why Akshay for Rustom? Why not Aamir for Dangal?" A user wrote, "Akshay wins National Award...The off-screen 'patriotism' pays off." Another tweet read, "Akshay getting the #NationalFilmAwards instead of Aamir. This is how GEN category people feel everyday while competing with quota guys."
