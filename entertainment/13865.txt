Singer Adele at a recent concert abused record producer Toni Visconti saying, "suck my d**k" and called him a "d**khead" for suggesting that her voice could have been enhanced digitally. Earlier, Visconti said that the extent to which Adele's voice is "manipulated" on a song is "questionable". Notably, the producer apologised for his comments which he said were misconstrued.
