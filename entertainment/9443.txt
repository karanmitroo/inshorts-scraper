Actor Suriya has issued a legal notice to PETA after the animal welfare organisation called his support for Jallikattu a publicity stunt as part of promoting his film 'Singam 3'. The notice has termed the allegations made by PETA as "mischievous and derogatory". It further demands that PETA issues a written apology to Suriya and release the same to media.
