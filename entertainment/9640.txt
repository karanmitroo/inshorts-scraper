Mark Hamill, who voiced the Joker in animated series Batman, shared an audio of himself reading US President-elect Donald Trump's tweets about Meryl Streep as the villain. Trump had called Streep an overrated actress for criticising him at the Golden Globes. Reportedly, Mark debuted 'The Trumpster' last week to troll Trump by reading out his tweets in the villain's voice.
