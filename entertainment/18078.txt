The White House said on Friday that they were contemplating a "proportional response" to the hacking of Sony Corporation, without stirring more trouble. In the investigation, all clues pointed to the North Korean government's hand in the hacking, which led to the release of "The Interview" being cancelled. Internet activities are strictly controlled by the government in North Korea.
