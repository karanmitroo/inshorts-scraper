A Mongolian rapper was beaten into a coma by a Russian diplomat after the rapper took to the stage wearing a swastika, reports said. Swastika is associated with the Nazis, but it is also a traditional symbol in Mongolia pre-dating Hitler. The rapper, Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar, was in a coma for 10 days after his performance in Mongolia's capital Ulan Bator.
