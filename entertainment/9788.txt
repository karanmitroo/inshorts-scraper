Actor Naseeruddin Shah has revealed that late actor Om Puri's mental and physical health was in shambles. "Om was really suffering... In a way, death has relieved him of all the stress, (including) the bad films he took on, I presume for financial reasons," he added. Shah worked with Puri in films like 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro' and 'Mirch Masala'.
