Sidharth Malhotra, while talking about the clash of his upcoming film 'Aiyaary' with the Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar starrer '2.0', said, "I think that is pretty unfortunate." Sidharth added, "We have also not finished 'Aiyaary' and even they haven't finished their shooting...let's see we still have time." 'Aiyaary' is set to release on January 26, 2018, a day after '2.0'.
