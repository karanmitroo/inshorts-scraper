Actors Tom Holland and Zendaya, who worked together in the film 'Spider-man: Homecoming', took to Twitter to deny rumours about them dating each other. "[M]y favourite is when it says we go on vacations together! I haven't been on a vacation in years!" tweeted Zendaya while responding to a report. Tom responded sarcastically by writing, "Does the press tour count?".
