Filmmaker Karan Johar has said women wear salwar kameez and men wear loose clothes to hide their extra weight. Talking about the time when he used to be overweight, he added, "I used to camouflage my extra kilos with black clothes." Johar further said he used to feel terrible when people told him that he had put on weight.
