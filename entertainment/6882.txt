US rapper Eminem is suing New Zealand's ruling National Party for allegedly using an unlicensed version of his 2002 song 'Lose Yourself' in its 2014 election campaign advertisement. The party previously claimed that it purchased the song through an Australia-based supplier. Notably, Lose Yourself is the first ever rap song to have received an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
