Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's former international manager Simone Sheffield in a comment on a leading magazine's article wrote that producer Harvey Weinstein tried hard to get Aishwarya alone. Sheffield added, "He...acted like a big bully pig...He asked me to leave the meeting numerous times and I politely declined." This comes after various actresses alleged that they were sexually harassed by Harvey.
