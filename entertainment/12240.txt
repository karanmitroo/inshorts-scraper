A minute-long video shows TV show host Jimmy Fallon ruffling US presidential nominee Donald Trump's hair during an interview on Thursday. Asking if he could do something "not presidential", Fallon had asked Trump's permission to mess up his hair while he was just a "civilian". Trump said  it would not be an issue with his "hairspray".
