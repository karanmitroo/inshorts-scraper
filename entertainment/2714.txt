A Californian artist has accused Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski of sexually assaulting her when she was 10 years old in 1975, the fifth such allegation made against him. The artist has claimed the incident took place at a beach following a photoshoot where the director asked her to pose naked and then molested her. Polanski has, however, denied the allegations.
