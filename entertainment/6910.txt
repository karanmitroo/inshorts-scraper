Actor Suniel Shetty said it's embarrassing to be called hot by his daughter's friends. "It's not like I do anything to look young because I don't even dye my hair. It's just the result of being fit all these years," added the 55-year-old. Suniel further said that according to his children, he and his wife Mana look like their siblings.
