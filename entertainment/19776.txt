Rihanna(25), famous for tiny bikni shots, took her minimalist wardrobe aesthetic to the next level by appearing naked in balcony of hotel French Riviera, Monaco. Often photographed in skimpy clothes, Rihanna has always stunned the audiences with her outfits, like at the Grammy Awards in 2011 where she wore a floor-length gown that had gaps from neck to toe.
