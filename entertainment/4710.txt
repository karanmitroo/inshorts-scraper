Rapper Kendrick Lamar received eight nominations for his music video 'Humble' at the MTV Video Music Award this year. He was followed by The Weeknd and Katy Perry, who received five nominations each. Notably, MTV has eliminated gendered categories for the Video Music Awards, similar to that of its Movie Awards which were held earlier this year.
