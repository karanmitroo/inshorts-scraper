Mira Rajput, wife of actor Shahid Kapoor, has said that the new wave of feminism is aggressive and destructive. She added, "Feminism is not man versus woman. There's a term called feminazi, which has become the female equivalent of male chauvinist." Mira further said that it's a woman's choice to work or stay at home and neither should be shamed.
