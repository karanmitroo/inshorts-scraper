Actress Lisa Haydon has finally signed for ‘Shaukeen’ after Nargis Fakhri's exit from the film, a remake of Basu Chatterjee's 1982 hit. She will play Akshay Kumar's girlfriend, whom three old men — played by Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor and Piyush Mishra — will be seen lusting after. The shoot with her will start on April 16.
