BJP leader Suraj Pal Amu, who kept a bounty for beheading Deepika Padukone, on Wednesday said that now his dream is to slap National Conference Chief Farooq Abdullah at Srinagar's Lal Chowk. This comes after Abdullah took a jibe at the Centre, asking them to try hoisting the Tricolour at Lal Chowk first, before attempting the same in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
