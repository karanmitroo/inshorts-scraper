Kamal Jain, the producer of Kangana Ranaut starrer 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi', said, "The film doesn't portray anything objectionable about (Rani Laxmibai) and nor has the film distorted the history in anyway." This comes after a Brahmin organisation objected to the film alleging distortion of historical facts and sent a warning letter threatening to stall its shooting in Rajasthan.
