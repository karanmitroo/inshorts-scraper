Commenting on television actress Pratyusha Banerjee's suicide, actress Rakhi Sawant has said that ceiling fans should be banned and table fans and ACs should be used instead. “Banning ceiling fans is more important than chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ because many daughters and daughters-in-law are committing suicides", she said at a press conference.
