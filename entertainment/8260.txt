Actress Konkona Sen Sharma has said that she's fed up of the Censor Board banning films like 'Lipstick Under My Burkha'. She added, "It is very discouraging...In India, it is...difficult to get funds for such films and the movie is getting awards internationally." Konkona further said that Indians should have the right to choose the films they want to watch.
