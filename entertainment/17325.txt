Hollywood actress Sandra Bullock, 50, has topped People Magazine's list of World's Most Beautiful Woman of 2015, becoming the oldest person in the history of the list to do so. The actress, however, believes that "real beauty is quiet". When asked about her response on hearing the news, she said, “I just said, ‘That’s ridiculous.’ I’ve told no one.”
