The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday declared 'Masaan' and 'Jaanisaar' tax-free in the state. Notably, both the films were shot in Uttar Pradesh. While Masaan tells the story of Varanasi and has also won two major awards at the Cannes Film Festival 2015, Jaanisaar depicts the culture of Avadh and encourages communal amity and peace.
