Singer Kesha has released 'True Colors', her first single since her legal battle with Sony Music over a sexual assault case against music producer Dr Luke in 2014. The 'Tik Tok' hitmaker collaborated with musician Zedd to re-release a version of his 2015 song, 'True Colors'. "This is more than a song... itâ€™s a declaration of my truth," tweeted Kesha.
