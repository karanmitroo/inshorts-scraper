Akshay Kumar on Saturday took to Facebook to share a video with his sister Alka Bhatia. In the video, the duo can be seen recreating a scene from the Ramayana where Ravan abducts Sita. However, the ending of the video has a funny twist. "Here's something spontaneous on #â€ŽRakshaBandhan with my partner in crime since childhood", Akshay captioned the video.
