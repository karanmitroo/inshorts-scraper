Kangana Ranaut and R Madhavan-starrer ‘Tanu Weds Manu Returns’ minted Rs 8.75 crore on the opening day, industry trade analyst Taran Adarsh said. The movie falls third in the first day box office collection this year after 'Gabbar Is Back' (Rs 13.05cr) and 'Roy' (Rs 10.40cr). The film’s collection is expected to multiply due to its positive word of mouth.
