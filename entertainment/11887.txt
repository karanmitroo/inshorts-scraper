Indian Railways has used Bollywood dialogues to promote the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at the Howrah railway station in Kolkata. Dialogues from films including 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), 'Sholay', 'Anand' and 'Deewar' have been used for the initiative. "Ja Simran Ja, Platform bhi saaf rakhte hue ja," reads one of the posters, a take on the iconic dialogue from DDLJ.
