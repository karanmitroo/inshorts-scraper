Actor Shahid Kapoor, who reportedly walked out of Tigmanshu Dhulia's 'Milan Talkies' to work in Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Haider', has started shooting for the film in Srinagar from Nov-8. 'Haider' is based upon Shakespeare's famous novel 'Hamlet' with Shahid in lead role. Shraddha Kapoor and Tabu have also been selected for the film, though their roles are being kept secret.
