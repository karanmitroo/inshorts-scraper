Actress Bhumi Pednekar turned showstopper for designer Reynu Taandon at the ongoing India Couture Week. She walked the runway in a royal blue lehenga and floor-length jacket from Taandon's latest collection 'CYAN', which was inspired by peacock blue hues. "I felt so comfortable walking in this outfit that I can wear this at any point of my life," said Bhumi.
