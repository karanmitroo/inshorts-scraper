In a video message, singer-composer AR Rahman announced separate concerts for his Hindi and Tamil fans in Canada. He was earlier criticised by certain Hindi speakers for having "too many Tamil songs" at a concert in London in July. Rahman jokingly added, "The Hindi concert is for the Tamil fans and the Tamil concert is for the Hindi fans."
