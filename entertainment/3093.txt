Shamita Shetty, who's currently seen in the web series 'Yo Ke Hua Bro', said facing the camera after a long time made her feel like she was working in her first film. "My director...explained to me that [because] I hadn't acted for so long...you tend to unlearn everything," she added. Shamita made her Bollywood debut with the 2000 film 'Mohabbatein'.
