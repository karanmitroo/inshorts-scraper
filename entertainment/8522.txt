Actress Taapsee Pannu has gifted a vacation in Singapore to her spot-boy, who has been with her for six years through "thick and thin". "More than anything I feel he deserves a good break and somewhere where he doesn't have to do anything but relax," said Taapsee. She has reportedly gifted him and his entire family the vacation.
