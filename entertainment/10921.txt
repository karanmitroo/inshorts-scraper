Actress Sonakshi Sinha, while responding to a question on "stereotyped" roles in the films 'Akira' and 'Force 2' said that people never ask actors like Salman, Akshay or John when they do action films. "These are just two movies which happened to release one after the other... It's not as if both characters are similar in any way," added Sonakshi.
