As fans' disappointment increased with the news of the halt in screenings of Bollywood's iconic film DDLJ at Mumbai's Maratha Mandir, the cinema management extended the run for at least another week. Also, the original screening time, 11:30 a.m, has been left unchanged till the tentative last show on Feb-26. The screening run can be extended after a final decision.
