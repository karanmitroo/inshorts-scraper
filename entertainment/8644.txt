Singer Jennifer Lopez, while speaking about her relationships, said that they have nothing to do with age. "I don't date younger men. It's not like you have to be younger. It's not about that... It's about the person... it has nothing to do with age," she added. Forty-seven-year-old Jennifer is rumoured to be dating singer Drake, who is 30-years-old.
