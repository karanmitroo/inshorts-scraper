Saif Ali Khan, who will be seen in 'Phantom' next, on Tuesday said everybody knows who was responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. "We all know that terrorists are hiding in Pakistan, so why shouldn't we accept it?", Saif said. Earlier, Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed had sought a ban on 'Phantom' claiming that it contains "filthy propaganda" against Pakistan.
