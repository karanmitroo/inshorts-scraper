Singer Adele almost fell off the stage as she tripped on the train of her gown while performing the song 'Hello' at her concert in Brisbane, Australia. Adele explained, "I've never worn a dress like this. I'm basically celebrating Beauty and the Beast coming out...but I forgot to lift it up and tried to run up and nearly fell over."
