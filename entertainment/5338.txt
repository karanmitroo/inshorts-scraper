Actress Katrina Kaif has said that she does not know why she was so against joining social media. "My mind was blocked completely, I wasn't even ready for a discussion. But now that I have come on it, I really like it. I really enjoy it," added Katrina. The 33-year-old actress made her debut on social media by joining Facebook.
