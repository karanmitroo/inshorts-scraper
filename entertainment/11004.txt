Actor Ranveer Singh has said he is not trying to enter Shah Rukh Khan's territory with his upcoming film 'Befikre'. "Adi sir wanted to make the film with me and I am involved in the project from its scripting," said Ranveer. 'Befikre' is directed by Aditya Chopra, who had only worked with Shah Rukh in the capacity of a director.
