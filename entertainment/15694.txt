Singer Adele will reportedly launch her own brand of clothing for "stylish-yet-busy mothers", in the latter half of 2016. While the focus is on comfortable daywear, the clothes will reportedly range from signature pieces like the singer's favourite winter item, the poncho, to mix-and-match clothing in neutral tones. The 'Hello' hitmaker is reportedly already working on the initial sketches.
