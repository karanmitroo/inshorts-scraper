'Baar Baar Dekho' director Nitya Mehra has said that the film, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Katrina Kaif, has "no scene... with Katrina wearing a bra so it canâ€™t be cut". "It is a clean film," added Mehra. Earlier, reports suggested that the Censor Board had asked the makers to remove a scene showing a bra from the film.
