Actor Ranbir Kapoor said Monday that if he has to pen down a portion of his life, then it would be the time when he assisted director Sanjay Leela Bhansali during the film 'Black'. "That was the time I really switched from just being an aimless slacker boy to somebody who wants to do something in his life," said Ranbir.
