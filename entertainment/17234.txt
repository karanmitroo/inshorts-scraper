Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, whose 'Bombay Velvet' has been granted an 'A' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification, has said, he would approach the Revising Committee as there was nothing in the film that qualified it to be an A-film. Anurag, who once had a dustup with CBFC over anti-smoking disclaimers, said that he has faith in the Committee.
