According to reports, the 'phone a friend' lifeline in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) will be replaced by 'video a friend' in the show's upcoming ninth season. Contestants will also reportedly have the option to get a partner on the sets instead of using 'audience poll'. The prize money is also said to be higher than last season's â‚¹7 crore.
