Bill Cosby, an American stand-up comedian, reportedly said in sworn testimony 10 years ago he used his position in the entertainment industry to pursue women, paid them off to keep the affairs secret and offered them sedating drugs. The testimony stems from a civil lawsuit filed by one of several women who have publicly accused the comedian of sexual assault.
