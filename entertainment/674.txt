Discussing the row over 'Padmaaavat' allegedly endorsing jauhar, Sanjay Leela Bhansali said, "It's like saying...Hrishikesh Mukherjee endorsed cancer in Anand...It is the story, it is what happened." He added, "Why must a filmmaker be answerable to socio-political interpretations for every action... reaction in his cinema?" Earlier, Deepika Padukone said the film's team was not endorsing jauhar.
