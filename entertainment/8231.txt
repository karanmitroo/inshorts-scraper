Actresses Taapsee Pannu and Swara Bhaskar have featured in a video where they discuss, 'How much cleavage is good cleavage'. Swara and Taapsee in a mocking manner describe how much women should cover up in various scenarios. However, they end the video by telling women, "If people are getting judgemental then it is their problem and not yours."
