Talking about the decision of the Central Board of Film Certification to certify 'Padmavati', former CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani said, "This film was sidelined by CBFC... Chairman (Prasoon Joshi) faced pressure from the (I&B) ministry." Pahlaj added, "This decision could've been taken before the film was opposed by people and political parties."
