Actor Shah Rukh Khan, in a recent interview, said that he has no understanding of his stardom and he doesn't live for it. "I'm happy I'm a star...it humbles me. But...it is not something I look up to," he added. Shah Rukh further said that he's a small-time guy who worked hard to be where he is today.
