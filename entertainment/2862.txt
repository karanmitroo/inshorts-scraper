Actress Shraddha Kapoor has been trolled for urging people to not burst crackers on Diwali. "Be the change you wish to see in the world," commented a user while sharing a photo showing firecrackers being burst during the promotion of Shraddha's film. "I saw Shakti Kapoor bursting crackers near your house last year," wrote another user.
