Malaysia has banned the release of 'Padmaaavat' in the country as "the storyline of the film touches on the sensitivities of Islam". "That in itself is a matter of grave concern in Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country," said Malaysia's National Film Censorship Board (LPF) chairman Mohd Zamberi Abdul Aziz. The film's distributor in Malaysia is expected to appeal against the decision.
