Taapsee Pannu has said she believes 100% in box-office collection above everything else. She added, "(The film) may get four or five stars or even one, but nothing really matters in front of the box-office collection." Taapsee further said, "I cannot run away from that fact. If my films didn't collect money, I wouldn't be able to do more films."
