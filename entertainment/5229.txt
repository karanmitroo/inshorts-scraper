Actress Sridevi is seen crying in a video message to her Pakistani co-stars Adnan Siddiqui and Sajal Ali, which was played before the premiere of their film Mom at Karachi. "I really miss you all.. I can't even think of this film without the two of you," said Sridevi. Adnan and Sajal didn't come to India to promote the film.
