Actor Abhishek Bachchan has shared a picture from the photoshoot of his debut film 'Refugee'. Directed by JP Datta, the film released in 2000. "Remember being petrified about this shoot. Have always hated photoshoots, being a motion picture actor have always found it very difficult to be still and literally freeze," he wrote in the caption.
