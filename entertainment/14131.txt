The animated film 'The Angry Birds Movie', which released on Friday, is "in serious need of animatism", wrote Hindustan Times. "It's decent but doesn't... touch your heart," wrote Times of India, while Mid-Day called the film "a fairly constipated attempt to recreate the video game success on cinema". It has been rated 1.5/5 (Hindustan Times), 3/5 (TOI) and 2/5 (Mid-Day).
