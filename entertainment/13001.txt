The ivory rayon-acetate dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in the movie ‘The Seven Year Itch’ raised $4.6 million at an auction, making it the world’s most expensive dress sold at an auction. The dress famously billows up as Monroe steps over a windy subway grate in the movie. Monroe died at the age of 36 on August 5, 1962.
