The producers of Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' have sent a legal notice to former Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani. "I sent him a legal notice because he made false claims that my clients showed two different copies of their film to the CBFC and the Tribunal. We want him to clarify and apologise," said the advocate representing the producers.
