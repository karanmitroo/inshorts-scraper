Shahid Kapoor, while speaking about the time when he was a newcomer in Bollywood, said it wasn't fair to compare him to Shah Rukh Khan. "The worst thing that can happen to a newcomer is being compared to a big star... because it confuses him," he added. However, Shahid further said that he is comfortable with who he is today.
