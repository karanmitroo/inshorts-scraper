Lyricist Swanand Kirkire, while talking about singer-songwriter Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in Literature this year, said that it was "high time" for artistes like Dylan to win the honour. "Artistes such as Bob Dylan or John Lennon are people's poets. They wrote the kind of poetry that people understood... they wrote for the people," added Kirkire.
