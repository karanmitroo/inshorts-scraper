Ranaragini, a women's group in Goa demanded the removal of condom advertisements featuring actress Sunny Leone, as well as other contraceptive advertisements featuring women models. The group said they had no objection to contraceptive advertisements, but to the objectification of women in such advertisements. "A different message is conveyed on account of this," said a member of the organisation.
