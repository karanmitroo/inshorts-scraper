Celebrated author JK Rowling's new Harry Potter spin-off, "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" will be made into a film trilogy. Rowling said that it even though it is set in the same wizard community of Harry Potter, "it is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world".
