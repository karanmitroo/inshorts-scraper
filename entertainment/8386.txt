Madhya Pradesh policeman Daulatram Jogawat, who weighed around 180 kg and was mocked by writer-columnist Shobhaa De on Twitter, on Thursday underwent a gastric bypass surgery in Mumbai. Gastric bypass surgery is aimed at reducing the volume of the stomach to curb the food intake. "A wrong tweet has changed my life," Jogawat said before his surgery.
