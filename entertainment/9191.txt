Author JK Rowling offered her lighter to a fan who tweeted about burning Harry Potter books and films, following Rowling's criticism of US President Donald Trump's immigration ban. "Well, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money," read Rowling's tweet. She also thanked everyone for sending "lovely messages which outnumbered the bad ones".
