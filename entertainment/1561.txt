Ritesh Sidhwani, who co-produced 'Fukrey Returns', has said that the film's box-office success shows that the audience is coming for content and star value is not the only driving force. "If you have made a smaller film, there's no stopping...it, if you have a really good story to tell which can make people laugh," added Sidhwani.
