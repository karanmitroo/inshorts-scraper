Singer Kailash Kher has slammed actress Sonakshi Sinha's selection for the opening act at Justin Bieber's upcoming Mumbai concert. He added that actors are selected to perform with international singers instead of Indian singers as the event organisers are scared. "It doesn't give a good message internationally. Foreigners will think Sonakshi must be a big singer in India," said Kailash.
