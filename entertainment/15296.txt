Arunachal Pradesh Governor JP Rajkhowa on Thursday urged national award-winning filmmaker Jahnu Barua to make a film showcasing the state's cultural diversity and tradition by involving local artistes. The governor also requested the filmmaker to take up the issue of opium cultivation. "A message should go to the people of its ill effects," said Rajkhowa.
