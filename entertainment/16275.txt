Actor Amitabh Bachchan, who turned 73 on Sunday, said that a biopic on him would be a 'flop'. "I don't think a film should be made on me. I am not in that trend (biopic). I don't think I am capable of that", he said. Further, the actor said that a biopic on his father Harivanshrai Bachchan would be "okay".
