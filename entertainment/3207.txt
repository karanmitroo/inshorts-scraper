YouTube personality-comedian Bhuvan Bam has denied reports that he is a participant of the reality TV show Bigg Boss 11. "Papa ko laga bacche ne surprise diya hai. I told him that there's no such plan," said Bhuvan. He added money was never the bait and even though the makers pursued him, he never wanted to do the show.
