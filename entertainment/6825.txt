IPL presenter Archana Vijaya has clarified that RCB captain Virat Kohli was looking at the cue card and not at her ripped jeans in the photograph of them which went viral a few days ago. "We were playing a round of rapid fire and the poor guy was just trying to cheat by looking at the cue card," Vijaya said.
