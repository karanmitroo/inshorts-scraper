Playback singer Lata Mangeshkar on Saturday moved to the Bombay High Court, challenging a Maharashtra Government's order which declared a film studio located on her plot as a heritage structure. The 82-year-old singer, accusing authorities of trying to grab the plot, contended that the Government had not given a notice to her before declaring Jayprabha Studio as a heritage structure.
