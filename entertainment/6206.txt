Actor Randeep Hooda in a Facebook post addressed intolerance in India. He wrote that if any Muslim starts feeling unsafe in India or if any Dalit starts feeling insulted, they should stay away from news and religious debates. Randeep added that by looking at different castes, communities and religions, people should realise they're living in one of the best countries.
