A Ramlila programme in Muzaffarnagar featuring actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has been cancelled following opposition by some Hindu activists, police said on Thursday. The 42-year-old actor, who hails from Muzaffarnagar, had to play the character of 'Maricha' in the programme. According to the Ramayana, 'Maricha' was a rakshasa (demon) who was killed by Lord Ram.
