Actress Kalki Koechlin has said she's not getting tempting offers in commercial cinema. "I'd very much like to do mainstream as well as independent, thought-provoking work, but (it doesn't) come my way very often unfortunately," she added. Speaking of short films, Kalki said, "It's hard to make short films in terms of releasing them...online viewership is going to change that."
