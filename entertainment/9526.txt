Bollywood actor Anupam Kher said on Thursday while reciting a poem that the future of Kashmiri Pandits is in dark. "I don't think even 0.1% of them are staying there (Kashmir). We need to go back but we cannot go back in an atmosphere of fear. We cannot go back to the atmosphere of false security," Kher said.
