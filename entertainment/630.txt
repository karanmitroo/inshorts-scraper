Reacting to ongoing protests against the film 'Padmaavat', Vidya Balan said that it is one's fundamental right to make a film on any subject and screen it in theatres. Balan, who is also a CBFC member, said, "I feel every... film should be allowed to be released in the way it's been made... if you don't want to...watch it, don't."
