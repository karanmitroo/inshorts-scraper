Doctors at Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital have said veteran actor Dilip Kumar is recuperating well and is conscious but added that he'll be under observation in ICU for the next two-three days. "Today he has no fever, no breathlessness," said the hospital's Vice-President. The 94-year-old actor was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday after he suffered dehydration and urinary tract infection.
