Malayalam actress Priya Prakash Varrier, whose clip in the song 'Manikya Malaraya Poovi' has become viral, said she would like to be known as a good actor rather than being known as the wink queen. "This is a new feeling. But I am happy... I never expected that [the clip] would become such a big hit," she added.
