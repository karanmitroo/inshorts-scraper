Speaking on the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, actress Priyanka Chopra said that she is "very patriotic" but it is "unfair" that actors and artistes are "held responsible for every bigger political agenda". "[W]hatever my government decides is important to keep the country safe I go with that but... I don't believe that artistes are a representation," added Priyanka.
