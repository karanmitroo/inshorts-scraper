According to a popular theory, the trophy got its name when Academy librarian Margaret Herrick remarked that the award resembled her Uncle Oscar. In 1934, Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky used the term 'Oscar' in an article while referring to Katharine Hepburn's first Best Actress win. 'Oscar' was adopted as the official nickname for the Academy Award of Merit in 1939.
