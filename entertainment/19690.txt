Shah Rukh Khan, who set new benchmarks in Indian cinema with the use of new technology in Ra.One, says he would love to do Ra.One 2, but that could take time. "We have the latest technology and the equipment, but we lack trained technicians. For Ra.One, we had hired 50 foreign-trained technicians." Shah Rukh said.
