Amitabh Bachchan has revealed that he was once told by a film crew that if his second child was a son, he should name him Tiger. This was owing to the fact that he came to hear about his son Abhishek Bachchan's birth when he was fighting a live tiger during the shoot of the 1977 film 'Khoon Pasina'.
