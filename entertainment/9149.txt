Actor Varun Dhawan has said that like Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, he wants to make films for the entire country. "Also Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan. They do it wonderfully," he added. Varun further said that commercial films don't only mean 'masala' films but films that everyone in the country can watch.
