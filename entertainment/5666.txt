Late actress Carrie Fisher's autopsy report has revealed that she had cocaine, heroin and ecstasy in her system, which may have been consumed three days before her death. However, investigators could not determine the impact of these drugs on her death. Fisher, known for playing Princess Leia in 'Star Wars', passed away in 2016 following a heart attack.
