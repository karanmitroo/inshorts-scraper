Actor Sanjay Dutt is reportedly scheduled to be released from jail on February 27. The actor almost had his good conduct benefits cancelled for reporting to the jail two days after his previous parole expired. Without the benefits, Sanjay Dutt would have had to serve three more months for possessing illegal weapons following the 1993 Mumbai blasts.
