Several trolls have shared what they claim to be phone numbers of filmmakers Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Anurag Kashyap on Facebook. They further asked people not to abuse the filmmakers by calling them while adding that people are wise enough themselves. The political affiliations of the trolls could not be ascertained but some of their earlier posts reportedly opposed 'Padmaavat'.
