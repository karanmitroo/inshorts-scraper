Sony Music India will be offering paid access to Shah Rukh Khan and Diplo's collaboration 'Phurrr'. "We needed a big project with a must-listen song that had so much anticipation," said Shridhar Subramaniam, President of Sony Music Entertainment in India and Middle East. He added, "We're inserting a paid window in the music business which didn't exist prior to this."
