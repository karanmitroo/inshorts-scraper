Shraddha Kapoor has said that she was a possessive girlfriend in the past but she now wants to give space and allow her partner to do what he wants. "Earlier, I was like my man should have a good sense of humour, a sense of adventure... now I realise that love can happen with anyone," added Shraddha.
