Actress Sharmila Tagore was denied permission by the Pakistani immigration officials to cross the Wagah border into India on Sunday, for allegedly not having a 'police report' for staying in Lahore. Tagore who was on a four-day visit to participate in the Lahore Literary Festival, decided to leave for India later on Monday.
