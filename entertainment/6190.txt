Vidya Balan shared a picture holding an 'additional credit card' captioned, "Who needs credit when your director gifts you this...." This comes after Kangana Ranaut was credited for additional story in upcoming film Simran's poster before main writer Apurva Asrani. "Before Vidya could demand 'additional credit' on her new film, her producer gave her this," commented Asrani on the picture.
