Actress Kangana Ranaut on Sunday said that she would like to work with Irrfan Khan "regardless of whatever role is offered" to her. Responding to Irrfan's earlier comments that she had gone "so out of reach" that he would work with her only if he wishes to be a heroine, Kangana said, â€œHe always teases me."
