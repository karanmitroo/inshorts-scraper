While shooting for the 2012 film 'Django Unchained' actor Leonardo DiCaprio "slammed his hand on the table and hit a glass" and continued to shoot the scene while bleeding. "My hand started really pouring blood all over the table...maybe they thought it was done with special effects. I wanted to keep going," said Leonardo, who turned 42 on Friday.
