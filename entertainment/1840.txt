Actor Rishi Kapoor, while talking about the various kinds of roles he has played, said, "I have played positive roles, negative ones, the role of a gay man...I've done everything possible." Rishi added that he's thankful to the writers and directors who have written such parts for him, as it's very difficult for actors of his age to get work.
