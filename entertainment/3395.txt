A man claiming to be a resident of Pakistan hacked the official Instagram account of the upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding' demanding a role in the film. The hacker changed the account's display picture to that of a monkey and the bio read, "I am paki papu bhai." The film's team retrieved control of the account after 90 minutes.
