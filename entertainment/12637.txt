Eddie Vedder, the vocalist for the American rock band 'Pearl Jam', stopped a performance mid-song to throw out a fan, who was misbehaving with a woman at their concert in Chicago. Vedder shouted from the stage, "Hey, get your finger out of that woman’s face!" After the fan was escorted​ away, Vedder checked with the woman if she was fine.
