Hollywood actor Thomas Dekker, known for playing Zach in the television series 'Heroes', revealed on social media that he's gay and added that he married his husband in April this year. Dekker wrote that he decided to reveal his sexual orientation, after a "prominent gay man" referred to it indirectly at an award show recently.
