Hollywood actor Johnny Depp's former business company The Management Group (TMG), has claimed that the actor was a habitual liar, who also forced others to lie for him. They also added that Depp "denied responsibility for his own outrageous conduct". Notably, Depp had sued the company in January for over $25 million, charging fraud and negligence.
