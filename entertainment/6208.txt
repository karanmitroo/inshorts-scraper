Comedian Kapil Sharma took a dig at his brawl on a flight with comedian Sunil Grover in an episode of 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. In the episode's promo, the team can be seen in a plane setup with everybody fighting. When Kiku Sharda, dressed as an air hostess, asks Kapil to intervene, he says, "Nowadays, I don't speak on flights."
