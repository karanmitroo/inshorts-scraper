After filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali was physically assaulted on the sets of his film Padmavati, the founder of Rajput Karni Sena Lokendra Singh Kalvi has asked if the former would dare to make a film on Hitler in Germany. "Under our nose, on lands of Rajputs they tampered with the history of our ancestors," he added.
