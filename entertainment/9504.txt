Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt has said that his upcoming web series 'Maaya' is not inspired from the book and film series 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. "It's like saying Dangal is Sultan because they are about wrestling," added Vikram. He further said, "It's not as much about BDSM as it is about the internet and the anonymity that it gives."
