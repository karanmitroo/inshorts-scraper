Sandeep Singh, producer of Sanjay Dutt's film 'Bhoomi' questioned why would Dutt do an adult film on his comeback while reacting to reports that the Censor Board demanded 13 cuts in the film. "It's not a 'Hate Story' or a 'Great Grand Masti', which have double meaning dialogues," he added. Sandeep further said Bhoomi is a family action drama film.
