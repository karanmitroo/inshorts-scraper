Filmmaker Karan Johar, while talking about his sexual orientation, said, "I'm very proud of who I am and who I'll always be." He further said that people criticised him for not addressing his sexual orientation directly in his biography 'An Unsuitable Boy'. However, he added, "I've insinuated a lot and have said what I wanted to say in my book."
