Former 'Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai' actress Shilpa Shinde, while speaking about being fat-shamed for her item song 'Maro Line', said she is not looking vulgar. "I was fat when I shot for it... I have lost 6-7 kg since then," she added. Shilpa further said, "I really don't care if I was or am still being trolled."
