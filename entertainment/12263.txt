Celebrity choreographer Wade Robson has accused late singer Michael Jackson of running the most sophisticated child sex abuse operation 'the world has ever known'. Wade has sued MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures in a new complaint stating that children were invited to Neverland Ranch and molested by the singer. Earlier, Wade claimed that Jackson molested him when he was seven.
