Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that it is time to get “children” out of the Central Board of Film Certification and not allow the Censor Board to examine adult films like 'Saat Uchakkey' and 'Haraamkhor'. Both the films have reportedly been rejected by the Censor Board. Kashyap added, “Can we please just go straight to the Tribunal to save time.”
