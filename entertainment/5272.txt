Rakhi Sawant appeared before a Ludhiana court wearing a burqa on Thursday, a day before her hearing in the case of allegedly making objectionable remarks against sage Valmiki. She was granted bail after furnishing two bail bonds worth â‚¹1 lakh each. In April, Rakhi submitted an apology stating she never spoke against Valmiki after non-bailable warrants were issued against her.
