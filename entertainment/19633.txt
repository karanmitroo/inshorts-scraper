Hollywood star Tom Cruise (51) has reportedly launched a search to find a new girlfriend after splitting from his ex-wife Katie Holmes. It is also reported that Cruise met an "unidentified actor" at a recent gala event for this purpose. Last month, former Scientologist Anette Iren Johansen claimed she had been "auditioned" to be Cruise's wife in 2005.
