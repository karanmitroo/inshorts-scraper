Actress Emma Watson was left with bleeding lips after filming repeated takes of a passionate scene with Douglas Booth for the movie “Noah”. Watson plays Booth's onscreen wife and they had difficulties shooting a sequence in which they run at each other before embracing. Watson said that by the sixth take Booth also had a sore nose and swollen mouth.
