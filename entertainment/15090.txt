Actress Kangana Ranaut, who is reportedly the highest paid actress in Bollywood currently, has recently said in an interview that she is still underpaid in comparison to male counterparts. "I think guys still get paid a lot more than girls do. But now, women have found expression in cinema...roles aren't limited to two scenes and one item song," Kangana added.
