The animated film 'Minions' that hit the screens this week was cuteness overloaded with charming elements galore, adorable gibberish talk and winsome screen presence, said TOI. "It's harmless fun, and the kids will surely enjoy it," wrote Mid-Day. The film that serves as a prequel to the 'Despicable Me' series has been rated 2.5/5 (HT), 3/5 (Mid-Day) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
