Ranbir Kapoor has said the upcoming biopic on Sanjay Dutt is not propaganda to portray him as God. "We're trying to show a very human side of Sanjay Dutt, his perils, his downfall, his time in jail, terrorism charges, his drug phase...," he added. Ranbir further said Dutt has never been a hypocrite about his life.
