Hrithik Roshan, who will be seen in a triple role in upcoming movie Krrish 3, had to spend nearly four-and-half hours in makeup to portray the strikingly different looks.  Hrithik was assisted by prosthetic expert, Mike Stringer, who is best known for Lord of the Rings trilogy. The 39-year-old actor says that the journey has been a fairly challenging one.
