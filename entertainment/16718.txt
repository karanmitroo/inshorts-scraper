Criticising the ban on several porn sites in India, filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma has called the move “regressive”. “Any deprivation of personal liberty of an individual... amounts to regression of social progress of that country," he tweeted. "It’s a proven fact by international surveys that instead of fuelling sexual crimes porn actually provides safer outlet for sexual repression,” Verma added.
