Walt Disney’s original Disneyland map has been sold for $708,000 (₹4.56 crore) at an auction in Los Angeles. It is believed to be the most expensive Disneyland map ever sold. Created by Walt Disney and Herb Ryman, the map was hand-inked and hand-coloured and was used to secure initial funding for the first Disney theme park in Anaheim in 1953.
