Star Wars actor John Boyega, while slamming HBO television series 'Game of Thrones' for lack of diversity, said there are no black people on the show. He added, "I ain't paying money to always see one type of person on-screen." Significantly, actors Nonso Anozie and DeObia Oparei, both of Nigerian descent, have featured on the show.
