Tiger Shroff has said that he's not even half the man his father Jackie Shroff is. He said this in response to filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma's tweet as he shared Tiger's picture and wrote that "real men" like Jackie Shroff never pose like Urmila. "He is a senior director, so, there's not much I can say to him," added Tiger.
