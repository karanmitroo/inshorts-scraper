Actress Kajol has said that she doesn't understand the term 'size zero' and doesn't allow critics to pressurise her. She added, "I wear regular...clothes which are comfortable. It's not airport fashion...I am not walking in heels with perfect lipstick. After long flights, everyone looks like they survived a calamity." Kajol further said that she doesn't take the fashion police seriously.
