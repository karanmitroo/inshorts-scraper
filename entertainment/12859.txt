As per reports, a store in Malaysia was fined around Â£76 for displaying a poster of actress Aishwarya Rai as the local Municipal Council found it "too sexy". The store owner was instructed to remove the advertisements which reportedly included Aishwarya's advertisement for the watch brand 'Longines'. The council can refuse to issue business permits if shops display sexy photographs.
