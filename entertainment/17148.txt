A Jodhpur sessions court Thursday rejected actor Salman Khan's plea seeking re-examination of witnesses in the Arms Act case against him in connection with the blackbuck poaching case. Salman is accused of using expired licence guns to allegedly poach the endangered animal in Jodhpur on Oct-1, 1998. He pleaded 'not guilty' in the case on Apr-29 before the Jodhpur court.
