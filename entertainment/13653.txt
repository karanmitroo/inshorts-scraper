The release date of the Jimmy Shergill starrer 'Shorgul' has been shifted to July 1. The date was reportedly shifted after allegations, including a fatwa against Shergill, that 'Shorgul' will hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community as it revolves around the Muzaffarnagar riots. However, Shorgul's director Pranav Singh said, "There is nothing in the film which will hurt anyone."
