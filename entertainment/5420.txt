Tiger Shroff has said that he doesn't think actress Soha Ali Khan did anything wrong by wearing a sari. This comes after Soha, who's pregnant with her first child, was slammed for sharing a picture of herself in a sari and not sharing Eid greetings. "I think everybody has...the right to do or don't do whatever they like," added Tiger.
