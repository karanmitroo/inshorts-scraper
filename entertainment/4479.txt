Actor Vicky Kaushal took to Instagram to share an old picture with Hrithik Roshan on the sets of the 2000 film 'Fiza'. "I was a crazy fan like many others," wrote Vicky. He further revealed he practised dancing to the song 'Ek Pal Ka Jeena' as someone told him jokingly that Hrithik only meets children who can dance to it.
