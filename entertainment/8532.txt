Actress Jennifer Lawrence fell down at Oscars 2013 as she tripped on her 'Dior' dress when she was climbing the stairs to the stage. She had been called to accept the Best Actress award for 'Silver Linings Playbook'. In her acceptance speech, Lawrence joked, "You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell. That's really embarrassing."
