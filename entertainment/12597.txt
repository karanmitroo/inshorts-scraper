'Between Musicâ€™, a Danish five-member music group, is an 'aquatic music band', who performed their first ever underwater concert 'Aquasonic' in Netherlands earlier this year. The band sings and plays musical instruments, which were made especially for playing underwater. The musicians can spend up to nine hours inside the customised portable individual glass chambers from where they perform.
