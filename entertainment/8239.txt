Actor Randeep Hooda said that he should have been more careful about his tweet related to Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur. He explained that he retweeted Virender Sehwag's tweet because he found it funny and did not even know who Gurmehar was at that time. "Whether it is a man or a woman, it is wrong to troll," he added.
