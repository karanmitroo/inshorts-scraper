Filmmaker Rohit Shetty is under the CBI's scanner for allegedly bribing former Censor Board chief Rakesh Kumar. Reportedly, Kumar had asked Shetty to cut several scenes and dialogues from 'Singham Returns' citing the issue of hurting religious sentiments. Shetty refused to enforce all the suggested cuts and paid Rs 2 lakh to Kumar to get the censor certificate.
