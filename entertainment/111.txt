Producer Harvey Weinstein's insurers have refused to pay in his defence of 11 lawsuits alleging sexual assault. Five insurance companies had asked a New York Supreme Court judge to absolve them of any obligation to assist the Hollywood producer. They argued that Harvey's more than 80 policies did not cover his alleged misconduct because they were intentional acts.
