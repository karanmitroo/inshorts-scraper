The Delhi High Court, while dismissing a plea against 'Padmavati', asked the petitioner, "Have you seen the film?" "Have the people who are burning cinema halls seen the film? By this kind of petitions, you are encouraging the people who are agitating," the bench added. It further directed the petitioner to approach the Censor Board over the matter.
