As per reports, singer Adele will marry her long-time partner Simon Konecki in the United Kingdom. Adele and Simon are said to have planned for a Christmas wedding but postponed it as the festive season made it difficult for all their family members to attend the wedding in the US. She reportedly got engaged to Simon in October last year.
