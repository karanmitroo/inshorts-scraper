Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that if he had been born in the US, he would've run for the US president this year. "Because now? This was a very good time to get in the race," the 69-year-old actor added. Recently, in a statement on Twitter, the actor said "he won't be voting for the Republican candidate for President".
