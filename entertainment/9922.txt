Veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar, who is 87 now, has confirmed that she's back to recording, after a gap of two years, with her rendition of the Rama Raksha Strotra (38 couplets devoted to Lord Rama). "I've been missing my singing. The last two years have not been too kind to my health. But this year, I'm far better," said Mangeshkar.
