Television actress Divyanka Tripathi has said if people think TV actors cannot endorse a popular brand, she would consider it backward thinking. "We've become a brand in ourselves, beyond our shows. My fans look up to me," she added. Divyanka further said the number of followers TV actors have on social media isn't any less than that of film actors.
