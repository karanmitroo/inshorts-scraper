In a ruling over a petition challenging liquor prohibition in the state, the Kerala High Court quoted Nobel laureate Bob Dylan's popular song 'The Times They Are a-Changin' while dismissing the plea. Adding that what is socially unacceptable may not be so tomorrow, the court asked the petitioner to have hope as "the times they are a-changing."
