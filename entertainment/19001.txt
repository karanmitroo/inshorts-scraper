Superstar Rajinikanth (63) has seemingly overcome his initial hesitation about romancing his friend, Shatrughan Sinha's daughter Sonakshi Sinha (27), as she is all set to play his love interest in her Tamil debut. "I could not have asked for a better project to start with; it's opposite Rajini sir," Sonakshi said. The film is aiming for a Diwali release.
