A trailer for Jobs, the film about the late Steve Jobs starring Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak, has debuted specifically on Instagram. Earlier, in June, a YouTube trailer had arrived. Apart from the indie film which will hit theatres on Aug-16, Sony Pictures is also creating another movie based on Jobs biography written by Walter Isaacson.
