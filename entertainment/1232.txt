The horror film 'Insidious: The Last Key', which released today, "doesn't have the slightest enthusiasm to muster up something fresh," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). "The script... is full of dead, baseless and illogical scenes," wrote Koimoi. Meanwhile, Firstpost wrote that the film is "frightening in a satisfyingly creepy way." It has been rated 1.5/5 (Koimoi), 2/5 (HT) and 3/5 (Firstpost).
