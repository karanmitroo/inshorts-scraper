Mumbai civic body on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to RK Studios for violating safety rules after a fire broke out at the studio recently. Officials said the studio lacked sprinklers and fire detectors which led to rapid spread of fire endangering people's lives. Notably, no shooting will be allowed at the studio until it replies to the notice.
