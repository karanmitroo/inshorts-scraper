In a video uploaded by YouTube channel 'BLUSH' on Monday, Bollywood actress Kalki Koechlin has performed on a self-written poem 'The Printing Machine', a satire on print and social media. Wrapped in a bandage dress, Koechlin talks about issues which Indian women grapple with on a day-to-day basis - from rapes to acid attacks and curfews for returning home late.
