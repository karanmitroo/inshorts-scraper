Actress Jennifer Aniston has said that she's been shamed over her marital status, divorce, lack of a mate and even her nipples. "I just thought: 'I have worked too hard in this life and this career to be whittled down to a sad, childless human'," said Aniston. She added how she is currently trying to figure out what inspires her.
