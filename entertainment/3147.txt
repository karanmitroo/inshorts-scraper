As per reports, actor Ranveer Singh is visiting a psychiatrist to get rid of the negative mindset he created while playing the character Alauddin Khilji for the upcoming film 'Padmavati'. "The film has also been shot for almost a year now, so sustaining the Khilji persona was very challenging. It affected his reactions and behaviour towards people," said a source.
