Actor Ranveer Singh strongly refuted media reports which claimed that he had been suffering from depression and was also consulting a therapist for the same. Ranveer lashed out at the media house in question through his Facebook post on Tuesday morning, especially for linking reports about his condition with that of actress Deepika Padukone, thereby belittling her case of depression.
