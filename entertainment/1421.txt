Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Saturday said Reliance Industries Founder Dhirubhai Ambani offered to help him when he went bankrupt in the 1990s. "I politely refused his offer and slowly, by God's grace, started to get work again which helped clear my debts," Bachchan said. He also recalled Dhirubhai saying, "This boy had fallen down but got up on his own."
