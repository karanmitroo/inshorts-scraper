Reacting to a picture of Ranveer Singh where he can be seen imitating yesteryear actor Manoj Kumar's signature hand-on-face pose, Manoj Kumar said, "What Ranveer did was in good taste." Ranveer's photo was captioned, "Workin' the Manoj Kumar." Notably, Kumar had earlier filed a defamation case against Shah Rukh Khan for mimicking him in 'Om Shanti Om'.
