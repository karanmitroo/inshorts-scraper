Comedian Sunil Pal has blamed the rift between Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover for comedy being in the hands of "so called YouTube comedians" now. "They talk about toilets in the name of comedy. The irresponsible youth has made stars out of these comedians," he added. Notably, Kapil's show will go on a short break owing to his ill health.
