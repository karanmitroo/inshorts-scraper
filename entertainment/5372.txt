The Bombay High Court has given two weeks to the Maharashtra government to explain actor Sanjay Dutt's early release from prison, following his conviction in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case. The court gave the order in view of a public interest litigation filed by activist Pradeep Bhalekar, who challenged Dutt's early release and questioned the frequent paroles he received.
