Television producer Steven Moffatt has released the trailer of a Christmas special of BBC’s "Sherlock" at San Diego’s Comic-Con. While Moffatt’s contemporary take on Arthur Conan Doyle’s creation was much talked about, he has taken the new episode back to the original victorian setting. He claimed to take it to the ‘correct’ era, keeping alive “a sprinkling of post-modern wit”.
