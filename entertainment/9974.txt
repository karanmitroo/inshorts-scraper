Several songs were re-created in Bollywood in 2016, including 'Kala Chashma' from 'Baar Baar Dekho', which is a rendition of 'Tenu Kala Chashma Jachda Hai' by Amar Arshi. 'The Humma Song' from 'OK Jaanu' was originally titled 'Hamma Hamma' and featured in 'Bombay'. Meanwhile, 'Laila Main Laila' in 'Raees' is based on the song 'Laila O Laila' from 'Qurbani'.
