Yash Raj Films (YRF) on Tuesday announced that Salman Khan-starrer 'Sultan' will release on Eid next year. The announcement made on Twitter also had a link to a 30-second YouTube audio clip wherein an announcer calls wrestler Sultan as 'Haryana ki shaan and jaan'. "Wrestling isn't a sport, it's about fighting what lies within" is Sultan's motto in the film.
