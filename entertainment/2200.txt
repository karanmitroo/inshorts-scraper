Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone sexually assaulted a teen and forced her into a threesome while shooting for a film in 1980s, according to old police reports published online. The teenager had said that while she consented to have sex with Stallone, she did not give her consent to the threesome. However, Stallone's spokesperson called the report a "false story".
