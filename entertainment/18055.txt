A Lucknow-based group Hindu Front For Justice filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), seeking a ban on Aamir Khan's recently released film PK, for allegedly hurting sentiments of Hindus. The PIL also demanded a quashing of the certificate issued to the film, for portraying Hindu gods and goddesses in a derogatory manner. The petition will be heard on Tuesday.
