A fan nearly grabbed Taylor Swift's ankle as the pop-singer was performing at a concert in Alberta (Canada) on Tuesday night. She was startled by the act, but just stared him down and continued performing. An Instagram user made a video of the entire incident and posted it on the photo-sharing app.
