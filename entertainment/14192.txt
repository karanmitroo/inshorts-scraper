Several Congress workers in Allahabad's Shivaji Park area on Monday pasted labels displaying Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor's name outside a public toilet. The move came after the 63-year-old recently took to Twitter and questioned the naming of country's assets after the Gandhi family. Kapoor's tweets had also led to protests outside his Mumbai residence last week.
