The Randeep Hooda and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan starrer 'Sarbjit' may not be released in Pakistan as no major distribution company in the country has approached Pakistanâ€™s Central Board of Film Censors for it. A film's content has to be reviewed by the censor board before its release in Pakistan. 'Sarbjit' is reportedly being viewed as an anti-Pakistan film.
