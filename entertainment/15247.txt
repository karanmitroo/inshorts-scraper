A petition has been filed in the Bombay High Court against actor Sanjay Dutt's release on the morning of February 25. Citing inequality, social activist Pradeep Bhalekar, with his public interest litigation, hopes to get the 56-year-old actor's release order canceled.
Dutt is set to be released after serving the remainder of his five-year sentence for possession of illegal arms.
