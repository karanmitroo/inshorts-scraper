Actress Paz de la Huerta has accused producer Harvey Weinstein of raping her twice in her apartment in 2010. "I felt so disgusted by it, with myself. I became a little self-destructive. It was really hard for me to deal, to cope," she said while talking about the aftermath. Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment by over 40 women.
