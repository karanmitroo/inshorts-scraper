Actress Angelina Jolie will continue to have sole custody of her six children, while Brad Pitt will have "therapeutic visits" for the time being, according to a representative of the actress. It is unclear what "therapeutic visits" entailed. Pitt filed a legal response on Friday, seeking joint custody of their children, while Jolie earlier asked for sole physical custody.
