Actor Sushant Singh Rajput has said that after playing the lead role in the biopic MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, if he says whatever he feels, people think that he has become arrogant. "Before MS, when I used to speak my mind, people used to tell me, 'Oh you are such a refreshing personality in the industry'," added Sushant.
