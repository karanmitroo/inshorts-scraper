Actor Arshad Warsi has done the Hindi dubbing for Hollywood actor Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film. "I don't think anyone would have passed on such an opportunity," said Arshad. Talking about his dubbing experience, he revealed that it was challenging as Depp's character is either heavily drunk or hungover throughout the film.
