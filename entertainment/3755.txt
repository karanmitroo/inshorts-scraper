Alf Clausen, who composed music for animated sitcom 'The Simpsons' for 27 years has been fired. Alf, who won 2 Emmy Awards for the show, said he received a call from producer Richard Sakai telling him the company was seeking "a different kind of music." It is speculated that his dismissal is related to cost-cutting measures by the show's makers.
