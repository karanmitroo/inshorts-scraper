British singer George Michael was buried in London on Wednesday in a private funeral, over three months after his death on Christmas last year. His former partner Kenny Goss and Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley were among attendees at the funeral. George's boyfriend Fadi Fawaz was reportedly unaware about the funeral and attended only after being informed by a media person.
