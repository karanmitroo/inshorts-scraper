Bollywood's action star Akshay Kumar, who is equally good at comedy, says he is open to doing sex comedies because for him it would be just "a character". "Nobody is forcing you to watch such films. 'Grand Masti' did well at the box office, but if you don't like it then don't watch it," said Akshay.
