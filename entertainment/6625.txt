Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has said he's happy and relieved that the Rajinikanth-Akshay Kumar starrer '2.0' isn't releasing on Diwali, the same day as his film 'Golmaal Again'. He added, "We know if we release a film with another big film, business does get affected." Earlier, Aamir's 'Secret Superstar', 'Golmaal Again' and '2.0' were scheduled to release on Diwali this year.
