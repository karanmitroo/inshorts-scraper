Ravikanth Perepu, the director of Telugu film 'Kshanam' of which Tiger Shroff's 'Baaghi 2' is a remake, has expressed his disappointment on not giving the credit to the original script writer in the recently released trailer. The filmmaker added, "Giving the writers (of 'Kshanam') credit is essential, especially since ('Baaghi 2') is being made on a national scale."
