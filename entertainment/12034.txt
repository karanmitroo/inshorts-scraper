Actor Matt LeBlanc is set to return as the host for the television series 'Top Gear'. He reportedly signed a two-year contract for around Â£2 million. "He's a huge talent whose love of cars is infectious," said BBC Two editor Patrick Holland. Earlier, LeBlanc's co-host Chris Evans had quit the show following record low viewings for the show's finale.
