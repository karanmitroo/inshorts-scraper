Actress Shabana Azmi has said that it seems the society will crumble and fall down if women express their sexuality. Shabana said this in response to the Censor Board banning the film 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' for being "lady-oriented". She added, "You cannot have a healthy society unless women and men get equal opportunities."
