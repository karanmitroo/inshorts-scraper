Actress Kangana Ranaut, while promoting her upcoming film 'Rangoon' on the sets of a reality show, said that she wanted to slap the show's host Sugandha Mishra after she mimicked her. A source from the sets said it was an awkward moment for Sugandha after Kangana's statement. However, Sugandha took it sportingly and continued with the shoot.
