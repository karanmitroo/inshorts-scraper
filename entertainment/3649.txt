Creative director of 'The Kapil Sharma Show' Rajiv Dhingra has said that Kapil's empire has been brought down by the people he trusted. Rajiv was earlier accused of being the reason behind show's mismanagement. He added, "Those spreading such lies about me should...see how much they've damaged Kapil's image and how prominently they've contributed to the show's closure."
