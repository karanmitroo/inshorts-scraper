As many as 230 head constables in Telangana's Adilabad district were, on Thursday, given an off for a day so that they could watch recently released Telugu movie 'Head Constable Venkatramaiah'. The theme of the movie is good and it will boost morale and integrity of the profession besides instilling confidence among policemen, the district SP Mitta Srinivas said.
