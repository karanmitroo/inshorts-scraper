Singer Shreya Ghoshal is set to get a wax figure at the Madame Tussauds in New Delhi. Ghoshal said, "it is an honour to be featured among such talented stars, artists, historians and renowned celebrities." The wax museum, which will open later this year, will also feature wax figures of Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan.
