Former Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) Chairman Gajendra Chauhan, while speaking about Anupam Kher's appointment as the new Chairman said, "One doesnâ€™t have to be just an actor or director, but a good administrator." "Given the kind of person Anupam is, I think he'll do really well," he added. Chauhan further said he is yet to congratulate Kher.
