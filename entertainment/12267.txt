Filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker has revealed that actor Hrithik Roshan was in a "state of turmoil" when they had started shooting for 'Mohenjo Daro' last year. "But Hrithik never let that show on the sets. He kept it within himself. There were times when we told him to take a break but he was mentally strong and kept going," added Gowariker.
