Tiger Shroff and Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer 'Munna Michael', which released on Friday, is "a film where everybody would look disinterested and jump on a chance to break into a song," wrote HT. NDTV called it "a mixed-genre monstrosity that never hits any kind of rhythm," while Koimoi wrote, "The script...lacks purpose". It was rated 1/5 (HT) and 1.5/5 (NDTV, Koimoi).
