Six months after leaving the show, Sunil Grover, best known as Gutthi, is set to return to Kapil Sharma's ‘Comedy Nights’. Last November, he moved out of the show, citing creative differences. But his show ‘Mad In India’, launched in Feb, failed and was pulled off air prematurely in May. Kapil and Sunil remained unavailable for comment.
