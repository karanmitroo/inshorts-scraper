Angels Flight, the Los Angeles cable railway featured in the movie 'La La Land' when its characters are on a date, will reopen in September after three years. Making the announcement, Mayor Eric Garcetti said, "As anyone who has seen 'La La Land' can tell you, dreams do still come true here". The 116-year-old railway was closed after several accidents.
