Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol-starrer 'Dilwale' which released on Friday, is a plotless drag with nothing new in it, said Indian Express. It has a very predictable story but is immensely enjoyable, wrote India Today. Calling it a 'bizarre love story', NDTV said Kajol was fantastic. 'Dilwale' has been rated 1/5 (Indian Express), 2.5/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (India Today, TOI).
