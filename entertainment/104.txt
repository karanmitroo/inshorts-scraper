Neil Patrick Harris, who hosted the 2015 Oscar ceremony, presented a segment of the award show in his underwear. He re-enacted a scene from 'Birdman' in which Michael Keaton gets locked outside a theatre in Times Square in his underwear. "A second pair of underwear [was sewn] to the first so you couldn't see through it," Neil later revealed.
