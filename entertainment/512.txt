Brahmin group Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha has withdrawn their protest against Kangana Ranaut's 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' after receiving a written assurance from the producers that there is no distortion of history with respect to Rani Lakshmibai. Producer Kamal Jain wrote, "There is no romantic song...with the Britishers. We are making 'Manikarnika' with huge respect towards the great woman."
