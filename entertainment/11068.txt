Actor Ajay Devgn has said that even though his film was "suffering" due to demonetisation of
₹500 and ₹1000 notes, this inconvenience was "trivial" in front of "nation's interest". Earlier, he showed support for PM Modi's move by tweeting, "100 सोनार की, 1 लोहार की।Masterstroke @narendramodi." Meanwhile, the shoot of Devgn's 'Baadshaho' has been postponed following the government's decision.
