Kangana Ranaut and R Madhavan-starrer 'Tanu Weds Manu Returns' that released on Friday is a "total delight that keeps you laughing, sighing, cheering, and guessing throughout," said TOI. "It takes a lot of efforts to take your eyes off Kangana, who dazzles with dual performances," said Mid-Day. The film has been rated 3.5/5 (NDTV, Mid-Day), 4/5 (HT) and 4.5/5 (TOI).
