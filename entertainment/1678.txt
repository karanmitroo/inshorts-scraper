Actress Rani Mukerji has said she has had a stammering problem which she successfully hid for 22 years. She added, "I was very conscious of it early on in life, so I made sure... I worked towards my lines in such a way... (so I could) camouflage that." Rani further said that even her team was unaware about her problem.
