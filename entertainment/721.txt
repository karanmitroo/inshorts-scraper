Author Chetan Bhagat has said that it is a bad Budget for the rich people. He claimed that being in a good spot in the economy doesn't mean that every Indian is doing well if the economy is doing good. "No government can claim it has solved unemployment problem. The attitude should be they need to do more," he added.
