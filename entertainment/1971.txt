British actress Angela Lansbury, who voiced the character Mrs Potts in the 1991 animated film 'Beauty and the Beast', said, "We (women) can't make ourselves look...attractive...without being knocked down and raped." She added that over the years, women have tried to look more attractive which has backfired on them. Angela further said, "We must sometimes take blame."
