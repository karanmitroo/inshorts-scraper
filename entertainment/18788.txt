Some residents of an Air India Co-operative Housing Society in Mumbai have complained that actor Arshad Warsi (of Munnabhai MBBS fame), in blatant violation of BMC regulations, is constructing a second floor on a bungalow he bought in the society. In September last year, the society had complained to the BMC, following which part of the unauthorised structure was demolished.
