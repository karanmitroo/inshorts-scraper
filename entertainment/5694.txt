CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani, when asked about a no objection certificate (NOC) from the Gandhi family for the upcoming film 'Indu Sarkar', said, "There's no mention of Indira Gandhi or Sanjay Gandhi in the trailer." The CBFC usually asks for an NOC  from the concerned people before the release of a film, if it revolves around real people and situations.
