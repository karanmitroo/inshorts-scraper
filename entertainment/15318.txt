The Supreme Court today issued a notice to Salman Khan on the Maharashtra Government's plea challenging his acquittal by the Bombay High Court in the 2002 hit-and-run case. Issuing a notice returnable in six months, the court said, "It would be much better if he (Salman) gets acquittal from this court as it will save him from all the repercussions".
