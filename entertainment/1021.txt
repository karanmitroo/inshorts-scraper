While talking about his struggling days in the film industry for 17 years, 'Mukkabaaz' actor Vineet Kumar Singh said, "I used to skip a roti to ensure I had money for the local train ticket." Vineet, who had no godfathers in the industry, added he used to try and meet filmmakers without taking appointments but watchmen would chase him away.
