Pakistani actress Saba Qamar, while clarifying her comments over calling Salman Khan 'chichora' (indecent), said, "Why would I say anything bad about him?" Qamar added, "It was a fun show... There was nothing in it... 'Koffee With Karan' mein kya kuchh nahi hota (What all does not happen on Koffee With Karan)... he's (Salman) a big superstar and so humble."
