The words gay and virgin were muted in an episode, which was on the issue of homosexuality, on MTV's show Big F. The episode is about a teenager, who is yet to reveal that he's gay as he is under peer pressure, and his interactions with a girl, who works as a prostitute to pay for her mother's medical bills.
