Lyricist Javed Akhtar has said that not Westernisation, but it is social segregation and economic divide in the society, which leads to incidents of rape and molestation in India. "What happened...in Delhi (Nirbhaya gang rape) does not reflect lust or want for sex. It showed anger, frustration...against the society. They did not just rape her, it was brutality," he added.
