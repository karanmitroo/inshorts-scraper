Actress Sonam Kapoor has said she doesn't believe in censorship, adding that everybody should have the choice to wear either a burkha or a bikini. She added, "We're supposed to be the largest democracy in the world...so we should have the right to lead...life according to (our) choices." Sonam further said there will be more rebellions if censorship continues.
