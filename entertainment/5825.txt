Aamir Khan starrer Dangal has hit $300 million (₹1,900 crore) worldwide box office collections milestone, making it the 5th biggest non-English movie ever. Only four other movies - China's 'The Mermaid' and 'Monster Hunt', France's 'The Intouchables', and Japan's 'Your Name', have achieved this milestone. Last month, Dangal became the first Indian movie to earn over ₹1,000 crore in China.
