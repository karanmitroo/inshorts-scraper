Actress Priyanka Chopra has revealed that when she was around 18 or 19, a director once told her she would be replaced if she wouldn't work on "ridiculous terms" or low salary. "Because girls are replaceable in the entertainment business. That was a memorable one, made me decide to make myself irreplaceable," she added.
