Objecting to some of the scenes of Bollywood film 'Dirty Politics', the Patna High Court on Tuesday banned its release, a government lawyer said. The ruling came after a petitioner informed the court that the film shows its lead actress Mallika Sherawat draped in India's national flag, thereby insulting and dishonouring the flag.
