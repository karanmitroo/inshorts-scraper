The Karnataka government has assured security for audiences going for Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Dilwale.' The decision came post the Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad's protests against the film's screening after SRK's remarks on intolerance. "We will not tolerate any kind of moral policing. Film audiences can watch the movie without anybody's fear," said state Home Minister G Parameshwara.
