Actor Irrfan Khan has said that while Hollywood will keep growing, India won't have many films like Baahubali. He added, "It is praiseworthy that an Indian director is trying to make a product...at par with Hollywood. [But] we need more [such films]." Irrfan further said that Hindi films need to come up with stories the local guy can relate to.
