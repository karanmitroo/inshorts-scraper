Actor and BJP MP Paresh Rawal has apologised for his tweet in which he had taken a jibe at Congress. The tweet was in response to a meme by Congress' youth wing's online magazine which mocked PM Narendra Modi's past as a tea seller. "Deleted the tweet as it's in bad taste and I apologise for hurting feelings," wrote Paresh.
