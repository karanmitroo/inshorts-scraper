Keeping their differences aside, Shah Rukh and Salman Khan hugged each other Thursday at the Star Guild Awards 2014. Salman, who was the host of the show, breaked the ice by saying - "Shah Rukh kya ho raha hai?" This is their second hug (the first being the last yearâ€™s Iftar party hug) since their alleged 2008 fight.
