American actor and comedian Mike Epps was criticised for animal abuse after he brought a chained kangaroo on stage during his recent show in Detroit. Videos showed the kangaroo being held upright, and 'punching' Epps, after which the actor ran off the stage. The actor, who is best known for his role in 'The Hangover', later apologised for the incident.
