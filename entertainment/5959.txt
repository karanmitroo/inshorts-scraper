The release date of the Saif Ali Khan starrer Chef has been postponed to October 6 from its earlier release scheduled for July 14, which is also the release date for Ranbir Kapoor's Jagga Jasoos. "We want to release the film at a time when the entire family can go out and watch it," said Chef's director Raja Krishna Menon.
