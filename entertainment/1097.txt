Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has said that Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmaavat' will not be released in the state. He had already banned the film in the state before the Assembly elections in December. Rupani had earlier said that the state banned it because of the way women have been represented in the film.
