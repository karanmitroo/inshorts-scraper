Indian music composer AR Rahman is facing a tax evasion charge related to a $7,50,000 payment received from a UK-based mobile company Lebara for composing their ringtone in 2010-11. The Income Tax department has alleged that the Oscar-winning composer got the money transferred to the AR Rahman Foundation (a trust), which didn't have permissions to accept foreign donations.
