Actor Ayushmann Khurrana has said that pure singers are here to stay and nobody can ever replace them. He added, "If actors are singing for themselves and for their character on screen...[then] that is allowed." Notably, Ayushmann sang the song 'Pani Da Rang' for his Bollywood debut film 'Vicky Donor' (2012).
