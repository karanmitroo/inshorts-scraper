The Australian government has invited Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio to visit the Great Barrier Reef and help in its conservation efforts. This comes after DiCaprioâ€™s comments on the recent bleaching impacts on world's largest coral reef system. Notably, 93% of the reef is affected by bleaching and almost a quarter of its corals are deemed to have died.
