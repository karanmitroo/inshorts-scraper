Speaking at the trailer launch of his upcoming movie ‘Fan’ Shah Rukh Khan on Monday said that freedom of speech also "means the right to keep silent". “When I would watch Mumbai Indians’ match against KKR, the only one appeal I would make is ‘Out’... I am not getting into this... I am very silent about this", he added.
