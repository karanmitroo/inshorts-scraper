Actress Bipasha Basu has written an open letter in which she has slammed the organisers of a fashion show, who accused her of being unprofessional after she walked out if it. "[T]he defaulters are playing the victim card and making up ridiculous stories," she wrote. Bipasha further wrote the organisers did not honour the conditions that they had agreed upon.
