After Maharashtra, Delhi, Goa and MP, RO Mehra's "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" was made tax-free in Haryana. Mehra says the reason for getting the film tax-free is an attempt to increase its reach to every nook and corner of country to inspire the youth. He wants it to fit into monthly-budget of people, so that they can watch it in theatres.
