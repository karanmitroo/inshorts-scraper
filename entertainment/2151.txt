Stating that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's apology for his tweet on Miss World Manushi Chhillar wasn't genuine, National Commission for Women (NCW) chief Rekha Sharma asked him to "apologise properly to the nation". Tharoor had apologised for the pun on Chhillar's name in his tweet against demonetisation saying that the tweet was light-hearted and didn't mean offence to Chhillar.
