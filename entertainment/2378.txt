American television host Ellen DeGeneres' wife Portia de Rossi has claimed actor-producer Steven Seagal once unzipped his pants while she was at his office for an audition. She tweeted, "He told me how important it was to have chemistry off-screen." Portia added, "I ran out... called my agent. Unfazed, she replied, 'well, I didn't know if he was your type'."
