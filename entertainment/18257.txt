Actor Salman Khan Friday appeared before a Jodhpur court hearing two cases regarding the 1998 black buck poaching incident, without any summon. According to Salman's  counsel Hastimal Saraswat, "...since he was in the city for some other work, he made it a point to appear in court as a gesture of responsibility and respect for the court".
