Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that she can't force someone to give her an award. "Maybe other actors can, but that's not my personality," she added. Responding to Alia Bhatt receiving the Best Actress award for 'Udta Punjab' at Star Screen Awards, she said, "...it was what they thought was the best. I was not offended."
