Actress Alia Bhatt said that if the jokes on her stop coming, she will be upset. She added, "I'm either relevant or irrelevant. If I'm crossing your mind at any point of the day, I am relevant." Significantly, Alia was trolled on social media after she said that Prithviraj Chauhan is India's President on a Koffee with Karan episode.
