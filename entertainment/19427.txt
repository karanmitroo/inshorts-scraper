Director Vishal Bhardwaj had to pack-up the shooting of Shahid Kapoor starrer 'Haider' inside the Kashmir University at Hazratbal when students living in the on-campus hostels objected to hoisting of the national tri-colour atop a make shift bunker. Police, deployed for security of the film crew, chased away the protesters but the shooting could not proceed further.
