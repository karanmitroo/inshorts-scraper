KC Bokadia's 'Dirty Politics', starring Mallika Sherawat, Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah, is a rough take on the sordid underbelly of Indian politics, writes NDTV. It is about a lady trying to use a politician for electoral success, bringing into picture a mash-up of sex, subterfuge and stupidity. The film has got 0.5/5 (Indian Express), 1/5 (NDTV) and 1.5/5 (TOI).
