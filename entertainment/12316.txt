Filmmaker Karan Johar, while talking about how 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' (ADHM) is an emotional film, jokingly said, "You weep and I laugh all the way to the bank." He revealed that ADHM is an ode to himself. "It is about the angst of falling in love without reciprocation. I am the brand ambassador of that emotion," said Johar.
