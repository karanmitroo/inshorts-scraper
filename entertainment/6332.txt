Katrina Kaif, while sharing a video of herself working out at the gym, wrote, "Prep for those days when you can't find a chair. Please do it at the gym it's very fun." Katrina's trainer Yasmin Karachiwala said the exercise is good for strengthening VMO (vastus medialis oblique), a part of the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh.
