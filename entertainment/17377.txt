The poster of choreographer Remo's dance-based film 'ABCD 2' was leaked on micro-blogging website Twitter last night. The stars of the film, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor, are reportedly upset with the leak. Expressing his rage, Dhawan tweeted, "...whoever leaked the poster... I want to say to that individual that #HatersGonnaHate but we gonna keep on moving ahead."
