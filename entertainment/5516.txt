Actress Katrina Kaif has said that Ranbir Kapoor treats her like a kid like she knows nothing while adding, "He won't let me finish my sentences." She said this during an interview for their upcoming film Jagga Jasoos as Ranbir kept interrupting her. "You do realise you're talking about my character when I am sitting right here," added Katrina.
