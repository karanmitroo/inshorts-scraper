Renowned Mexican comedian Roberto Gomez Bolanos, fondly known as 'Chespirito', died on Friday at the age of 85. He wrote and played the very highly-acclaimed and well-loved television character “El Chavo del Ocho”. He was like a cult-figure for Mexicans across generations. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted, “Mexico has lost an icon whose work has transcended generations and borders.”
