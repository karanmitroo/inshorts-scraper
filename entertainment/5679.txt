Saif Ali Khan has said that though he supports his daughter Sara Ali Khan's choice to get into acting in films, he is still concerned for her as it's an unsure profession. Saif added, "She has a lot of well wishers... from her mother (actress Amrita Singh) to me, Karan Johar to everybody. She can seek advice from anybody."
