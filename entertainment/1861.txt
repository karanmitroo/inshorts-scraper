While talking about how music companies exploit singers, composers and songwriters over royalty of their own songs, singer Aditya Narayan said it's demotivating when one is called to sing for free. "(You are) made to sign...contract, saying this song doesn't belong to you. If you want to perform the song, you need to pay the label some money," added Aditya.
