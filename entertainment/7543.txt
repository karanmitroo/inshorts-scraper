Tamil television actress Nandhini's husband Karthikeyan allegedly committed suicide at a lodge in Chennai on Monday. Karthikeyan was reportedly found lying unconscious in the room. Initial reports suggested that Karthikeyan blamed his father-in-law in his suicide note but Nandhini alleged that her husband had been taking money from people and threatened to commit suicide when she confronted him.
