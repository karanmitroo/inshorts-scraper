The Censor Board, while talking about the 'Jauhar' scene in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', said, "We feel women's organisations would take strong objection to the self-immolation." "They might see this as another form of Sati, a practice that is constitutionally banned in the country. Jauhar is a very different practice from Sati," said a source from the Censor Board.
