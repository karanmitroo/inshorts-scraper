As per a DNA report, actor Akshay Kumar charged more than actor Rajinikanth for playing the antagonist role in the upcoming sci-fi thriller '2.0' or 'Robot 2'. The makers reportedly agreed to Kumar's demand as they were in a hurry to sign a 'big' actor for the role, which had earlier been rejected by Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan.
