After Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim uploaded pictures and videos of himself on Instagram on Wednesday, Saif has advised him to be seen less on social media. "I hope he understands that interest on social media is a double-edged sword. People are interested in him today because of his family, who his parents are as well as him", Saif said.
