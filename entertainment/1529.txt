Nawazuddin Siddiqui has sent a counter notice to his ex-girlfriend Sunita Rajwar after she sued him for revealing details about their relationship in his biography. Nawazuddin has claimed that the 'Sunita' he had mentioned in his book was not Sunita Rajwar. The notice reportedly also says that if she doesn't withdraw her case he would send her behind the bars.
