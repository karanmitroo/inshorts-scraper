Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University in Agra, formerly Agra University, issued a marksheet to a student carrying the photo of actor Salman Khan. The university denied any error on its part, saying they had verified records and it was actually the students who filled forms and pasted their photos. The marksheet belongs to a first-year student of an Aligarh-based college.
