Talking about what he would be willing to do for money, filmmaker Karan Johar said that he would even go to the opening of an envelope. Karan further said, "Money, I'd do anything for. I've done Indian television, I've danced on reality shows." He said this during his appearance on the chat show 'BFFs with Vogue', hosted by Neha Dhupia.
