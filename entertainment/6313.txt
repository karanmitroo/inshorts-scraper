Sachin Tendulkar's biopic 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams' was declared tax-free in Odisha on Tuesday. Odisha's Finance Minister Shashi Bhusan Behera said entertainment tax for the movie has been waived as the cricket legend is a source of inspiration for the youth. The film, which will be released on May 26, was earlier made tax-free in Kerala and Chhattisgarh.
