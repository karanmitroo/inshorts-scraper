The Film Certification Appellate Tribunal has directed the Censor Board to grant certification to Oscar-winning film 'The Danish Girl' for television viewing. In March, Censor Board had cancelled the film's broadcast as they found it unsuitable for audiences below 18. The film is about Lili Elbe, one of the first known people to undergo sex reassignment surgery.
