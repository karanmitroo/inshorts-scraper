Twitter users have slammed the Los Angeles Times for featuring only white actresses on the cover of its magazine 'The Envelope'. "It shouldn't be necessary to point out the obvious," tweeted a user. "I guess the redhead is the diversity offering," wrote another user. "White actresses [should] speak up when their Women of Colour colleagues are ignored," read another comment.
