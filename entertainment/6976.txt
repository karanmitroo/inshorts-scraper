New Zealand has banned under-18s from watching Netflix drama '13 Reasons Why' without the supervision of an adult, amid complaints that the series glorifies suicide. An average of two youngsters commit suicide every week in New Zealand, which has created a new censorship category to address concerns over the show. The show is about a teenager's sexual assault and suicide.
