Filmmaker Woody Allen, while discussing rape and sexual allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, said, "Don't want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere." Woody added such an atmosphere would be where every guy in an office who winks at a woman would have to call a lawyer to defend himself. He further called Weinstein "a sad, sick man".
