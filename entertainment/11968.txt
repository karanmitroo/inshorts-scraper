Pakistan's film industry may incur about 70% loss in business if India-Pakistan ties deteriorate further and Bollywood films are banned in the country, Pakistani film distributor Nadeem Mandviwalla said. "I just hope the ties don't remain tense on long-term basis", he added. Mandviwalla also attributed the "boom" in the country's movie industry to the release of latest Bollywood films.
