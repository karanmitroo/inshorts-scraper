Taapsee Pannu has said she'll believe she's a star when the audience buys tickets for her film and says 'It's Taapsee's film, let's go and watch it'. "I still don't feel I'm the one who'll get the audience into theatres as yet," she added. Taapsee further said, "I still feel like a struggler because I need to really work hard."
