Calling Amitabh Bachchan a 'living legend', Bollywood star Ranveer Singh said Big B has had a great influence on him. "My earliest and fondest memories of engaging with Hindi cinema are all directly related to Amitabh Bachchan," he said. "In coming years, I believe Bollywood will be defined as BB and AB - Before Bachchan and After Bachchan," Ranveer added.
