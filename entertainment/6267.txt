The makers of 'Raabta' have rejected claims of their film being a copy of Telugu film 'Magadheera'. They added it's extremely disrespectful when people "belittle" someone's hard work and allege plagiarism on the basis of a trailer. The makers of 'Magadheera' accused 'Raabta' producers of copying their story and have approached a court seeking injunction against the film's release.
