A journalist from The Quint has received rape threats after Omprakash Mishra's video 'Bol Na Aunty Aau Kya' was taken down from his official page on YouTube. While the video was taken down due to a copyright claim, fans blamed the journalist as she had featured in a video against Omprakash. The Quint has removed the video following the threats.
