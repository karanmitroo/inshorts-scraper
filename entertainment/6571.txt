Director Mohit Suri has said that he doesn't want to get into the â‚¹100 crore club, as after a point, money doesn't motivate him to work, but passion does. He added he wants his films to do well at box office but there's no pressure. Mohit further said, "My success should create a platform for new musicians, actors and directors."
