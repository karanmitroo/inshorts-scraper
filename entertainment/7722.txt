Singer Beyoncé fulfilled the wish of Ebony Banks, a dying fan suffering from cancer, whose dream was to talk to Beyoncé once in her life. Ebony passed away three days after talking to the singer over a video chat. Ebony's classmates had started an online campaign before her death to give her a chance to meet her favourite singer.
