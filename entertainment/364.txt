Swara Bhasker slammed a news report for misinterpreting her statement on the open letter against 'Padmaavat' while tweeting, "I hate headlines." When her letter was called bold, Swara had quipped, "And an incredibly stupid one too, I hear." However, she later clarified that her response had just been "tongue-in-cheek" while adding that she had not called her letter "incredibly stupid".
