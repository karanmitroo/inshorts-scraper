As per reports, Deepika Padukone's midriff in the song 'Ghoomar' from 'Padmaavat' will be covered using CGI (computer-generated imagery). The report added, "Censor Board's Examining Committee asked the producers to remove the shots where her stomach was visible. But such editing would've disturbed the choreographic flow." It has been re-submitted to the Censor Board with suggested modifications.
