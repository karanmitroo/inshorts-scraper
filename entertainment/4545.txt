Actress Taapsee Pannu, who turned 30 on Tuesday, has said she doesn't like typical off-the-shelf gifts and instead likes something customised on her birthday. She added, "Every year, I like that pressure that my friends and family have to bring their creative side out and think of a gift." Taapsee is known for films like 'Pink', 'Naam Shabana', among others.
