The Enforcement Directorate has summoned Shah Rukh Khan for allegedly violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act. Kolkata Knight Riders Sports, the company co-owned by Khan, Juhi Chawla and Jay Mehta, is suspected to have undervalued its shares in 2008 in a transfer deal to a Mauritius company. This is the third time that Khan is being summoned by the ED.
