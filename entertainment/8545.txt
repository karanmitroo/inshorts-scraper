Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi said he is happy that the cinema fraternity is opposing the hate that some politicians are trying to promote. "I hope this unity will continue and spread," he added. Farhadi earlier said he would boycott the Oscars ceremony this year to protest US President Donald Trump's travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran.
