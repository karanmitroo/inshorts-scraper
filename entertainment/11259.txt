The wrong band was awarded the prize for the Best Song at the 21st Mobo (Music of Black Origin) Awards in Glasgow, Scotland. R&B trio WSTRN had given their acceptance speech before organisers said, "someone picked up the wrong envelope" and announced Abra Cadabra to be the winner. However, WSTRN went on to win the prize for the Best Newcomer.
