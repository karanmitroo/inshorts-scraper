Scriptwriter Salim Khan has slammed Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for the recent terrorist attack in Kashmir's Uri town. Khan tweeted, "Beg your pardon Mr Sharif, If people those who gave you your name knew what your characteristics would be, they would have named you Be-Nawaz Sharif." He also wrote that it is "ironic" that Sharif is "complaining about India".
