Twinkle Khanna has said America imposes taxes on menstrual hygiene products like tampons and sanitary napkins but Viagra is tax-free while adding, "Perhaps because policies are made by 65-year-old men with erectile dysfunction." Twinkle further said, "Pads are taxed at 12% in India but brooms are tax-free...because it is more important (to) keep your house clean rather than your body."
