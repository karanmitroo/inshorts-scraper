Actor Shahid Kapoor has said that many co-actors have an 'It's all about me' kind of energy, adding that he's not that kind of an actor. He added, "I have tried that and didn't enjoy it." Shahid further said that he doesn't feel intimidated by co-actors and the only way great films can be made is by working in collaboration.
