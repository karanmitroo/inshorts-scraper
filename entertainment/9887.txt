Akshay Kumar has shared a video message condemning the Bengaluru molestation incident. "The most shameful part is that certain people feel they have the authority to justify such incidents by blaming women and their way of dressing," he said. "[W]e are evolving backwards, from humans to animals, rather beasts because even animals are better," he wrote in the caption.
