Actor Sanjay Dutt has revealed that he was so addicted to drugs that he once travelled with 1 kg heroin hidden in his shoes. "My two sisters were also with me on the same flight...Today, when I think about the incident, I get scared." He added, "It is better to be high on life than on any substance."
