As a picture of Subhash Ghai hugging self-styled godwoman Radhe Maa, who has been charged with obscenity, went viral on the internet, the director defended himself by saying, "The Picture... is real but please look at my wife hugging me too in it." Furthermore, Ghai said that Maa treats him and his wife "as her parents.”
