Actress Radhika Apte has slammed a reporter by telling him that if he wants to see a naked body, he should look at himself in the mirror rather than her clip from 'Parched'. Answering his question about the clip, she said, "Controversies are made by...people like you. You saw the clip, you shared with other people... you made the controversy."
