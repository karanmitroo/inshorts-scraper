Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, who directed 2016 film 'Aligarh', has tweeted that workplace harassment, whether it's sexual, mental or the result of a person's perceived power over the other, must be denounced. This comes after Arunabh Kumar, founder and CEO of The Viral Fever, was accused of molestation and sexual misconduct by an anonymous person claiming to be a female ex-employee.
