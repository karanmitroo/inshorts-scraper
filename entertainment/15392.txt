A petition challenging Bollywood actor Salman Khan's acquittal in the 2002 hit-and-run case was accepted by the Supreme Court today. The apex court will hear the petition filed by the family of the hit-and-run victim Noorullah Sheikh on February 12. The prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the actor's role in the incident, the Bombay High Court said.
