A Malayalam actress was allegedly sexually harassed on a moving train from Kannur to Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday night. "I was sleeping... When I woke up I saw this guy lying on the upper berth opposite me trying to feel my lips," she said. The actress also stated that apart from two men, none of her co-passengers came to help her.
