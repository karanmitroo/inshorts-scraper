Actor Aamir Khan and Chinese director Jia Zhangke are planning Chinese remakes of Bollywood films. "I am very interested in Aamir Khan's style of production...I found out that in some of the stories Aamir Khan has told, it is possible to make adaptations into Chinese," said Jia. He added that they are likely to  collaborate on a Chinese film too.
