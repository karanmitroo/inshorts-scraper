Actor Naseeruddin Shah has referred to yesteryear 'superstar' Rajesh Khanna as a "poor" and "limited" actor. "It was the 70â€™s when mediocrity came in Hindi films," said Shah while blaming Khanna's entry into the film industry for the deterioration in the quality of scripts, acting, music and lyrics. However, Khanna's daughter Twinkle Khanna has slammed Shah for his comments.
