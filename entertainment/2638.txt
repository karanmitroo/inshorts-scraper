Actor Ali Fazal, who recently appeared in the Hollywood film 'Victoria & Abdul', said Bollywood is almost 20 years behind Hollywood. "There is a huge difference... but we can catch up with them," he added. Ali further said, "Filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane are breaking the mould and creating some good stuff."
