Actor Tom Sizemore, known for films like 'Pearl Harbour', has been accused of touching his 11-year-old co-star's genitals on the sets of the 2003 film 'Born Killers'. Sizemore was reportedly sent home after the actress' parents complained to the producers. The former actress, who's 26 now, said she has hired a lawyer to take action against Sizemore and her parents.
