Twitter users slammed India Today for its article on Shah Rukh Khan's 16-year-old daughter Suhana, which was titled '20 photos of Suhana Khan to spice up your Friday, in case you had other plans'. "Dear @IndiaToday, you better have an explanation for this sexualization of a teenager," tweeted a user while another tweet read, "Nothing is sacred for clickbait journalism."
