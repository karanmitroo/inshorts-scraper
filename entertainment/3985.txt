Actor Aadar Jain, while talking about the similarity of his debut film 'Qaidi Band' with Farhan Akhtar's 'Lucknow Central', said, "I hope these...films...become the Sultan and Dangal of Bollywood." He added the only thing common in these films is the prison set-up. Aadar further said, "Our film is about...undertrials waiting for their cases to be heard...'Lucknow Central' is...about prison break."
