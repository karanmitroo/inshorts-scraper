Alice Bamford, an heiress, was accidentally photo-bombed by famous couple, Kim and Kanye West, with their daughter North. In the picture, taken Sunday at a restaurant in New York, Kim appears to be wearing less make-up than usual. Alice, however, made no reference to them as she uploaded it on Instagram. She captioned the image: “Lunch with Lilou at Nobu!!”
