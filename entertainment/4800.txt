Singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, in her tweet, referred to the morning Azaan played on loudspeakers as "extreme imposed religiosity". "Came home at 4.45 am to most aggressive/ear shattering call of Azaan. Nothing more lowlife & dumb than such extreme imposed religiosity," read the singer's full tweet. Earlier, singer Sonu Nigam also tweeted about the Azaan, while calling it "forced religiousness".
