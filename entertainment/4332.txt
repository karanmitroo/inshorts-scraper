Reacting to Kangana Ranaut's comment that 'Simran' writer Apurva Asrani brought up allegations against her deliberately at the time when 'Rangoon' flopped, Apurva said she's a "very busy star" and seems to have her timelines confused. "But it's time to put negativity behind us," he added. Apurva further said he hopes people will refrain from provoking either party to fight.
