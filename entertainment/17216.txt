The Bombay HC on Friday suspended Salman Khan's sentence of 5-year imprisonment in the infamous 2002 hit-and-run case. "...if the sentence is not more than 7-years, then it can be suspended," said the court. A final appeal hearing will be held in July. Also, the court has ordered the actor not to leave the country.
