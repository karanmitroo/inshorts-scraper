Wrestler-turned-actor Nathan Jones has said that mouthing Hindi dialogues in his debut Bollywood film 'A Flying Jatt' was difficult. "I used to fumble but then I got it. Learning Hindi was bit difficult for me," said Jones, who plays the main villain. Directed by Remo D'Souza and starring Tiger Shroff and Jacqueline Fernandez, the film will release on August 25.
