Mohit Suri's 'Ek Villain' starring Shraddha Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra and Riteish Deshmukh might have received mixed reviews but has opened to good numbers at the box-office. The film has collected Rs 16.72 crores on its first day. This apparently is the second highest opener of the year in absolute terms.
