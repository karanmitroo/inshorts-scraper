At a recent event, Anil Kapoor revealed he'd rent suits worn by Sanjay Dutt to wear at parties in early 90s. "They were a little loose, because he (Dutt) was well-built and I was single 'pasli'," he added. Gulshan Grover, who was also at the event, said the duo had to do some buttering to get suits from the designer.
