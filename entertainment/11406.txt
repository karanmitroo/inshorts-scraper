Actor Harshvardhan Kapoor has said actors Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan are "stars" as "people go and watch their film on the first day". "Your box office receipt decides if you'll be a star...not always your work," Kapoor added. He further said he's "not trying to be a star" but it'd be "great" if he becomes one.
