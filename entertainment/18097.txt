Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher, who recently had a baby with his fiancee Mila Kunis, feels having a newborn baby is like having a new mobile phone. "It won't take pictures and you're like, 'Why won't my phone take pictures?'' and it won't make calls and it doesn't do a lot, but it looks really cute," he said.
