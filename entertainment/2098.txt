While speaking on the ongoing 'Padmavati' row, IFFI's Panorama jury head Rahul Rawail said, "Anarkali does not exist in history. If today 'Mughal-E-Azam' is released, will they ban it? They will not." He added that Sanjay Leela Bhansali would not play around with history, but as a filmmaker he could have his own take without disturbing history.
