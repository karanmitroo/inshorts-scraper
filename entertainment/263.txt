Padma Shri awardee Manoj Joshi has said he did buffoonery on screen and senseless roles in films just for survival. He added, "But even in all this, a few films come your way that touch your heart." Manoj further said, "I've done roles of every kind...By God's grace, I escaped the 'stamp' of being an actor of a particular genre."
