Following the loss in revenues, Pakistan theatres have decided to end their self-imposed ban on the screening of Indian films from Monday, the Film Exhibitors Association said. The screening was banned amid escalating tensions between the two countries following the Uri terror attack. Notably, 75% of the revenue generated by Pakistani theatres is reportedly through the screening of Indian movies.
