Maharashtra government has announced that it will provide security to filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar. This comes after Congress workers in Pune recently disrupted the promotions of Madhur's upcoming film 'Indu Sarkar', which is based on the 1975 Emergency. The filmmaker had tweeted that he and his team were "stranded like hostages" in the room after Congress workers "barged in" the hotel.
