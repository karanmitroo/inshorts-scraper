Actor Leonardo DiCaprio was supposed to star in the original Baywatch television series as the show's protagonist Mitch Buchannon's son, according to reports. David Hasselhoff, who played Buchannon on screen, reportedly did not want the then 15-year-old DiCaprio to be cast as his son because he thought portraying the father of a child that age would make him look old.
