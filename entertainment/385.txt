Hollywood actress Jennifer Aniston's spokesperson has clarified that she is not getting back with her first husband Brad Pitt following her separation from Justin Theroux. The spokesperson said the magazine report which suggested that Brad is being her "shoulder to cry on" is "fabricated". Jennifer and Brad got divorced in 2005 after five years of marriage.
