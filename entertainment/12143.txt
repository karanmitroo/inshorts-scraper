Actor Daniel Radcliffe has said that it is "pretty undeniable" that Hollywood is racist. "We like to think of ourselves as being a very, very progressive industry, but we have been lagging behind in all kinds of areas," said the 27-year-old actor. Radcliffe was responding to a question on the lack of diversity in the nominations for the Oscars 2016.
