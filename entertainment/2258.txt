Filmmaker Karan Johar has said actress Kajol has been and will always be more than special to him. This comes after Karan reconciled with Kajol following their fallout in 2016. The fallout had taken place after Kajol supported her husband Ajay Devgn, who alleged that Karan had bribed self-styled critic Kamaal R Khan to slam Devgn's film 'Shivaay'.
