PM Narendra Modi once again praised Bollywood superstar Salman Khan's efforts towards Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. Modi, who had himself nominated Salman for the campaign on Oct 2, tweeted, "Once again, @BeingSalmanKhan makes a distinct & appreciable effort towards a Clean India. I congratulate him." PM's praise comes a day after the actor said he'll nominate 100 people/month for the cause.
