Actress Ratna Pathak Shah has said that not letting Pakistani actors like Fawad Khan work in India is a problem. She added, "Nobody is unhappy that these poor guys have been thrown out of the business." Notably, Ratna has worked with Fawad in the films 'Khoobsurat' (2014) and 'Kapoor & Sons' (2016).
