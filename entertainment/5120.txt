Ranbir Kapoor, while being quizzed on internet acronyms during an interview, jokingly said that OOTD, which is originally an acronym for Outfit Of The Day, stands for "Oh Oh Teri Dafli". However, Ranbir knew that TBH is To Be Honest and IKR stands for I Know Right. Katrina, who was also there, said that Ranbir cheated in the quiz.
