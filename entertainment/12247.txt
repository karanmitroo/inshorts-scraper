Actor Rishi Kapoor has said that he and brother Randhir Kapoor "did not misbehave" with journalists during their family's 'Ganpati visarjan' and that the media has "misinterpreted it". "I feel it is very unfair, what the news channels have shared everywhere... I was behaving like the Mumbai police, trying to monitor the situation," added Rishi.
