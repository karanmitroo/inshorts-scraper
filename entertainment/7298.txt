Late actress Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd wore a custom-made dress by designer Tom Ford at Star Wars' 40th-anniversary celebration. The dress was inspired by Fisher's outfit in the 'Star Wars' film franchise, where she portrayed the character 'Princess Leia'. "My mom used to say she never knew where Princess Leia ended and Carrie Fisher began," said Billie.
