Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt starrer 'Shaandaar', which hit the screens on Thursday, is bloated with excess wherein Shahid suffers from a badly-written character, wrote Indian Express. "Shaandaar tries very hard, but itâ€™s not funny," said HT. "[I]t doesn't live up to its title," wrote NDTV. The Vikas Bahl directorial has been rated 1.5/5 (HT, Indian Express) and 3/5 (NDTV).
