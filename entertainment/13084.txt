Actor Shah Rukh Khan has revealed that he used to work out seeing actor Hrithik Roshan’s picture in my gym. "This was nearly twenty years ago. We had a picture of Hrithik standing pulling over his suspenders, this was from Dabboo Ratnani’s shoot. We used to keep his picture," said Shah Rukh. He further praised Hrithik for his chiseled body.
