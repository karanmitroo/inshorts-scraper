Senior actor Anupam Kher on Wednesday questioned the filmmakers who returned their National Awards in solidarity with the protesting FTII students. "This #AwardWapsiGang has not insulted the Govt. but The Jury, The Chairman of the Jury and the audience who watched their films. #Agenda," Kher tweeted. His remarks have divided Twitterati, with some seconding him and others criticising.
