Filmmaker Subhash Ghai, while citing a hypothetical example of Katrina Kaif and Kareena Kapoor playing the Phogat sisters in 'Dangal', has said that casting is a crucial factor. "I rope in actors who...do justice to the role," he added. Ghai further said that for him, the story is important and the actor has never been a priority for him.
