Sunny Leone has launched her own mobile app in partnership with New York-based startup 'Escapex'. Sunny said, "The shelf-life of a Bollywood actor is not always long until you are Salman, Shah Rukh or Aamir Khan!" The app allows access to Sunny's social media handles on a single platform while fans can interact with her through an in-app social feed.
