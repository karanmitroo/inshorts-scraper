Vidya Balan has revealed she has opted out of the biopic on yesteryear actress Meena Kumari. Talking about the reason she quit the project, Vidya added, "The script has to do justice. It can't just be a sensational account...It has to present different episodes." She further said biopics are very sensitive and need to be done for the right reasons.
