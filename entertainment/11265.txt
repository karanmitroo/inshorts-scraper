Central Board of Film Certification chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the Censor Board is "not homophobic". "No cuts are made on the basis of the gender of the people involved. We evaluate films with homosexual content by the same yardstick as films about heterosexual content," said Nihalani. The Board recently gave an 'A' certificate to a gay music video.
