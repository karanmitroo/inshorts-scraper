Actor Purab Kohli, who has a daughter with partner Lucy Paton, said he was "adamant" to not get married before the baby's birth. "There was pressure... (from) my family... but I didn't want her to feel that we got into a relationship because she was coming," he added. Kohli further said that their daughter Inaya, was really "their love child".
