English singer-songwriter Chris Rea collapsed on stage in the middle of a song while performing at the New Theatre Oxford in England. The audience was informed that the concert had been cancelled and the musician was taken to the hospital, where he was later described as stable. The 66-year-old singer had also suffered a stroke last year.
