Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will appear in the upcoming Star Trek movie 'Star Trek Beyond'. Bezos has a one-scene cameo in the movie, where he plays a “Starfleet Official”. "He had to wait around all day because it was one day we were shooting like three different scenes...he just nailed it every time," said Star Trek director Justin Lin.
