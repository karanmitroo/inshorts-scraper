The organisers of French disc jockey David Guetta's show have cancelled his concert which was scheduled for Thursday night in Bengaluru. Law and order issues following the molestation incident during New Year's eve have been cited as the reason. The organisers said they hope to reschedule the concert if they get permission from the authorities and the artist.
