Actress Kareena Kapoor has replaced Katrina Kaif for a performance at Zee Cine Awards, after Katrina pulled out of the show due to an injury on sets of 'Jagga Jasoos'. This will be Kareena's first performance onstage after son Taimur's birth. Her performance will reportedly be a tribute to Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Saif Ali Khan.
