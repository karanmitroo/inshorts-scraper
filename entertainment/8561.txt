Actor Shahid Kapoor, while speaking about working with filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj, said that he is like the potato in Bhardwaj's dishes. "I am the aloo, kisi bhi sabzi mein daal do. When Vishal sir is cooking, I am always there," he added. Shahid has worked with Bhardwaj in three films, including 'Kaminey' (2009) and 'Haider' (2014).
