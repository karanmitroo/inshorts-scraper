In response to Rekha's disrespect towards her husband on 'Bigg Boss 8', Puneet Issar's wife Deepali Issar said recently that Rekha wears sindoor for Amitabh Bachchan. Rekha was clearly seen avoiding Puneet on the show, whom she considers responsible for Amitabh's near-fatal accident on the sets of 'Coolie'. Rekha, a widow, is seen wearing a sindoor on almost all occasions.
