Rishi Kapoor slammed director Anurag Basu for delaying 'Jagga Jasoos', and said the film was in post-production even two days before release. "You may be...biggest director in the world but nobody would like to work with you...you're irresponsible," added Rishi. He further said that in the entire process, he and Ranbir, who's the film's co-producer, are getting a bad name.
