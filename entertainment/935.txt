A man has climbed a 350-feet-high mobile tower with a bottle of petrol while saying that he will come down only when the upcoming film 'Padmaavat' is banned in India. The incident occurred in a town in Rajasthan's Mewar region. Earlier, a Mewar royal Mahendra Singh Mewar said the Censor Board had endorsed a film that may cause social unrest.
