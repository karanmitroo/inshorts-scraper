Swara Bhaskar has said she can be frank as she doesn't have much at stake like actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan do. She added, "I don't have crores of endorsements to lose...and don't have the kind of visibility they do." Swara further revealed that sometimes her film's producers have told her, "Swara, can you not say so much?"
