Actor Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the 'Harry Potter' series, recently said that he believes that Ron's marriage with Hermoine Granger, played by Emma Watson, wouldn't have "done very well". "I would expect Ron has probably divorced Hermione already", Rupert said. "He's living on his own, in a little one-bedroom apartment. He hasn't got a job", he added.
