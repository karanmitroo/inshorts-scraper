Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson was mistaken for a homeless person on sets of a photoshoot. Talking about it, she tweeted, "One of the first people on set, sitting in the parking lot and this dude comes up to me and says, 'Homeless people aren't allowed in this area'." She also retweeted musician Nahko's reply, "yer home free, not homeless."
