Hollywood actress Carrie Fisher, known for playing Princess Leia in the 'Star Wars' film series, suffered a medical emergency, reportedly a heart attack, onboard a flight on Friday. The 60-year-old actress is currently in the ICU of a Los Angeles hospital. "Everybody is praying for her. There's nothing new from the doctors," Fisher's brother told an American magazine.
