Ajay Devgn has reportedly postponed the release of his film, Action Jackson, on the request of David Dhawan to clear April 4 for his son Varun's film. David Dhawan is said to have approached the producer of Action Jackson, who in turn consulted his lead actor, Ajay Devgn, and agreed to postpone their film by a week.
