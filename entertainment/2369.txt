Ranveer Singh has been trolled for the caption of a picture he shared on Twitter that read, "Losing my religion." A user tweeted, "He did it deliberately to get more controversies for the film ('Padmavati')." Another tweet read, "These words were not needed at this time." Users also defended Ranveer while tweeting that the caption was just a song's name.
