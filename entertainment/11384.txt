A silent protest was held by a local Maratha organisation outside a Mumbai multiplex on Friday, appealing people not to watch Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai and Anushka Sharma starrer 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'. Reportedly, they raised slogans of 'Pakistan Murdabad'. The film, which hit theatres on Friday, was initially opposed by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena for featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan.
