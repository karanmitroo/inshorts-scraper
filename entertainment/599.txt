Tamil Film Producers Council has decided to go on an indefinite strike from March 1, while adding there will be no new film releases in theatres. This is owing to exorbitant prices charged by digital service providers for screening of films. The council added, "Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala will (also) protest against them until...requests are fulfilled."
