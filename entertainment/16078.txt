Veteran filmmaker, Shyam Benegal, on Sunday said that returning a national award is a way of disrespecting it. His statement was based on the recent trend of returning awards by filmmakers and writers as a fight against the growing intolerance in the country. “It’s not a healthy trend, as there are several other ways to register your protest", said Benegal.
