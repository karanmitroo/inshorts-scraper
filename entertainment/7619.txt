Actress Raveena Tandon has said that it is easy to accuse the Censor Board for denying certificate to a film. However, according to her, their hands are tied too as everyone has become so sensitive in present times. She added, "Censor Board has certain guidelines, which they follow. According to that...we can show some things while some we can't."
