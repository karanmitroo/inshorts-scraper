Following a meeting between MNS chief Raj Thackeray, 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' maker Karan Johar and Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, the party said it will allow the movie's release. This comes after Karan Johar offered to put a special slate honouring the Uri martyrs before the movie begins, and the producers assured not to work with Pakistani actors in future.
