'Lucknow Central' producer Nikkhil Advani, while talking about the excessive marketing culture, said, "I got a call from a marketing person saying Kangana's scandal is going on, tell Farhan to create a scandal." Advani said, "This is an actual conversation! Farhan has to have a scandal otherwise our buzz won't go up...they were like 'any scandal but we need it'."
