Actress Mini Mathur took to Twitter to share a collage of Deepika Padukone wearing the same outfit at different occasions and wrote, "Finally...a "normal" film actor who actually repeated her super expensive, lovely dress!!" Deepika, who wore an off-shoulder crochet white dress by Chloe at the IIFA 2016 press conference, repeated the outfit at Shah Rukh Khan's birthday party.
