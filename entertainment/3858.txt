Disha Patani, while discussing about shaving her head if the character demands it, said, "My decision will be based on how passionate I'm about the script. If I...feel it will benefit the narrative...I'll go ahead with it." She further said actresses don't experiment with looks regarding their hair because their multiple commitments require them to maintain a particular look.
