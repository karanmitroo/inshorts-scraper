Actress Deepika Padukone has said that she doesn't look at working in Bollywood and Hollywood as separate careers. She added, "A film set is a film set, and nothing changes. The creative process is the same. For me, it's a part of the same journey." Notably, Deepika's Hollywood debut film 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' released in January this year.
