Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan will be tried in the court in a plagiarism case over his 2013 film 'Krrish 3'. This comes after Uttarakhand High Court dismissed the petition filed by Roshan wherein he requested for the FIR against him to be dropped. Roshan has been accused of copying portions from writer Roopnanarayn Sonkar's novel 'Sooardan' in the film.
