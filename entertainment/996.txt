Actor Prakash Raj has said he doesn't consider PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah Hindus, adding that people who support killing cannot be Hindus. Declaring that he isn't anti-Hindu, the actor said he is anti-Modi and anti-Amit Shah instead. Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde is also not a Hindu as he wants to wipe out a religion, Raj asserted.
