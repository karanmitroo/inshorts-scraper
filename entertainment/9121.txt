Celebrity hair stylist Sapna Bhavnani, who revealed in 2015 that she had been gang raped when she was 24, said talking about the incident is the biggest thing she has done. "I just feel...talking of gang rape is really huge," she added. Bhavnani further said more people should share their stories of abuse as this would help change people's mindset.
