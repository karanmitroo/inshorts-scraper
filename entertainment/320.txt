Akshay Kumar has said shooting for his film 'Housefull 4' is going to be like a three-month vacation. "For me, it's like a reunion of old friends," he added while talking about the film, which will bring back the entire cast from the earlier 'Housefull' films. Akshay further said, "It's been a while since I've done a full-on comedy film."
