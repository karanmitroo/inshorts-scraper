Actress Jennifer Lawrence has said she turns into a huge a**hole once she enters a public place. "I become incredibly rude... That's the only way of defending myself," she added. Jennifer further said, "I'll see someone walking towards my table and just go like, 'Can I have a selfie?' And I'm like, 'No!... Sometimes I go, 'It's my day off.'"
