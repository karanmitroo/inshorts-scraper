Comedy group AIB's new video titled 'Lightning Fast Movies' is a parody of various Bollywood films like 'Dangal', 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and 'Dhoom'. The video recreates films while summarising their plots within 10-20 seconds. The video points out that 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara', 'Rock On!!' and 'Dil Chahta Hai' have stereotypical storyline of how friends fight and then reconcile.
