Kapil Sharma's Bollywood acting debut 'Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon', which released this Friday, has a flawed script, wrote Zee News. "[I]f you want to see the film solely for Kapil's brand of humour, you get 'babaji ka thullu' (nothing)," said TOI. The film, also starring Elli Avram and Arbaaz Khan, has been rated 1.5/5 (NDTV), 2/5 (TOI)and 2.5/5 (Zee News).
