After rapper Kanye West requested furniture company IKEA to allow him to "create" for the brand, IKEA Australia tweeted, "Hey Kanye, we’d love to see what you’d create...we could make you Famous!" Kanye had earlier said, "Allow him to make this thing...I want a bed that he makes". Kanye's song 'Famous' depicted celebrity figures sleeping naked in a shared bed.
