Journalist Siddhant Adlakha has claimed that he "got kicked out" of Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani's office, when he questioned him on the film certification process during an interview. "You (media) are interfering without any reason in our business," said Nihalani. When Adlakha asked him if the Board curtails the rights of producers as artistes, Nihalani asked him to leave.
