Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and TMC MP Derek O'Brien posted their pictures with the Snapchat dog filter amid the recent controversy around comedy group AIB. "It's the weekend. Time for a little bit of fun," wrote O'Brien, while Tharoor captioned his image "Attn all trolls: I took the #DogFilter challenge!" AIB was slammed for using the filter on Modi's image.
