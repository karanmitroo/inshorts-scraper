Paying tribute to late actor Shashi Kapoor in a blog post, Amitabh Bachchan wrote that he had thought with men like Shashi Kapoor around, he stood no chance as an actor. "Somewhere he had let himself go after the passing away of his dear wife Jennifer," he added. Amitabh and Shashi worked together in films like 'Deewaar', 'Suhaag' and 'Silsila'.
