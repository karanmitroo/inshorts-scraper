Actor Matthew Perry, who portrayed Chandler on the television series 'Friends', said that he'll pass Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's request for a rematch. Perry further joked that this was owing to PM Trudeau currently having an army at his disposal. On April 1, Trudeau tweeted, "I've been giving it some thought...who hasn't wanted to punch Chandler? How about a rematch?"
