The term 'box office' originated in Elizabethan era, when affluent people would sit in private 'boxes' to watch theatre. Tickets for boxes were sold at an 'office', called box office. A significant portion of revenue would come from these tickets as they were costlier. In contemporary times, 'box office collection' means earnings generated by ticket sales after a film's release.
