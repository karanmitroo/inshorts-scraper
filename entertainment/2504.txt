Maisie Williams, who portrays 'Arya Stark' on HBO series 'Game of Thrones', has said she's really excited for the show to end. "There's going to be time for me to do whatever I want," she added. Maisie further said. "On one hand it's nerve-wracking to know that I won't have that support blanket, but on the other hand I'm free."
