A Roman Catholic bishop on Wednesday urged Philippine Catholics to boycott American pop singer Madonna's concert, calling her music 'suggestive' and her clothes 'vulgar'. Madonna, who was scheduled to visit Manila for a two-night concert, later made surprise visits to city shelters to hang out with the orphans and street children. The 57-year-old posted pictures of the same on Instagram.
