Makers of 'Julie 2', presented by former Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani, have won the copyright infringement case filed by the producer of the 2004 film 'Julie' over the use of the title. 'Julie 2' will now release on November 24. 'Julie' producer NR Pachisia had claimed that despite undertakings given to him, 'Julie 2' was promoted as a sequel.
