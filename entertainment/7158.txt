Actor Salman Khan's father Salim Khan and actress Waheeda Rehman are among the 50 residents who've demanded shifting the public toilet being constructed in Bandstand, Mumbai. "If the toilet is built in the middle of promenade, there'll be a mess and it'll create nuisance," said Salim Khan. The residents have filed a complaint regarding the same with BMC.
