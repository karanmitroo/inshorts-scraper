Reality television star Kylie Jenner was forced to leave the red carpet from a photo event at the opening of a restaurant as anti-fur protestors raised slogans against her. The protestors were seen holding posters of tortured animals. "Kylie Jenner, you have blood on your hands," shouted the protestors even as Kylie left the photo session and entered the restaurant.
