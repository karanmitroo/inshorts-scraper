Asia's largest music festival Sunburn began at Kesnand in Pune on Wednesday, with a line-up including DJ Afrojack and former Swedish House Mafia members Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso. This is the first time in ten years that the four-day festival, which has been facing allegations of unpaid dues, has shifted its venue from Goa to Pune.
