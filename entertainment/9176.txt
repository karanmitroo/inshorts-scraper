Actor Rishi Kapoor has said the sudden ban on Pakistani artistes in India is unfair. "Films are not planned in one or three days... You must give a cut-off period. It gives us time to finish our films and henceforth we will not take them," he added. Kapoor also criticised PM Narendra Modi for visiting Pakistan in December 2015.
