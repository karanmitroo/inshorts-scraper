Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali has told the Parliamentary panel he met on Thursday that his film 'Padmavati' is not based on history but on the poem 'Padmavat' written in 1540 by Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Adding that he has not distorted history, Bhansali has said that all the controversy around the film is based on rumours.
