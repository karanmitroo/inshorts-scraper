While responding to reports about a dream sequence between Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in the film 'Padmavati', Sanjay Leela Bhansali said there's no interaction whatsoever between the characters portrayed by Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. "Padmavati has been made with a lot of responsibility and hard work," he added. Bhansali further said, "We've kept the honour of Rajputs intact."
