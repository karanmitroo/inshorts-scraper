Singer Ed Sheeran last week visited nine-year-old Melody Driscoll, who has spent "80% of her life in hospital", after she was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, and other medical issues. Sheeran performed his song, 'Thinking Out Loud' for Melody, who's "on cloud nine" since his visit. According to her mother, Sheeran's music "helps" Melody through her pain.
