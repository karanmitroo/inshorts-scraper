Section 144 has been imposed in Gurugram, two days before the release of Bollywood film 'Padmaavat'. Officials said that the step has been taken to avert any disturbances by the anti-social elements outside the cinema halls. Earlier, Rajput organisation Karni Sena had distributed a memorandum to all theatres in Gurugram asking them not to screen the film.
