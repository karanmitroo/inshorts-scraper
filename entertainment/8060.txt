Singer Lata Mangeshkar has said that she finds the soul missing in songs these days. The 87-year-old singer added, "Perhaps that is why people still love to listen to retro songs, and new songs are going out of listeners' memories faster." Lata further suggested that young singers should understand the character, situation and story before recording songs.
