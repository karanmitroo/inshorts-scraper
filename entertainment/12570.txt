Filmmaker Woody Allen has said that the allegations of sexual abuse against him by Dylan Farrow, his adopted daughter with Mia Farrow, do not affect him anymore and he takes "no interest in it". "That situation had been thoroughly, thoroughly investigated... by New York social services in a 14-month investigation," said Woody. He added that he leads an isolated life.
