Actor Woody Harrelson has revealed he had to go out to smoke a joint halfway through a dinner with US President Donald Trump in 2002. "It was brutal. I never met a more narcissistic man. He talked about himself the whole time," he added. Harrelson further said, "I had to walk out halfway...to steel myself for the rest of it."
