Kolkata's Jadavpur University has cancelled a screening of filmmaker Vivek Agnihotriâ€™s political satire 'Buddha In A Traffic Jam' citing the prevailing model code of conduct in West Bengal due to the assembly elections. Agnihotri slammed the university's decision by calling it "a lame excuse". The film also stars Anupam Kher and revolves around corruption and Maoism in a business school.
