Actress Priyanka Chopra, who will soon be seen in American TV series 'Quantico', recently revealed that she faced "a lot of racism" while studying at an American school. "I was told to go back on the same boat that I came on... Browny and all of that... It wasn't everybody, but a group of people in high school...," she said.
