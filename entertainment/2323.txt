Actor Irrfan Khan has said he would like to see a film where a woman is not competing with a man. "I don't see any reason for a competition because the two genders have their own peculiarities, their own specialities...and they cannot be compared," added Irrfan. He further said that a woman celebrating her womanhood is the most beautiful thing.
