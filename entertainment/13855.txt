Actress Upasana Singh, who recently quit the show 'Comedy Nights Live', has said that she will drag the makers of the show to court. Calling it a 'pathetic' show, she alleged that she has just been paid for two episodes. Notably, Upasana had earlier left her role as 'Bua' in 'Comedy Nights With Kapil' to join 'Comedy Nights Live'.
