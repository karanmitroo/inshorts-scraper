Actor Ajay Devgn has said that he doesn't want to do films which he can't watch with his children. Talking about his 2011 adult comedy 'Rascals', he said, "That was the only mistake (I made), and I learnt from it. (It) had some double-meaning dialogues." He added the film was criticised by audience for being unsuitable for kids.
