Paul Nicholls, a British actor who worked on shows like EastEnders and Ackley Bridge, has been rescued three days after he was trapped at the base of a jungle waterfall in Thailand's Koh Samui island. He was found partially submerged in a rock pool, semi-conscious and with hypothermia. "I am lucky to be alive," said Nicholls.
