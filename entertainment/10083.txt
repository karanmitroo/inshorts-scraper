Tamil filmmaker G Suraj has apologised to Tamannaah and all industry heroines for his alleged sexist remarks. "If we're paying good money to watch a film, we... expect Tamannaah to be completely glamorous," Suraj had said. He added he'd instruct his costume designer to shorten the heroine's clothes. Actresses Tamannaah and Nayanthara had slammed the director for his comments.
