Akshay Kumar wants to be known for his acting skills rather than his superstardom. Akshay, who has completed over 20 years in Bollywood, said, "I'd like to be called an actor and not a superstar. That's not the tag I'm looking for." Claiming that he does 'different' roles everytime, Akshay said, "If I like the script, I do it."
