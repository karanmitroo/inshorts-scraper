Swaminathan Gurumurthy, the newly-appointed editor of the Tamil magazine Thuglak, urged actor Rajinikanth to join politics. "Rajinikanth won't enter politics just because I want him to. He should take the decision himself. People who will do good for Tamil Nadu should join politics," said Gurumurthy. He revealed how Thuglak's late editor Cho Ramaswamy had also urged Rajinikanth to enter politics.
