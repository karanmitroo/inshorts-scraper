A panel set up to revamp the Censor Board of Film Certification, headed by filmmaker Shyam Benegal, has recommended that the board should not make cuts to any film. It further sought the creation of more categories for film certification, including two categories each for U/A and A. The panel submitted its report to Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday.
