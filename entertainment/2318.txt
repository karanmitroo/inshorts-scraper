Actress Mahira Khan, while talking about her pictures of smoking with Ranbir Kapoor which surfaced online, said, "Whether it was the trolls or the misogyny; whatever it was, at least it sparked a debate." She added that being a public personality she knows where there is love, there will also be people who will troll her and say bad things.
