Raveena Tandon, while talking about Twinkle Khanna, said, "We are friends and we all know each other in the industry, we all meet each other regularly." Earlier, Twinkle joked how she almost dropped social entrepreneur Arunachalam Muruganantham's biopic as her first production venture because he thought she looked like Raveena. Twinkle's husband Akshay Kumar and Raveena dated in the 90s.
