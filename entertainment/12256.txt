Golden Globe-winning actor Bill Murray will be bartending this weekend at the opening of the '21 Greenpoint' restaurant in New York. The restaurant is owned by his son Homer Murray and Syd Silver, both of whom previously owned the restaurant 'River Styx'. Murray once 'impulsively' poured customers tequila shots at a bar in Austin, United States.
