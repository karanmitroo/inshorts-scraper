The makers of Sanjay Dutt's upcoming film 'The Good Maharaja', a biopic on Maharaja of Jamnagar, have been sent a legal notice by the Maharaja's daughters. Their lawyer said, "The Maharaja was a public figure and if the facts are distorted, it'll tarnish his image." He added that no permission was sought from the Maharaja's daughters by the film's makers.
