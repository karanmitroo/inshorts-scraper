Malayalam actor Sreejith Ravi was arrested following complaints from over ten school girls of exposing himself in front of them. The minor girls also alleged that the actor clicked pictures of them after exposing himself. Sreejith was produced before the additional sessions court on Friday as the police imposed the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act against him.
