'Julie 2' director Deepak Shivdasani wrote in a Facebook post that the film's intent was to let the Indian cinema audience know who Jesus Christ is in commercial cinema. The film's protagonist, played by Raai Laxmi, is said to find solace in Christ. However, Deepak admitted that the film has failed at the box-office.
