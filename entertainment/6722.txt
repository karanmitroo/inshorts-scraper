Television actress Chrissy Metz, while addressing those criticising her dress at the MTV Movie & TV Awards, tweeted, "For the record, I wear what I want, when I want. News flash it's MY body." The 36-year-old actress had chosen a red PVC dress for the event. Supporting Metz, a user tweeted, "You don't have to dress to please others."
