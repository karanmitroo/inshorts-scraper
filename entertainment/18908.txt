Kristine Rodas, wife of Roger Rodas who was driving the Porsche car that crashed and killed actor Paul Walker, filed a lawsuit Monday against the carmaker, alleging it of designing a faulty vehicle. Authorities have cited unsafe speed as a cause of the crash but Kristine's complaint says Roger was driving the Porsche at only 88.5 kmph before the accident.
