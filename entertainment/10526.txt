A Pakistani court has charged three people, including the brother and cousin of Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch over her "honour killing". The 25-year-old social media celebrity was found strangled in her house in Multan, Pakistan on July 16. Notably, hundreds of women are killed by male relatives every year in Pakistan for allegedly dishonouring their family.
