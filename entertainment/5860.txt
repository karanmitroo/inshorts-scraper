Singer Diljit Dosanjh has said that he loves model Kylie Jenner very much. He added, "I never leave any chance to comment [on her Instagram]... I comment in Punjabi, so that she doesn't reply. My people should have fun." In May, Diljit commented, 'Kylie kithe aa?' which translates to 'Where is Kylie?', on Kylie's sister, Kim Kardashian's Instagram Live video.
