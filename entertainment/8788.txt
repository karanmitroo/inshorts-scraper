Actor Saif Ali Khan, while speaking on naming son Taimur, said that a name really doesn't mean anything. He added, "The ruler was Timur and this is Taimur." Citing the example of Timur's son's name being Shah Rukh, Saif jokingly said that if one starts getting into names being right or wrong, then everyone's names would have to be changed.
