Zaira Wasim, who played young Geeta Phogat in 'Dangal', wrote in a Facebook post that she does not want anyone, including Kashmiri youth, to consider her a role model. "I'm not proud of what I'm doing and I want everyone... to know that there are real role models out there," added Zaira in the post which was later deleted.
