The release of Saif Ali Khan and Katrina Kaifâ€™s upcoming terror drama 'Phantom' has been postponed from April 3 to August 28. Reportedly, the reason for this delay is the film's similarity with the recently released Akshay Kumar starrer 'Baby.' The film-makers are hoping that releasing 'Phantom' after a big gap would bring more audience than releasing it earlier.
