Salman Khan-starrer 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' has got into legal trouble over its title. Raising slogans against the film in UP, a group of right-wing organisations demanded that the film's title be changed as it hurts Hindu sentiments. They have even threatened to carry out massive protests if 'Bajrangi' was not dropped from the title before the film's release on July 17.
