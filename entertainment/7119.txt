The Zookeeper's Wife, which released on Friday, is "well-intentioned but exceedingly melodramatic", wrote Hindustan Times. "The film on Holocaust is worth telling", said NDTV. "The director's....ability to showcase varied human tendencies...allows the film to shuttle between a heartrending human drama and compelling war thriller", wrote Times of India. It was rated 4/5 (TOI), 2/5 (HT, NDTV).
