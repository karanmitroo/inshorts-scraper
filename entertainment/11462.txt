Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that no one has the right to stop a film from being shown after it has been given certification. "Why are only high-profile films being made soft targets?," he said, referring to the 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' release controversy. He added it was "wrong" to target any kind of cinema for Pakistani presence.
