Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said that filmmaker Karan Johar is his 'karta dharta' (like my godfather) in Bollywood. He said that in moments of doubts or crisis, he speaks with Johar or his manager Reshma Shetty. "They both are very senior... and know the industry well. They are sweet and protective; like my guardians in the industry," added Sidharth.
