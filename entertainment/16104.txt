Princess Leia from the 'Star Wars' franchise will no longer be referred to as a Princess but as a General, according to Director JJ Abrahams. Carrie Fischer, who plays the role, described Leia as "solitary and under a lot of pressure". The seventh instalment in the series, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', is scheduled to release on December 14.
