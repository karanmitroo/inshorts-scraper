Pulsar Suni, the prime accused in the Malayalam actress assault and abduction case, has said actor Dileep's wife Kavya Madhavan knows him very well. "It is idiotic to say that Kavya doesn't know me," added Suni. Earlier, when Dileep was arrested, Kavya told the investigating team that she does not know Suni and had no knowledge about the alleged conspiracy.
