Stylist Law Roach has revealed the sleeves of singer Celine Dion's gown at the Billboard Awards were filled with tissues. "It came in a huge box. The sleeves were packed up with tissue paper - it's a whole thing, for real," said Roach. Celine wore a floor-length white gown with a plunging neckline and accentuated shoulder details to the awards.
