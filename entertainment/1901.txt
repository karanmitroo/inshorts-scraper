Comedian Kapil Sharma starrer 'Firangi', which released on Friday, fails to leave a lasting impression, wrote Bollywood Hungama. The film "moves at a snail's pace", said The Times of India (TOI) while The New Indian Express wrote that the film "relies on simplicity... and humorous candour." It was rated 2/5 (Bollywood Hungama, TOI) and 4/5 (The New Indian Express).
