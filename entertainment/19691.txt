Continuing its record breaking run at the box-office, Chennai Express has become the fastest movie to cross the 100-crore-mark in Bollywood's history. The movie achieved the feat in the first weekend itself, surpassing Ek Tha Tiger which had taken 5-days. The other records include the highest grosser in paid previews (beating 3 Idiots' record) and highest first day grosser.
