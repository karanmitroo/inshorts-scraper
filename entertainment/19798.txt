Rajput community organizations, on Monday, jammed an overbridge on Ambala-Hisar state highway, demanding ban on Jodha-Akbar TV-serial, being telecast on a private channel. The community alleged that the serial was produced by distorting historical facts, portraying the Rajput community in poor light. District administration has ordered cable-operators of the city to put the telecast of Jodha-Akbar serial on off-mode.
