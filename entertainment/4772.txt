Actor Sunny Deol has denied reports of Yash Raj Films launching his son Karan Deol and added, "Only we were supposed to launch him." Karan's debut film, reportedly titled 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas', will be directed and produced by Sunny. Reports suggested that Sunny had objected to Yash Raj Films' three-film deal which Karan was supposed to sign.
