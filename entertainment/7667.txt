At a recent event, filmmaker Karan Johar jokingly told author Suhel Seth that he's going to run away, when Suhel mentioned Kangana Ranaut's name. The row between Kangana and Karan began when Kangana called Karan the "flagbearer of nepotism" on a Koffee With Karan episode. In response, Karan said Kangana should leave the film industry if it is so bad.
