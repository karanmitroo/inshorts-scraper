In response to SC's decision to make it mandatory to play the National Anthem before movies in theatres, a user tweeted, "How about tiranga sweets and namkheen to eat after the national anthem is played?". "Hope Supreme Court orders Indian Parliament to sing our Nation Anthem before each session. Often its drama too is movie like", tweeted director Shekhar Kapur.
