Designer duo Rimple and Harpreet Narula, who designed the costumes for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati', said that they are broken sentimentally because of the vandalism on the film's sets in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. "Something so unfortunate has happened because of illiteracy in our country. There is so much hard work that was put into making the clothes," they added.
