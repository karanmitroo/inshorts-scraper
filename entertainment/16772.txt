Salman Khan's film 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan, which was released on Friday, reportedly had a good opening and collected over Rs 27 crore at the Indian box-office. Tweeting about the film's collections, trade analyst Joginder Tuteja wrote, "Quite good, considering it was Ramadan". Since Ramazan kept many moviegoers from visiting the theatres on Friday, the collections are expected to rise on Saturday.
