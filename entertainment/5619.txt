Entertainment journalist Lipika Varma has clarified that her question to Matin, child actor from Arunachal Pradesh who stars in Tubelight, on whether it was his first time in India was a slip of tongue. Lipika further explained she actually wanted to ask Matin if it was his first time in Mumbai and slammed journalists who misinterpreted the question as racist.
