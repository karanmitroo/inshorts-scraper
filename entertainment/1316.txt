Actor Dylan Sprouse, known for acting with his twin brother Cole Sprouse in the Disney Channel series 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody', has said that being called a "former child star" is derogatory. He added, "Even 'young actor' sounds better. You're already in a box. But they put you in a smaller box inside that box."
