Actress-turned-author Twinkle Khanna took to Twitter to share a picture of a man defecating in open while she had gone for a walk on the beach. "Good morning...I guess here is the first scene of Toilet Ek Prem Katha part 2 #WhenYourWalkGoesDownTheToilet," she captioned the photo. Twinkle's husband Akshay Kumar starred in the recently released film 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha'.
