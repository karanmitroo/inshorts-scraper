The release of Salman Khan's upcoming film Tubelight on Eid is being opposed in Pakistan to ensure better business for Pakistani films during Eid holidays. Local distributors, producers and filmmakers stated they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies. They claim that a 2010 law forbids release of any Indian film on a Muslim holiday in Pakistan.
