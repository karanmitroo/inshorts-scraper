The divorce of actor Johnny Depp and his estranged wife Amber Heard has been finalised. At a hearing on Friday, which neither she nor Depp attended, a judge signed papers to finalise their divorce. The judge also denied a motion Depp's attorney had filed to have Heard pay the actor's attorney fees. Amber had filed for divorce in May 2016.
