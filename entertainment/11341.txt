Singer Adele has said that she would be "happy never to tour again". "I'd still like to make records, but I'd be fine if I never heard [the applause] again...  I don't care about money," added the Grammy-winning singer. She said, "I have a very dark side," while admitting to suffering from depression and postpartum depression following her son's birth.
