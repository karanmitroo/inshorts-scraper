Actor Irrfan Khan has questioned the ritual of fasting and animal sacrifice during 'Ramzan' and 'Muharram', which are holy festivals for Muslims. "Rather than fasting during Ramzan, people should self-introspect... We, Muslims, have made a mockery of Muharram," said Irrfan. However, Muslim clerics have slammed Irrfan saying that he should "concentrate on his film career" and not make such remarks.
