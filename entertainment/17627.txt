Pakistani singer Adnan Sami has applied for Indian citizenship for the second time, two years after his earlier request was rejected by the Centre. Last month, Home Ministry had asked Law Ministry as to whether Sami can be granted Indian citizenship. But Law Ministry refused to entertain the request, saying the power of granting citizenship lies with the Home Ministry.
