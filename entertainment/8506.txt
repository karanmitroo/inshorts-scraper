Actress Alia Bhatt, while explaining that she did not plan her birth in the Bhatt family, said it is not right to blame nepotism. "I am successful not just because my family is famous, but also because I've worked hard," she added. Alia further said there have also been many examples of people of lineage who have not been successful.
