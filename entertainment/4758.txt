'Airlift' director Raja Krishna Menon has said that actor Akshay Kumar is simply brilliant in 'Airlift', and neither he, Akshay or the audience feel the need to endorse his performance with an award. He said this while reacting to Akshay not receiving nominations for his performance in recent award shows. "I don't think its worth even thinking about," added Menon.
