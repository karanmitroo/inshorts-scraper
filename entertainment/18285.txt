The Supreme Court Monday put an end to the six decade old rule which prohibited women to become make-up artists in Bollywood. The logic behind prohibition was that if women were allowed to do so, male artists wonâ€™t get any jobs. Considering the provision to be unconstitutional, SC said that no discrimination can be made on grounds of gender.
