Actor Vishal, known for his work in Tamil films, requested reviewers to give reviews only after three days post the release of a film. "Don't do reviews before even the first show is over... It's hurting that particular filmmaker," added Vishal. Rajinikanth said, "Please see that you (reviewers) do it in a right way using right words without hurting anyone."
