A postage stamp bearing late actor Raj Kapoor's face was released by India Post in 2001 to honour him. Kapoor, who started his career as a clapper boy, made his acting debut with the 1935 film 'Inquilab' as a child actor and later appeared in films like 'Awara' and 'Mera Naam Joker'. It was Kapoor's 93rd birth anniversary on Thursday.
