In a recent interview, former footballer David Beckham revealed that he and his wife Victoria renewed their wedding vows after nearly 18 years of marriage. "It was a lot more private, there were six people in our house," David shared. The couple, who have four children together, got married in an elaborate ceremony in Ireland in 1999.
