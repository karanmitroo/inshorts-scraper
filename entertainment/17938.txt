Salman Khan's 'Kick' co-star Jacqueline Fernandez has defended his recent visit to Sri Lanka, saying that he was there for a charity event and not for any political campaign. Jacqueline, a former Miss Sri Lanka, said, "We were there to promote and conduct eye camps on behalf of Being Human... Politics was not in the picture at all."
