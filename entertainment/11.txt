Rani Mukerji has said if she was offered the film 'Black' now, she won't be able to do it. "There was some kind of magic that happened during those months when we were shooting for the film," she added. Rani further said, "I don't think I even rehearsed for the film's scenes. There were all spontaneous scenes."
