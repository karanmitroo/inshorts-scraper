Kaabil's director Sanjay Gupta, in a veiled reference to Shah Rukh Khan's next film and Akshay Kumar's 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' sharing the same release date, tweeted, "Kartam Bhuktam (you'll pay for your actions) on Independence Day." In the now deleted tweet, Sanjay wrote, "I believe in (Karma)... I love how you go after all that f*** with you."
