The Tiger Shroff and Jacqueline Fernandez starrer 'A Flying Jatt' which released on Thursday is a "superhero film" that "doesn't fly", wrote India Today. The film "borrows heavily from Hollywood superhero clichés", said Hindustan Times while NDTV wrote that it is "poorly mounted, abysmally acted and dreadfully tedious". It was rated 2.5/5 (India Today, Hindustan Times) and 1.5/5 (NDTV).
