British comedian and actor Eddie Izzard's iconic pink beret (French cap) was snatched during a pro-European Union rally in London. However, Izzard chased the thief despite wearing high heels and retrieved it with the help of six police officers. The 54-year-old actor was a vocal supporter of the 'remain' camp, which campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union.
