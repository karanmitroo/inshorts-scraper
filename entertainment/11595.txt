The Rajasthan Government has said it will approach the Supreme Court against Bollywood actor Salman Khan's acquittal in the Black buck (Chinkara) poaching case. The Rajasthan High Court had on July 25 acquitted Khan in the case, citing lack of evidence to incriminate him. In 1998, Khan and seven others were accused of hunting and killing chinkaras in two cases.
