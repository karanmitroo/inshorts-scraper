Comedian Tiffany Haddish has jokingly said that when actor Brad Pitt met her at the elevator during the Oscars, he told her that in one year if both of them are single they are going to 'do it'. She added, "So you know what that means!" Haddish said this while she was being interviewed by television presenter Kelly Ripa backstage.
