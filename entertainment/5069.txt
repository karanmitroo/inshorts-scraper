The voice actor of Kermit the Frog, Steve Whitmire has claimed he was fired from the Disney show 'The Muppets' after twenty seven years. In an open letter, he wrote, "I'd never consider abandoning Kermit...to do so would be to forsake the assignment entrusted to me by Jim Henson...mentor...my hero." Whitmire took over as Kermit following Henson's death in 1990.
