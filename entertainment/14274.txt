Actress Jacqueline Fernandez has denied rumours of dating Arjun Kapoor amid speculations of her best friend Sonam Kapoor bringing the two together. "No one set anyone up. If you are single, like me, you get linked up with everyone. If you laugh with someone in public, it's taken to mean that you're dating that person," said Jacqueline.
