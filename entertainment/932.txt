Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said that the state government will move the Supreme Court to stop the release of the film 'Padmaavat' in the state. This comes after the apex court recently stayed the orders issued by Rajasthan and Gujarat governments prohibiting the screening of the film, and restrained other state governments from issuing similar orders.
