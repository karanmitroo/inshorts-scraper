Locals in Chandni Chowk have reportedly lodged an FIR against Aamir Khan, Director Raj Kumar Hirani and other actors from the movie PK for allegedly hurting their religious sentiments. They objected to a scene where a man dressed as Lord Shiva was pulling a rickshaw in which two burqa-clad women were sitting. The 3-actors were taken to the Kotwali police-station.
