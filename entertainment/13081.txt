Actress Jacqueline Fernandez has said that it is not fair for people to compare her to actress Katrina Kaif. The two actresses are reportedly compared due to their foreign descent and closeness with superstar Salman Khan. "Both of us are different individuals, and people should see things that way," said Jacqueline while adding that Katrina was an inspiration for her.
