Singer Selena Gomez, who had undergone a kidney transplant due to complications arising from Lupus, said, "It was really kind of life or death... My kidneys were just done." Selena added that she did not want to ask anyone for an organ and it was her friend Francia Raisa who volunteered to donate a kidney to her.
