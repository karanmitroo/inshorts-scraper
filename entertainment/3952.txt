Kajal Aggarwal, who will play the lead in the Tamil remake of Kangana Ranaut starrer 'Queen', has said she'll add her own touch to Kangana's role in the remake. "The makers...and I are very clear that we want to adapt 'Queen' to southern sensibilities," added Kajal. 'Queen' won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi in 2015.
