Salman Khan's action flick ‘Kick’, which was released in Pakistan on Eid, has become the highest holiday grosser in Pakistan. The movie has reportedly made Rs. 20.8 million, owing to house-full shows everyday. "We generated ticket sales of around 2 lakh rupees for the matinee show on Eid day and all subsequent shows have been full," said a cinema owner.
