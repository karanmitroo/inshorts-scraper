Police officers in New Zealand recently danced to Bollywood songs like 'Munni Badnaam Hui' from Dabangg and 'Chalti Hai Kya 9 Se 12' from Judwaa 2 during an annual Diwali event in Christchurch. Trained by a local Bollywood choreography group, the officers said their performance was the result of many rehearsals. They had participated in a similar event last year.
