Hollywood actress Rachel McAdams has revealed that Oscar-nominated writer-director James Toback once invited her to his hotel room for a workshop and said, "I've masturbated countless times...thinking about you since we met at your audition." She added Toback further asked her, "How far are you willing to go as an actress?" Over 38 women have accused Toback of sexual harassment.
