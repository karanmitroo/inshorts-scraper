Shah Rukh Khan, while talking about Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge's (DDLJ) final scene, said, "In real life, I would stop the train, or say let's meet at the next station." The scene shows Kajol running towards SRK, who is on a moving train. He added, "I would never do it in real life, putting my hand out, beating her would-be-husband."
