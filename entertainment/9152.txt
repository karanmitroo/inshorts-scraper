Akshay Kumar, when asked why he and Priyanka Chopra don't work together anymore, jokingly asked journalists to call her and check if she has issues working with him. "It's not like I don't want to work with her. If there's an opportunity, I will...," he added. The two have worked together in films including 'Waqt' (2005), 'Aitraaz' (2004), among others.
