Bhumi Pednekar has said heroines are no more a mere tool of glamour in films. "Now is the time characters need to be made around girls and women because, honestly, they are the ones either suffering or celebrating at the moment," she added. Bhumi further said she is determined to only do roles where she contributes to the film.
