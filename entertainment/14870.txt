An FIR has been registered at the Bandra-Kurla Complex cyber police station based on a complaint lodged earlier by actor Hrithik Roshan about a fake e-mail address being used to impersonate him. The actor in his complaint letter said that many innocent people including his fans and certain people from the film industry were communicating with the alleged fake ID.
