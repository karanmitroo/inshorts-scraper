British singer Sir Rod Stewart has clarified that a video showing him mock executing a person was a recreation of a scene from 'Game of Thrones'. The video of the mock execution in the desert was perceived as mocking an Islamic State-style execution. "This has been misinterpreted... I send my deepest apologies to those who have been offended," said Stewart.
