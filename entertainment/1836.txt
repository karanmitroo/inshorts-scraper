Actor Tiger Shroff, who will star with Hrithik Roshan in an upcoming film, said that if Hrithik gives his 100%, he will have to give his 200-300% to match up to him. "He's my idol. Whatever I'm today, it is because of what I saw of him while growing up," he added. The film will be directed by Siddharth Anand.
