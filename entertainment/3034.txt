An FIR will be filed against 'Bigg Boss 11' participant Zubair Khan for pretending to be the son-in-law of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's sister Haseena Parkar, said Sameer Antulay, a member of Dawood's family. Antulay added, "He's a fraud...misusing the Dawood title for publicity." Sameer said the woman Zubair claims to be married to, is already married to a businessman.
