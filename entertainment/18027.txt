Actor Salman Khan has drawn criticism from Tamil Nadu's political parties for agreeing to campaign for Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa in elections to be held in that country next month. "He is a betrayer," said Vaiko of the MDMK. The DMK's TKS Elangovan said, "Salman Khan going to campaign for Rajapaksa is highly condemnable."
