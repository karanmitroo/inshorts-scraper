While talking at IFFI 2017 about how cinema is a unifying force, actor Amitabh Bachchan said that inside a movie hall one never asks what the caste, colour or religion of the person sitting next to them is. "We see...same film, we laugh at the same jokes, we cry at the same emotion, we sing the same songs," added Amitabh.
