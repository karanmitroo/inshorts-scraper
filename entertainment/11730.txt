The mother of actor Jim Carrey's ex-girlfriend Cathriona White has announced that she is suing the actor over her daughter's death, claiming that he gave her three sexually transmitted diseases. Her statement comes less than a month after White's estranged husband filed a lawsuit against Carrey for allegedly supplying prescription drugs that contributed to White's death.
