Television actress Narayani Shastri has said that if audiences saw Sridevi's 'Nagina' several times when it released, then what is the problem with such shows on television. She added, "People who find the naagin concept regressive, ask them if they watch international shows on vampires." However, Narayani further said that the quality of such Indian shows can be improved.
