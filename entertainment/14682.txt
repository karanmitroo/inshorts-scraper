The producers of 'Mena', actor Tom Cruise's upcoming film, have been sued over the death of two crew members in a plane crash while shooting in Columbia last September. The lawsuit also claims that the producers violated the closed-set policy by allowing a non-crew member, who was also killed in the plane crash, on location.
