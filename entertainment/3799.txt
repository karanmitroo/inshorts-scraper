Kangana Ranaut said she has not yet met a happy married man in her life. Talking about how married men lie to 'young' women, she said, "When you're young, you tend to believe...sob story of a married man when he tells you 'my wife beats me'." She added such things aren't true and women should stop falling for "this crap".
