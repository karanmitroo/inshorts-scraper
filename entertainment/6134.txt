Actor Abhishek Bachchan is set to star in filmmaker Priyadarshan's upcoming film tentatively titled 'Bachchan Singh', which has been described as something along the lines of Mr. India and The Mask. The film, which has been written by Rumi Jaffrey, is a fantasy fiction film, where Abhishek plays a corrupt cop who turns into a "saviour of sorts with powers".
