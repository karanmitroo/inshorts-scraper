Pornstar-turned-actress Sunny Leone starrer 'Kuch Kuch Locha Hai' that hit the screens today, is an insanely bizarre sex comedy, said Hindustan Times. The Devang Dholakia directorial, featuring TV actor Ram Kapoor opposite Leone, has 'nothing' and is far from being called an entertainer, it added. The film has been rated 0.5/5 (HT), 1/5 (Bollywood Life) and 2/5 (india.com).
