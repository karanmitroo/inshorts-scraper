Reacting to the Supreme Court's decision to allow an all India release of 'Padmaavat', Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria said, "The order given by the court will be studied". He said that while there are provisions for banning the film which he'll be looking into, the Supreme Court is above all. Earlier, the Rajasthan government had officially banned 'Padmaavat'.
