The BJP, Hindu Munnani, and the Hindu Makkal Katchi outfits of Tamil Nadu have warned actor Rajinikanth against doing a film on Tipu Sultan. Calling Sultan a murderer who ‘committed atrocities against Hindus’, the parties are against the idea of glorifying him. Ashok Kheny, a Kannada producer, had reportedly expressed his wish of making a film on Sultan with Rajinikanth.
