Late actor Shashi Kapoor's dialogue "Mere paas maa hai" from the 1975 film 'Deewaar' was a part of music composer AR Rahman's Oscar speech in 2009. Accepting two Oscars for 'Slumdog Millionaire', Rahman had said, "I want to thank her (my mother) for coming all the way to support me." Shashi passed away on Monday at the age of 79.
