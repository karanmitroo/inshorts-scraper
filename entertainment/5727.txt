Actress Huma Qureshi revealed that initially, she was asked to change her name as there's a Pakistani actor with the same name. She added, "[Was told] I wouldn't want that association, since I wanted to be the leading lady." Huma refused to change her name and explained, "I'll always be Huma Qureshi and people will have to deal with that."
