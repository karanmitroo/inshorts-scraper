Self-styled critic Kamaal R Khan on Twitter slammed Baahubali 2, and called the film a cartoon and a computer game. "I'm highly disappointed to see that #Bahubali2 is not even 10% of #Bahubali1," read one of his tweets. Further, he gave the film a one-star rating and accused the film's director SS Rajamouli of fooling public by generating fake hype.
