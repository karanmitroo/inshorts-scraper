Akshay Kumar, while agreeing to how international agencies like CIA or Mossad claim women are the world's best spies, said, "You can even ask any husband... this is not a joke, it is a fact." He further said, "Women have an inbuilt antenna in them... I don't know how they do it, but they find out things in a snap."
