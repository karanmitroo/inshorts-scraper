Actor Tom Hiddleston has apologised for his "inelegantly expressed" acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. "My words just came out wrong. My intention was to salute the incredible bravery... (of those) who work tirelessly for Unicef UK, Doctors Without Borders...," he wrote in a Facebook post. Hiddleston was criticised for bragging about his charity work in Sudan in his speech.
