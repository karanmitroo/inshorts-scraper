Filmmaker-choreographer Farah Khan on Wednesday said that filmmaker Karan Johar is "stressed out" regarding the ongoing controversy over 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'. "Karan will never do anything that is not patriotic," she said, adding that the matter should now be put to rest. Notably, Johar recently released a video message clarifying his stand on Pakistani artistes working in India.
