The Income Tax Department has provisionally attached Shah Rukh Khan's farmhouse in Maharashtra's Alibag under benami laws, as per reports. The I-T investigation said the farmhouse, registered as Deja Vu Farms Private Limited, acted as benamidar for the ultimate benefit of the actor. Khan had allegedly applied for buying agricultural land for farming but constructed a farmhouse for personal use.
