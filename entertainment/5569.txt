Actress Swara Bhasker has said that it's unfair to judge independent films based on their opening weekend collections as they usually don't feature actors like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan and Aamir Khan. "Indie films need 2-3 weeks to run. They're content driven and only work when word of mouth kicks in, once audiences like them," added Swara.
