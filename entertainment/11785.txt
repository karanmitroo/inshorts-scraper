American singer Madonna dedicated her song 'Human Nature' to Malala Yousafzai at a concert, days after the child rights activist was shot in the head by Pakistani Taliban on October 9, 2012. Madonna took off her shirt to reveal "Malala" written on her back during her 'MDNA' tour and divulged that hearing of the attack had made her cry.
