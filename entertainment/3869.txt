Nawazuddin Siddiqui, while speaking about his recently released film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz', said it's hard for a low-budget film to be declared a hit as people don't talk about it. He added, "₹3 crore ki film ₹16 crore kamale toh hit nahi hai, par ₹100 crore ki film ₹70 crore kamale toh hit hai, yeh kaha ka hisaab hua."
