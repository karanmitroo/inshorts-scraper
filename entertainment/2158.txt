Actress Zareen Khan has said that despite the film's producers telling her that the 2017 thriller 'Aksar 2' would be a very clean film, they wanted her to wear minimal clothes in every frame. Zareen added, "It was about certain angles that blur the line between looking sensuous and vulgar. The kissing duration was increased for no rhyme or reason?"
