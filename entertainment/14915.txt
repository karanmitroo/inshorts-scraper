Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan has said that there are no plans of reviving the banner 'RK Films', which was established by the late filmmaker-actor Raj Kapoor in 1948. "We made some really good films but at the moment there is nothing happening," added Kareena. The banner's last film was 'Aa Ab Laut Chalen', which released in 1999.
