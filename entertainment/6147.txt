Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Twitter supported the Mumbai Police's campaign which aims to create traffic and cyber crime awareness using dialogues from his films. One of the posts shows a scene from his 1975 film 'Sholay' wherein Amitabh asks Hema her name. The message in the tweet reads, "Cyber criminals often ask questions that do not need to be answered."
