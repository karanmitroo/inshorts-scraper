Actor Prateik Babbar has revealed that his first run-in with drugs was at the age of 13. "My first real drug was a disturbed childhood. Constantly faced with internal dilemma, the voices in my head debating... who I am, drugs came disguised as a glitzy escape," added Prateik. He further said that his family encouraged him to join rehab.
