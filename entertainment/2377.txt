Actress Lupita Nyong'o has slammed Grazia UK magazine for editing her curly hair on the cover of its latest edition. "I am disappointed that [they]...edited out and smoothed my hair to fit their notion of what beautiful hair looks like," she wrote. Lupita added, "I embrace my natural heritage...I know that my dark skin and coily hair are beautiful too."
