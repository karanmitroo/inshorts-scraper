Twinkle Khanna has written in her recent blog that men "have a strange obsession with balls". Twinkle made those comments after her husband Akshay Kumar mistakenly referred to "tentacles" as "testicles" while enquiring about their daughter Nitara's octopus costume, which Twinkle had been stitching. "Slip of the tongue... you know what I meant!" said Akshay.
