The ground floor of Mumbai's RK Studio has been gutted after a major fire broke out on the sets of reality show 'Super Dancer' on Saturday. The reason behind the fire was reportedly the failure of electric wiring which sparked the flames causing the fire to spread throughout. No casualties were reported, since there was no scheduled shooting.
