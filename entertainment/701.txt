Sanjay Leela Bhansali, while speaking on the 'Padmaavat' row, said, "I think it's the most anxious release in the history of Indian cinema." "There were anxious moments right from finishing it to getting the censors and getting it into theatres," he added. Bhansali further said, "I know I was troubled...but deep inside, I found the strength to make the film."
