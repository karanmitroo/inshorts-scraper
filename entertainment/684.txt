Talking about remakes, rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh said, "I feel that remakes should be done properly so that we do not get cursed by their original artists." He added, "I try to keep the hook line and melody of old songs while remaking songs." He further said the remake should seem like a new song with an old feel.
