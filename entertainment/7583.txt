Actor Sylvester Stallone has joked that it was his dog Butkus' idea to write 'Rocky'. Sharing an old picture of himself with Butkus during his days of struggle on Instagram, Stallone wrote, "Years later when things got even worse I had to sell him for $40...because I couldn't afford food." After selling Rocky's script, Stallone bought Butkus back for $15,000.
