Iraq held its first beauty pageant after over four decades, crowning Shaymaa Abdelrahman (20) as the first Miss Iraq since 1972. The contest was designed to let its winner participate in the Miss Universe pageant, and was reportedly held "to make Iraqâ€™s voice heard". The pageant was conducted despite the ongoing conflict with the Islamic State and other armed groups.
