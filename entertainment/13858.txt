A new trailer for the Morgan Freeman and Jack Huston starrer 'Ben-Hur' was released on Tuesday. The film has been termed a "new interpretation" of the 1880 novel 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ' by Lew Wallace. Huston portrays the fictional character 'Ben-Hur', while Morgan stars as Sheik Ilderim, the person who trains the titular character to become a charioteer.
