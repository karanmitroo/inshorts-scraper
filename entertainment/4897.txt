The trailer of the eight-hour long slow-motion film 'Baa Baa Land' has been released. Described as the "dullest movie ever made", the film mainly consists of slow-motion shots of sheep in a field. The film has been produced by the founders of a digital meditation app and is reportedly inspired by the 2016 Oscar-winning film 'La La Land'.
