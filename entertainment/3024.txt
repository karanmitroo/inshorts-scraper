Arjun Kapoor responded to a troll who called him a rapist and a criminal on Twitter. "This is an all-time low at trolling I feel...a woman, a girl shamelessly and casually using the term rapist isn't trolling it's saddening," he wrote. Earlier, speaking about social media trolls, Arjun said, "[People] get pleasure out of hiding behind a keyboard and trolling."
