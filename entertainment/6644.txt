American actress and singer Patti LuPone has slammed Madonna's acting skills while saying, "Madonna is a movie killer. She's dead behind the eyes... She should not be in film or on stage."  LuPone added, "She cannot act her way out of a paper bag... She's a wonderful performer for what she does, but she's not an actress."
