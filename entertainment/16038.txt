The 45-year-old children’s show “Sesame Street” will be back on air on January 16 in the US, TV network HBO has said. The new production will have a new real-life bilingual Latina character Nina beside Muppets Elmo, Cookie Monster and Big Bird on a “reimagined” set. The episodes in this season will be 30-minutes-long against the usual 60 minute run-time.
