Filmmaker Shyam Benegal, who heads the government-appointed panel to revamp the Censor Board, has said that 'Udta Punjab' is an "important film". "[I]t brings to the fore a... big problem. You cannot think that everything will fit in the same set of rules, films are not made in a factory", Benegal said, after watching the film at a special screening.
