The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has denied a certificate to the film 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', starring Ratna Pathak Shah and Konkona Sen Sharma. "The story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life," wrote CBFC in a letter. The Censor Board further wrote that the film contains sexual scenes, abusive words and audio pornography.
