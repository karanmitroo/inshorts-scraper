Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said he's thrilled that his film 'Haraamkhor' is doing well without expensive marketing or any set promotion techniques. "It truly represents that both big ticket films and those who are true indie...can do well simultaneously," he added. 'Haraamkhor' is about the relationship between a teacher and his teenage student, played by Nawazuddin and Shweta Tripathi respectively.
