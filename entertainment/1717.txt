After 17-year-old Dangal actress Zaira Wasim alleged that she was molested on-board an Air Vistara Delhi-Mumbai flight, the airline said that Zaira and her mother refused to file a complaint when asked by the crew. The airline further claimed that Zaira shared the incident only when the flight commenced its descent for Mumbai, when all the cabin crew was seated.
