On the occasion of World Cartoonist Day, RK Laxman's grand-daughter Rimanika Laxman announced that she'll be introducing new cartoon characters 'New Common Man' and 'The Common Woman'. The cartoons aim to continue the legacy of RK Laxman's iconic 'The Common Man' cartoons, which according to him "symbolizes the mute millions of India.. a silent spectator of marching time".
