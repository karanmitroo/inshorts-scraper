A video clipping of actress Anushka Sharma promoting her recently released film 'NH10' in a news studio has gone viral. In the video, a female journalist repeatedly tried to ask Anushka about her relationship with cricketer Virat Kohli. Calling her questions 'stupid', the actress said, "You know me for my work, will never talk about my personal life."
