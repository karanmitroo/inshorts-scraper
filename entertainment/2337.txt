American actress-model Jenny McCarthy has said that she once asked Hollywood actor-filmmaker Steven Seagal to buy her Playboy video when he tried to sexually harass her. She added how during an audition for his film, Seagal asked her to lower her dress. He allegedly told her, "There is off camera nudity...I know you must have a beautiful body underneath there."
