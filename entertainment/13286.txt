The seventh season of the HBO series 'Game of Thrones' is set to premiere in summer next year. "Instead of the showâ€™s traditional spring debut, we are moving the debut to summer to accommodate the shooting schedule," said HBO Programming President Casey Bloys, as the upcoming season features more winter scenes. The season will reportedly have only seven episodes.
