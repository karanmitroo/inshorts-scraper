Ang Lee's directorial 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk', which released on Friday, is "one of the year's most quietly meditative experiences", wrote Hindustan Times. Mid-Day called the film "absorbing but not wholly involving" while Times of India wrote that "this is not one of his (Lee's) strongest films". The film has been rated 4/5 (HT), 2.5/5 (Mid-Day) and 3/5 (TOI).
