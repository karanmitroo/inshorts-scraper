Actress Emilia Clarke, who plays 'Daenerys Targaryen' in the HBO fantasy drama television series 'Game of Thrones', has shared a video from the sets. Emilia can be seen trying to speak through a strong wind blowing on the shooting location. "And then I fell over. Or rather a brisk 50mph (North) Irish wind caught me unawares," she captioned the video.
