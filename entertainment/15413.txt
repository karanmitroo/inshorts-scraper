Actor Pulkit Samrat has said that it is "immature" to hold anyone responsible for his broken marriage, after rumours claimed that Pulkit and his wife Shweta Rohira parted ways due to his closeness with co-star Yami Gautam. Pulkit said that Shweta and he mistook each other as soul mates. He added, "It is foolish to hold someone else responsible".
