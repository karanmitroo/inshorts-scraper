A video titled 'The Worst Item Number', where children are seen dancing alongside a woman in an item number, is part of a petition to the Censor Board Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani to ‘Re-grade Item Numbers’. The project by 'Angels Clinic', a mental health clinic aims to spread awareness about such unregulated adult content in films glorifying the "objectification of women".
