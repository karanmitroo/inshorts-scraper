Director Abhinav Kashyap's 'Besharam' has managed to earn only Rs 40.31-crore in the first four-days of release. Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted - "Thu + Fri + Sat *combined total* is less than what it collected on Wed [Rs 21.56 cr] Shocking!" The movie, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, seems to have failed to impress the audience.
