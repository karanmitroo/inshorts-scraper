Actor Akshay Kumar has said that unfortunately actresses are treated like time bombs in Bollywood, which he feels is completely unfair. "I'm beyond proud of all [those] who've not let the 10-year shelf life have any significance for their careers and have stormed past [that deadline] with pride," added Akshay. He further said, "To feel young, one must act young."
