On the directives of a Bareilly local court, a case has been filed against 12 persons including actors Ranvir Singh, Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra and director of movie 'Goliyon Ki Raslila Ramleela'. The order came on the basis of a petition, which alleged that violence and obscenity has been glorified in the film, which has hurt the sentiments of Hindus.
