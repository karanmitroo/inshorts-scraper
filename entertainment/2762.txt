Aamir Khan has revealed that he was offered Rajinikanth's role in the upcoming film '2.0' as Rajinikanth wasn't feeling well at that time. Further talking about why he rejected the film, Aamir added, "When I used to think of the film, think of the scene, Rajini sir used to come in my head. I could not imagine myself doing it."
