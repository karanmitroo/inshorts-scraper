Slamming Aamir Khan's statement on alleged intolerance in India, actor Anupam Kher on Monday asked the former about the country he and Kiran Rao wish to move to. "When did ‘Incredible India’ become ‘Intolerant India’ for you?," Kher asked him on Twitter. Citing 'Satyamev Jayate', Kher advised Khan to spread hope the way he did in the show, not fear.
