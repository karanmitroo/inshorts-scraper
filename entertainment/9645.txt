English singer Ed Sheeran revealed that he once posed as Scottish DJ Calvin Harris to get inside an Oscar party. "I was with Rita Ora. She said Calvin's on the list and I know he's not coming, so just say that you're him," he said. No one knew what Harris looked like, just the DJ name, Sheeran added.
