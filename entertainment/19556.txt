Choreographer-director Prabhu Dheva's 'R...Rajkumar', set to release on 6-December-2013, launches Shahid Kapoor in a new action-hero avatar. The trailer has ample resonances of Dheva's earlier works like 'Wanted' and 'Rowdy Rathore' and has lead-actress Sonakshi Sinha in her never explored action-style and sultry-avatar. Sonu Sood is back in a negative-role and Shradda Kapoor is going to appear in a special-song.
