Singer Britney Spears suffered a wardrobe malfunction during a concert in Las Vegas last weekend. She was performing to 'I love rock 'N' roll', when her top came undone. The 30-year-old continued performing, while two dancers fastened the top. When her top fell for the second time, a dancer gave her his shirt and Spears continued her act.
