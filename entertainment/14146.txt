Fardeen Khan on Thursday  took to Facebook to say that he is neither offended nor depressed by the body-shaming he faced after a recent picture of him emerged online. "This worldwide behavioral pattern on the internet is disturbing even though I believe in absolutely free speech," said Fardeen. "Happy to have been the weekends entertainment for you trollers", he added.
