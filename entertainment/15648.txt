After the death of songwriter-singer-actor David Bowie last week, Belgian radio station Studio Brussel and the MIRA public observatory have dedicated a constellation to him. The constellation consists of seven stars shaped like a lightning bolt. "The constellation is a copy of the iconic Bowie lightning and was recorded at the exact time of his death", the MIRA observatory said.
