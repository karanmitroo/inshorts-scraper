Actor Aamir Khan while speaking about regional cinema said that "Marathi cinema has really evolved over the last ten years" and this growth in "regional cinema is a great thing". Aamir added, "The kind of films you make is relevant, not the language. Cinema has got no language." He also appreciated some Marathi films including 'Sairat', 'Court' and 'Natsamrat'.
