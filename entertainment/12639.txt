Late American singer Prince's private estate and studio complex Paisley Park in Minnesota will open for public tours starting October 6. A 70-minute tour, costing around $38, will span the 65,000-square-foot complex in which the singer died of a painkiller overdose in April. According to Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, "opening Paisley Park is something that Prince always wanted to do."
