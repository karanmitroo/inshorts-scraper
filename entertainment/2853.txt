Karan K, an artist in Surat who made a rangoli on Deepika Padukone's look in 'Padmavati' in 48 hours, has claimed that a crowd of 100 people cried 'Jai Shri Ram' as they vandalised his work. He took to Twitter to share pictures of how the rangoli looked while he was making it and how it looked afterwards.
