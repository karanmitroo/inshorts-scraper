'Pad Man' director R Balki has said menstruation is as natural a phenomenon as growing a beard is while adding, "It's a natural process and there's nothing to hide." He added, "The moment you call this (menstruation) an adult topic, the whole purpose is defeated." Balki further said 'Pad Man' is a children's film which must be watched with families.
