The Tamil Film Producers Council has decided not to release new Tamil movies from Friday in protest against the levy of additional 10% local body tax by Chennai Corporation. The council said the announcement of levying the additional tax has come as a shock to the industry. It also wrote to the Tamil Nadu government requesting removal of the tax.
