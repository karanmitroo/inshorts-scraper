Egypt has banned Hollywood film "Exodus: Gods and Kings", a 20th Century Fox spokesman said on Friday. The studio refused to give a reason for the ban, but films that depict biblical figures have been prohibited before in the Muslim country. The film,  starring Christian Bale, dramatizes the Bible's Book of Exodus about Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt.
