Choreographer-director Remo D'Souza recently said that he wants to direct Hrithik Roshan in his dream project. Remo, whose directorial venture 'ABCD 2' is releasing on June 26, said, "I am working on it. Itâ€™s a period drama... It's a very huge film." He added, "[I]f 'ABCD 2' works, then filmmakers might trust. And if it happens, I will make it."
