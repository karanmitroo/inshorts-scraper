Child actor Sunny Pawar, who featured in the Oscar-nominated film 'Lion', has been named the 'Rising Star' at the 7th Annual Asian Awards. He portrayed young Saroo Brierley in the film. "It is a travesty that other award ceremonies overlooked [Sunny's] performance in the film 'Lion' and we want to correct that," said the founder of the Asian Awards.
