Filmmaker Onir has slammed a scene in the recently released film 'Judwaa 2', which showed a woman's back being casually slapped. Onir questioned how is it alright for everyone to watch such a scene in a country where women are molested, whereas his film 'Shab', which deals with homosexuality, is not deemed fit for television viewing by the Censor Board.
