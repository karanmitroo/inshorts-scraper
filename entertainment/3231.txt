Filmmaker Rohit Shetty, on being asked if there'll be a fifth film in the 'Golmaal' series, said, "Definitely, but we have to get the right script for that." Rohit added that the fourth instalment 'Golmaal Again' comes after seven years because he wanted the right script and didn't want to make a film just for the sake of making it.
