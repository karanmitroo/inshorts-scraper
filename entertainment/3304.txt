Akshay Kumar has said comedy is in his blood and entertainment is his calling card. Akshay added, "My audience will never have to fear about me not doing an out-and-out comedy." He further said, "Making someone laugh with your (comic) timing, your one-liners and your facial expressions, is not only extremely difficult but also painfully embarrassing if you fail."
