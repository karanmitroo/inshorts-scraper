Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday said the Centre is ready to provide security to 'Dangal' child actor Zaira Wasim if the Jammu and Kashmir government recommended. Zaira, who portrayed the young Geeta Phogat in 'Dangal', recently issued an online apology for 'offending' and 'unintentionally hurting' the people after she met CM Mehbooba Mufti. The actor later deleted the post.
