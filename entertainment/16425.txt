Sooraj Pancholi and Athiya Shetty's acting debut film 'Hero', which hit the screens on Friday, is a bad remake, said HT. "Sooraj is good in parts... Athiya has the potential and looks good," wrote Mid-Day. "Hero is below mediocre fare except for the lead pair's straightforward performances," said NDTV. It has been rated 1.5/5 (HT) and 2.5/5 (Mid-Day and NDTV).
