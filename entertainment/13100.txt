Two-time Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman is set to become the second Indian to perform at the United Nations General Assembly, as part of India's 69th Independence Day celebrations. Rahman will reportedly perform a musical rendition of Rabindranath Tagore's poem 'Where the mind is without fear'. Carnatic singer MS Subbulakshmi was the first Indian to perform at UN in October 1966.
