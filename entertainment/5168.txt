Pooja Bhatt has said she and her estranged husband Manish Makhija never got divorced on paper. She added, "I don't believe that a piece of paper can decide your relationship status. We made a choice to get married...to end our marriage, and to remain friends." Pooja and Manish had been married for eleven years when they separated in 2014.
