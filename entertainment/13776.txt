Actor Sunny Deol has said that he wants to continue the 'Ghayal' film franchise with a sequel to 'Ghayal Once Again', which released on February 5, 2016. "I won’t direct this time... I would produce the film because it’s quite difficult to direct and act at the same time,” said Deol. Notably, the franchise's first film 'Ghayal' released in 1990.
