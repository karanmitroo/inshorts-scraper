Singer Adnan Sami, who became a father to baby girl Medina, said even if she holds a German citizenship by birth, that doesn't stop her from being a Hindustani. He added, "She'll eventually come to India and we'll apply for Indian citizenship." Adnan, who was born in London and is of Pakistani origin, was granted Indian citizenship in January 2016.
