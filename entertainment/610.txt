Indian comedy group AIB in their video 'An Ode To Karni Sena' has taken a dig at the Rajput organisation for allegedly attacking a school bus in Gurugram during protests against 'Padmaavat'. The video shows children inside a bus singing lyrics including, "Sena outside comes beat beat beat...Cause our lives are cheap cheap cheap...Cops don't give a beep beep beep."
