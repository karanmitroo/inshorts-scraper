US actress and comedian Tina Fey has slammed white supremacists over the violence which killed one woman and injured 19 others in Virginia last week. She advised Americans to tell white supremacists that the US is not their country and they have taken it from native Americans. She also criticised President Donald Trump for blaming "both sides" for the violence.
