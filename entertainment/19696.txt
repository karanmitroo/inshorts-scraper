After 50 years of gap, Pakistan will submit an entry to Oscar this year for the foreign language film category awards. However, the committee, being chaired by Sharmeen Chinoy - Pakistan's first Oscar winner, has not yet chosen the movie. Pakistan has sent only two films, Jago Hua Savera(1959) and Ghunghat(1963) to Oscar since the category was created in 1956.
