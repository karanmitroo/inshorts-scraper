Members of West Bengal's Visva Bharati University have objected to two kissing scenes in actress Priyanka Chopra's upcoming production 'Nalini', based on Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's love story. "The scenes are unnecessary. There's no proof of their authenticity like the director claims," said the university members. They plan to file a case if the kissing scenes aren't deleted.
