The American sitcom 'The Big Bang Theory' is reportedly getting sued for using the lullaby 'Soft Kitty' over copyright issues by daughters of poet Edith Newlin who wrote the lyrics for 'Warm Kitty' in 1937. In the lawsuit, they claim no credit or compensation was given even though 'Soft Kitty' lyrics is among the "most popular aspects" of the show.
