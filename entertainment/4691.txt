Actor Saif Ali Khan has said that he was fortunate to enter films when the audience was forgiving and the media was kind. He added, "We do live in times where celebrities and people are in general cautious about what they say. I think we live in so much fear." Saif made his acting debut with the 1993 film 'Parampara'.
