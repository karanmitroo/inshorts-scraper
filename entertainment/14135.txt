The release of the Irrfan Khan starrer 'Madaari' has been postponed to July 15. "I want complete justice to be done to the subject of the movie," said the film's director Nishikant Kamat on deferring the release date. Notably, the earlier release date of 'Madaari' on June 10 would have clashed with the release of Amitabh Bachchan's upcoming film 'TE3N'.
