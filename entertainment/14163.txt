Bollywood actor Salman Khan has said that the most difficult thing he faced during the shooting of 'Sultan' was to wear a ‘langot’ (loincloth). Saying that the film's director did not allow him to wear shorts to keep his character of wrestler 'real', Khan added, "I realised how heroines would feel when they have to go through the strip shots."
