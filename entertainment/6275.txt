Actor Salman Khan has said that it's difficult to bring out the honesty of pure, innocent characters onscreen, as actors themselves aren't the purest of people in real life. He said this while talking about his role in films like 'Tubelight' and 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. "It is your own personality that goes against you in films like these," added Salman.
