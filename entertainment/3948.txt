Tabu has denied reports of being approached to portray Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj in an upcoming biopic on Uzma Ahmed. "I think this is clearly done to hype their projects and to create insecurity among other actresses who may be approached for the role," said Tabu. Uzma was an Indian national who was brought back from Pakistan.
