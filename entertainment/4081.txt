The Huma Qureshi starrer film 'Partition: 1947' is a "wishy-washy, desiccated History lesson," wrote NDTV. "[Director] Gurinder Chadha ably paints the anxiety and painful relocation of millions on both sides of the border," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). Times of India (TOI) said the film is "a timely and riveting watch." It was rated 2/5 (NDTV), 2.5/5 (HT) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
