Vidya Balan has said that the role of a teenager or dancing around the trees never excites her. "What excites me is now I can experiment with roles and characters being in my age," Vidya added. The 38-year-old actress further said, "I'm not apologetic about my age...I know there'll always be some work for me in whichever age I am."
