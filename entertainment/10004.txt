Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the Sunny Deol starrer film 'Mohalla Assi' has been denied certification by the board. "The film has now gone to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal," Nihalani added. Notably, this comes after the Delhi High Court sought a response from the Censor Board after it denied certificate for public screening of the film.
