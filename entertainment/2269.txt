Pakistan's Censor Board has been trolled for cancelling the release of Mahira Khan starrer 'Verna', reportedly due to its subject of rape and the depiction of a rape scene in the film. "Maybe it was banned for not having enough item songs," commented a user. "When they can't bear the truth, they try to destroy it," read another comment.
