A four-minute kiss between real-life couple Devika Rani and Himanshu Rai in 'Karma' (1933), is known to be the longest kiss in Indian cinema. Rani, whose 109th birth anniversary was observed on Thursday, is known as the 'First lady of Indian cinema'. However, the first on-screen kiss in an Indian movie was in 1929 silent film 'A Throw of Dice'.
