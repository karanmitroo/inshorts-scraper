Hollywood actress Kate Winslet has revealed that she and Leonardo DiCaprio often quote lines from their film 'Titanic' back and forth to each other. "Because only we can, and we find it really funny," she added. Kate further said, "[We] find ourselves saying to each other, 'Can you imagine if the world really knew the stupid things we say?'"
