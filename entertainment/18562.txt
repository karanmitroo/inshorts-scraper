YRF production 'Mardaani', which hits the theatres on Friday, will not be released in Pakistan. The Pakistan Film Censor Board gave an 'A' certificate to the film, but also demanded the omission of several scenes, and blurring of others. "These changes were leading to the message of the film being distorted and the essence being diluted," said a YRF spokesperson.
