Actress Taapsee Pannu has said that she isn't reprising the role of Karisma Kapoor or Rambha in the upcoming sequel to 'Judwaa'. She added, "They've revamped the girl's character. I play an Indian girl, born and brought up in London, who studies with Varun Dhawan's character in college." The film, also starring Jacqueline Fernandez, is being directed by David Dhawan.
