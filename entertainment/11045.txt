Vandals have painted a Soviet-era star on a tower in Russia to resemble Patrick Star, a character in the American series SpongeBob SquarePants. The police have said the vandals will be charged with hooliganism, and face up to 15 days' imprisonment and a â‚¹1,000 fine. Last year, a 'Jolly Roger' (pirate flag) was left on top of the tower's spire.
