Anushka Sharma's recently launched clothing line NUSH will be discarding a few of the items whose designs were found to be plagiarised from a Chinese e-commerce website. Pawan Agarwal, the Chief Managing Director of the company which designed and procured the samples said Anushka was only involved in advising them on the styles that are part of the clothing line.
