Singer Justin Bieber got emotional during his speech at the One Love Manchester concert, held to raise funds for the victims who died after the terror attack at Ariana Grande's concert in the city earlier. "God is good in the midst of the darkness. God is in the midst, no matter what is happening in the world," said Bieber.
