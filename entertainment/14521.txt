People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has released an advertisement with actress Sunny Leone urging people to "adopt a dog from the street or a shelter". "If you can rescue an animal, then thatâ€™s one of the greatest gifts you can give," said Sunny. Notably, India recently banned the import of foreign dogs for breeding.
