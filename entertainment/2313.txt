The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) has cancelled the screenings of the regional language films 'S Durga' and 'Nude' at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), without consulting the jury, which initially selected the films. "My guess is that the people who took this decision did not bother watching either of the two films," said a jury member.
