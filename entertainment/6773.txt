Music composer and singer AR Rahman, while speaking on the row between Sonakshi Sinha and Armaan Malik over actors turning into singers, has said that it is not like singing belongs to singers only. "[I]t doesn't matter who is doing what, dedication is what matters," he added. Rahman further said that there is no point in restricting oneself.
