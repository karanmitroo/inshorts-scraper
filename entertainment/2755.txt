Ousted Censor Board Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani, while speaking about casting couch in Bollywood, said the industry has a clear list of sexual offenders. "They continue to exploit hapless strugglers because they are not held liable for their dirty deeds," he added. Notably, the upcoming film 'Julie 2', which is being presented by Nihalani, deals with casting couch in Bollywood.
