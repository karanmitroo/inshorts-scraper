Reacting to Aamir Khan’s “nude” pose for the poster of upcoming film “P.K.”, a Kanpur-based lawyer named Manoj Kumar Saturday filed a case against the actor, director Rajkumar Hirani and producer of the film Vidhu Vinod Chopra under Section 292 of the IPC. The lawyer contended that the film’s poster sends a “wrong message” to the people and was “obscene”.
