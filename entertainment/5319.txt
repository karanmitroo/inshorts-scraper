A police complaint has been lodged against Aam Aadmi Party leader and poet Kumar Vishwas for making derogatory remarks against women on The Kapil Sharma Show. Vishwas was on the show on Saturday when he said, "Chunav mein...jis ladki se aapka affair chalao uske pati ko jijaji kehna padta hai, jijaji vote de dena samaan to aap le hi gaye."
