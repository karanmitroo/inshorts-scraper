American DJ Skrillex has tweeted a video of himself getting handcuffed by the police to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Skrillex claims he was pulled over for playing music too loudly in his Tesla car but was handcuffed as he didn't have his ID. "@elonmusk ur system in the tesla model x is just too [fire]," he said in another tweet.
