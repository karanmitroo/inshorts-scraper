According to reports, the Censor Board has asked to delete a sequence from the film 'Phillauri', which shows actor Suraj Sharma reciting the Hanuman Chalisa in a bathtub in a ghost's presence. The board said it would hurt religious sentiments and hence should be deleted from the film. Sharma's chant will reportedly be inaudible in the film now.
