The Supreme Court has closed a nine-year-old case against Govinda for slapping a man named Santosh in 2008. The SC's decision came after the actor tendered an unconditional apology to the complainant and the apex court. The actor had slapped Santosh when he had gone to see Govinda's film shoot and the act was also caught on camera.
