Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) CEO Anurag Srivastava has said they refused certification to the film 'Padmavati' as the makers did not provide a disclaimer on whether it was based on fiction or on historical facts. He added, "The document was (deemed) incomplete, because for examination purposes, we need to know what they (makers) are saying."
