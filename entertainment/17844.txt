Following rumours that he would join BJP, actor Amitabh Bachchan Saturday clarified that he was not joining any political party. “Just because I have campaigned for a social cause that does not mean I am joining politics... I am not in politics,” Bachchan said. The rumours erupted after he took part in Swachh Bharat campaign launched by PM Narendra Modi.
