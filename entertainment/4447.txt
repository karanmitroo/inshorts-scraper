Actress Sophie Turner, known for portraying 'Sansa Stark' in HBO series 'Game of Thrones', said there are often times when she is asked to lose weight for roles, even when it has nothing to do with the character. "It is so f*cked up," she added. Sophie further revealed that she initially struggled to adapt to life in the public eye.
