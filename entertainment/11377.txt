Television host Jimmy Kimmel shared a video on Facebook, wherein he mocks Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's pronunciation of "Ab Ki Baar, Trump Sarkar" in a campaign advertisement which surfaced online. The video further shows Indians being asked if they could understand Trump's Hindi, which many couldnâ€™t. Notably, "Ab Ki Baar, Modi Sarkar" was BJP's election slogan for 2014 polls.
