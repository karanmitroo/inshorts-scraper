Filmmaker Karan Johar has said Aditya Chopra is the only person he doesn't lie to because Aditya can catch him at the very moment. Further talking about their friendship, Johar added, "We message and call each other when we love a film, when we don't, then the silence is...understood." He added that Aditya is also incapable of lying to him.
