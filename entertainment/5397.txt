The Tamil Nadu Film Chamber of Commerce has announced an indefinite shutdown of about 1,100 theatres across Tamil Nadu from July 3. This is because the state government hasn't specified yet whether theatre owners will have to pay 30% entertainment tax to the local body above GST. Cinema tickets above â‚¹100 will fall under the 28% tax slab under GST.
