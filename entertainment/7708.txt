American rapper Wiz Khalifa left a joint and flowers at Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's grave in Medellin and shared a picture of the same on social media. Criticising the rapper for this, the city's mayor compared him to Adolf Hitler and said, "This guy should have brought flowers to the graves of all victims killed by drug trafficking."
