Anushka Sharma's Phillauri "hovers...from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting," wrote India Today. "Phillauri is an unconventional Bollywood entertainer...watchable all the way," said NDTV. Hindustan Times wrote, "Despite a fresh idea, it is a loosely-written film that fails to engross the audience." It was rated 3/5 (NDTV), 2.5/5 (HT) 1.5/5 (India Today).
