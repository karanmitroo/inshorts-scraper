The yellow and gold outfit, that singer Rihanna wore to the 2015 Met Gala, took 2 years to make, the singer has claimed. "It's a miracle how it happened actually. I saw this beautiful beast on the Internet... It's handmade by one Chinese woman," Rihanna said. The dress has been stitched together by woman designer Guo Pei.
