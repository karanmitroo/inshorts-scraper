Actress Kangana Ranaut, who was last seen in 'Tanu Weds Manu Returns', will adopt a bald look in her next film 'Katti Batti'. The actress, however, will not shave off her hair but will take the help of prosthetics. In the film, that also stars Imran Khan, Kangana’s character is suffering from an illness that’ll make her lose her hair.
