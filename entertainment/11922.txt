Actor Ranbir Kapoor, while reacting to the ban on Pakistani artistes working in India, said, "[W]e are living in some "hard times right now". "I hope that you guys don’t get swept away with the bitterness and negativity, the violence that’s happening around the world and around us," added Kapoor. However, he added that he doesn't want to sound "preachy".
