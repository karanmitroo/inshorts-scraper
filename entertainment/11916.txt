An old couple from Tamil Nadu has claimed that they are the real parents of actor Dhanush, the son-in-law of actor Rajinikanth. They have alleged that Dhanush's real name is Kalaiyarasan and he left the house in 2002 after performing poorly in his studies. They further said that Dhanush has not visited them since he became an actor.
