Tony Award-winning Broadway singer Jennifer Holliday on Saturday pulled out of President-elect Donald Trump's Inauguration Day concert, saying that the performance will be a "betrayal" of her gay and lesbian fans. Holliday further apologised for her "lapse of judgement" and for being uneducated on issues affecting Americans. Trump will be sworn in on January 20, known as the Inauguration Day.
