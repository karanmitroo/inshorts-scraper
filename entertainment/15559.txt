Pakistan's Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC) has banned the Tusshar Kapoor and Aftab Shivdasani-starrer sex comedy 'Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3' from public viewing. â€œThe film is full of nudity and has a lot of vulgar content in its dialogues", CBFC Chief Mobashir Hasan said. It is not fit to be screened even with an adult rating, he added.
