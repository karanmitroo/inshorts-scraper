Four women, including actors Kirsten Dunst, Vanessa Paradis and Valeria Golino, and Iranian producer Katayoon Shahabi are part of the Cannes Film Festival jury, making it the most feminine jury of the 69-year-old festival. 'Mad Max' director George Miller will be presiding over the nine-member jury. "Cannes has always sought to adopt a universal and international approach," the organisers said.
