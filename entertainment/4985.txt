Mumbai's Royal Opera House will host a full opera performance this month, its first since the venue closed down in 1993. II Matrimonio Segreto, or The Secret Marriage, is an 18th century opera and will be performed by an all-Indian cast. The recently-restored opera house is owned by the former royal family of Gondal and was reopened in 2016.
