Actress Rose McGowan slammed Meryl Streep for being silent on the sexual harassment row in Hollywood even though she has worked with rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein. "Actresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @GoldenGlobes in a silent protest," tweeted McGowan. She added, "You'll accept a fake award breathlessly and affect no real change."
