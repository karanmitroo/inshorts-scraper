The upcoming edition of Bråvalla, Sweden's biggest music festival, has been cancelled due to reports of rape and sexual assaults at this year's edition of the event. Police were notified of 23 sexual assaults and four rapes between Thursday and Sunday. "Certain men... apparently cannot behave. It's a shame. We have therefore decided to cancel Bråvalla 2018,” said the organisers.
