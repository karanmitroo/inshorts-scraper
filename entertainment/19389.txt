A Mumbai court on Thursday ordered fresh trial in a 2002 hit-and-run case against actor Salman Khan. Salman had urged for a fresh trial, as the charge against him was enhanced to the more serious "culpable homicide not amounting to murder", which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail. The trial is set to begin on December 23.
