Rani Mukerji has said she doesn't post pictures of daughter Adira on social media as her husband Aditya Chopra is a very private person and she respects that. She added, "I also hate saying no to my fans if (they)...ask me for her pictures. So I stay away from social media." Adira, born in 2015, is the couple's first child.
