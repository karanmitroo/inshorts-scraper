Actor Akshay Kumar has extended his help to Ravi Shrivastava, the ailing producer of his first film which later got shelved. Shrivastava is reportedly suffering from kidney failure and needs money for the transplant. "Yes sir, my team has reached out to him...already taken care of," tweeted Akshay responding to a follower, who shared an article on the producer.
