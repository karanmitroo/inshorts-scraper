Talking about competition in Bollywood, Katrina Kaif has said that it would be insane and illogical to compete with 20-21 years old and that she can't think of playing a 21-year-old girl in a pink miniskirt. She added, "Healthy competition is obviously there, but there is no sense of envy for people who are at different stages of their career."
