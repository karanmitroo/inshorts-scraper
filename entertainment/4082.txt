Producer Ekta Kapoor has said that as much as she would like to take credit for Pahlaj Nihalani getting fired as Censor Board chief, she has had no role in it. "When I asked Smriti Irani why she didn't tell me about it, she shot back saying that it's her work and why should she tell me," added Ekta.
