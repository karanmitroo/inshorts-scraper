Mark Bridges gave a speech for 36 seconds after winning an Oscar for Best Costume Design, which was the shortest speech at the 90th Academy Awards. Bridges received a jet ski and a free stay at a luxury hotel in Arizona as promised by Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel, who said the winner with the shortest speech short would be rewarded.
