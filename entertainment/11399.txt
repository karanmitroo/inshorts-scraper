The Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai-starrer film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', which released today, is "hard to relate to", wrote Hindustan Times. "This brand new film feels same old," said The Indian Express. The film "is a mish-mash of [Karan Johar's] own films", wrote India Today. It has been rated 2/5 (India Today, Indian Express) and 2.5/5 (HT).
