Singer Sona Mohapatra, in a veiled reference to Sonakshi Sinha and singer Armaan Malik's row over actors turning into singers, tweeted that Justin Bieber's concert was worthy and best left to 'actors of singing'. Further, she called the concert a "fake, overhyped gig". Sona also wrote that Bieber should've spent time on a sound check instead of visiting underprivileged kids.
