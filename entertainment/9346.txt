Actress Natalie Portman, who is pregnant with her second child, has posed with her baby bump in the 2017 Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue. The magazine in its Hollywood Portfolio has called Portman "a super-concentrated packet whose features have the precision of an X-Acto knife." Notably, the 35-year-old actress has received a Best Actress nomination for 'Jackie' at the Oscars 2017.
