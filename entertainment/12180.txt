Actor Charlie Chaplin was forbidden from re-entering the US on September 19, 1952, while he was travelling to England, due to his association with 'communist organisations'. The comedian visited the US twenty years later in 1972 to accept an honorary Oscar Award. Notably, the US was engaged in an ideological 'Cold War' against the communist Soviet Union at that time.
