Model Poonam Pandey was arrested by the Mumbai police for 'indecent behaviour' on Friday night. There was no indication on what those 'indecent acts' were but police officials said that she was ‘caught wearing skimpy attire’ and ‘was let her off with a warning.’ Pandey defended herself saying that she was just listening to music, which wasn't indecent.
