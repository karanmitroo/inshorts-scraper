Sachin Tendulkar has promised to meet one of his fans who appeared on the game show, Kaun Banega Crorepati. Rajudas Rathod revealed he had been Sachin's fan since he started watching cricket and had even broken one or two remotes while quarrelling with his daughter who used to interrupt during matches. Sachin tweeted he hoped Rathod didn't break more remotes.
