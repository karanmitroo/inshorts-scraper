UP government has decided to make Amitabh Bachchan's latest Bollywood film "Bhoothnath Returns" tax free across the state, an official said Thursday. With the tax free dole, the government said, it hoped that more and more people will be able to view the film, which promotes voting. Notably, Amitabh's wife Jaya Bachchan is a Samajwadi Party MP in Rajya Sabha.
