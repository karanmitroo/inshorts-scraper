As per reports, the Censor Board has demanded the removal of a dialogue referring to Lord Hanuman and references to events from Ramayana in Sarkar 3. "We've asked them to delete the mythological reference as it doesn't go well with the context of the crime in the film," said a Censor Board source. Sarkar 3 will release on May 12.
