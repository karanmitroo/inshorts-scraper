The promotional video for Oscars 2018 has been released. The video references the Best Picture announcement goof-up from Oscars 2017, wherein presenter Warren Beatty mistakenly named 'La La Land' instead of 'Moonlight' as the Best Picture. Oscars 2018, which will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will be held on March 4 next year.
