Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, while talking about the need for more realistic Indian films, said, "How long will we keep making films where hero-heroine is dancing around trees?" He added, "We have to make such realistic films or world cinema won't take us seriously. Internationally, our films are known for dance, drama, music and that, they (global audiences) take lightly."
