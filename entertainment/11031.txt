Actress Alia Bhatt said that wearing revealing outfits does not necessarily make a person look sexy. "Bikini can be sexy because you are showing skin but I don't think that is necessarily sexy. Saree, I haven't explored much," she said when asked to choose between the two. Alia added that she would choose pyjamas because they are "effortless".
