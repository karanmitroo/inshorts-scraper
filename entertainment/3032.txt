Saif Ali Khan starrer 'Chef', which released on Friday, is "a bland dish," wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV wrote the film "is emotionally fulfilling... and laced with genteel humour," while The Indian Express wrote, "There're some interesting flavours here, but 'Chef' feels derivative...And that's...to do with the uneven, stodgy writing." It was rated 1.5/5 (HT), 3.5/5 (NDTV) and 2/5 (Indian Express).
