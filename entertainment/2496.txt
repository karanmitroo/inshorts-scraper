Sidharth Malhotra, who will play Captain Vikram Batra in an upcoming biopic on the Kargil martyr, said, "It's a very heroic and touching story." Sidharth added, "Hearing what he did at the age of 24 for the country we want to do full justice to his story." Sidharth will reportedly also portray Vikram's identical twin brother Vishal in the film.
