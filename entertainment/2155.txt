Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said that the boy from Delhi's Defence Colony is still alive in him. "The struggling Delhi boy in me is still not out, so I still have the hunger and anxiety to keep challenging (myself) and try new things," added Sidharth. He further said he hopes that ten years from now, he has a legacy.
