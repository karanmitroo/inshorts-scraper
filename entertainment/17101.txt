Deepika Padukone, in a recent interview, claimed that she was a mix of Naina Talwar from “Yeh Jawani…” and Piku, “a contemporary girl rooted in Indian values”. She added that she agreed to do "Piku" right after the first scene was narrated to her as she could instantly connect with the character, who represents today’s youth.
