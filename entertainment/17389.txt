The best thing about Paresh Rawal-starrer 'Dharam Sankat Mein', a Fuwad Khan directorial, is the story, writes mid-day. Based upon British film 'The Infidel', the comedy genre film is a mirror to our own well-hidden judgments, however, secular we claim to be, it added. The film has been given 2.5/5 (TOI), 1.5/5 (Indian Express, NDTV) and 3/5 (Zee News, mid-day).
