Filmmaker Anurag Basu, while talking about the biopic he plans to make on late singer-actor Kishore Kumar, said, "So far, only Ranbir (Kapoor) and I are confirmed." Basu added if Ranbir says he's available to do the film in 2019 but the singer's family wants him to make the film at once, things will have to be worked out accordingly.
