Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence, while speaking about the hacking of her nude pictures in 2014, said she still fears being 'blindsided' by another such hack. "It's scary when you feel the whole world judges you," she added. Jennifer further said, "When my publicist calls me, I'm like, 'Oh, my God, what is it?' Even when it's nothing."
