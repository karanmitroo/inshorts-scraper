Shah Rukh Khan's wax statue at the Madame Tussauds museum in London will be re-dressed as Gaurav, the character he plays in his upcoming film 'Fan'.  The move was initiated by the makers of the film as a promotional strategy. The statue will also be taken out to the London Eye for the public to see.
