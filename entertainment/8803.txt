Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that she feels she won't be as good as actresses Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone in Hollywood. "They are doing well, very well and I just hope I can do a fraction of what they are doing," added Sonam. She further said that in whichever industry she gets the best work, she'll work there.
