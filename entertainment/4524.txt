Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin performed a cover of Linkin Park's song 'Crawling' as a tribute to the rock band's lead singer Chester Bennington, who committed suicide recently. Performing at a concert in New Jersey, USA, Chris played the song on the piano and in his dedication said the performance was for "anybody who's missing someone".
