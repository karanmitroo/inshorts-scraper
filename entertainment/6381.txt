Hollywood actor Johnny Depp rejected an early version of the script of the upcoming film 'Pirates Of The Carribean: Salazar's Revenge' because it had a female antagonist, revealed the film's screenwriter Terry Rossio. Rossio added Depp felt that a female antagonist would make the film redundant. Notably, the film now stars Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush as antagonists.
