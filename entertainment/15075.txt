Actor Fawad Khan has revealed that he was offered the role of Sarfaraz in the Aamir Khan-starrer film 'PK'. However, he had to turn down the offer due to his commitment to the film 'Kapoor & Sons'. "I completely lost my mind because I got such a good opportunity", Fawad said. The role was eventually played by Sushant Singh Rajput.
