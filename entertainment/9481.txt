The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) reportedly deleted words including a**h**e, son of a b***h, b*lls and even baller (excellent) from the Hollywood film 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage'. A copy of the film's censor certificate has emerged online. The copy shows that 'visuals of girl pouring liquor' and 'visuals of girls lying on the bed' were also removed.
