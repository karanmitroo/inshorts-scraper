Peter Dinklage, who portrays 'Tyrion Lannister' on 'Game of Thrones', has urged fans to stop buying Huskies just because they look like dire wolves. "Not only does this hurt deserving homeless dogs...but shelters are also reporting that many of these Huskies are being abandoned," he added. In the series, the dire wolf is the symbol of the 'Stark' family.
