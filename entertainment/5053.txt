The promotions of Madhur Bhandarkar's upcoming film on 1975 Emergency 'Indu Sarkar' were disrupted by Congress workers in Pune. Bhandarkar shared on Twitter that the promotional activities had to be cancelled due to the disruption. "It's baffling to see self-proclaimed custodians of #freedomOfExpression creating huge ruckus to prevent a legitimate release of #InduSarkar," he further tweeted.
