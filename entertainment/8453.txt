Mumbai Police on Tuesday tweeted, "No mix up in our endeavours. Always striving to paint the #BestPicture of Mumbai across the globe #TheBestCity," alongside a picture of the movie 'La La Land'. The tweet comes after actor Warren Beatty mistakenly announced that 'La La Land' won the Best Picture Award instead of 'Moonlight' at the Oscars.
