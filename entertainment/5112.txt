Filmmaker Kushan Nandy has said that actress Divya Dutta's role in his upcoming film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' is not based on late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. "Our film is fictional. So, the similarities [between Divya's character and Jayalalithaa] begin and end with the fact that she plays a female politician, who is a go-getter," he added.
