'Shunyota', the Bengali film based on demonetisation has been recommended six cuts by the Censor Board's regional office. Most of the cuts include comments on the effect of demonetisation by principal characters in the film. "I have to accept what they (Censor Board) say. I wish my work be finally seen by the general audience," said the film's director.
