Priyanka Chopra revealed she was once asked not to be part of a cast because she was too ethnic. "I didn't realise how hard it was until I came to America...I've had people take away films from me because I might not have agreed with them," she added. Priyanka further said her 'Quantico' role wasn't written for an Indian girl.
