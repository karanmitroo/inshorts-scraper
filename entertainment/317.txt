Meryl Streep has slammed producer Harvey Weinstein for quoting her in his defence against a sexual harassment lawsuit. "Weinstein's attorneys' use of my statement that he wasn't sexually transgressive or physically abusive in our business relationship as evidence that he wasn't abusive with other women is pathetic," said Meryl. Weinstein had also quoted actress Jennifer Lawrence in his defence.
