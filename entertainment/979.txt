BJP MP-actor Shatrughan Sinha questioned as to why Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan are being criticised for not condemning protests against 'Padmaavat' when PM Narendra Modi is quiet. Sinha said, "Why must we in the  entertainment industry be  expected  to take  a stand on  political issues?" He added that PM Modi and I&B Minister Smriti Irani should speak up.
