Singers of the hit song Despacito have slammed Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro after his government used a remixed version of the song to encourage Venezuelans to vote for setting up a body to rewrite the Constitution. The singers said they were neither asked nor did they authorise the use or the change in lyrics of the song for political ambitions.
