Actor Emraan Hashmi, whose film 'Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai' completed seven years on Sunday, said that people had never imagined him in this kind of cinema, considering the serial-kisser tag he had. "The director Milan Luthria and the producers dared to take the risk, and had belief in the potential of the film," Emraan added.
