Singer Ed Sheeran has been honoured the MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) by Prince Charles for his service to music and charity. He was awarded in a ceremony held at the Buckingham Palace. "My grandfather...died on this day four years ago, so it's...a nice full circle, I guess he'd be pretty proud," said Sheeran.
