The first Global Citizen Festival in India, which took place on Saturday, saw British rock band 'Coldplay' as the headlining act. Traffic reportedly came to a standstill at Bandra as additional vehicle movement towards Bandra-Kurla Complex clogged the roads. People could be seen taking selfies while waiting in queues to enter the concert venue.
