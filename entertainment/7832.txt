BJP MP Kirron Kher on Thursday asked Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu not to cite her example to make a case for his appearance on the TV show hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma. "I am not a minister and I didnâ€™t work in any movies for last three years. My attendance in Parliament is more than other parliamentarians," she said.
