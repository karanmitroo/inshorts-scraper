Hollywood actress Meryl Streep, while recalling an incident wherein actor Dustin Hoffman slapped her for a scene in the 1979 film 'Kramer vs Kramer', said it was overstepping. "This is tricky because when you're an actor, you're in a scene, you have to feel free," she added. Meryl further said, "Those things are being corrected...because people won't accept it anymore."
