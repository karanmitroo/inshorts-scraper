After director Jahnu Barua, actor Pallavi Joshi and cinematographer Santosh Sivan resigned from FTII society in July, the Information and Broadcast Ministry on Friday appointed actor Satish Shah, producer BP Singh and film critic Bhawana Somaaya as replacements. FTII Chairman-appointee Gajendra Chauhan reportedly termed the appointments as "good choices" with whom he wishes to work "positively".
