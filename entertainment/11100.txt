Actor Arjun Rampal, while speaking on how demonetisation has affected the collections of his film 'Rock On 2', said that although the film has suffered, sometimes sacrifices are required. "I believe and hope that this decision is beneficial in long run; it's the time when we must stand together and support government's decision," added Rampal.
