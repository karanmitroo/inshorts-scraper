Singer Armaan Malik has said that Bollywood actors shouldn't feature in every non-film song. He added, "The singer who has actually created the entire song gets lost somewhere in the background." Armaan further said that if there's a Bollywood actor in a non-film song, it might not help the musician expand his fan base.
