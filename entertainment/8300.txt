Singer Adele paused her performance at a concert in Brisbane, Australia to fend off mosquitoes that were biting her during the performance. "I'm sorry, I'm not Australian, I don't like bugs!" she screamed before fleeing across the stage. "It was sucking my blood!... They're all trying to kill me! They're here all the time," she further exclaimed.
