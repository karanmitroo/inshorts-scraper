A nine-minute video explores the career of American artist Kanye West, who made his singing debut with the single 'Through the Wire', a few weeks after a car accident caused his jaw to be wired shut. The video further states that West considers human voice to be the greatest instrument ever and doesn't limit it to just singing or rapping.
