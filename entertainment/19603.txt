The 31-year-old-popstar, Britney Spears, was left disappointed after her much-hyped new single"Work Bitch" was leaked online in 'poor quality'. She had been teasing her fans via a countdown clock on her website to mark the release of her track, Contactmusic reported. Spears and her manager, Adam Leber, expressed their discontent through Twitter and decided to release the original track early.
