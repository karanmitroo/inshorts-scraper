Singer Justin Bieber, who didnâ€™t get to go to his own prom in 2012, crashed Chatsworth Charter High School 2015 prom in Chatsworth, California, on Saturday (April 26). He was crushed and mobbed by ecstatic students who were present there. The 21-year-old hit the dance floor and began dancing with them.
