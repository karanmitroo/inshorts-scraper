Only three Indian films have been nominated for Oscars in the 'Best Foreign Language Film' category since the category was introduced in 1957. The selected films from India's official entries include 'Mother India' (1957), 'Salaam Bombay!' (1988) and 'Lagaan' (2001). Before the award category was officially introduced in 1957, an 'Honorary Foreign Language Film Award' was presented.
