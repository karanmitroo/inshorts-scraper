Priyanka Chopra's mother Madhu Chopra said that her daughter is the "best part" of the film 'Baywatch'. She said that the makers did not show much of Priyanka in the trailer as they did not want to give out the best part of the film. "Priyanka is the main antagonist and she has a fabulous role in it," added Madhu.
