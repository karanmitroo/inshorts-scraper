A luxury private jet designed and owned by late singer Elvis Presley is expected to fetch up to $3.5 million (â‚¹22 crore) at an online auction. The 1962 Lockheed JetStarOne, featuring red velvet seats and red carpets, has never been restored and is presently without engines. It has been sitting on the tarmac in New Mexico for over 30 years.
