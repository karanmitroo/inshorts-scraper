Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that many actors who came from "outside the industry" could not become "stars" like Shah Rukh Khan as they lost focus after success and were marred by ego. "When Shah Rukh Khan came from Delhi, from theatre he became a star... Star is a different thing, acting is a different thing," added Kashyap.
