Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has been ordered by a judge in New York to give his testimony in a defamation lawsuit for $15 million against the 2013 film 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. The lawsuit was filed by Andrew Greene, who alleged that his image as projected onscreen, by the film's character 'Nicky “Rugrat” Koskoff', was defamatory.
