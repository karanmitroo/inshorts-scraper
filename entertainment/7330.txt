Sonam Kapoor tweeted a picture of Abhay Deol's cousin Esha Deol in a fairness cream advertisement and asked for Abhay's thoughts on it. This comes after Abhay slammed Bollywood actors, including Sonam, for endorsing fairness creams. Responding to Sonam, Abhay tweeted, "[This] is wrong too". After this, Sonam was trolled on Twitter and deleted all tweets related to this conversation.
