Actor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged over $15 million towards environmental organisations at the awards ceremony of the World Economic Forum in Davos where he was given the Crystal Award. He was felicitated for his "leadership in tackling the climate crisis". "We.. cannot... allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity," DiCaprio said.
