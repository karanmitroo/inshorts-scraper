Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has removed the line from his website which mentioned that he won this year's Nobel prize in literature. The words "winner of the Nobel prize in literature" initially appeared on the page for his book 'The Lyrics: 1961-2012'. The acknowledgement came a week after the award's announcement even as the Nobel prize committee failed to contact Dylan.
