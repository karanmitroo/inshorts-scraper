Rocco, the teenage son of pop queen Madonna, is reportedly embarrassed by his mother's topless photo shoot. The 56-yr-old singer had recently gone topless for a magazine. "Rocco is mortified that his mum is still doing topless photo shoots," a source said. On the contrary, Madonna's eldest daughter thinks that her mother's topless pictures are great.
