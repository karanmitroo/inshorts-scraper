Prernaa Arora, producer of the film 'Jasmine: Story of a Leased Womb', has said Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is their top choice to play the role of a surrogate mother. It has been inspired by the real-life story of a woman in Gujarat, who decided to become a surrogate mother but later gets attached to the child and wants it back.
