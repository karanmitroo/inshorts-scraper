The Sharman Joshi starrer '1920 London', the third installment of the '1920' horror franchise, which released on Friday, does not have "an inkling of innovative thinking", wrote the Times of India. The Indian Express wrote, "Hats off for at least the ambition" while Koimoi called it a "yawn fest." It was rated 1/5 (India Express, TOI) and 1.5/5 (Koimoi).
