Singer John Mayer, while commenting on a photo posted by Canadian musician David Foster with his daughter Erin, tried to ask for a date with Foster's daughter. "Can you put a good word in for me?" commented Mayer on the Instagram post. Neither Erin nor David has responded to John's comment on the photo yet.
