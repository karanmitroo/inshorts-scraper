Film distributors in Rajasthan have said they will not buy the distribution rights for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati' until the controversy on the film has been settled. Various Rajput organisations, including the Karni Sena, have threatened to disrupt the screening of 'Padmavati'. The organisations have accused Bhansali of distorting facts in the epic historical film.
