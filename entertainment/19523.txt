Waar, claimed as the most expensive Pakistani film ever made, has set new records at box-office collection on Eid-occasion, thanks to its aggressive storyline that showcases Pakistan's fight against terrorism and blames India for all terrorist activities on its soil. The film is also rumored to be partly funded by Pakistani military, though the director Bilal Lashari denies the charge.
