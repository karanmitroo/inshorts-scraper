Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya has sparked a controversy for referring to Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali as 'dengue artist from terrorist country'. Abhijeet also tweeted that singers like Ghulam Ali don't come to India on their merit but due to Pakistani dalals (touts). His remarks came after Ali's concert in Maharashtra was cancelled on Shiv Sena's demand.
