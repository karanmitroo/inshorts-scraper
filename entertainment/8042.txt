Singer Anuradha Paudwal, who sang 'Tamma Tamma' originally, has said that people sell trash in the name of trends these days, while speaking about remixing old songs. She added, "I used to get upset with...remixes. Now, I realise this is how the newer generation expresses love." Anuradha further said that songs these days have a vidhwansak (destructive) tone.
