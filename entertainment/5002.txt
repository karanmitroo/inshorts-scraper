Sitaram Panchal, known for films like Jolly LLB 2 and Paan Singh Tomar, has sought financial help on Facebook as he is suffering from cancer. He has been bed-ridden for the past ten months. "Initially, he used to work and we could make ends meet. But now, he does not even have the strength to stand up," said Panchal's wife.
