Pakistani actress Mahira Khan has said it's her right to be in interviews with Shah Rukh Khan to promote their film 'Raees'. She added, "Why is that...asking for too much? This was also my film." Mahira hasn't been a part of 'Raees' promotions, following a call for ban on Pakistani artistes from working in Indian films after the Uri attack.
