Singer Taylor Swift is reportedly responsible for saving three teenagers' lives after they met with an accident on their way home from her concert in LA. The girls' car crashed when one of them fell asleep behind the wheel. The trapped girls were saved when a woman spotted their concert wristbands, that were programmed to light-up in-sync with Swiftâ€™s music.
