JK Rowling has criticised Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump by posting on Twitter, "When a man this ignorant & easy to manipulate gets within sniffing distance of the nuclear codes, it's everyone's business." Her tweet came in response to being asked to mind her own business by a Twitter user after she criticised Trump for his obscene comments about women.
