Actor Govinda has launched a restaurant named after his 1997 film 'Hero No. 1' in Delhi's Rajouri Garden area. "My friends always suggested... that Delhi needs a place that is No 1 and blends right music, right food and right ambience. So, Hero No.1 had to be here," said Govinda. He added that he likes Delhi's people and culture.
