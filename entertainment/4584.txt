Actor TJ Miller, who played the superhero's best friend in 'Deadpool', has said that more 'Deadpool' and R-rated superhero genre films will be made, depending on the success of 'Deadpool 2'. Miller added, "He (Deadpool) is almost the antidote to the poison that is those very milk-toast superhero genre films...(Deadpool's) present every couple of years to cleanse the palate."
