Dominican newspaper El Nacional on Friday mistakenly published a photo of Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin impersonating US President Donald Trump instead of Trump himself. Baldwin's photo appeared next to that of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the headline, "Trump says settlements in Israel don't favour peace." El Nacional later apologised to "anyone who felt affected" by the photo.
