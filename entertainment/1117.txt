Five women have accused actor James Franco of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behaviour. The women, four of whom were his acting class students, claimed Franco would make everybody think they could get roles if they were to perform sexual acts. Denying the allegations, Franco said, "Things that I heard...aren't accurate. But I completely support people...being able to have a voice."
