Union Minister Smriti Irani, who was once a popular TV actor, said she quit acting to focus on her responsibilities as an MP. "If you want to be taken seriously for your political contributions, then you need to give it that much time," Irani said. The 38-year-old will soon be seen in Abhishek Bachchan-starrer "All is well".
