Actor Sidharth Malhotra, while tweeting about Haryana where section 144 has been imposed, promoted his film 'A Gentleman', which released on Friday. Many users called his tweet "insensitive". However, the actor clarified that his earlier tweet was misconstrued as it was posted before the CBI court's verdict, where Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted of rape charges.
