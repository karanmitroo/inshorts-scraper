Oscars producer Michael De Luca said that Warren Beatty, who was given the wrong envelope resulting in La La Land's announcement as Best Picture at Oscars, was the night's unsung hero. He added, "He was showing co-presenter Faye Dunaway the card, like, 'I think a mistake's been made here.'" They're heroes and completely in the clear for me, he added.
