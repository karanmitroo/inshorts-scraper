Late Bollywood actor Rajesh Khanna's Carter Road (Mumbai) bungalow, popularly known as 'Aashirwad', is reportedly being sold to Shashi Kiran Shetty - executive chairman of Allcargo Logistics - for around Rs 90 crore. The sole beneficiaries are his two daughters, Twinkle and Rinke. The actor had bought the bungalow from another actor Rajendra Kumar, sometime in the late 1960s.
