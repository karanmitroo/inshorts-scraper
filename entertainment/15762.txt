Rock band Guns N' Roses will reunite this April at California's Coachella Music Festival for the first time since the founding members disbanded in the mid-1990s. This comes after the 20-year feud between the band's singer Axl Rose and guitarist Slash ended in 2014. The band's founders Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan have confirmed participation in the reunion.
