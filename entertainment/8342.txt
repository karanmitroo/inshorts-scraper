As per reports, accountants Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz from PricewaterhouseCoopers, who were responsible for the wrong announcement of 'La La Land' as Best Picture at Oscars 2017, wanted to appear onstage during the ceremony. Reportedly, they wanted to interact with host Jimmy Kimmel but the idea was "shot down". Meanwhile, both accountants have been banned from future Oscar events.
