Actors Sidharth Malhotra and Katrina Kaif will wear prosthetics make-up in Farhan Akhtar’s next home production, debutante director Nitya Mehra’s untitled love story. The two will play a couple ageing from 30 to 60 years of age. “There are different age groups that we have to play in the film... I am excited to try [the] prosthetics look,” said Sidharth.
