Kangana Ranaut has featured in comedy group AIB's video titled 'The Bollywood Diva Song' in which they recreated the song 'Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan' taking a dig at Bollywood. In a veiled reference to old actors romancing young actresses in Bollywood, it features lyrics like "Ho mai toh hun kitni young young...Iss buddhe ke sang sang...Buzurg hai mera piya... It's almost paedophilia."
