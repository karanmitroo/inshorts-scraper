Japan's public broadcaster NHK has apologised over a cartoon with Adolf Hitler's face that was printed on a T-shirt worn by a talk show guest. The black T-shirt, worn by entrepreneur Takafumi Horie also carried a "No war" message on one side and a peace symbol. Responding to a tweet, Horie said it was meant to be an anti-war message.
