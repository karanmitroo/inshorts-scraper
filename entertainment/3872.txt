Actor-singer Jared Leto paid tribute to rock band Linkin Park's lead singer Chester Bennington, who committed suicide earlier this year, at MTV Video Music Awards. Leto said, "I remember his voice, at once both ferocious and delicate. That voice will live forever." Leto's band Thirty Seconds to Mars and Linkin Park toured together in 2014.
