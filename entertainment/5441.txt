Chandan Prabhakar joked about Kapil Sharma's brawl with Sunil Grover on a flight, while returning from Australia, on Kapil's show. In the episode promo, Chandan tells Kapil that he was in Australia, to which Kapil replies, "We all went to Australia." In response, Chandan says, "However, not everyone has returned."
