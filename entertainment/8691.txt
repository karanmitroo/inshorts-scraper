Filmmaker Anurag Basu has tweeted that the team of 'Jagga Jasoos' is considering to delay the release of the film as the current release date of April 7 is likely to coincide with school exams. "Jagga Jasoos is a Family Holiday film," tweeted Basu while adding that the date would be shifted only if they get a better release date.
