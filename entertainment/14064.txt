Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow in 'Game of Thrones', recently said that men too face sexism in the film industry. "I like to think of myself as more than a head of hair or a set of looks. It is demeaning", he said. "It's not just men that can be inappropriate sexually; women can be as well", he added.
