Bollywood superstar Salman Khan Friday moved an application in a Mumbai sessions court to ban the media during the recording of his statement in a 2002 hit-and-run case. His plea was rejected by the Judge, DW Deshpande. Deshpande, however, directed the media to report only after the recording of Salman's entire statement is completed.
