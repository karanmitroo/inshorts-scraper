Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Gujarat unit of Shiv Sena have sought a ban on Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Raees', claiming the film "glorifies" a real-life criminal. VHP leader Ranchhod Bharwad said the titular character of 'Raees' is based on the life of Abdul Latif, a bootlegger-turned-politician. He also slammed SRK for casting Pakistani actress Mahira Khan in the film.
