Socialite Paris Hilton has been trolled on social media for her tweet in which she claimed that she co-invented the selfie with singer Britney Spears 11 years ago. A user tweeted, "In 2004 you also invented the sex tape." Another user pointed out that the first ever selfie in history was taken by Robert Cornelius in 1839.
