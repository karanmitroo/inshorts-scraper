Neha Dhupia jokingly said she'll send a press release the day she starts dating someone. "I'm in a state of mourning, that's how single I am," she further joked. Neha added, "I only work. If you send me a work related message at 4 am, I'll do it. But if someone asks me out, I'll say, 'I have no time'."
