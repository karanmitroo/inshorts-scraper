Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali has said that the vandalism on the sets of his film 'Padmavati' was unjustified and unacceptable. He added, "It was merely based on hearsay, allegations and accusations...not on facts. We do not intend to hurt the sentiments of any community." Recently, the film's sets were vandalised and set on fire in Kolhapur.
