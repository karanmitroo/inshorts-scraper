Chetan Bhagat has pledged to fast for wife Anusha on Karwachauth and also nominated Ronnie Screwvala and singer Mohit Chauhan to do the same. The idea of #FastForHer went viral when Anupam Mittal, the founder and CEO of People Group which owns Shaadi.com, took the pledge on Twitter and nominated author Chetan Bhagat and others to follow suit.
