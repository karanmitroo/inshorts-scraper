Arjun Kapoor has said that he recently took a social media detox and didn't check his phone for 48 hours. "I realised that I can survive without checking (the phone)...life is still good without constantly checking updates on social media," added Arjun. He further said that the bane of social media is that we have become too dependent on phones.
