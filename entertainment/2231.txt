Actor Aditya Pancholi, while speaking about allegations made by actress Kangana Ranaut against him, said that she is a nobody and is just an okay actor. He added, "Just to promote 'Simran', she targeted everyone- me, Hrithik Roshan, award ceremonies and the women's commission." Aditya had earlier filed a defamation case against Kangana and her sister Rangoli.
