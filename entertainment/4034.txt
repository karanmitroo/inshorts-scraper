Arjun Kapoor has said that his reason for refusing a two-hero film will never be just insecurity of the other hero. "It has to stem more from, if my role is not exciting me... then obviously it becomes difficult for me to say yes to it," added Arjun. Notably, Arjun featured in a two-hero film with Ranveer Singh in 'Gunday'.
