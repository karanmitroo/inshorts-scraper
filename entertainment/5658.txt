Singer Miley Cyrus, while sharing a picture of her brother Braison Cyrus walking for Dolce & Gabbana, wrote, "I strongly disagree with your politics...but I do support your company's effort to celebrate young artists." Reacting to this, the D&G duo responded that they don't care about American politics. Miley could have been hinting at D&G's decision to dress Melania Trump.
