The release of Mahira Khan starrer 'Verna' has been cancelled reportedly over its subject of rape. The Sindh Board of Film Censors hasn't cleared the film yet and it's waiting for the decision of Pakistan's Censor Board. "The film is yet to be viewed by the board and see if there're any objections," said the Censor Board chief Mobashir Hassan.
