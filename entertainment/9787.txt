Defending the game of Jallikattu, currently banned in Tamil Nadu, actor Kamal Haasan on Monday said, "If you want a ban on Jallikattu, let's also ban biryani." Earlier, Haasan had said that Jallikattu mustn't be confused with bull-fighting in Spain as in Spain, people hurt the bull and it would die but in Tamil Nadu bulls are treated like God.
