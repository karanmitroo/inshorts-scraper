Comedian Sunil Grover has said that there is no need for a mediator to resolve the feud between him and Kapil Sharma. "I know [Kapil] very well. Why do I need someone else to sort things between us?" he added. Sunil further said, "Anyway, the best part is that the comedy didn't stop and it's continuing from both ends."
