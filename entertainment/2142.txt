The Supreme Court has rejected a lawyer's plea seeking to delete "objectionable scenes" in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati' while stating that they can't interfere with the Censor Board's work. The SC added, "Our interference in this writ petition will tantamount to pre-judging, which we're not inclined to do." The court earlier dismissed a plea seeking a stay on Padmavati's release.
