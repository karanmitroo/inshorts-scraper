National award-winning filmmaker Ashim Ahluwalia, who directed Arjun Rampal starrer 'Daddy', said 95% actors in Bollywood can't act. "For the role of Asha Gawli...I didn't want any random model to portray the role, because nobody in Bollywood fit the bill," he added. Ashim further said "The sole thing which made 'Daddy' a bonafide Bollywood film was that it starred Arjun."
