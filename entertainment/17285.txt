Bollywood actress Radhika Apte's nude pictures, which are taken from a video shot for an international short film, were leaked on WhatApp on Monday, infuriating the video's director Anurag Kashyap. Kashyap said that the video is a part of a "powerful" story, which is thrown out of context and made fun of. A police investigation in the matter is afoot.
