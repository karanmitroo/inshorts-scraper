After tasting defeat in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha polls, Rakhi Sawant has resigned from the Rashtriya Aam Party she had founded. “I even went to the slums to campaign, but people didn't take me seriously and I got only 1,995 votes from Mumbai's North-West constituency,” she said. Now, I am planning to join the BJP but won't contest again.
