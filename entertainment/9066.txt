Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who will feature alongside Tiger Shroff in the upcoming film 'Munna Michael', jokingly said that he got a fever watching him dance as he's so good with his craft. "He's like magic. It was intimidating dancing with him. He's pure madness...," he added. 'Munna Michael' is a dance drama which is scheduled to release on July 7.
