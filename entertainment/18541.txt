The Expendables 3 may have some big names like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarznegger, Mel Gibson, Harisson Ford, Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas, but the movie has a videogame-like quality to the relentless action in it and is noisy and unending, according to IBNLive. The film has been rated 2 (IBNLive), 1 (Indian Express), 1.5 (NDTV) and 1.5 (Hindustan Times).
