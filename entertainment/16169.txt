Superstar Salman Khan's lawyer on Friday said in the Bombay HC that the victim in 2002 hit-and-run case did not necessarily die in the road accident. He added that the victim might have died when his car crashed down on him while it was being lifted by the crane. Notably, Salman has been convicted under culpable homicide in the case.
