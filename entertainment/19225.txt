Explaining his take on the contemporary films, newly appointed Censor Board CEO Rakesh Kumar said - "I seriously don't think Ranbir Kapoor should have shown his middle finger and bared his butt in 'Besharam'." He further said Aamir Khan shouldn't have produced a cussloaded film like 'Delhi Belly', adding that filmmakers are pushing the envelope a bit too far.
