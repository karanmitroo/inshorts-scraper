Actor Anupam Kher has said that the rules of the Censor Board need to be revisited since they were written in 1952. He added, "The present government had appointed a committee headed by filmmaker Shyam Benegal. I don't know what happened to the recommendations." Anupam further said that even though new rules are made, they are not implemented.
