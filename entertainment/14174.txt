A day after playback singer Arijit Singh claimed in a Facebook post that Salman Khan removed his song from his upcoming film 'Sultan', Khan's close friend Nikhil Dwivedi on Thursday denied the singer's allegations. "I'm privy & Salman not once interfered in the choice or asked to remove any singer. He only refused to meet Arijit. His wish!," Dwivedi tweeted.
