Salman Khan's Da-Bangg Tour in Nepal, which was scheduled to take place on March 10, has been cancelled over threats from the CPN-Maoist led by Netra Bikram Chand 'Biplav'. The group said the show amounts to "expansion of cultural intervention on Nepali soil". "In a way, the programme is also promoting liquor which isn't acceptable to us," the group added.
