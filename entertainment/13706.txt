Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that actor Salman Khan must "say sorry" for his recent comments where he compared himself to a "raped woman" after the tiring training sessions for his film 'Sultan'. "It was poor choice of words... What he says is unfortunate and he also realises it," added Kashyap. Notably, Salman is yet to clarify on the issue.
