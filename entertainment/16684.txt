The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to actor Akshay Kumar and his mother-in-law Dimple Kapadia over a petition filed by Anita Advani. The petition sought restoration of her complaint of being subjected to domestic violence after the death of actor Rajesh Khanna. Anitaâ€™s petition challenges the order of the Bombay HC quashing Anita's complaint of domestic violence.
