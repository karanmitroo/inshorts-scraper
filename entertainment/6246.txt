Actor Oscar Isaac has revealed that late actress Carrie Fisher had to slap him 27 times while filming a scene for the film 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. He added, "And every time she'd hit like a different spot on my face." Fisher, who died after suffering a heart attack in 2016, played Princess Leia in the 'Star Wars' franchise.
