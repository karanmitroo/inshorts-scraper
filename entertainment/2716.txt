Actor Richa Chadha has said that sexual assault and gender violence are the rites of passage for the average Indian girl. In a blogpost supporting the #MeToo campaign, she added, "As children, we learn the 'good and bad touch' with first-hand experience unfortunately and not...sex-education". She further said the society should shame culprits of sexual harassment and not the victims.
