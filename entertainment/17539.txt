Stephanie Green, a Maroon 5 fan, was Monday hit on the head by a microphone thrown by  lead singer Adam Levine during a concert in Toronto. Frustrated by broken PA system, Levine hurled his mic into the audience, accidentally hitting Green. He, however, immediately apologised to her, brought her on stage and hugged her. Green was bruised but unharmed.
