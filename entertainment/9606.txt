Shah Rukh Khan, while reacting to actress Meryl Streep's recent speech, said that he is an actor and not a vocal leader. "She found a platform and... people who appreciated what she said. In India, everybody has so many opinions that they want to pick on something others say," said SRK. He added he doesn't want to comment on issues.
