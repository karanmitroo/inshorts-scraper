American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, who was declared the Nobel Prize winner in Literature this year, has handed over a speech, which will be read at the Nobel banquet in Stockholm on December 10. Dylan, while citing "other commitments", said he would be unable to attend the award ceremony, where singer-songwriter Patti Smith will perform Dylan’s 'A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall'.
