Priyanka Chopra's debut Hollywood film Baywatch, which is set to release in India on June 2, currently has a 15% rating on American review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. With 46 reviews, the critic consensus states, "Baywatch takes its source material's jiggle factor to R-rated levels, but lacks the original's campy charm and leaves its charming stars flailing in the shallows."
