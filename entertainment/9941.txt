Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that although it is nice to receive awards, they do not define a person's stardom. "My foray into Bollywood had...to do with telling amazing stories. I just happened to become an actor by chance," she added. Sonam was recently awarded the Stardust Best Actress Award (Editor's Choice) for the film 'Neerja'.
