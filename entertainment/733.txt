Shahid Kapoor has said that he finds Swara Bhasker's open letter on 'Padmaavat' "a bit odd". "I would say this is not the time for all these... We had a tough time in making this film reach the audience," he added. However, Shahid further said, "But everybody has the right to put forward his or her views."
