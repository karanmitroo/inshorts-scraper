Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has thanked the people of Yakutia, Russia, on social media for giving him a customised version of the Oscar. The statue holds a goblet symbolising peace called 'choron', instead of a sword, like in the original Oscar statue. DiCaprio also highlighted climate issues of Yakutia, the coldest inhabited place, whose people gathered materials for the statue.
