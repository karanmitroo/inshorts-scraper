In response to Uday Chopra’s recent tweets about his love for her, actress Nargis Fakhri said “Uday's only teasing. I have known him, but I am most definitely not in love with him. I don't think I'd jeopardise my career by getting into a relationship at this stage. Moreover, I don't find the need.... Boyfriends are troublesome and unnecessary”.
