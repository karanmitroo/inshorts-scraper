Actor Salman Khan has revealed that he slept in cars at times when there were no vanity vans at shooting locations. "I have been working 24 hours since the age of 15...and only worked all my life," he added. Salman further said, "I live in a one-room apartment. It's a nice, hard-working man's life that I have led."
