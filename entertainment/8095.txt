An anonymous user in a Reddit post accused AIB's Rohan Joshi of molesting her by forcefully kissing 'her', then verbally abusing and groping 'her breast'. However, the user in another post claimed that Rohan was a great guy and the earlier post was only to show that the anonymous woman, who alleged TVF CEO Arunabh Kumar of molestation, is fake.
