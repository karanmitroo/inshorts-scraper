Actor Salman Khan, who will be seen in ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ next, has said that he is open to the idea of arranged marriage. “Sometimes, love marriages don’t work and arranged marriages do. And sometimes, it’s the other way around”, he said. Further, Khan said he hadn’t received any proposals as yet, but if he does, he will take it seriously.
