A video released by makers of 'The Ghazi Attack' shows the film's cast discussing their experiences of working with late actor Om Puri. "In those small scenes, he gives a dignity and authority to the character," actor Atul Kulkarni is seen saying in the behind-the-scene video. Puri passed away at the age of 66 in January, following a heart attack.
