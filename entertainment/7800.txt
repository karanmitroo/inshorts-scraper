Hollywood actress Emma Thompson revealed that US President Donald Trump asked her out on a date once, but she turned him down. Trump had offered Emma accommodation in one of his Trump Towers in 1998 while she was shooting for a film. He had told Emma, "I think we would get on very well. Maybe we could have dinner sometime."
