Filmmaker Kabir Khan has said that he doesn't think actors Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan look at the box office numbers of each other's films. He added, "I think it's the race created by media, it's fun to read. I don't think it exists in reality." Kabir further said that both actors are superstars in their own space.
