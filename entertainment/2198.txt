Mahira Khan starrer 'Verna', which deals with the subject of rape, has been cleared by Pakistan's Appellate Tribunal without any cuts. Earlier, the release of the film was cancelled abruptly. 'Verna' was reviewed by the Tribunal after an appeal by director Shoaib Mansoor, who was reportedly asked to make certain changes in the film but had refused to do so.
