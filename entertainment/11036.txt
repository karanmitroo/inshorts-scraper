Actress Sharmila Tagore said that she would want Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt to portray her late husband Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and herself respectively, if a biopic on Pataudi is made. "I think his life has got a lot of things, about the accident, about losing his father and playing cricket with such a handicap," added Sharmila.
