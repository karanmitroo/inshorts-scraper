'Happy' by Pharrell Williams, the 'world's first 24-hour music video', is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the longest music video. The 2013 video features people miming and dancing to the track, which is played on a loop 360 times. The previous record was held by Michael Jackson's 'Ghosts' from 1997, which was 39-minute 32-seconds long.
