Kareena Kapoor's first baby Taimur, born on Tuesday, was delivered by the same doctor Rustom P Soonawala, who delivered Kareena when she was born to Babita and Randhir Kapoor in 1980. Interestingly, the doctor has also delivered Ranbir Kapoor and Karisma Kapoor. Soonawala is said to be the doctor of choice for many Bollywood families.
