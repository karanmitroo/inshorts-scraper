On-demand streaming service Netflix will reportedly stream a special version of the movie 'Gangs of Wasseypur' across the world as an eight-part series starting December. "We do not need to deal with obnoxious censorship and we have creative freedom," the film's director Anurag Kashyap said about digital distribution. The movie is about warring families of the coal mafia in Jharkhand.
