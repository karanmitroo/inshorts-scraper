Akshay Kumar has said that he always wanted to work in and make socially relevant films, while adding, "I didn't have enough money, but now I can." He added, "Even Hollywood does not have a single film on sanitary pads or menstrual hygiene. People...don't want to make commercial films because they want to shy away from the issue."
