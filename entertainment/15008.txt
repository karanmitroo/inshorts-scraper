A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court on Friday seeking a stay on the release of the film 'Santa Banta Pvt Ltd' on April 22. The plea by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee alleged that the film “misrepresented” the Sikh community in a defamatory manner and would affect the reputation of the community world over.
