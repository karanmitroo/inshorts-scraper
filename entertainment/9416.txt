Hrithik Roshan, speaking on his film 'Kaabil' and Shah Rukh Khan's 'Raees' releasing on the same day, said there cannot be any bad blood between him and Shah Rukh. "If there's understanding between friends, you can still compete and come out with an even better relationship," he added. However, the clash will be commercially detrimental to both films, Hrithik added.
