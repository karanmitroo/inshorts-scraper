Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has called reports of him denying being part of the film 'God, Sex, and Truth' false. "For all those false news circulating that I have denied making #GodSexTruth, it's only a production and technical process that I was detailing," tweeted RGV. He added, "How can I deny (it) when I am credited in the film?"
