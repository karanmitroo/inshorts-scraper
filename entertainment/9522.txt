Actor Shah Rukh Khan, while speaking on his 2016 film 'Fan', said that he can afford to fail. "[For] someone who is not in my position failing can be career-ending, but not for me... [T]here were loads of people associated with the film, who had their hopes on me. To let them all down, it feels terrible," he added.
