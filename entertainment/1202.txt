Angelina Jolie attended this year's Golden Globe Awards with her adopted son 14-year-old son Pax. While Angelina wore a black dress, her teen son was seen in a black tuxedo on which he sported a lapel pin from the campaign Time's Up. The campaign is a movement against sexual harassment founded after the row involving top Hollywood filmmakers and actors.
