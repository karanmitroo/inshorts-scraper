Actor Rajkummar Rao, while talking about sexual harassment, said, "There's no point in staying silent." He added, "It's very important (for women) to just put (their experience) out there for the world to take notice." Rajkummar further said this is the only way that people like Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of sexual harassment, would get scared.
