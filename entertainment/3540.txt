Erotic thriller 'Julie 2', which is being presented and distributed by ousted Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, has been cleared by Prasoon Joshi-led Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with an A certificate and no cuts. "This is just what I had hoped for. Though it's a film on an adult subject, (it) has no nudity...no double-meaning dialogues," said Pahlaj.
