'Kedarnath', the debut film of Saif Ali Khan's daughter Sara Ali Khan, has not been shelved, according to the production house KriArj Entertainment. "Sara's career is important for KriArj. Not only hers, but everyone involved in the film," said KriArj Entertainment's Arjun N Kapoor. The company has approached Bombay High Court over issues with Kedarnath's director and co-producer Abhishek Kapoor.
