Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, who will star in 'Kapoor & Sons' next, said on Thursday he has never faced any issues while working in India. "The groups that work against Pakistan should be ignored because there are similar groups present in Pakistan too," he added. Notably, Shiv Sena had recently objected to the presence of Pakistani actors in Bollywood films.
