Sidharth Malhotra has said that there is authenticity in awards, citing the Filmfare Awards as an example. "Aamir Khan got (Filmfare award) for Dangal and the fact that he never attends any award but he was awarded... speaks about the authenticity of the award," said Sidharth. He added that Alia Bhatt and Sonam Kapoor's Filmfare wins were also well deserved.
