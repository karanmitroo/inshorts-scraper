Jason Momoa, who portrayed Khal Drogo in 'Game of Thrones, has said he was eight when he saw his future wife actress Lisa Bonet, who was a teen then, on television and said, 'Mommy, I want that one'. He added, "I didn't tell her (Lisa) that until we had two babies otherwise it would have been creepy and weird."
