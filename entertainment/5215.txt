Kajol has said that acting in a language one doesn't understand is difficult and revealed how she considered quitting the Tamil film VIP 2. She added, "I saw my scene paper, and I was like, 'Okay. You could take somebody else for the film now'. But Soundarya and Dhanush were very...kind and decided to work on me a little more."
