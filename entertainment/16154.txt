Actor Kamal Haasan has backed the now banned bull-taming sport 'Jallikattu' which was played in Tamil Nadu during Pongal festival. Requesting to lift the ban, Haasan said, "It's about taming the bull and not creating physical harm by breaking its horns or other parts". Notably, Jallikattu was banned by the Supreme Court last year on grounds of 'cruelty to bulls'.
