Actress Katrina Kaif has said that doing a 10-minute tayyari (preparation) for a picture is a bit obnoxious. She added, "It is the way people behave before clicking a picture. I am very happy to take pictures. But maybe, just figure the arrangement of your hair in advance or just get ready and come."
