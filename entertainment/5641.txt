Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that he would leave a film, which has a budget of ₹50 crore or ₹70 crore, and do a ₹50 lakh film instead as satisfaction is very important to him. "Maybe the ₹50 crore film doesn't allow me to tap a new side of my potential that a smaller budget film lets me discover," added Nawazuddin.
