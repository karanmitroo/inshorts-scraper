Rishi Kapoor has said if a biopic is made on father late Raj Kapoor, the family would ensure the story isn't sensationalised as they don't want to hurt anybody's emotions. He further said the offer for biopic has been on for the last 50 years, while adding, "But we, as a family, have an objection till our mother is living".
