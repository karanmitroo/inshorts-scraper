According to reports, Prabhas starrer 'Saaho' was initially offered to Alia Bhatt. However, Alia rejected it as the heroine has barely any scenes in the film in comparison to Prabhas. "Alia is...setting a league of her own by taking up some really good performance-oriented roles," said a source. Notably, Shraddha Kapoor has been signed for the role in the film.
