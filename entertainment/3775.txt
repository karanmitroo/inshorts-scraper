According to reports, Arjun Kapoor has recommended his cousin Harshvardhan Kapoor for Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK's film 'Farzi', after he walked out of the project. As per a source, Arjun's decision was based on the poor box-office performance of the director duo's last film 'A Gentleman'. Talking about casting Harsh, Nidimoru said, "It's too early to talk about it."
