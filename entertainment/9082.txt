Tapes of original live recordings of Bob Marley's concerts between 1974 and 1978, which were discovered in a London hotel basement, have been restored. The over 40-year-old tapes were initially thought to be damaged beyond repair. The recordings feature Marley's well-known tracks including 'No Woman No Cry', 'Jammin' and 'Exodus'. Notably, Marley's 72nd birth anniversary was observed on Monday.
