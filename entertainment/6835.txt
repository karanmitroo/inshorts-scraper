Harry Potter author JK Rowling took to Twitter on Tuesday to apologise for killing Professor Snape in her book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Rowling made the apology on the anniversary of the 'Battle of Hogwarts', which was a conflict that ended the Second Wizarding War in the Hogwarts School. In 2016, she apologised for death of werewolf Lupin.
