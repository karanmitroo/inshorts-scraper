The release of 'Junooniyat', starring Pulkit Samrat and Yami Gautam, has been preponed by a week to June 17. Junooniyat's director Vivek Agnihotri attributed the decision to the growing curiosity about the film. He added, "We got a ‘U’ certificate without a single cut with the censor board telling us 'We wish more filmmakers would make such beautiful films'."
