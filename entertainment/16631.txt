Jennifer Aniston, who got married to her long-time boyfriend Justin Theroux last week, did not invite her 'Friends' co-stars Mathew Perry and Matt LeBlanc to the wedding. However, Courtney Cox, who played Monica Gellar in 'Friends', was the maid of honour at the wedding. "I was surprised. I didnâ€™t know about it," Perry said, talking about Aniston's wedding.
