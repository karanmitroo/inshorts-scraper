Sunny and Bobby Deol, the half-brothers of Ahana Deol (Dharmendra and Hema Malini's daughter), were reportedly missing from her wedding on Feb-2. Earlier also, both of them had skipped the wedding of Esha (elder sister of Ahana) in 2012. Dharmendra, who converted to Islam to marry Hema, never divorced his first wife and has maintained two separate families ever since.
