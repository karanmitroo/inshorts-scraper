Actor Rishi Kapoor has revealed in his autobiography 'Khullam Khulla' that he once wore a pair of women's trousers for the song 'O Hansini' from the 1974 film 'Zehreela Insaan'. He bought the trousers, which were tight-fitting with flares and had a zip to the side, from Beirut, Lebanon. Further, Rishi also wore his own jerseys during film shoots.
