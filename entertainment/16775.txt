‘The Scream,’ a classic painting created by Edvard Munch in 1893, has been made into a three-minute animation by Sebastian Cosor. It is set to a Pink Floyd song and reflects Munch's memory of the original painting. He had recalled walking on a bridge with two friends when suddenly overwhelmed by anxiety, he sensed “an infinite scream passing through nature.”
