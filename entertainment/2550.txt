The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking a delay in the release of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's epic historical film 'Padmavati' to alleviate tensions ahead of the Gujarat elections. BJP state vice-president IK Jadeja said that the party wrote to the Election Commission, the Central Board of Film Certification and the Centre, seeking to stop the film's release temporarily.
