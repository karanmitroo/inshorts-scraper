Rajput organisation Karni Sena's president Mahipal Makrana has issued a veiled threat to actress Deepika Padukone over the row on 'Padmavati'. "Rajputs do not raise hand on women, but even Lakshman had cut off Surpanakha's nose," he said. Mahipal added he can't assure that there would be no further violence over the film's release.
