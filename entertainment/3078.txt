Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt took to Twitter to share an old picture of his daughter Pooja Bhatt from an advertisement campaign. "How can I ever forget this image. Pooja earned her 1st pay [cheque] when she was just 3 years old. Her 1200 bucks kept our kitchen fires burning," tweeted Mahesh. Pooja made her Bollywood debut with the 1989 film 'Daddy'.
