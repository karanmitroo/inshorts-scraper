Responding to Hrithik's lawyer's statement that a complaint was filed against Kangana this year for stalking Hrithik, Kangana's sister Rangoli tweeted, "Young, beautiful, talented, rich girl like Kangana doesn't need to stalk an uncle like you." "Kangana was in school when your first film came," added Rangoli. She further wrote, "Stalker uncle please focus on your children and wife."
