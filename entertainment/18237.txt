Salman Khan pulled ex-girlfriend Katrina Kaif's leg by calling her 'Katrina Kapoor' at his sister Arpita Khan's wedding. Reportedly, when the song 'Chikni Chameli' played, Salman took to the mike & announced "Katrina Kaif your song is playing. Please come on stage." When Katrina refused to budge, Salman said, "Okay fine, not Katrina Kaif. Katrina Kapoor, please come on stage."
