In an apparent move to raise voice against animal cruelty, south Indian actress Tanisha Singh was recently seen wearing a dress made out of real goat meat for a photo-shoot. "People kill animals for pleasure. I want to raise voice against this cruel practice," said Tanisha. Earlier in 2010, pop singer Lady Gaga had worn a similar meat dress.
