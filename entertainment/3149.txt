American singer Marilyn Manson got injured onstage during a concert in New York when stage props which were shaped like two giant guns tumbled over him. Manson's representative said that he was taken to a hospital. Certain eyewitnesses claim he was performing a song when he tried climbing onto the guns and fell backward and the props fell upon him.
