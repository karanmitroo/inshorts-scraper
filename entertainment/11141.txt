American series The Simpsons had 'predicted' that Donald Trump would be elected US President 16 years ago. In an episode released in 2000, Lisa said to her advisors in the Oval Office, "We've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump." The Simpsons also mocked Trump in a 2015 episode after he announced he was running for president.
