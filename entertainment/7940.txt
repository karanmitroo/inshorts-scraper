Hollywood actor Rupert Grint, known for his portrayal of the character Ron Weasley in the 'Harry Potter' film franchise, has said that he finds it difficult to separate where he, as an individual, ends and the character Ron begins. He added, "I had a weird relationship with that character because after that we kind of merged into the same person."
