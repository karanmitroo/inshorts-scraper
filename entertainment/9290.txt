Pakistani actress Mahira Khan has said she feels her success and fame have come under the evil eye, as her Bollywood debut film 'Raees' has not been able to release in Pakistan. "I am the first Pakistani actress who [worked] with SRK as the main lead," she added. Earlier, reports said Pakistani cinemas have lifted the ban on Bollywood films.
