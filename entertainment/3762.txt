Photo-sharing app Instagram on Thursday announced that a bug allowed hackers to access contact phone numbers and email addresses of high-profile users. The company said, "No account passwords were exposed. We fixed the bug swiftly and are running a thorough investigation." Earlier this week, Selena Gomez's Instagram account was hacked posting nude pictures of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber.
