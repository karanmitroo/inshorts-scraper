At a Jammu event on Saturday, actor Anupam Kher said that the Kashmir issue will be resolved only after Article 370 of the constitution is removed. â€œThe day a Bengali, a Gujarati, a Marathi, a Keralite or a Punjabi is able to purchase land and start his own venture there, I feel the Kashmir problem will get solved, Kher added.
