Kristen Stewart has become the first US actress to win a Cesar award- the French equivalent of the Oscars. Stewart won the best supporting actress award for her role in the film 'Clouds of Sils Maria', which is competing for best foreign film at Oscars. "I love you Juliette", Stewart shouted to her co-star Juliette Binoche, while accepting the award.
