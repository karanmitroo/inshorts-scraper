Actor Eddie Redmayne has said it's "really not a problem" for him to take public transport. "How else do you get around London? The traffic is so awful," Redmayne added. Explaining his reaction when someone takes his photograph on public transport, he said, "You just have this really awkward 37 seconds before you run off the train in embarrassment."
