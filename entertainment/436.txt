Rishi Kapoor has revealed that his late father Raj Kapoor had to mortgage his studio and assets to release the film 'Mera Naam Joker', but it failed to perform well at the box-office. "We were in severe problems. Then he made a film called Bobby with a new boy and a new girl, which was a huge risk," Rishi added.
