PETA has called singer Justin Bieber a "self-absorbed" and "childish showoff," after he admitted to wearing a real fur coat. PETA said, "He seems incapable of seeing how his buying habits cause needless suffering to animals, such as baby tigers, baby monkeys, and wild coyotes. Animal groups are tired of having to clean up after him".
