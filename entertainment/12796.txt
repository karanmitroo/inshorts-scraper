Actress Radhika Apte's nude scenes from the film 'Parched' have reportedly been leaked online. "I don't think the leak happened in India," said the film's producer Aseem Bajaj. He added, "The scenes are not sensational... But in our country, while rape videos are available freely, sex is still considered taboo so we had planned to blur out the breasts."
