Actor Naseeruddin Shah recently claimed that he was targeted for being a Muslim. In an interview to a news channel, Shah said, "I was quite astounded that everything I stated was interpreted as anti-Indian and there was nothing of the sort". He added, "I'm proud to be an Indian and will not allow anybody to question my patriotism."
