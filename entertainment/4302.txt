Punjabi singer Gurdas Maan has said that secularism doesn't exist in this world anymore. "People have become more hateful towards each other. They're constantly creating barriers on the basis of religion and gender," he added. The singer further said people should realise everyone is free to practise whatever religion they want and should treat fellow humans with love and respect.
