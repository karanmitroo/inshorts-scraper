Comedian Kapil Sharma has said he's planning a radical change in his talk show 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. "It'll be boring for me and the audience if I don't," added Kapil. He further said that the audience is open to all kinds of experiences now. The show had gone on a 'short break' in September owing to Kapil's ill health.
