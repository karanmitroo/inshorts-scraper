According to reports, Sanjay Dutt has quit upcoming film 'Total Dhamaal' as it's an adult comedy. Sources suggest Dutt doesn't want his children to see him in a film with crass humour. He also pulled out of the film as the dates for shooting coincided with other projects. Dutt starred in the franchise's first two films- 'Dhamaal' and 'Double Dhamaal'.
