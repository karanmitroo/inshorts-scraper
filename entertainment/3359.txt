Following the arrest of Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar on extortion charges, Thane police is now probing if any money from Dawood's underworld franchise D-Company had been used to fund the Shraddha Kapoor-starrer 'Haseena Parkar'. "The gang earlier used to finance movies with the money they got through extortion," said an official. 'Haseena Parkar' is a biopic on Dawood's sister.
