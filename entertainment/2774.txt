Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said he is happy that Aamir Khan played a quirky character in the film 'Secret Superstar'. "I think actors shouldn't have any image. He should be able to play any character. Earlier, actors were image conscious," added Nawazuddin. He further said that it's a good thing that actors are trying to experiment with their character choices.
