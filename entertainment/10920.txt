Actress Isla Fisher has revealed that no one noticed when she once replaced her face with Amy Adams, with whom she is frequently mistaken. She put Amy's picture on her Christmas card to trick friends and relatives. "Everyone was like, 'Oh, your card was so cute.' I was like, 'It was a joke, it's not me, it's Amy!'" added Isla.
