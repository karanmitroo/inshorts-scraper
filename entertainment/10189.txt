A roadside vendor selling actress-turned-author Twinkle Khanna's books 'Mrs Funnybones' and 'The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad' bumped into her while she was in her car on Wednesday. She took a photo of him and posted it on Instagram. "The silver lining to this inky cloud-pirated or otherwise, clearly I am still not past my sell-by date," she captioned the photo.
