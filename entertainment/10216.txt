Saif Ali Khan has said that he doesn't feel that having a kid is an additional responsibility, despite being 46. However, he acknowledged that there'll be a difference in terms of age. "Sara is so much closer to my age, while Ibrahim is a young teenager. So, now, 14 years later, it feels nice [to have a kid]," added Saif.
