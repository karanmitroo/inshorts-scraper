Rishi Kapoor, while speaking on nepotism, questioned if Ranbir Kapoor is only getting work because he is Rishi's son. "Ranbir has been working in this industry for the last ten years... We all have merit!" he added. Rishi further said, "[Actors] are chosen by the common man! Just as politicians are chosen, we are chosen too."
