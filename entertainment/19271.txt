No drugs or alcohol were found in the bodies of "Fast & Furious" actor Paul Walker (40) and his friend Roger Rodas (38) after the fiery car crash that killed them in November, a coroner's report released on Friday said. Walker died from "combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries," and Rodas from "multiple traumatic injuries," the report said.
