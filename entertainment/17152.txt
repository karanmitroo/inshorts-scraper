A new commercial of Rupa Frontline innerwear, featuring actor Ranveer Singh thrashing a shark, has brought criticism from the animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). While the company on Wednesday clarified that the shark shown in the advertisement is a rubber toy, PETA has demanded to add a disclaimer to the commercial.
