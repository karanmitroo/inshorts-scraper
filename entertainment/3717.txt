Shraddha Kapoor, while talking about Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra starring in 'Aashiqui 3', said, "I think it's great...it'll be fabulous (to see them)." While discussing why she didn't star in the film, Shraddha added the story of Aditya Roy Kapur and her characters ended perfectly in 'Aashiqui 2' and it didn't make sense for them to be cast again.
