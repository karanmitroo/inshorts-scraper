Late singer Chris Cornell's 12-year-old daughter Toni paid a tribute to her father and Linkin Park's frontman Chester Bennington on the TV show 'Good Morning America'. She, along with the band OneRepublic, sang the song 'Hallelujah' by Leonard Cohen as a tribute to the late singers. Both Chris and Chester committed suicide this year.
