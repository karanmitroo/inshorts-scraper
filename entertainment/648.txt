Shahid Kapoor said he always had to work much harder to get good opportunities, while adding, "Had to wait longer...to get a milestone in my (acting) career." He added, "But I view it like this...God has given me the opportunity to learn." Shahid said he took a risk working in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmaavat' despite it being a 'tricky opportunity'.
