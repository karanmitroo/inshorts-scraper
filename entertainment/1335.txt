Denmark's ruling Liberal Party is planning a national streaming service 'Danflix' along the lines of on-demand video streaming service Netflix, party officials said. The service would provide Danish-produced content through an app and 24-hour television channel, officials added. The proposal comes as part of negotiations for a new media deal set to take effect in 2019.
