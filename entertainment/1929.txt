New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern has sent British singer Ed Sheeran an informal citizenship test via a 35-second video of her own after Sheeran requested to be granted New Zealand's citizenship. Ardern asked Sheeran if he likes pineapple lumps, a type of chocolate, or if he's willing to wear jandals which are a type of sandals worn by New Zealanders.
