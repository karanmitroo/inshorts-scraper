According to Robert O'Neill, former US Navy SEAL who claims he killed Osama Bin Laden, Osama "died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure". Furthermore, he said,"The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am 'The Shooter.' The team got him."
