Twitter has suspended singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya's new account which he opened after his verified account was suspended last week. Abhijeet, who opened the new account on Monday, had posted a video captioned, "#VandeMatram I'm back. #Antinationals can't stop my voice". His original account was suspended over "inappropriate" and "insulting" language in "offensive" tweets directed at female users.
