Actor Ben Hawkey, known for playing Hot Pie in 'Game of Thrones' (GoT), has opened a GoT-themed bakery in London called 'You Know Nothing John Dough'. Hawkey said, "Hot Pie's Direwolf loaves are a favourite for 'Game of Thrones' fans, and people are always asking me for the secret of my recipe." Each Direwolf-shaped loaf costs £1 (₹84).
