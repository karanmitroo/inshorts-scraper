'Masaan' director Neeraj Ghaywan has slammed filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri for an alleged casteist tweet in which he narrated an experience wherein a Dalit leader's grandson was travelling in the business class of a flight. Responding to this, Neeraj wrote, "I am a Dalit... I won the National award and the Filmfare award. All without using my Dalit identity."
