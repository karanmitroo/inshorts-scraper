The first use of 'red carpet' is traced back to the play 'Agamemnon' by Greek playwright Aeschylus. In the play, King Agamemnon is welcomed by his wife to walk a "crimson path" after a war. Later, in the 1800s the red carpet was established as a part of "high-profile events", with it being used in Hollywood events in the 1920s.
