Tiger Shroff made his debut appearance at this year's Cannes Film Festival. It was for the unveiling of the first look poster of his upcoming film Rambo, which is a Hindi-language remake of the Hollywood film by the same name. "Being a martial artist and a huge action movie buff since childhood... I'm very grateful for this opportunity," said Tiger.
