A non-bailable arrest warrant has been issued against actor Sanjay Dutt over alleged threats to producer Shakil Noorani. He had alleged that the actor had failed to complete a film in 2002 despite taking the signing amount of ₹50 lakh. Dutt was then asked to pay ₹2 crore for losses incurred, following which Noorani claimed he started receiving threat calls.
