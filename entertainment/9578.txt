A cartoon of a girl who resembles Queen Elsa from Disney movie 'Frozen' has been used on a US billboard aimed at raising awareness about meth addiction. The billboard, which says "Meth: Just Let It Go," has been designed by a teenager from Montana. Interestingly, Elsa sings the song 'Let It Go' in the movie 'Frozen'.
