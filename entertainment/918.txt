Several protestors allegedly belonging to Rajput organisation Karni Sena vandalised the Delhi Noida Direct (DND) flyway toll plaza on Sunday. Demanding a ban on the movie 'Padmaavat', the armed protestors also set a barrier ablaze before 15 of them were arrested. Some protestors uploaded a video of the incident online, threatening to cause more disorder if the movie was released.
