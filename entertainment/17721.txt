The Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials began demolishing the ramp outside Shah Rukh Khan's residence Mannat on early Saturday morning. The wide ramp was not only causing trouble to the locals by making use of the road difficult, it was also illegal. MP Poonam Mahajan had also written a complaint letter to the BMC about it.
