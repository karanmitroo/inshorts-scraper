Director of 'Gulabi Gang' Nishtha Jain has accused former professor of Film and Television Institute of India, Arghya Basu, of sexually harassing her. "Do you remember how I pushed you off... you still wouldn't take off your hands from my breasts?" she wrote on Facebook. Basu is just another man whose brain is on his penis, Jain said.
