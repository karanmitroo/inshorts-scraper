Marathi film producer Atul Tapkir on Sunday allegedly committed suicide at a Pune hotel by consuming poison, as per preliminary investigation. He had earlier written a Facebook post in Marathi, citing financial loss in filmmaking and family disputes as the reasons for suicide. Tapkir's 2015 film Dhol Taashe, though appreciated for its political plot, hadn't performed well at the box-office.
