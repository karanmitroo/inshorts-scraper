Action film ‘Fast and Furious 7′ has resumed shooting after its production had to be halted last year following the death of actor Paul Walker (40), who played the character of Brian O’Conner in the franchise. Screenwriter Chris Morgan had to drastically alter the script in order to determine whether Walker’s character will be retired or killed in the film.
