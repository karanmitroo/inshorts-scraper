Salman Khan has said that his films are critic-proof while adding, "I am telling them (critics) now: go give my film minus 100 stars, why just zero." The 51-year-old actor added his fans will anyway watch his film despite the reviews and that is his reward. He further said critics have no right to take anybody's hard work down.
