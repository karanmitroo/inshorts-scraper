The Allahabad High Court has dismissed the PIL filed against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'RamLeela', seeking a direction for cancelling the public exhibition certificate of the film granted by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The petition was filed on the ground that the Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh starrer hurt religious sentiments.
