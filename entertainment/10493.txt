Actor Rajinikanth has requested his fans not to celebrate his birthday on December 12, when the actor will turn 66. The actor's decision is reportedly as a mark of respect to former Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, who passed away on December 5. Rajinikanth had visited the Rajaji Hall in Chennai to pay his last respects to the late CM.
