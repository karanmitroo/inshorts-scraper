Actor Kamaal R Khan (KRK) on Sunday criticised Imtiaz Ali and Farah Khan, saying they are not capable of making 'hit' films even in their dreams. "SRK became superstar with new director's films... but now he believes in established flop directors like Imtiaz Ali," tweeted Kamaal. He added that he suggested Shah Rukh Khan to do a Mohit Suri film.
