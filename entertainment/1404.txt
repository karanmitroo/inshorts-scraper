While talking about being compared to Deepika Padukone, actress Jacqueline Fernandez said that she doesn't take such comparisons too seriously. Jacqueline, who will be seen opposite Salman Khan in 'Race 3', had starred with Deepika in 'Race 2'. "You are on your own and each one brings her/his individuality when it comes to play a certain character," added Jacqueline.
