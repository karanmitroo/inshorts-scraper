The Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments have moved the Supreme Court seeking modification of its order lifting the ban on the film 'Padmaavat' in four states. The court will hear the plea on Tuesday, ahead of the film's release on Thursday. Meanwhile, violent protests erupted over the film's screening in Gujarat, which was one state that had banned the film.
