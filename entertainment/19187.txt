Salman Khan starrer 'Jai Ho' collected only Rs 60.7 crore in the first three days, even though the movie had an extensive release across the globe (5000+ screens). The movie was expected to do well as it is a Salman release after more than a year, and that too on a Republic Day weekend; but failed to impress the audience.
