Actress Deepika Padukone says the payment disparity between male and female Bollywood stars is a matter of concern but it is not a war.  The actresses are trying hard to change the irregularities in pay scale, she said. "..we should not get into the space of negativity where we are discussing who is getting what amount of money", she added.
