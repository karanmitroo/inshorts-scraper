A number of 'floating' Christopher Walken heads modelled on the actor have come up at the Socrates Sculpture Park in New York, as part of an art installation. 'Monument to Walken' by artist Bryan Zanisnik is situated in the Astoria neighborhood where Walken was born. The Academy Award-winning actor has appeared in more than 100 films and television series.
