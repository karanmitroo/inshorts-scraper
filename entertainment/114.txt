Karan Johar, who had planned to make the film 'Shiddat' with late actress Sridevi, has reportedly decided to shelve the project. As per reports, 'Shiddat' was to star Sridevi, Sanjay Dutt, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt in the lead roles. This would have been Sridevi's first film with Dharma Productions since the 1993 film 'Gumrah'.
