After a gap of six years, Bollywood actors Arshad Warsi and Irrfan Khan are teaming up again on-screen, for their upcoming movie 'Welcome To Karachi'. The film, directed by Ashish R Mohan (of 'Khiladi 786' fame), is about two Indians and some people from Pakistan and America. It is still unclear who will play the female lead in the movie.
