American singer Katy Perry compared her old black hair colour to former US President Barack Obama during an Instagram live session. When a fan mentioned missing Perry's black hair, she said, "Oh, really? Do you miss Barack Obama as well? Okay, times change." After this, Perry was slammed by various social media users for being racially insensitive.
