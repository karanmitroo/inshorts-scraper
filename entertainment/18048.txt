Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West reportedly bought her daughter, North West, a dollhouse worth 35,000 pounds (over $54,000) for Christmas. The dollhouse has a marble bathroom with NW encrusted in gold on the bathtub. "She's also splashed out on a Dolce & Gabbana leather jacket with 'North' etched in Swarovski crystals," a source said.
