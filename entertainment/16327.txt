As per reports, the government is planning to ban the airing of condom advertisements on national television between 5 am to 11 pm. The proposal reportedly came after the Information and Broadcast Ministry received complaints against such ads claiming that they were "spoiling children". The issue is pending to be discussed by an inter-ministerial committee before a decision is reached.
