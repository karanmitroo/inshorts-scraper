Actor Tiger Shroff has said that he never called his heroines 'padding'. This comes after Tiger said in a recent interview that he doesn't care about the 'padding' around him in a film. "The reporter misinterpreted me completely in the process. She asked me if I was okay being cast opposite newcomers and I said it didnâ€™t matter," added Tiger.
