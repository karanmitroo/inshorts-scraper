Kamal Haasan has said he and late actress Sridevi had a bond like that of a brother and a sister. Haasan added he was asked by people in the film industry not to speak about their bond as both of them were "celebrated as a couple". Sridevi and Haasan worked together in several films, including the 1983 Hindi movie 'Sadma'.
