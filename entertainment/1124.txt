Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati' has been officially renamed as 'Padmaavat', as confirmed by the film's Twitter handle. This comes after the Censor Board suggested the makers to change the film's title, along with some other modifications. Bhansali had earlier said that the film is based on the poem 'Padmavat' written in 1540 by Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi.
