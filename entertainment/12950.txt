Filmmaker Zhang Yimou has defended his decision to cast Matt Damon as the lead role in the film 'The Great Wall' against criticism on social media for casting a "white" actor. "Matt... is not playing a role that was originally conceived for a Chinese actor. The arrival of his character in our story is an important plot point," said Zhang.
