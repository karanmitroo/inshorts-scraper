French astronaut Thomas Pesquet aboard the International Space Station collaborated with French musician Yuksek for a music video depicting his everyday life in space. He is on a six-month mission on the Earth-orbiting spacecraft to perform around 50 scientific experiments for the European Space Agency and France's space agency CNES. ''Music makes the world go round'', tweeted Pesquet.
