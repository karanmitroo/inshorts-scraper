Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar has slammed BJP MLA Panna Lal Shakya for saying that Virat Kohli earned all his money in India and took it abroad by marrying Anushka Sharma in Italy. "Next time Virat hits his unpatriotic 1st sixer out of the park it will be in the name of that patriotic MLA," tweeted Sircar.
