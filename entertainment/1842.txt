Actress Rani Mukerji has said that she loved the film 'Befikre' directed by her husband Aditya Chopra but it was hard for Aditya to see failure. 'Befikre', which starred Ranveer Singh and Vaani Kapoor, marked Aditya's comeback as a director after 8 years. He had earlier directed films like 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and 'Mohabbatein'.
