An English daily called actress Deepika Padukone a 'Bollywood Blunder' based on the outfit she wore for her first international red carpet appearance at the 2016 MTV EMAs. "Indian actress Deepika Padukone may be stunning but her swamp green bralet and skirt combo did nothing for her sensational figure," wrote the daily while featuring her among the â€˜worst dressed' celebrities.
