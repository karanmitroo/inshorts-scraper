Central Board of Film Certification has given a U/A certificate to animated film Hanuman Da Damdaar. According to Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, some dialogues have been removed from the film as the "trendy language" of religious characters may not be acceptable to everyone. "Children can come and watch the film with their parents. Problem kya hai?" added Nihalani.
