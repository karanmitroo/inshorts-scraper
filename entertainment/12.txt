Actress Emma Watson was spotted with a temporary tattoo on her arm that read 'Times Up' instead of 'Time's Up' at the Vanity Fair Oscars party. She had sported the tattoo to support the 'Time's Up' movement, which aims to fight sexual harassment and gender inequality. Emma later jokingly tweeted, "Fake tattoo proofreading position available. Experience with apostrophes a must."
