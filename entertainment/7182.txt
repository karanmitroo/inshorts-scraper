Raveena Tandon, when asked if she would like to be a part of 'Andaz Apna Apna' sequel, jokingly said the film's actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan will instead prefer 21-year-old heroines. "They will be garlanding [photographs of] me and Karisma Kapoor and... then they will be running after 21-year-old heroines... That's how the sequel is gonna start," she added.
