A Maruti Suzuki dealership in Tamil Nadu is offering a custom variant of Swift inspired by actor Rajinikanth's upcoming movie 'Kabali'. The hatchback is wrapped in a sticker set featuring the movie's posters and dialogues. Priced slightly higher than the official ex-showroom tag, the edition is not an official variant but a custom sticker job offered by the dealership.
