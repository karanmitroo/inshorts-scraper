Politician Kapil Sibal, who will debut as a lyricist in Bollywood in the film 'Shorgul', has roped in singer Arijit Singh for lending his voice for the song 'Tere Bina', composed by Niladri Kumar. "The track is more of a social project that persuades the masses to take a stand on humanity," said Sibal, while Arijit called the lyrics emotional.
