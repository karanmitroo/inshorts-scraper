Aamir Khan, supporting his 'Dangal' co-star Zaira Wasim, said she's a role model for him, following her apology on social media for allegedly meeting J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti. "I can understand...what led her to make the statement," he added. Aamir also urged people to leave Zaira alone and respect that she's just a 16-year-old trying to deal with life.
