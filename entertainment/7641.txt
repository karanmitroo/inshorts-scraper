Singer Pawni Pandey has said that though actresses Priyanka Chopra and Parineeti Chopra sing well in recordings, she isn't sure if they can sing well while performing live. Notably, Priyanka made her singing debut in 2012 with the single 'In My City'. Meanwhile, Parineeti made her Bollywood singing debut recently with a song in the upcoming film 'Meri Pyaari Bindu'.
