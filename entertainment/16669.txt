The Isle of Man Constabulary has confirmed the cause of the late “Apprentice” star Stuart Baggs’ death to be asthma, a condition he had been suffering from for many years. Baggs was found unconscious in his bedroom by a friend last week. He was one of the youngest candidates ever to appear on the show at the age of 21.
