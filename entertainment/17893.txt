Singer-actress Jennifer Lopez, who has been divorced 3-times, thinks her breakups are due to the fact that she picked the wrong guys. "I'm a great girlfriend. And wife. Just picked the wrong guys," Lopez said on an episode of 'American Idol' where she is a judge. Lopez also admitted that she has found out how to be happy by herself.
