The Union government on Monday launched 'e-CinePramaan', the Online Film Certification System of the Central Board of Film Certification. This will make the process for films to obtain a certificate fully digital and will include QR Codes to check fraudulent certificates. "A highlight of online film certification is elimination of middlemen and of corruption," said I&B Minister M Venkaiah Naidu.
