Sunny Leone took to Twitter to share a video of fans who had arrived to see her at an event in Kochi. "Was overwhelmed by the love & support. Never will forget God's own Country Kerala!" she wrote in the video's caption. The roads reportedly remained blocked for hours and police had to resort to lathi-charge to control the crowd.
