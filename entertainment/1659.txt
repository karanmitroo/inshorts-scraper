Madhuri Dixit and Renuka Shahane, who worked together in the 1994 film 'Hum Aapke Hai Koun..!', will be working together in a Marathi film after 23 years. The yet-to-be-titled film will be directed by Tejas Vijay Deoskar. "It's a slice-of-life story with a dash of humour that a lot of people will be able to identify with," said Tejas.
