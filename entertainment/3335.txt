Hema Malini has said she wishes she were an actress at this time as the payments today are huge. "I was getting peanuts (in comparison). But whatever I did 20-30 years back is paying me back now," she added. Speaking about actors from this generation, Hema further said, "They're young and like to enjoy themselves... I myself was like that."
