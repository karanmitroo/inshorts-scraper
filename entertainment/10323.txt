Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said producer Karan Johar can come "ekdum befikre" to the Board for certification of his upcoming film on live-in relationships 'OK Jaanu'. "We won't certify it keeping 'Befikre'...as yardstick. Nothing like, 'Uske paas 20 kisses hain toh mere paas 10'," he added. He further said that every film will be certified on individual merit.
