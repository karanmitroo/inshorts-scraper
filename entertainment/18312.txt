The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its order on the Rajasthan govt's appeal challenging a state HC order staying the conviction of actor Salman Khan. The apex court said, Salman's conviction could not be stayed merely because it comes in the way of his getting a British visa. The high court had stayed Salman's conviction in 2013.
