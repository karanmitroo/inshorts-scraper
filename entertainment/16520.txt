Taradar Sauce, better known as 'Grumpy cat', will soon get a wax statue at the Madame Tussauds museum, San Francisco, becoming the first feline in the world to achieve this feat. The statue will be an “animatronic with five different movements”. The statue, which will reportedly purr, close its eyes and fall asleep, will be displayed in five US cities.
