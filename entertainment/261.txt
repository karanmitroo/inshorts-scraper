Shahid Kapoor reportedly turned down an offer from a brand which wanted to cast his one-year-old daughter Misha in an advertisement. Reports said while Shahid's wife Mira Rajput was keen on the offer, Shahid felt introducing Misha to the world of glamour at this age wouldn't be right. Shahid had earlier expressed his displeasure over the media glare on Misha.
