Actress Tippi Hedren has alleged that filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock sexually harassed her while working on the 1960s films 'The Birds' and 'Marnie'. "He suddenly grabbed me and put his hands on me. It was sexual, it was perverse... it was ugly," wrote Hedren in her autobiography 'Tippi: A Memoir'. Hitchcock reportedly did not allow her to work with other directors.
