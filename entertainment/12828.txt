Actress Renuka Shahane has invited anti-AFSAPA activist Irom Sharmila to stay with her at her home in Mumbai. Irom has been refused accommodationâ€‹ in Manipur by her former supporters after she broke her 16-year-long fast. "The image of you being sent back to the hospital bed that was your prison for 16 years just broke my heart," wrote Shahane.
