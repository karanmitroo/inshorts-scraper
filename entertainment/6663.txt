Actress Bipasha Basu and husband Karan Singh Grover left singer Justin Bieber's Mumbai concert on Wednesday within five minutes of arriving as it was too crowded. "We didn't get security with us and it is too crowded so we are leaving," said Bipasha. Meanwhile, celebrities including Alia Bhatt, Sridevi, Arbaaz Khan, Malaika Arora and Kriti Sanon, attended the concert.
