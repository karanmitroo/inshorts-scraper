Actress Kangana Ranaut will be seen playing an 80-year-old woman in her directorial debut film 'Teju'. "It'll...give you a glimpse into my life before Bollywood, into the real Kangana whom few have known in all these years," said Kangana, who's also scripting the film. The film will explore topics related to mortality and life beyond death in a light-hearted manner.
