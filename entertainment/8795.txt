Actress Kangana Ranaut, in a promotional video for 'Koffee with Karan', said that filmmaker Karan Johar will play a snooty Bollywood biggie in her biopic. She added, "You'll be that stereotypical Bollywood biggie...who's completely intolerant to outsiders, flag-bearer of nepotism, the movie mafia." Kangana will feature with actor Saif Ali Khan in the show's upcoming episode.
