Actress Alia Bhatt, who will be seen opposite Randeep Hooda in Imtiaz Ali's forthcoming film 'Highway', has warned her fans against "random" pictures of her, which are doing the rounds on internet. "There's some random image doing around from 'Highway' that isn't authentic at all! That is not me or Randeep in that picture," Alia posted on Twitter.
