American magazine 'Interview' has been slammed for making Kim Kardashian look 'darker' to match her daughter North's skin colour for its photoshoot. "Why did they darken her skin to try and make her look black," commented a user. Several people also slammed the magazine for calling her 'America's First Lady' and equating her to First Lady Jackie Kennedy.
