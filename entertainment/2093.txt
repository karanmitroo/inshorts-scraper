US prosecutors have charged an Iranian national, Behzad Mesri, with hacking into American TV network HBO and stealing its episodes and plot summaries for unaired programs including Game of Thrones. Mesri is alleged to have demanded $6 million for not releasing the data. The cyber-attack surfaced earlier this year as HBO was running a new season of Game of Thrones.
