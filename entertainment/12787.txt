In 1989, Pepsi cancelled a $5 million ad deal featuring Madonna within 48 hours of the ad's premiere. Religious groups threatened to boycott Pepsi after the commercial, which aired on March 2, 1989, was confused with the 'provocative' music video for the song 'Like a Prayer' which aired on March 3. The American singer turns 58 today.
