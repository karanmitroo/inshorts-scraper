The Panorama jury at International Film Festival of India (IFFI) refused to screen Malayalam film 'S Durga' despite Kerala High Court's order asking IFFI to screen it. In a letter to the film's director, the festival's director wrote, "Due to issues related to the film's title raised by the CBFC...(it) could not be screened at the event which culminates today."
