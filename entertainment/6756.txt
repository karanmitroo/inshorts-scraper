Actor Manoj Bajpayee has said that if a character really challenges him then he is like a bull. "If an actor doesn't know how to give characterisation, he will never be able to give different kinds of performances," he added. Bajpayee further revealed he was scared when 'Aligarh' was offered to him because of the kind of performance it demanded.
