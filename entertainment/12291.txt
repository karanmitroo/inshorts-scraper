Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that she hates doing love scenes as they are "so awkward". "I don't like my own love scenes... With 500 people watching you and it's just you got to make it look real and intimate," said the 34-year-old actress. She also revealed that watching films including 'Titanic', 'Finding Nemo' and 'Star Wars' made her cry.
