Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he will not work with Pakistani talent owing to India's current relationship with Pakistan. He clarified that when he was shooting his film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' from September to December 2015, the "circumstances were completely different" and his film is being targeted unfairly. Johar added, "For me my country comes first."
