The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court ordered a three-member committee to review the Akshay Kumar-starrer 'Jolly LLB 2' on Wednesday. The court also asked the committee to find out whether the allegations levelled by petitioner Ajaykumar Waghmare are true. Waghmare had stated that the film is an attempt to malign the reputation of the legal profession.
