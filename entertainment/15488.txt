Amid the ongoing reports on Katrina Kaif's break-up with Ranbir Kapoor, the actress on Monday said that it was disheartening to read stories about her personal life. "I am like every woman, when you are working you want to be spoken about your career... your work," she said. "I believe until you are not married you are single," Katrina added.
