Superstar Rajinikanth has said that romancing Sonakshi Sinha in his upcoming film 'Lingaa' was a big challenge. "The worst punishment god can give actors like me who are in their 60s is to sing duets. I found shooting duets with Sonakshi more challenging than doing stunts atop a moving train in the film," said the superstar.
