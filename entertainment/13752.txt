Actor Salman Khan has said that he "used to feel like a raped woman" while shooting the fight sequences for the film 'Sultan'. "[T]here'd be so much of lifting and thrusting on the ground involved. That was tough for me... I couldn't walk straight", he said. "I would eat and then, head right back to training", Salman added.
