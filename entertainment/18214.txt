A scholar from Bihar, Dr Birbal Jha, has accused author Chetan Bhagat for picking up the plot of his play 'Englishia Boli' and writing the novel 'Half Girlfriend' around it. Jha claims that Bhagat watched a performance of the play and was also given a copy of the same by Jha himself. Bhagat has refuted the claims through twitter.
