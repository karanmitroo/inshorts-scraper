Pictures of Ranbir Kapoor from the shoot at Mumbai's Pali Hill for the upcoming biopic on Sanjay Dutt have emerged online. The pictures show Ranbir with receding hairline, a moustache and a red tilak on his forehead. The film's shoot was stalled for a while when the Pali Hill Residents Association complained for not taking prior permission from the association.
