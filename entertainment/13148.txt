The Censor Board has refused to clear 'Power of Patidaar', a Gujarati film based on quota leader Hardik Patel and the agitation he led for the Patidar community's reservation. The Board reportedly denied clearance for using the real name of Hardik Patel and the word 'Patidaar' in the title. The mention of PM Narendra Modi's name was also found objectionable.
