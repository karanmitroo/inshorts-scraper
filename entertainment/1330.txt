Speaking on a television chat show, actor Zac Efron recalled an incident where he almost died during a cycling trip in London with actor Hugh Jackman. Zac said, "I followed Hugh around a few cars and suddenly there was a double decker bus right in front of me. I slammed on the brakes, went under the front tire...narrowly missed death."
