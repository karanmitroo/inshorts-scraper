Veteran actor Dilip Kumar has been discharged from Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai today. Earlier today, his wife Saira Banu had said, "Dilip ji is totally fine and I am waiting to take him home." The 94-year-old actor was admitted to hospital last week after he suffered dehydration and urinary tract infection.
