Hollywood actor George Clooney has said he will sue French entertainment magazine Voici for publishing images of his twins without his permission. "[P]hotographers from Voici magazine scaled our fence, climbed our tree and illegally took pictures of our infants inside our home," Clooney said in a statement. The twins, Ella and Alexander, were born in June this year.
