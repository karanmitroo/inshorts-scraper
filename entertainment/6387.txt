Former American baseball player and singer Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Alex Rodriguez was pictured making notes on birth control while making his commentary debut in a Major League Baseball game. Rodriguez had written "Child: birth control, baby, pull out stuff," on his notepad. Above the pointers was the statement, "We should be talking about why we haven't spoken about it?"
