Taylor Swift’s '1989' has become the fastest-selling album in more than a decade, by crossing the five million mark in the US sales in its 36th week (ending July 5) of release, according to Nielsen Music. The previous album to reach the milestone that quickly was Usher’s 'Confessions', which took 19 weeks to hit five million sales in 2004.
