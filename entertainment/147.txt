Jackie Shroff, during his appearance on the show 'BFFs with Vogue', revealed that he slapped Anil Kapoor seventeen times for a scene in the 1989 film 'Parinda'. "I gave him 17 slaps but didn't give it so hard that he would fall," he added. Interestingly, it was the first take that made it to the final edit of the film.
