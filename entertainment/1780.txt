Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that India has more sports films than medals. He added, "In population, we are second after China, but in the medal tally, we always lag behind. Why is it happening, why can't we produce sportsmen? Anurag further said his upcoming film 'Mukkabaaz' comes out of that "sad situation".
