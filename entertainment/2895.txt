Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap's sports drama 'Mukkabaaz' was the opening film at the 19th MAMI Mumbai Film Festival on Thursday. "I'm dying to see how everybody reacts to it...we've tried to make the film under the radar," said Kashyap before the film's screening. Kunal Kapoor and Aditi Rao Hydari hosted the opening ceremony of the fest, which ends on October 18.
