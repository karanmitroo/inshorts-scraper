Sanjay Dutt has said he has missed watching his kids grow up owing to his prison term. He is the father to twins Iqra and Shahraan. "Now all three of us don't seem to get enough of each other. I forget the world when I am with them. I want to involve myself more in their day-to-day lives," added Sanjay.
