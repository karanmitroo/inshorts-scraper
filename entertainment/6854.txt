Social media users have pointed out the similarity between the circular logo of taxi-hailing startup Uber and the one in Tom Hanks' new movie 'The Circle'. However, the film's director James Ponsoldt said that 'The Circle' logo was designed before Uber unveiled its new logo in 2016 and that the team noticed the similarity "with a bit of creeped-out amusement."
