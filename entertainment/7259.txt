Actor Rajinikanth has said that filmmaker Bharathiraja never accepted him as a good actor. He added, "He likes me, but in his old interviews, when journalist asked him his opinion on me as an actor, he would say, He is a good human being." Notably, Rajinikanth starred in Bharathiraja's directorial debut film '16 Vayathinile'.
