The Chitrapat Karmachari Sena, an MNS-affiliated organisation, on Monday asked the people to boycott Shah Rukh Khan's upcoming film 'Dilwale' claiming that the actor did not help the drought-hit Maharashtra farmers, even as he donated â‚¹1 crore to flood-hit Chennai. MNS Chief Raj Thackeray also advocated the appeal. However, he added that it was not the party's official stand.
