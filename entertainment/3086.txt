Actor Raza Murad took to social media to share his look from the upcoming film 'Padmavati' but later deleted it. Murad's post read, "I am playing Jalaluddin Khilji who...was killed by his paternal nephew and son in law, Alauddin Khilji (played by Ranveer Singh)." Previously, Ranveer was forced to share his look earlier than planned as it had leaked online.
