Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said a role is a role while adding, "It doesn't matter if it's big or small, as long as it is good." Talking about the concept of 'good looking hero', he called 'good-looking' a subjective term. Nawazuddin added, "God has made everyone different yet equal, so who are we to differentiate and call someone conventional or unconventional?"
