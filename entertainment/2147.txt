The National Commission for Women (NCW) has said that it would summon Congress leader Shashi Tharoor for his "derogatory" tweet on Miss World 2017 Manushi Chhillar. Tharoor used Chhillar's name as a pun in a tweet against demonisation. NCW tweeted, "He degraded the achievement of daughter of Haryana...who got glory to the country. Will he call his own daughter chillar?"
