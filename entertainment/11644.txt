Supporting the release of 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ which is facing trouble for featuring a Pakistani artiste, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap questioned PM Modi as to why he hasn't yet said sorry for his trip to Pakistan. "You actually diverted your trip on our tax money...why is it that we have to face it while you can be silent?” he tweeted.
