Actress Vidya Balan slammed a man for allegedly misbehaving with her at the Kolkata airport. The man, who had asked her for a selfie, reportedly put his arm around her despite her objection. "When a stranger puts an arm around you, be it a man or a woman, you get uncomfortable... We are public figures, not public property," said Vidya.
