Actor-comedian Chris Rock, in his opening monologue for the Oscars, termed Hollywood as racist. He started by saying, "Welcome to the Academy Awards, otherwise known as the white people's choice awards! You know, if they nominated presenters, I wouldn't get this job!" Earlier, the Academy Awards were labelled 'Oscars So White' as no black artistes were nominated this year.
