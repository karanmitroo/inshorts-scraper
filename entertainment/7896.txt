Filmmaker Shirish Kunder has slammed Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh by comparing it to how Dawood Ibrahim can be made CBI Director. Shirish also tweeted, "Hoping a goon will stop rioting once he's allowed to rule is like expecting a rapist to stop raping once he's allowed to rape." However, the tweets have been deleted.
