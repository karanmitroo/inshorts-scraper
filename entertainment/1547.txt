Hollywood actor Will Smith, who is currently in India for the fourth time, has said he thinks he should just move in with Akshay Kumar. "We had...dinner at his place last time I was here, and it was literally the best food I've ever had," added Smith. He further said he has read about 90% of the scripture 'Bhagavad Gita'.
