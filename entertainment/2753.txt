Actress Kate Winslet has revealed that her friend actor Leonardo DiCaprio warned her that she would "probably lose a limb" while filming 'The Mountains Between Us', which was shot in snow-covered terrain. "Leo said to me, 'You are bloody out of your mind to do this. Do you know how hard it's going to be?"' she added.
