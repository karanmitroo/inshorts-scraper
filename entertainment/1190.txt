While slamming Golden Globe Awards for honouring rape-accused 101-year-old actor Kirk Douglas with a video montage, a Twitter user wrote, "They are all wearing black to take a stand against sexual assault but they are honouring Kirk Douglas." A user tweeted, "Um...didn't #KirkDouglas rape Natalie Wood?" Another tweet read, "He doesn't (necessarily) fit this year's theme."
