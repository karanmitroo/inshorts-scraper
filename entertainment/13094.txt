A new version of Nike's 'Da Da Ding' ad by 'Epic Spiritual' features women from rural India. Titled 'Da Da Ding: The Other Women', it places some of the sportswomen in the original ad side by side with rural women working in fields or carrying water over long distances. The video ends with the message 'Been doing it- Barefoot!'.
