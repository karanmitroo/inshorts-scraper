Madame Tussauds museum in New York has opened a 'Ghostbusters' virtual reality exhibit that lets fans become a ghostbuster. The 15-minute experience allows fans to bust ghosts with plastic guns accompanied by real-time interactive effects within a physical set. The players can feel walls, sit on chairs and sense being touched or shot by a ghost.
