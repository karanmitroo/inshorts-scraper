After rapper Snoop Dogg made a music video featuring US President Donald Trump's mock assassination, Trump condemned the rapper by tweeting, "Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!" In the video, Snoop shoots a clown resembling Trump with a toy gun.
