Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she has never shown a wife touching her husband's feet or calling him 'pati parmeshwar' in her serials. "Whenever she has attempted to do that, her husband has stopped her," added Ekta. She further said the character 'Tulsi' from her serial 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' inspired women to participate more in family decisions.
