The Japanese government has teamed up with anime character Sailor Moon to raise awareness about the rise of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), such as Syphilis and HIV, among young women. It has also reworked Sailor Moon's catchphrase, from "In the name of the moon, I will punish you!" to "If you don't get tested, I will punish you!"
