Singer Selena Gomez has become the first person to get 100 million followers on photo-sharing platform Instagram. Her fans used the hashtag '#SelenaBreakTheInternet' to help her reach the milestone even as she takes a break from her music career. Interestingly, her last post on Instagram was over a month ago where she had posted a picture from her 'Revival Tour'.
