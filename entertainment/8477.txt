Actor Warren Beatty, one of the presenters for the Best Picture award, was handed the envelope for Best Actress in a Leading Role. While beginning to read the winner's name, Beatty seemed uncertain and handed the card to Faye Dunaway, his co-presenter. Dunaway then read out the film title written under Emma Stone's name, which was 'La La Land'.
