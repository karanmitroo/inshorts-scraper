Director Peter Jackson has admitted to blacklisting actresses Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino and not casting them in 'Lord of the Rings' under pressure from rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein. "I recall Miramax (Weinstein's production company) telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs," said Peter.
