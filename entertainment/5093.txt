The swords used in American fantasy-drama television series 'Game of Thrones' are made in India by the workers of a Dehradun-based factory named 'Windlass Steelcrafts'. The factory, started in 1943 as a supplier of 'gurkha khukris' to the British armed forces to fight against enemies in World War II, also supplies equipment to the American, British, and Spanish Armies.
