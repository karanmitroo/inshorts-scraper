Researchers have found that Russian government-linked group Turla has been leaving comments on Britney Spears' Instagram account with hidden links to malware servers. The malware, which gathers infected computers' browsing history, is spread through a Firefox extension. Once information is collected, the malware sends it to Turla using hidden links in Instagram comments left by the group members.
