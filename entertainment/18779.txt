For the shooting of Ranbir-Anushka starrer Bombay Velvet in Sri Lanka, film-maker Anurag Kashyap used over 200 vintage cars, to recreate the 60s era - a record in Bollywood as no other film has used these many cars for a shoot. It was easier to source it from Lanka probably as it has a large number of such cars.
