The upcoming biopic 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story'  starring Sushant Singh Rajput, has been boycotted in Pakistan following the ban on Pakistani artistes by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). A petition was also filed at the Lahore High Court on September 23, seeking a ban on Indian films until the Kashmir issue is resolved.
