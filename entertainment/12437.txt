Actor Hrithik Roshan's official Facebook account was hacked by an unidentified person on Monday. The hacker changed the account's display picture and also started live streaming a video where reportedly more than 500 people joined in. The account was recovered later, following which Hrithik wrote on his page that the matter had been "taken care of".
