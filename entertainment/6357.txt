Tom Hanks recently posted a picture of a car with about six parking tickets kept under the windshield wipers on Twitter, alerting New York police of the offender. He shared the picture with caption, "Sir? Move. Your. Car! Hanx". The police replied, "Mr. Hanks, If you like the DC region, APD could always use extra parking enforcement officers. Call us."
