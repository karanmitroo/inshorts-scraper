The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has demanded a ban on SAB TV's comedy show 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah'. The group has alleged that the show hurt the sentiments of Sikh community by depicting a living character of tenth Sikh spiritual leader Guru Gobind Singh, which is "against the Sikh tenets". SGPC chief said, "Such an act is unpardonable."
