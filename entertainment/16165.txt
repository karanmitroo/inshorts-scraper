In wake of eminent directors returning their National Awards, Vidya Balan on Thursday said she will not give her award back. "This honour is by the nation and not the government", she said. Balan had won a National Award for 'The Dirty Picture' in 2012. Ten directors had on Wednesday returned their awards, protesting against growing intolerance in the country.
