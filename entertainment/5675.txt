Actress Sridevi has said that she would be happier if her elder daughter Jhanvi Kapoor gets married rather than act in films. Sridevi added that initially, she wasn't in favour of Jhanvi working in films. "But her happiness matters more, and if she does well as an actress, I will be a proud mother," said Sridevi.
