Singer-composer Vishal Dadlani, while responding to Bigg Boss 11 contestant Akash Dadlani's claim that he is related to Vishal, said he doesn't know him apart from Akash having texted him for work. "He's a relative but at quite a distance...With respect, I won't work with someone just because they happen to have the same surname as I do," added Vishal.
