Singer Adnan Sami has said that a biopic on him, if ever made, would be a typical masala movie. "It already has all the ingredients that you can ever think of...romance, action, suspense, drama, sorrow, sadness... everything to make it work at the box office," added Sami. He further said that his life has been an "incredible roller coaster ride".
