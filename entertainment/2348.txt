Actor Raza Murad has said that BJP leader Subramanian Swamy should prove his allegations that the funding of 'Padmavati' has been done from Dubai. "If he cannot, then he should stop passing these statements," added Murad, who plays the uncle of Ranveer Singh's character Alauddin Khilji. Murad further clarified that Khilji has been shown as a villain in the film.
