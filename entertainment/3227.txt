A trial court in Jodhpur has dismissed the plea against actor Salman Khan by a former forest officer who had accused the actor of misleading the court in the blackbuck poaching case. Earlier in January, the Jodhpur court acquitted Salman in the Arms Act case filed against him in connection with poaching blackbucks and chinkaras in Rajasthan.
