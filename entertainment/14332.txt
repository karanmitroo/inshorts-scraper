American actress Susan Sarandon on Sunday slammed Woody Allen for allegedly sexually assaulting his daughter. Speaking at the 'Women in Motion' talk at the ongoing Cannes Film Festival, Sarandon said, "I think he sexually assaulted a child... I don’t think that’s right". Allen's daughter had earlier claimed that he molested her when she was 7. Allen, however, denied the allegations.
