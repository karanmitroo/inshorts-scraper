Former Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while reacting to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry's restrictions on advertising condoms on television between 6 am and 10 pm, questioned why Akshay Kumar is promoting paan masala. "It's not condoms but paan masala that's killing people," he added. Pahlaj further said, "Ms Smriti Irani needs to focus better on the dos and don'ts."
