Actress Deepika Padukone has revealed that if given a chance, she would've loved to present her 2015 film 'Piku' at Cannes Film Festival. Deepika attended the festival this year, seven years after her first appearance in 2010. Speaking about the perception of Indian cinema abroad, she said, "Largely...it is colour, scale, grandeur, song and dance and a lot of culture."
