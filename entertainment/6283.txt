Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya has called Twitter a platform "for anti-nationals, anti-Indian Army, anti-Modi, anti-Hindu and for terrorist supporters". Calling Twitter users "naxals", he further accused Twitter of being Jihadi. Abhijeet added, "We are not only singers... We are the voice of our nation and come out openly against anti-nationals. So, Twitter is trying to shut our voice."
