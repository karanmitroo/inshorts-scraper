Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's 'Fanney Khan' is set to release on Eid 2018, the same time as Salman Khan's 'Race 3'. "It'll be an exciting clash, since Aishwarya and Salman's relationship continues to hold the audience's attention, even years after [their break-up]," a source said. While 'Race 3' is a multi-starrer, 'Fanney Khan' will also star Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao.
