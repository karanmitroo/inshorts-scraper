Model-actress Pamela Anderson has revealed she was molested by her babysitter for a year when she was aged between four and eight. "But I remember wishing her dead, and she ended up dying the next day at her graduation in a car accident and I thought, 'Okay, now I've killed her, I'm magic'," Pamela added.
