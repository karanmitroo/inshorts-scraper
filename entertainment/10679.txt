Netflix on Wednesday announced that it has now begun offering downloading of select videos on its Android and iOS apps. Once content is available for offline download, users will be able to download and watch it even if the phone or tablet later doesn't have internet connectivity. The feature is limited as it is not supported on web browser platforms.
