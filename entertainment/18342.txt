Actor-director Randhir Kapoor said that he is not in favour of making a remake of his father Raj Kapoor's 'Awara'. "When I took the idea few steps forward, we all got scared. Where will we get another Prithviraj Kapoor and Raj Kapoor? I am not in favour of making remakes," he said. Randhir had last directed 'Henna' in 1991.
