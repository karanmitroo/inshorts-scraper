Actor Brad Pitt has slammed estranged wife Angelina Jolie for violating the privacy of their six children in their ongoing custody case. Pitt claims Jolie "exposed" the children "by making public the names of their therapists". Further accusing Jolie of having "no self-regulating mechanism", Pitt has requested the court to seal details about the kids emerging from the couple's divorce.
