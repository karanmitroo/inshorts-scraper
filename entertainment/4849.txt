Singer Shreya Ghoshal has said that people often underestimate the audience of our country as well as worldwide, by thinking that they don't understand art. "They are the reason art exists," she added. Shreya further said every time she has sung from her heart and not thought about the commercial aspect, it has done really well for her.
