After the cremation of late actress Sridevi on Wednesday, her husband Boney Kapoor released a statement saying, "Rest in peace, my love. Our lives will never be the same again." "To our daughters, she was their everything...She was the axis around which our family ran," the statement read. He also urged people to respect their "need to grieve privately".
