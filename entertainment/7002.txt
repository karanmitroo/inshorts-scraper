CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani said he is unaware of the Film Certificate Appellate Tribunal (FCAT)'s instruction to clear 'Lipstick Under My Burkha'. "I am hearing about the FCAT's verdict through the media. The CBFC has received no such notification," he added. Nihalani further said the makers submitted a different version to the FCAT from the one submitted to the CBFC.
