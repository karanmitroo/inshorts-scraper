Hollywood actress Uma Thurman has said that producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of rape and sexual harassment by several actresses, does not deserve a bullet. Suggesting that Weinstein deserves to suffer rather than a quick death, Uma added, "I'm glad it's going slowly." She used the hashtag '#metoo' in her post indicating that he had sexually harassed her.
