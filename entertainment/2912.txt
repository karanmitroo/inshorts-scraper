The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) suspended producer Harvey Weinstein's membership, effective immediately, over sexual harassment allegations against him. "We hope this sends a message that such behaviour has absolutely no place in our industry," read BAFTA's statement. BAFTA further called Harvey's alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with its values.
