Director Clint Eastwood will reportedly direct and produce pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger's biopic for Warner Bros. The film is yet un-titled and its screenplay will be adapted from Sullenberger’s memoir “Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters”. Sullenberger had safely evacuated 155 passengers of a US Airways flight that had lost power while he was piloting it in 2009.
