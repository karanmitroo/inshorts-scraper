Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol Friday celebrated 1,000 weeks of screening of 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and recalled their memories of the film. "It's been 20 years for this film and I feel honoured that I was part of this film. It's been 100 years of Indian cinema and I would say one-fifth belongs to 'DDLJ'," SRK said.
