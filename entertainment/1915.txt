Veteran actor Dharmendra has said that the film industry these days has become a "sabzi mandi". He added, "The actors today are dancing and singing for money, go anywhere where money is, get involved in oil massages (pun intended). All for money." The 81-year-old actor further said that money was not everything in their time.
