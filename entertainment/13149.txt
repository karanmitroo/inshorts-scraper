Singer Sia has topped the 'Billboard Hot 100' for the first time with her track 'Cheap Thrills', thus replacing Drake's 'One Dance', which took the number one spot on the charts for ten weeks. Sia also became the first 40-year-old female artist in 16 years to top the chart, after Madonna topped the charts when she was 42 in 2000.
