Child sex is being offered for Rs 50 on Goa's beaches, Pramod Salgaocar, producer of film 'Baga Beach', claimed Tuesday. Directed by Laxmikant Shetgaonkar, Baga Beach is a movie based on the ills of Goa's tourism industry. "Every day four children are abused in Goa. These are government statistics," Shetgaonkar said.
