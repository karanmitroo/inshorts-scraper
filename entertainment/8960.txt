Censor Board has refused to clear 'Modi Ka Gaon', a film based on PM Modi's development plans. The board has asked its makers to get a no objection certificate (NOC) from the Election Commission as the "film can be treated as promotional material for political campaigns". NOC from the PM's office also has to be submitted, the Censor Board added.
