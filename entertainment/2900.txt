The Judi Dench and Ali Fazal starrer Hollywood film 'Victoria & Abdul', which released on Friday, is "a shameful attempt to normalise evil," wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV wrote, "The complexities of...colonial oppression are beyond the film," while Firstpost called it "a missed opportunity (rather) than a piece of entertainment." 'Victoria & Abdul' was rated 1.5/5 (HT) and 2/5 (NDTV, Firstpost).
