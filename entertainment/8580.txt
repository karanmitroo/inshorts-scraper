Actress Disha Patani, while responding to a person shaming her for wearing a 'revealing' outfit, has asked people to stop their hypocrisy and open their minds. "It's easier to judge a woman on the basis of how much they cover up their skin, but it's hard to accept your own cheap mentality," she wrote in a message posted on Instagram.
