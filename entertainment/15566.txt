National Award-winning actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui on Friday said that he does not feel affected for not winning “commercial” awards for his critically acclaimed movies. Speaking on his win for 'Manjhi' at the 22nd Lions Gold Awards, he added, "This award (Lions Gold Award) is important for me as they select only those actors whose performances have been really good."
