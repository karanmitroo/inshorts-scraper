'Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', which released on Friday, is a "visually dazzling passion project (that) can't take flight," wrote Hindustan Times. "The audience is left with ocular diabetes and hardly any savoury storytelling," wrote Times Of India, while Koimoi called the film "too predictable". The film has been rated 1/5 (HT), 3.5/5 (TOI) and 1.5/5 (Koimoi).
