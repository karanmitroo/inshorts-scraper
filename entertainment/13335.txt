Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg has said he follows his intuition and it takes "a very quiet, tiny whisper" for him to pursue a film. He adds that it is this whisper which makes him say, "This one is for me. I'm not going to give this away and produce it through my company. I'm taking this for myself".
