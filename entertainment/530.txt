Actress Anushka Shetty, while denying rumours that she is getting married to her 'Baahubali' co-star Prabhas, said, "Please do not expect Baahubali and Devasena-like chemistry in real life." "It is only for the screen," she added. Prabhas and Anushka portrayed the characters 'Baahubali' and 'Devasena' respectively in the 'Baahubali' film franchise.
