Ukraine has banned American actor Steven Seagal for five years, with security services labelling him a threat to national security. The latest of blacklisted cultural figures, he had recently received Russian citizenship. Seagal, whose grandparents emigrated from Russia, had also called Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine "very reasonable" and performed at a pro-Putin biker club concert.
