The Censor Board has passed the film Behen Hogi Teri with no cuts while reportedly retaining the scene where actor Rajkummar Rao dressed as Lord Shiva, which people earlier protested against. "Before people come out with 'dharnas' and 'morchas', I wish they respect what the censor board, a government-appointed body, has to say about the film," said the film's producer.
