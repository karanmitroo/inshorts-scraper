Television-film producer Ekta Kapoor has said she won't repeat the mistake of showing kissing scenes in her serials again like she did in Bade Achhe Lagte Hai, which starred Ram Kapoor and Sakshi Tanwar. Calling the scene one of her biggest learnings, Ekta added, "Ratings for that show, which was six and five on regular episodes, went down to two."
