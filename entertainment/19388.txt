It is rumoured that Shahrukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra, who were very close so much so that it irked SRK's wife Gauri Khan, are not close anymore. A Bollywoodlife.com report says that at a recent event, SRK and Priyanka avoided each other by perfectly timing their entry and exit and made no efforts to greet each other.
