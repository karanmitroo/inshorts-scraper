Honest Company, an American consumer goods startup co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, has recalled its organic baby powder over concerns of eye and skin infections. During the tests conducted on the product by the startup, possible contaminations from microorganisms that could cause skin or eye infections were found. The powder has been in the US stores since April last year.
