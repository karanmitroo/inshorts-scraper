Priyanka Chopra, while giving her views on feminism said that in India people "pray to" goddesses but at the same time they "prey on" women. "For eons, women have been told how to... think or dress," she said. Priyanka added, "Feminism needs men to understand that we don't want to... hate you. We just need you to stand by us."
