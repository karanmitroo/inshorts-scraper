Denying any role in attacking a school bus in Gurugram over the row on 'Padmaavat', Karni Sena's spokesperson Vijendra Singh said, "Rajputs can never even think of attacking a school bus." Singh added, "This is a plot being created by politicians, who wish to weaken our peaceful protest." He further said Rajputs can never engage in violence with the innocent.
