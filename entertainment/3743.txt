Kangana Ranaut, who earlier called Karan Johar the flag bearer of nepotism, said he's harmless compared to Hrithik Roshan and his father Rakesh Roshan. The actress also revealed she had a "terrible" time on the sets of 'Ungli', her only film produced by Johar's Dharma Productions. "If I don't work with Johar, I'm not missing out on anything," she added.
