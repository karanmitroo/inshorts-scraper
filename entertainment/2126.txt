Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, while speaking on the 'Padmavati' row, said if groups like Karni Sena are guilty of giving death threats then director Sanjay Leela Bhansali is also responsible for hurting people's sentiments. "Nobody has the right to take law into their own hands, be it Sanjay Leela Bhansali or anybody else," he added.
