Actress Richa Chadha has turned director for a yet-to-be-titled short film starring her boyfriend Ali Fazal. The project is a satirical comedy set in 2025 when commodities are too expensive and the world has become beyond repair. "I have always wanted to explore satire. I am just glad my friends trusted me and came on board," said Richa.
