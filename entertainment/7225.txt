Sushant Singh Rajput has said he cannot complain about nepotism as he has had the luxury of choosing the films he wanted to do. He said that nepotism exists in all industries and not just Bollywood while adding, "If you allow new talents from outside also to flourish... then it's good. If you don't allow that, then there's a problem."
