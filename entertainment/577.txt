Speaking about the upcoming biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, actor Paresh Rawal said, "Only I can play Modi ji." "I say that even at the cost of sounding pompous because I really love him...Just by sporting a white beard, someone can't be Modi ji on screen," he added. Paresh further said, "Aankhon ka power aur anguish hai Modi ji."
