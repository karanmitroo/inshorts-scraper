Marc Haynes, a scriptwriter, said, "I was as delighted at 30 as I had been at 7," in a Facebook post about meeting late actor Roger Moore, known for playing James Bond in films. While Haynes first met Moore at 7, the next time was when he was a scriptwriter for a UNICEF project and Moore featured in the campaign.
