The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is suing California over a law forcing the website to remove ages of actors on request, arguing it is unconstitutional. California passed the law in September ruling that entertainment services should remove actors' age within five days, on request. The law intended to fight age discrimination in Hollywood and was campaigned for by actors' groups.
