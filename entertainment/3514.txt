Former Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has said Priyanka Chopra's comment that Sikkim is "troubled with insurgency" has deeply hurt the sentiments of the people in the state. Bhutia added, "I'm surprised that Priyanka made this comment because she is one of the best and intellectually sharpest actresses." He further said that he has done a cameo in Priyanka's 'Pahuna'.
