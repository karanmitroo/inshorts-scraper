Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio has joined an international movement aimed at combating climate change by selling investments in fossil fuel companies. The movement represents investments worth $2.6 trillion â€“ a fifty-fold increase from the previous year. The campaign, active in 43 countries, is gaining momentum ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015.
