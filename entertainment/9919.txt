Actor Shahid Kapoor, while playing the game 'Kill Marry and Hookup' during his appearance on 'Koffee With Karan', has said that he would hookup with Alia Bhatt, marry Sonakshi Sinha and kill Priyanka Chopra. He said he would hookup with Alia because it was "safe", marry Sonakshi as she's "very marriageable" and thus he had to kill Priyanka by default.
