Actor Naseeruddin Shah has denied making remarks about Anupam Kher over the Kashmiri Pandit issue and has called earlier media reports a case of 'misreporting'. Media reports had stated that Shah commented about Kher saying, "a person who has never lived in Kashmir has started a fight for Kashmiri Pandits". Notably, Kher advocates for the rights of Kashmiri Pandits.
