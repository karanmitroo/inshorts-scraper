Deepika Padukone on Wednesday shared a video on Facebook, in which she is making fun of ex-boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor. “Clearly our friend here doesn’t know much about social media!”, Deepika captioned the video. In the video, the duo is asking fans to follow the online pages of their upcoming film 'Tamasha'. Ranbir, however, forgets the sentences he has to say.
