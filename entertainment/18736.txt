Pop star Justin Bieber was on Wednesday sentenced to two years probation by a Los Angeles Superior Court, for pelting a neighbor's home with eggs. The court also ordered him to pay $80,900 in restitution, serve five days community service and complete an anger management program in what the district attorney called a negotiated settlement.
