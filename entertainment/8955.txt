Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie's new novel 'The Golden House' will dramatise the last eight years of US politics. Starting with the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2008, the book will include current and recent political events. The novel's publishing director called it "the ultimate novel about identity, truth, terror and lies" for "a new world order of alternate truths".
