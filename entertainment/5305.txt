Choreographer Ganesh Acharya, while talking about losing 85 kg in the past one-and-a-half years, said, "People have only seen the fat Ganesh Acharya, that's why I wanted to change the image." He added, "I danced even when I had so much weight, but the difference between then and now is that the energy in my dance has doubled."
