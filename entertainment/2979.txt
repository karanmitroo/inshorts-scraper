Singer Lady Gaga, while remembering her late friend Sonja Durham on her birthday, wrote, "I wear some of Sonja's ashes around my neck in a black pearl given to me by her husband Andr√© Dubois." Sonja, who served as the managing director of Haus of Gaga, battled breast, brain and lung cancer and had passed away in May this year.
