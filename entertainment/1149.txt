Talking about patriotism being sold in films, Anurag Kashyap said, "You should hear when producers say 'we should put in the National Anthem in the end'. It's like putting in a bit of jeera in a dish." "That's what they reduce patriotism to," he added. Speaking on Bollywood biopics, Kashyap stated, "All biopics are nationalist and patriotic...that pisses me off."
