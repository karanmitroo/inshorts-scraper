Three songs from Justin Bieber’s new album “Purpose” featured in the British singles charts at the first, third and fifth place on Friday, making him the only artist to achieve the feat after John Lennon. Bieber’s “Sorry”, “Love Yourself” and “What Do You Mean” featured in the same sequence as Lennon’s “Imagine”, “Happy Xmas” and “Starting Over” did in 1981.
