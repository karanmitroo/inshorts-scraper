Traffic will be banned from part of a Northern Ireland road which became famous after it appeared in TV series Game of Thrones. The move is aimed at protecting trees called the Dark Hedges, which were planted 200 years ago by the Stuart family. The tunnel of trees represented "the Kingsroad" in the series, and has become popular among tourists.
