Congress MLAs from Assam, Nandita Das and Rupjyoti Kurmi, have alleged that Priyanka Chopra's outfit on Assam Tourism calendar is immodest. They further stated that Priyanka's "minimal clothes" brought a bad name to the state's culture, adding that what she was wearing was not an Assamese attire. Kurmi demanded that she should be removed as Assam Tourism's brand ambassador.
