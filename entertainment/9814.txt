Speaking on reports of her moving in with rumoured boyfriend Farhan Akhtar, actress Shraddha Kapoor has said that it went overboard this time. "Publishing a story as fact is wrong. I wanted to take action against the person but then I didn't," she added. Reports of Shraddha's father Shakti Kapoor "dragging" her out from Farhan's flat had also emerged.
