National Award-winning actor Adil Hussain has said he does some films to pay his bills and some films for his dil. "'Aiyaary' and '2.0' are those small...roles that I'm doing to pay...bills. Films like 'Mukti Bhawan' don't pay me," added Adil. He further said he is in a good headspace right now, devoting some time to his first passion, theatre.
