After rival AIADMK factions announced their merger, actor Kamal Haasan said, "Gandhi cap, saffron cap, Kashmir cap, and now clown's cap on the Tamilians' head." "Is this enough, or do you (Tamilians) want more? Rise up Tamizha," added Haasan. He had earlier slammed the AIADMK and called for CM E Palaniswami's resignation over alleged corruption last week.
