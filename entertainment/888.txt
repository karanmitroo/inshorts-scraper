China has banned hip-hop singers, and actors with tattoos from appearing on television shows, according to reports. The country's media regulator issued orders to ban actors whose "heart and morality" did not match the Communist Party's values. The crackdown is reportedly part of a broader attempt by the Communist Party to close potential platforms for dissent by the youth.
