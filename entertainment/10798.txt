Ranveer Singh, while apologising for the sexist advertisement by fashion brand 'Jack & Jones', said that he treats women with utmost respect both professionally and personally. "It was important to give the brand creative freedom... but I guess we got it wrong... I'm sorry this happened but it's a thing of the past," said Ranveer, who featured in the ad.
