Priyanka Chopra shared a picture with her mother Madhu Chopra, captioned "Legs for days.... #itsthegenes". This comes after Priyanka was criticised on Facebook for wearing a western outfit which showed her legs when she recently met PM Narendra Modi in Berlin. A Facebook user had posted Priyanka should have the "basic sense of covering" her legs.
