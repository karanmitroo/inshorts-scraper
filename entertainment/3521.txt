Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel has said Aditya Pancholi should use his contacts and give work to his jobless children, while reacting to his statement that he got Kangana into Bollywood. "A failed actor Pancholi claims that he made Kangana [a super star]," she added. Rangoli further said Kangana gave 5 auditions before she bagged her debut film 'Gangster'.
