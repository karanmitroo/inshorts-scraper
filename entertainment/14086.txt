Emraan Hashmi on Monday said that he gifts a bag to his wife Parveen every time he kisses on screen. “She still sulks. She doesn’t hit me as hard now,” added Emraan during the launch of his book ‘The Kiss of Life'. Notably, the actor has been given the tag of 'serial kisser' for his numerous kissing scenes.
