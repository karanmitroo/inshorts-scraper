Actress Nargis Fakhri is set to make her debut as a singer with the song Habitaan Vigaad Di, which also features Indo-Canadian singer-composer Parichay and rapper-record producer Kardinal Offishall. The actress is said to have given a hundred takes for the main chorus line as she could not get the Punjabi lyrics right.
