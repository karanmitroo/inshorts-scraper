Actress Nandita Das has said that be it films, advertisements or television, India portrays 'fair' people in a country that is largely dark. She said this while reacting to actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui's tweet wherein he wrote, "I cannot be paired along with the fair and handsome because I am dark and not good looking."
