Actor Aditya Pancholi and his wife Zarina Wahab have sent a legal notice citing defamation to Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli. Aditya had recently said, "Rangoli has tweeted a lot of objectionable stuff against my wife, daughter and son. Which is why, I am taking the legal recourse against her." Earlier, they had also sent a similar legal notice to Kangana.
