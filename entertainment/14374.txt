The 69th Cannes Film Festival opened on Wednesday night with the screening of Woody Allen's latest film 'Cafe Society'. The film, starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, tells the story of an aspiring actor who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s. Notably, this was Allen's third film to open the festival, after 'Hollywood Ending' (2002) and 'Midnight in Paris' (2011).
