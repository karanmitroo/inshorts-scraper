Filmmaker Karan Johar will launch his biography, 'An Unsuitable Boy', in January 2017. Co-authored by Karan and Poonam Saxena, it will be published by Penguin Random House. "The idea was to make Karan sit and reflect, remember and recall his life in a very unsparing sort of manner," Poonam had said while discussing the book at Jaipur Literature Festival 2016.
