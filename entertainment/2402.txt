Comedian Kapil Sharma has said he will discuss the possibility of a new show with Sunil Grover after the latter returns from Canada. "Hopefully, we should be back together. The rest of the cast members are also ready to come on board," he added. Sunil had earlier quit 'The Kapil Sharma Show' following a fight with Kapil.
