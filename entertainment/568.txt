Jeetendra's lawyer, while denying sexual harassment allegations against the actor, called the claims "baseless, ridiculous and fabricated". "[These claims] cannot be entertained by any Court of law... after a span of almost 50 years," the lawyer added. Jeetendra's cousin had filed a complaint against him claiming that he sexually abused her when she was 18 and he was 28.
