Addressing the controversy around singer Papon kissing an 11-year-old female contestant of a reality show, the singer's lawyer Gaurang Kanth has said that consent of the child is not important. "Papon gave a peck on the girl's lip, it was to show affection," said Kanth. He added that nothing is wrong as Papon thinks of her like his own child.
