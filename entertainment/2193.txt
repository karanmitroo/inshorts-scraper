Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, while talking about the protests against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati, said that the protesters are ignorant fools and not torchbearers of culture. "I think this environment (of protests against films and art) empowers you. There won't be a rebellion if everything's good," added Mehta. He further said that more political films should be made in this environment.
