As per reports, 'Pad Man' has been banned from releasing in Pakistan after distributors failed to secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the country's censor board for it. The film is said to have been denied certification as it addresses menstruation, which was why censor board members reportedly refused to watch it.
