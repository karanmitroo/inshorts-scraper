Actor-filmmaker Kamal Haasan recently said as a filmmaker, he has never had "full freedom". "No Indian filmmaker has had full freedom of speech as compared to the rest of the world... I’m yet to see my full freedom", he said. Haasan added, "Freedom should come with ‘Lakshman Rekha’... you have to feed it, guard it and take care of it".
