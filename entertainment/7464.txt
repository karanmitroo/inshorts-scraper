Rakhi Sawant has claimed that she got to know from the media about her arrest, and added she didn't even know that a case has been filed against her. She added, "If I am guilty, I am ready to go to jail." An arrest warrant was issued against Rakhi for allegedly making "objectionable" remarks against sage Valmiki, who wrote Ramayana.
