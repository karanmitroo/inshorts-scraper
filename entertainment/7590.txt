Rana Daggubati, while reacting to a leaked picture of him kissing Trisha Krishnan from singer Suchitra Karthik's Twitter account, said he doesn't give a shit. "There were many pictures. If mine made news, it probably means I'm more popular than others," he joked. Dhanush, Hansika Motwani's private images were also leaked from the account, which Suchitra claimed was hacked.
