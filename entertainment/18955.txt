Sai Kabir's Revolver Rani, starring Kangana Ranaut and Vir Das, is rated 1 (DNA; Rohit, India Today), 1.5 (Indian Express), 3 (Koimoi.com) and 3.5 (NDTV; TOI). While Kangana is being appreciated by critics, the movie fails to impress everyone as IE writes: "This Rani, who hefts revolvers and shoots to kill, is neither wholly a cartoon figure, nor completely credible."
