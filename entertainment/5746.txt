CBFC Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that he'll resign immediately, if anybody proves he has favoured a filmmaker. He added, "These charges of favouritism are levelled by filmmakers of small-budget films, who do not have the resources to market their film." Nihalani further said that some "big" producers bypass CBFC and ask the I&B ministry directly for censor clearance.
