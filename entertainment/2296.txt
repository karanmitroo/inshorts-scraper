Ranbir Kapoor's cousin Aadar Jain, while talking about the picture which showed him kissing Deepika Padukone on the cheek, said, "If we're at a party and are clicking photos, what's the harm in that." "It was a great time to enjoy ourselves...That's about it," he added. Earlier, Deepika was called "drunk", "desperate" and "vulgar" after the picture was shared online.
