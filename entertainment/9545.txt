Actor Harshvardhan Kapoor has expressed his displeasure over Diljit Dosanjh bagging the Best Debut trophy at the Filmfare Awards. "I think a debutant award is meant for someone working on his first film. It shouldn't go to an actor who has worked in several films in another industry or language," he said. Diljit has previously worked in several Punjabi films.
