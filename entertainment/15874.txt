In an attempt to attract more youth, Berlin's Zion Church on Sunday organised a Star Wars-themed special Sunday service. "It shows that the Bible and the church are part of our culture that keeps being reworked and reinterpreted," the Church's pastor Lucas Ludewig said. Over 500 people, double the usual attendance, took part in the sci-fi blockbuster-inspired service.
