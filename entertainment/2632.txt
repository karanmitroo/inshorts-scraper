Singer Kumar Sanu, while speaking about approaching people for work said, "I can't lose my self-respect by knocking at everyone's door in Bollywood for work." "I've reached a stage where I've created my niche and everyone knows what I'm capable of," he added. Sanu further said he'd rather work on his private albums, do shows and sing for regional films.
