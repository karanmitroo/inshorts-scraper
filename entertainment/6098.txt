Comedian Kapil Sharma was hospitalised on Wednesday, after he complained of uneasiness while shooting for an upcoming episode of his show. The shooting of the show was also cancelled. Reports suggest Kapil was feeling unwell as his blood pressure had shot up. "There's nothing to worry. He's fine now," said comedian Kiku Sharda, who's also a part of Kapil's show.
