A man from Australia who allegedly pretended to be singer Justin Bieber to groom children online was on Thursday charged with further 931 child sex offences, including rape and indecent treatment of children. The 42-year-old, understood to be in prison, has been accused of using Facebook and Skype since 2007 to deceive young victims into sending him explicit images.
