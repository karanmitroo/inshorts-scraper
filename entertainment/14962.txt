Actress Kangana Ranaut has requested the media to allow celebrities to have their personal space. She added, "It can be overwhelming. Strong doesnâ€™t mean you can just walk through life without being affected or intimidated." The 28-year-old actress made these comments when asked about the controversy involving actor Hrithik Roshan. Earlier, both the actors served each other a legal notice.
