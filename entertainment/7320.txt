Pink's co-producer Shoojit Sircar, while talking about the film winning the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues, said, "It still disturbs me when I watch my own film, so no celebrations." He added, "This film is to introspect, this film is not to celebrate." The film revolves around the issue of sexual harassment and consent.
