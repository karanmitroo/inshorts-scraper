Alleging that Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's film 'MSG-2: The Messenger' features derogatory dialogues against the tribal community, the Jharkhand government on Saturday banned the film from being screened across the state. "No one could be allowed to play with the sentiments of the tribals," CM Raghubar Das said. The film has been facing protests in Chhattisgarh as well.
