BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday said it would be a "matter of pride" if Amitabh Bachchan becomes the next President of the country. "Amitabh Bachchan has achieved many a milestone in cultural and social fields and if he becomes president, it will fetch a good name for the country," he said. Sinha has worked with Bachchan in many movies.
