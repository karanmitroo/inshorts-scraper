Singer Bruno Mars and the musical group 'The Time' paid tribute to singer-songwriter Prince, who passed away on April 21 last year, at the Grammy Awards 2017. Mars performed a rendition of Prince's 1984 song 'Let's Go Crazy' from the album 'Purple Rain'. The Time closely collaborated in the 1980s as Prince wrote and produced many tracks on their albums.
