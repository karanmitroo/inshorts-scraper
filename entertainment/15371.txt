Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has played the role of businessman-turned-politician Donald Trump in a spoof video made by comedy website Funny or Die. The 50-minute short film, titled 'Donald Trumpâ€™s The Art of the Deal: The Movie', was released on Wednesday. The name of the film, a Ron Howard directorial, has been taken from Trump's 1987 business advice book.
