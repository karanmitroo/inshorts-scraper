Twinkle Khanna has responded to a man who called the 'Pad Man' challenge, wherein celebrities are being asked to post a picture holding a sanitary pad, 'hypocrisy [in] its best form'. "In 2015 I started writing about menstruation in my columns, 2016 I wrote about A Muruganantham in my book and 2018 I am producing Pad Man," she wrote.
