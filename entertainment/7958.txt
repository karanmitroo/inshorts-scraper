Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he had been at a "shaadi ka mandap" when the love of his life was getting married to somebody else. "When it happens to you, you feel like you can't get over what's happening to you," said Johar. He added, "People say Hindi films are...dramatic, but somewhere its roots are in real life."
