A cafe in Chennai has installed a 6 feet tall statue of actor Rajinikanth, made of 600 kilogram of chocolate. The statue was created by Chennai-based sculptor Srinath Balachandran after the cafe conducted a poll on how to pay tribute to Rajinikanth. This comes just after the actor was awarded a 'Padma Vibhushan' for his contribution to the film industry.
