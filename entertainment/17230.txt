As Salman Khan was Wednesday sentenced to 5 years imprisonment in the 2002 hit-and-run case, his Bollywood counterparts tweeted in his support, expressing grief. "It hurts when your own are punished, even if they are in the wrong...," Alia Bhatt tweeted. "It doesn't matter what anyone or any court says, he doesn't deserve this on any level," tweeted Arjun Kapoor.
