Jagga Jasoos director Anurag Basu has said it's a coincidence that Ranbir Kapoor's hairdo in the film is like the comic book character Tintin. He added, "This look wasn't my first choice...[but] no other look...matched our narrative." Basu further revealed that he had stacks of Tintin comics during childhood and details of such adventure stories stayed in his mind.
