Smurfette, a cartoon character, has been censored from movie posters of 'Smurfs: The Lost Village' in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city in Israel. A PR company confirmed that it changed the original poster to avoid insulting local sensibilities. Bnei Brak reportedly has an ordinance which prevents hanging posters of women that "might incite the feelings of the city's residents."
