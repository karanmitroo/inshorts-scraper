Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has issued a notice to actress Anushka Sharma for "illegally" installing an electric junction box in the lobby outside her house. The notice was issued after one of Anushka's neighbour filed a complaint with BMC. Meanwhile, Anushka's spokesperson has said that the construction is not illegal as the electric box was installed after getting all permissions.
