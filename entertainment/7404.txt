Actor Vin Diesel paid a tribute to his late co-star Paul Walker at the premiere of the film 'The Fate of The Furious'. "There wasn't a second we made this movie, not a minute, not a day that went by that we weren't thinking about our brother Pablo," said Vin. Walker's mother and daughter were also present at the premiere.
