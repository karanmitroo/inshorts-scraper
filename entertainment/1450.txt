Talking about the release of 'PadMan' and 'Aiyaary' on the same day, Akshay Kumar said that it is only the media that refers to simultaneous release of two films as 'clash'. He added, "Both PadMan and Aiyaary are absolutely different. Neeraj Pandey (director of 'Aiyaary') is a very dear friend of mine."
