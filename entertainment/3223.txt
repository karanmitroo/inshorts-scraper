Sherlyn Chopra, the first Indian to pose nude for Playboy magazine, has shared a picture with the magazine's founder Hugh Hefner while condoling his death. Sherlyn called Hefner "a true visionary who chose to not conform to the dogma set by the self-proclaimed guardians of the society". Sherlyn had earlier said the nude shoot was not cheesy or vulgar.
