Bombay HC has directed Pakistani singer-cum-musician Adnan Sami to deposit his passport to Mumbai police while they look into the harassment case filed against him by his ex-wife Sabah. She pleaded that Adnan isn't complying with HC orders passed while granting him anticipatory bail in 2009. HC has ordered Adnan to vacate the Lokhandwala Duplex which is Sabah's matrimonial home.
