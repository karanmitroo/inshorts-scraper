A police complaint was filed against Kamal Haasan by the nationalistic Hindu party 'Hindu Makkal Katchi' (HMK) over the actor's remarks about the Hindu religious text Mahabharata. Calling Haasan anti-Hindu, HMK Tamil Nadu secretary Rama Ravikumar said, "Haasan said that Mahabharata talks about a woman (Draupadi) who was used as a pawn and was gambled away...It has hurt our sentiments."
