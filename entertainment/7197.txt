Baahubali 2 director SS Rajamouli has spoken in defence of actor Sathyaraj, who portrays Katappa, against pro-Kannada organisations asking for an apology over the actor's speech on the Cauvery issue. Rajamouli claimed that Sathyaraj's speech was from nine years ago. "After that, about 30 films of his were released in Karnataka... No one had problems with that," added Rajamouli.
