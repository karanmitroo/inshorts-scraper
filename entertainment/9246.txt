Actor Sushant Singh Rajput has removed his surname from his Twitter handle to show his support for director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, following an attack on the filmmaker by Rajput organisation Karni Sena. "We would suffer till the time we're obsessed with our surnames.
If you're that courageous, give us your first name to acknowledge. #padmavati," he tweeted.
