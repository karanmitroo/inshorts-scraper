The Revising Committee of Censor Board has reportedly asked for the word 'Punjab' to be dropped from the title of 'Udta Punjab' while demanding for the film to be set in a fictional place and not Punjab. The film is reportedly being viewed as defamatory to the state as it is based on drug problems that Punjab's youth faces.
