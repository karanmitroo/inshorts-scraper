Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has sent a legal notice to Priya Singh Paul asking her to prove her claims that she is Sanjay Gandhi's daughter. Paul had demanded that Bhandarkar screen his film Indu Sarkar for her as it misrepresented her 'father' and 'grandmother' Indira Gandhi. Madhur termed her claims as 'vague' and an attempt to extort money out of him.
