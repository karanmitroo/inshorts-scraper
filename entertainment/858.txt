Entry to Rajasthan's Chittorgarh Fort has been closed reportedly for the second time since 1947 after 1,900 female Karni Sena members opposing the release of 'Padmaavat' threatened to commit 'jauhar' (self-immolation) in the fort. Karni Sena Chittorgarh unit president GS Khangarot has been arrested over the threat. In November 2017, protesters opposing the movie blocked the entrance to the fort.
