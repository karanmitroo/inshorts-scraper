In response to a cleric who announced a ₹10 lakh reward for anybody shaving Sonu Nigam's head, the singer on Wednesday shaved his head live on TV. Before shaving his head, Nigam called the cleric's act "religious gundagardi" and asked him to keep ₹10 lakh ready. The fatwa was issued after Nigam complained of being woken up by the Azaan.
