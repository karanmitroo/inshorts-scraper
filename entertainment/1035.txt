'Bigg Boss 11' winner Shilpa Shinde has claimed TV actress Hina Khan, who was the first-runner up on the show, treated her like a servant. Shilpa revealed how everyone used to complain about her cooking extra food while adding, "Hina squirmed if the food was stale... she wasn't appreciative." Earlier, Shilpa said she would never want to meet Hina again.
