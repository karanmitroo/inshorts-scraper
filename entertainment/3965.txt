The Central Board Of Film Certification (CBFC) has ordered for 39 abusive words, including 'f**k', 'assh***' and 'motherf***er', to be censored in the Hollywood film 'The Hitman's Bodyguard', which released on Friday. "That's not a new thing as Censor Board is doing this with most Hollywood movies because of the outdated guidelines they are following," said the film's Indian distributor.
