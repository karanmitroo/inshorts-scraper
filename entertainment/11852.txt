Actress Priyanka Chopra, during an interview on American talk show 'Live With Kelly', said that she "hates" it when men remove their body hair by waxing, adding that she thinks it's "gross". "There are some things only women should do, please. Boys need to be effortless and scruffy, I mean well put together but not so put together," said Priyanka.
