The BJP on Wednesday said the ongoing controversy surrounding the release of Karan Johar's upcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' should not be politicised. The final decision in this regard should be taken by the Bollywood industry, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said. The filmmaker is entitled to put his point of view by the Constitution, he added.
