Actor Aamir Khan, who was reportedly very fond of non-vegetarian food, has turned into a vegetarian and has also given up milk and dairy products. Aamir said that he took the decision after his wife Kiran Rao showed him a video which suggested how a diet change can prevent 15 most common diseases that cause death.
