Model-turned-actress Urvashi Rautela, while speaking about punishment for rapists and paedophiles, said, "I feel that chemical castration will be good." "Castration is intended to have a deterrent effect and prevent sexual offenses," she added. Urvashi further said, "There is a growing sense of frustration... on our collective failure to protect our women and children."
