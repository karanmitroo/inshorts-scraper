Speaking about the silence on sexual harassment in Bollywood, Neha Dhupia said, "There's a constant fear among actors to save their reputation, [and that of] their parents and families." "Also, they may feel it's going to become ugly," she added. On being asked if she has ever had any such experience, Neha further said, "I've never felt exploited...I feel blessed."
