Kangana Ranaut, while speaking about Swara Bhasker's open letter on 'Padmaavat', questioned, "What's so offensive about it?" "It's disturbing to see how she's being...slut-shamed into silence," she added. Kangana further said, "I read somewhere that Mr Bhansali has said Jauhar is the character's way of winning the war. That's equally controversial, and one of the most insensitive things to say."
