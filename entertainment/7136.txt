Randhir Kapoor said he feels that his elder daughter Karisma Kapoor doesn't want to get married right now. He added, "Karisma's an excellent mother who dotes on her children and probably doesn't feel the need to get married." Karisma divorced husband Sunjay Kapur in 2016 after 13 years of marriage. They have two children together, daughter Samaira and son Kiaan.
