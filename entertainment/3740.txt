Actress Bhumi Pednekar has said that right from the beginning, society tells boys not to cry or be vulnerable, while also teaching them 'mard ko dard nhi hota'. Bhumi added, "When they grow up, somewhere in the back of their mind, they start behaving as if their heart is built of stone." She further said that this nurtures ruthlessness.
