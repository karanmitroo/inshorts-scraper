Karni Sena has threatened to blacken the face of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray after a party member said nobody will be allowed to obstruct Padmaavat's release in Mumbai. The party later clarified the member's comments were her personal take and not partyâ€™s official stand. We aren't a security agency to offer protection to any movie, party officials said.
