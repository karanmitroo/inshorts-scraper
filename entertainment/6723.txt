Rajkummar Rao has said that he couldn't recognise himself in his look from upcoming film Raabta. He added, "It used to take me six hours every day. It required patience. A special team from Los Angeles was brought in, that worked with a team from India." Rao will play a 324-year-old man for a guest appearance in the film.
