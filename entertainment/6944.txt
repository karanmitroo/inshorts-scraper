Choreographer Terence Lewis has jokingly said that he is not on drugs as dance itself gives him a high. "When you start dancing, the internal chemistry of your body changes, your mind changes. You feel very powerful. It's like the biggest drug," he added. The choreographer was speaking on the occasion of World Dance Day.
