Singer Kylie Minogue has won a legal battle against reality television personality Kylie Jenner over the trademark of their shared first name. In 2014, Jenner had filed a US trademark application for the term Kylie, seeking protection for the term in connection with advertising services. Minogue filed a notice of opposition to Jenner's application in February 2016.
