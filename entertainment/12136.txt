The wax figures of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have been kept separately at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in London, following the news of their divorce. The couple's wax figures were unveiled in 2013 to mark Pitt's 50th birthday. In the picture, a wax statue of 'Twilight' actor Robert Pattinson is seen placed between Brad and Angelina's statues.
