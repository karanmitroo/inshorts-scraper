The sequel to 'The Woman in Black', the most successful British horror film, 'The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death' has mild ratings, as critics mourn the death of a horrid climax. The film has "few solid scares" but won't make you jump in fear, writes Economic Times. It has been rated 2.5 (ET) and 3 (TOI, Daily Mail).
