Responding affirmatively to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s comment, actress Rakhi Sawant on Friday said she could in fact govern better than Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. Sawant also termed the Delhi CM an "item boy". Commenting further, she added if Gujarat CM Narendra Modi can run the country by selling tea, why can’t she do being an item girl.
