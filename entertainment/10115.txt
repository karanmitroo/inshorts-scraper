Actor Akshay Kumar has said that Bollywood was hit hard by demonetisation. "Even my staff wasn't able to go to the cinema on their usual Sundays off because they couldn't spare 500 bucks. I can only imagine how hard it's hit many areas of India," said Akshay. However, he added that everyone has had to sacrifice for the greater good.
