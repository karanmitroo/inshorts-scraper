The Tamil Nadu government has temporarily called off the 30% entertainment tax, to be levied by the local body, above 28% GST in the state. The decision was made after three rounds of talks between the state government and representatives from the Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners and Distributors Association. The association had earlier initiated an indefinite strike of theatres.
