Actor Anil Kapoor has said that he can't think of any bad patch or wouldn't like to erase anything in his over 35-year-long career in films. He added, "I didn't realise that the time has passed so fast. Something good has happened every decade." Anil made his acting debut in a lead role in 'Hamare Tumhare' (1979).
