Saif Ali Khan and Ileana D'Cruz-starrer, 'Happy Ending', has managed to collect only Rs 13 crores in the opening weekend. "Though the collections improved marginally over the weekend, it was much below expectation. The production partners and worldwide distributors of the film stand to lose heavily," Trade analyst Amod Mehra said.
