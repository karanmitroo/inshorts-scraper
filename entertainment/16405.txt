The Bombay HC on September 15 rejected a plea demanding that Salman Khan's bail be cancelled, and his jail term increased in the 2002 hit-and-run case. The mother of Ravindra Patil, Khan's former bodyguard and complainant, who died during the course of the trial, had filed the plea. Khanâ€™s appeal opposing the conviction will be heard daily beginning September 21.
