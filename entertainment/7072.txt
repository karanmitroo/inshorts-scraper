Actress and former Miss India Esha Gupta, who was at a fashion show in Dubai, was followed by a male fan into the ladies washroom, on the pretext of helping her with her gown which got stuck. "I was just taken aback... But he then apologised, said he wants a picture with me, and waited outside," said Esha.
