Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has said that despite his 2008 directorial 'Golmaal Returns' being "the biggest hit of those days", was a crap film. Commenting on a film's box office failure, he said, "I start getting that feeling when you're going wrong." He added, "The whole team sits together and we introspect. We rectify ourselvesâ€¦what all went wrong."
