Actress Radhika Apte has said that periods should not stop women from doing anything. "[During my periods], I have the freedom to choose whether I want to sleep in my bed or whether I want to go climb a mountain," she added. Radhika further said, "[T]he constant reminder... that 'I am on period' does stop you from doing certain things".
