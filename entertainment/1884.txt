Actor Salman Khan has said that Katrina Kaif is one of the best dancers today while adding, "Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone, girls who are considered dancers... I think she beats them hollow." "She (Katrina) knows her limitations and works hard to achieve what she can't do. When she joined the industry, she couldn't dance," Salman added.
