Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that women are always judged by the way they look, to the way they speak, to whether they are pregnant or not. Speaking at Indian Merchant Chamber (IMC) Ladies’ Wing opening of Women Entrepreneur exhibition, the actress added, "Ours is a patriarchal society... Women are looked upon as they can’t do a lot of things."
