Actor Randeep Hooda has said that he thinks his Twitter handle should be put on parental guidance. "I laughed at a joke (by former cricketer Virender Sehwag). It was blown out of proportion because certain people had an agenda," said Hooda. He further clarified that he didn't know who Gurmehar Kaur was, while adding, "I wasn't aware of the threats."
