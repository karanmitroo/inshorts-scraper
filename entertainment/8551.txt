Deepika Padukone has said that it feels weird and odd when she is compared to Priyanka Chopra. "I think we are both doing extremely well. But our worlds are also completely different," added Deepika. She further said, "I can understand comparison with an Anushka or a Sonam or a Sonakshi but I can't wrap my head with... comparisons with Priyanka."
