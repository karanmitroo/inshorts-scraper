Harry Potter author JK Rowling has apologised for a series of tweets in which she falsely accused US President Donald Trump of refusing to shake the hand of a child in a wheelchair during an event last week. Rowling was slammed for not removing the tweets from her social media account after her comments were proved to be incorrect.
