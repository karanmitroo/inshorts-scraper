As per reports, the Censor Board has stalled the release of the documentary The Argumentative Indian, which is on Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, over the use of words 'cow', 'Gujarat', 'Hindutva view of India' and 'Hindu India'. The documentary's maker Suman Ghosh said that he would never agree to beep or mute anything that Amartya has said in the documentary.
