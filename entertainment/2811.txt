Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has said that while shooting 'Dilwale' he went off-track, away from the script and his audience, and instead catered to Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol's audience. "The original script...was a typical Rohit Shetty film. But after Kajol came...we started catering to that audience," added Rohit. He further said that because of this, he was scared about the film's performance.
