The Ministry of External Affairs has termed Akshay Kumar starrer 'Airlift' a great film, adding that it fell short on facts. "The film has also taken a lot of artistic liberties in the depictions of the events that actually happened in Kuwait in 1990," ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. Former Ambassador Nirupama Rao has also termed the film as 'biased'.
