Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that people mistake her genuine dislike for them as arrogance. "It's taken for granted that women should be receptive of whatever and whosoever comes... their way," said Kangana. She further said, "It's just that I don't waste time on equations that are not going anywhere... It will be a waste of time."
