Actor Jim Carrey was sued on Monday for allegedly procuring drugs under a fake name for his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White, who died of an overdose last year. The lawsuit has been filed by White's estranged husband, who alleges that Carrey tried to hide his involvement after White's death. The lawsuit also seeks reimbursement for funeral expenses and attorney fees.
