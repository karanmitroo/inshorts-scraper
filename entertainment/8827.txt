Actress Meryl Streep has said that she is the most overrated, over-decorated and over-berated actor of her generation. "We're not going to go back to the bad old days of ignorance and oppression and hiding who we are," she added. Earlier, US President Donald Trump had called her an overrated actress following her speech at the Golden Globes.
