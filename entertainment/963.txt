After the Supreme Court stayed the ban on 'Padmaavat' in Rajasthan, the state is set to challenge the court against it. Mewar's royal Maharana Mahendra Singh wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi and Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje against the decision. The court had stayed the ban on the film, which is now scheduled to release on January 25.
