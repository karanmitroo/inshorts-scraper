Katrina Kaif, on being asked what she hates about Alia Bhatt, jokingly said, "She could possibly be a little more generous and pass some of the critics' appreciation and awards my way rather than taking it all." She said this on Neha Dhupia's talk show 'BFFs with Vogue'. Katrina had appeared with Alia Bhatt on the show.
