Actress Nicole Kidman, who was spotted clapping with her fingers stretching outwards and only her palms touching at the Oscars last month, said she was afraid of damaging her diamond ring. "I don't want to not be clapping, which would be worse right?" she added. Nicole further said it was difficult for her to clap because of the huge ring.
