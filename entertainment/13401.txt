Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he had to "literally beg" Salman Khan and Rani Mukerji to star as the characters 'Aman' and 'Tina' in the 1998 film 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. "I had approached eight heroines and no one agreed (to play Tina's role)," said Karan. He also revealed that he initially wanted a known face to portray 'Tina'.
