Reacting to Aamir Khan's recent comments on the issue of intolerance, veteran Bollywood actor Naseeruddin Shah on Tuesday said that as a Muslim, the thought of leaving India never occurred to him. "I don't think he should have said this. Regardless of what he feels, we Muslims do not need any further aggravation of our feeling of persecution", Shah said.
