Reacting strongly to the diktat on film content, filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj has said that the Censor board is behaving like Taliban. "They (censor board) should be censored and chopped... They should know their limits... it's (film is) an art form", he said. Talking about using abuses in a film, he said, "A film doesn't create reality, it just reflects reality".
