New Zealand cricketer Ross Taylor has revealed that he was mistaken for a Game of Thrones character and invited as a guest for a TV show. â€œI was two minutes away from going on Soccer AM, UK's massive Saturday morning soccer show ahead of the FA Cup semi-final as Grey Worm, who's a huge Manchester United fan apparently," Taylor said.
