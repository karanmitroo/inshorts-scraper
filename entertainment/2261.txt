Actors Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth were announced as the winners of the NTR National Film Award for 2014 and 2016, respectively, by the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday. The government had not announced the awards since 2014 due to the split of Andhra Pradesh and the formation of Telangana. Both the actors took to Twitter to congratulate each other.
