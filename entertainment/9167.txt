Actress Kangana Ranaut has said it would be stupid for anyone to make a move to Hollywood now. "Their theatre business is crashing because of the influx of digital media. Asia, on the other hand, is where Hollywood was 15 years ago," she added. Kangana further said she does not wish to offer herself on a platter to another industry.
