Actress Shilpa Shetty, who had said that books like 'Animal Farm' teach children to "love and care about animals", has called her remark a "misunderstanding", while saying, "This shall too pass". "I've "NEVER" read these books(@ the cost of soundin even dumber!)... So recommending them to kids is out of the question!", Shilpa added.
