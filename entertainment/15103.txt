The Central Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday opposed Bollywood actor Sooraj Pancholi's plea seeking a return of his passport. Pancholi, who is accused of abetting actress Jiah Khan's suicide, had moved the Bombay High Court to seek a return of his passport saying he has to travel abroad to fulfil work commitments.
