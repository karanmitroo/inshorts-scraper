Shahid Kapoor has said no one knew he was actor Pankaj Kapur's son till he joined Bollywood. "It was only after an IMDB page about me was made that people discovered who my father is," he added. Shahid further said, "My mother was a struggling actor...who separated from dad when I was growing up. I had a regular middle-class childhood."
