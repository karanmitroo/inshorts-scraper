Actor Varun Dhawan will get a wax statue at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong, making him the youngest Indian actor to have his statue at the museum. Talking about the honour, Varun said, "It was quite surprising... when they approached (me) for it. I remember, as a kid...visiting Madame Tussauds and clicking pictures with Mahatma Gandhi's statue."
