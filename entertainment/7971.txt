American rock and roll legend Chuck Berry passed away early on Sunday aged 90 following a medical emergency. Often called the father of rock and roll, Berry's hits included 'Johnny B Goode', 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'School Days'. "If you had to give rock'n'roll another name, you might call it Chuck Berry," singer John Lennon had once said.
