A film producer named Hardev Singh (47) was arrested on Saturday for allegedly trying to implicate Salman Khan in a fake attack on himself. Singh reportedly planned the fake shootout in order to force the actor to work in his next project, after failing to rope him directly. During sustained interrogation, Singh confessed his involvement in the shootout.
