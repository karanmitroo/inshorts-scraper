Haryana-based Shweta Mehta, from Neha Dhupia's gang, was on Saturday announced the winner of stunt-based reality show MTV Roadies Rising. She emerged as the winner after beating Baseer Ali from Prince Narula's team. "I had auditioned for Roadies thrice in the past, but did not make it to the show. But failing thrice did not dampen my spirits," said Shweta.
