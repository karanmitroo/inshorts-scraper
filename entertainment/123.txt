While talking about her belief in the institution of marriage, Kangana Ranaut said, "I definitely want to get married...want to have children, but my work will always be my first baby." She further said, "Meeting the right guy is on the to-do list. Frivolous dating and going for midnight walks...are not things that interest me anymore."
