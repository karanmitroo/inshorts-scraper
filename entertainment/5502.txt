Late music composer-singer RD Burman used beer bottles to compose the opening beats of 'Mehbooba Mehbooba' song from the 1975 film 'Sholay'. Burman also used other ways such as using a glass and spoon to create the tinkling beats in the song 'Chura Liya' (Yaadon Ki Baaraat). Popularly known as 'Pancham da', Burman's 78th birth anniversary was observed on Tuesday.
