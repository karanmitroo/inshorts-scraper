Actress Kangana Ranaut has filed a complaint against Hrithik Roshan, in which her lawyer has demanded preventive action against Hrithik. The complaint said Hrithik is trying to fabricate the case by relying on emails which originate from a hacked email account. Kangana's lawyer further claimed that Hrithik himself hacked the account in May 2014.
