Actress Neha Dhupia has said that she literally slept in her bed with the award she received at a recent awards ceremony the night she received it. "I've been around (in the industry) for too long and I've always been on stage giving away awards, and I've never been on stage to receive it. It feels really amazing," added Neha.
