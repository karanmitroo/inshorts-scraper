Actress Jacqueline Fernandez has responded to reports of her dating actor Sidharth Malhotra. "Obviously people want to believe what they want to and will write what they want. I'm an easy target because I'm single. There is no point in clarifying anything," said Jacqueline. The rumours emerged when Jacqueline and Sidharth were shooting in Miami for an upcoming film.
