According to reports, the producers of Vijay-starrer film 'Mersal' have agreed to remove the scenes that mocked GST and Digital India. This comes after the Bharatiya Janata Party's Tamil Nadu unit objected to the references in the film. Vijay has starred in triple roles in the film, which deals with corruption in India's medical industry.
