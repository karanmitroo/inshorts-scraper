Actress Dia Mirza turned showstopper for designer Anju Modi's 'Sunehri Kothi' collection at the India Couture Week. Dia walked the runway in an organza lehenga and an embroidered maroon velvet blouse, paired with a sheer white dupatta. "I took inspiration from the miniature art of 16th Century Rajasthan, especially Kishangarh. Dia looks like a princess from Rajasthan," said Anju.
