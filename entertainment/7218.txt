A picture of Kangana Ranaut, wearing what appears to be a supergirl-like costume, has surfaced online. Reports suggest that the picture is from the sets of her upcoming film 'Simran'. Directed by Hansal Mehta, the film is reportedly inspired by the life of an NRI nurse who was sent to prison for robbing banks to pay off her gambling debts.
