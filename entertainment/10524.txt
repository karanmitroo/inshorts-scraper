Ritesh Sidhwani, producer of Shah Rukh Khan starrer film 'Raees', has said that if necessary, they'll bring Pakistani actress Mahira Khan to India for the film's promotions. "I don't think there will be any restriction for her from the government or issuing visa to her will be a problem," Ritesh added. 'Raees' is scheduled to release on January 25, 2017.
