Actor Saif Ali Khan has said that singer Sonu Nigam's tweet on Azaan was a bit aggressive. He added, "It's fine to express your views on decibel levels. I do think religion should be a private affair and we should be a secular country." Sonu had complained about being woken up by the Azaan and termed it "forced religiousness".
