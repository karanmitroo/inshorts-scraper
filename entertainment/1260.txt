'Baahubali' actor Prabhas has said that actors also have a shelf life and he cannot think of giving five years to one project now. He added that age is also a factor and doing a long-term film would be adverse for his career. Prabhas reportedly spent nearly five years shooting for 'Baahubali' franchise without signing any other film in between.
