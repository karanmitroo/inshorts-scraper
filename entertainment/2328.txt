Actor Salman Khan, while talking about the protests against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', said, "Bhansali makes lovely films and there is nothing wrong with his movies." Salman added that no conclusions should be drawn without seeing the film. The film has been facing opposition from various Rajput organisations and political leaders, who claim that it distorts historical facts.
