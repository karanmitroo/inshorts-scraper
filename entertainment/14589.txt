Oscar-winning actor George Clooney in a comment on the refugee crisis in Europe said, "We call them refugees, but they’re just people, like you and me". "If we are to survive as a people, we simply can’t look away," he said. This came after Clooney presented a humanitarian award to Marguerite Barankitse, who saved 30,000 children during Burundi's civil war.
