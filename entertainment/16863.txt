Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui recently said he is "tremendously" inspired by Bollywood's Khan trio- Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. "There are a lot of aspects that we can learn from Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh. Sustaining their stardom for so many years is a big achievement", he said. "And they have their own separate identity," Siddiqui added.
