Rishi Kapoor took to Twitter to share a picture of RK Studios' half-broken logo after the recent fire. He captioned it, "Gutted by a devastating inferno. Scars shall remain but will build a state of the art studio." Rishi had earlier revealed the mask and costumes from the 1970 Raj Kapoor starrer 'Mera Naam Joker' got burnt in the fire.
