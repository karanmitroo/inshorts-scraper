Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has been named the Sexiest Man Alive by People Magazine. Johnson said to People, "I thought, 'Wow, we've pretty much reached the pinnacle'...I've done it all, this is it." Johnson, who was recently named the highest-paid Hollywood actor for 2015-16, is the first non-white actor to have won the title since Denzel Washington in 1996.
