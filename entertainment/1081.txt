Vidya Balan has said people no longer feel the need to go to a theatre to watch a star. "Stars have become quite accessible now... People want to go to the theatre to experience a good film and characters," she added. Giving the example of 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', Vidya further said the film did well because of its content.
