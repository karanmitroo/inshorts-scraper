Priyanka Chopra has responded to the suicide claims made by her ex-manager Prakash Jaju and said that there is no "credibility" to him. "[I]tâ€™s so sad that Indian media has given credibility to the man, who was in jail because of harassing me", she said. Earlier, Jaju had alleged that Priyanka tried to commit suicide thrice in the past.
