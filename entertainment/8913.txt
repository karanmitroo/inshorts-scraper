Actress Shama Sikander has clarified that she never watched pornographic films to research for her character in the short film 'Sexaholic'. "I was misquoted... I had asked for both written and visual content that I can refer to and get a better understanding of the character I was to play. But there was nothing pornographic involved," said Shama.
