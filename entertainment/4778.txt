The Kerala High Court has rejected the bail plea of actor Dileep, who was arrested two weeks ago in connection with the abduction and assault on a Malayalam actress. The court noted that Dileep's release at this point would affect the ongoing investigation. The police suspect Dileep of paying men to abduct and assault the actress.
