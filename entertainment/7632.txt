Hoverboard startup SideKick Wheels has sued singer Jennifer Lopez for failing to promote the brand on Twitter and Instagram. According to the lawsuit, the startup gave Lopez 42 hoverboards to use during a show and in return, Lopez was required to post about the hoverboards at least once every three months. However, she tweeted only once about SideKick Wheels.
