'Jurassic World', a Colin Trevorrow directorial, that released this week "is not as good as 'Jurassic Park', but a worthy successor," says HT. The film, starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Indian actor Irrfan Khan among others, "is full of fear and fun," writes The Guardian. It has been rated 4/5 (The Guardian, TOI), 3.5/5 (HT) and 3/5 (NDTV).
