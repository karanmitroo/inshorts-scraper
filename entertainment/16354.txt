Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat has revealed that she wears a burqa whenever she travels alone. "Usually when I travel I have my staff with me. But on occasions when I am travelling alone, I wear a burqa to avoid attracting attention," Mallika said. "I am religious and spiritual... I read Hanuman Chalisa daily in the morning," she added.
