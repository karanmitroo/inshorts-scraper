Veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar, while talking about former cricketer and Rajya Sabha MP Sachin Tendulkar's first speech in the Parliament being disrupted, said, "This is an insult to...one of cricket's biggest icons." She added, "Sachin calls me Maa. He called to take my blessings before proceeding to Parliament. Then, when I heard what had happened I was very distressed."
