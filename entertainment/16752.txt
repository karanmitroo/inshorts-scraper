Cricketer Irfan Pathan will soon be seen in the celebrity dance reality show 'Jhalak Dikhla Jaa' as the first wild-card entry. "This offer came to me and I took it as a challenge. It took time for me to accept the show," Irfan said. He added that he will donate all his earnings from the show to his cricket foundation.
