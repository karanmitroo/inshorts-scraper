Hollywood actor Brad Pitt, in response to estranged wife Angelina Jolieâ€™s divorce petition, has sought joint physical and legal custody of their six children. In the divorce filing, Jolie had reportedly requested for sole physical custody of the children, allowing Pitt to have joint legal custody and visitation rights. Jolie had filed for divorce in September, citing "irreconcilable differences".
