Responding to being slut-shamed for breastfeeding a baby on the cover of Malayalam magazine 'Grihalakshmi', Gilu Joseph said, "I haven't earned a single penny out of it...How is this a publicity [stunt] at all?" "People would...have no problem seeing graphic images of people getting killed...but cannot bear to see a woman bond with her child by feeding it," she added.
