Singer Adele revealed that doctors have instructed her to exclude pizza from her diet as "cooked tomatoes" would affect her throat and vocals. "I'm in America and I can't eat pizza no more. It's worse than Romeo And Juliet! If only Shakespeare was alive, he could write about it!", Adele said to a crowd during her North American tour.
