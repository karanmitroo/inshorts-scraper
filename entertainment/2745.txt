Actress Sean Young, who starred in the 1982 film 'Blade Runner' has claimed that she was sexually harassed by producer Harvey Weinstein. "I personally experienced him pulling his you-know-what out of his pants to shock me. My basic response was, 'You know, Harvey, I really don't think you should be pulling that thing out, it's not very pretty," she added.
