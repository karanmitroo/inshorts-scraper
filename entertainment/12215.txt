Consumer goods major Unilever is reportedly in talks to buy Honest Company, a startup co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, for more than $1 billion. The startup, founded five years ago in LA, was reportedly valued at $1.7 billion when it raised $100 million in financing last year. Honest Company sells natural and organic household cleaning goods.
