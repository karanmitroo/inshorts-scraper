Anurag Basu, who directed Kangana Ranaut's debut film 'Gangster', said he saw a spark in her but had no idea that she'll become such a huge star. "Now look at her, with every single character that she plays, she has mastered the art of character building," he added. Anurag further said her growth as an artist makes him feel proud.
