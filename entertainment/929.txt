Neha Dhupia, while recalling an incident where she tried to copy Priyanka Chopra's style, said, "Priyanka...looked really hot in a golden sari... I wore the same thing and ended up looking like an idiot." She added, "Now, I do my own thing. Call it a bed sheet, a curtain or effortlessly chic - I dress the way I want to."
