The Punjab and Haryana High Court has said it cannot issue any direction against Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu's participation in a television show due to the absence of any statutory provisions. Stating that the court "can't start moral policing of politicians", the bench added, "No doubt those in public life should exercise restraint, but how far can we go?"
