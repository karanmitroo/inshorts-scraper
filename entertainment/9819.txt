US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday mocked his 'Apprentice' successor Arnold Schwarzenegger over the reality TV show's ratings. "Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got 'swamped' (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine," Trump tweeted. Arnold responded by tweeting, "I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings."
