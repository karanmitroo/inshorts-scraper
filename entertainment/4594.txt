Producer Ritesh Sidhwani has said that television actress Mouni Roy bagged the female lead role in 'Gold' opposite Akshay Kumar on the basis of her talent and not on anyone's recommendation. "She was auditioned for that part and she gave a fantastic audition. We all, Farhan (Akhtar), Reema (Kagti) and everyone, watched the audition and we chose her," added Sidhwani.
