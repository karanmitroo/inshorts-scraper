Actor Ranbir Kapoor has said he took his "success for granted" until his films failed at the box office. "When my films were doing well... I was given adjectives like 'superstar'," the actor revealed. He further said he "faced brickbats" when he didn't do well, adding that it gave him a chance to understand where his life was going.
