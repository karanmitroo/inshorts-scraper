US-based Berklee College of Music has started an annual scholarship under Oscar-winning musician AR Rahman's name, for Indian students. Under the scholarship, one Indian student studying any discipline â€” jazz, western, western classical or Carnatic or Hindustani, will receive education fund each year. The institution had earlier honoured Rahman with a honorary degree last year.
