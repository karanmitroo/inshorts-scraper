About 300 people went to a movie theatre on Saturday in the Palestinian territory of Gaza, for the first time in more than 30 years since political tensions led to the shut down of cinema halls. The territory's oldest cinema hall hosted a special screening of a film about Palestinians in Israeli prisons but only for one night.
