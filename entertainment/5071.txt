Filmmaker Kabir Khan, while speaking about the Salman Khan starrer film Tubelight's performance at the box office, said that he is disappointed. However, he added that it is unfair to pitch every film of his against his 2015 film 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', which also starred Salman. Notably, 'Tubelight' became Salman Khan's lowest Eid opening in four years.
