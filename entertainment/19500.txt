Pop star Rihanna, who performed live in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, was asked to leave the city's Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque complex for posing for "inappropriate" pictures outside it. Though she wore a hooded black-jumpsuit, the authorities found photos to be at odds with the sanctity of the place. Pictures posted on Rihanna's Instagram account sparked controversy among her fans.
