Actor Rishi Kapoor has said that celebrities attend prayer meetings because they want to be in air conditioned premises and it's more like a fashion parade. Rishi added that for this reason, more actors could attend late Vinod Khanna's prayer meeting. "I can't say I shared great chemistry with him. It was pure respect," said Rishi on attending Khanna's funeral.
