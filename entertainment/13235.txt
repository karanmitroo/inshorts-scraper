Actor Ranveer Singh has said that youngsters no longer look upon sex as a "taboo subject". "Whatâ€™s most important is for the Indian youth to understand as much as they can about safe sex and sex education," said Ranveer. He made these comments while attending a screening of 'Sex Chat with Pappu & Papa', a sex education based web series.
