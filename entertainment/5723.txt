CBFC Chief Pahlaj Nihalani said that Phullu's poster is vulgar as it shows a man happily lying down on a sanitary pad. Speaking about the film's adult certificate, he said, "Our society doesn't talk about 'that time of the month' with daughters." He added, "When we certify films we've to be sensitive towards 'other' India, which doesnâ€™t exist in metros."
