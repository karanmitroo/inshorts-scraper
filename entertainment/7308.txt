'Begum Jaan', which released on Friday, "has Vidya Balan in good form, but it lacks cohesiveness as a complete story," wrote Hindustan Times. "The film does well to humanise the prostitute," wrote Mid-Day while SpotboyE said, "The film is...full of Bollywood high drama and hysteria." It has been rated 3/5 (Mid-Day), 2.5/5 (Hindustan Times) and 1/5 (SpotboyE).
