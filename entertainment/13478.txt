Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that actors Aamir Khan and Salman Khan "are enough to handle wrestling" while adding that he is more of "a romantic hero". "Above all I don't look like a wrestler from any angle... and I don't know wrestling," said SRK, justifying as to why he sticks to his image of a romantic hero.
