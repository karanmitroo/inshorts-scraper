According to reports, actor Hrithik Roshan has mimicked Amitabh Bachchan for his upcoming film 'Kaabil'. Hrithik's impression of Bachchan's voice was reportedly so accurate that people on the sets thought it was engineered by sound designer Resul Pookutty. Hrithik will play the role of 'Rohan Bhatnagar', a blind man who tries to make a living as a mimicry artist.
