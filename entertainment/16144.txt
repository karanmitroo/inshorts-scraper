Actor Anupam Kher and director Madhur Bhandarkar on Saturday led a symbolic march, March For India, in New Delhi to voice their point that the country was "very tolerant". "Speak about your problems rather than returning awards. This is a march for India, not against anyone," Kher said at the march which will end at Rashtrapati Bhawan, beginning from Janpath.
