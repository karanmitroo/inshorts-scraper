The Bombay High Court has dismissed a petition that opposed the title of the show ‘Satyamev Jayate’ as these words formed part of the Emblem of India. "The show has not used the main Emblem and there is no... pictorial representation of Ashok Chakra," ruled the HC. Notably, using the Emblem as a whole commercially is prohibited by the law.
