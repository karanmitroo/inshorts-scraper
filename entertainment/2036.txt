Ram Ratan Saini, the brother of the man found hanging from Jaipur's Nahargarh Fort alongside slogans against the film 'Padmavati', has claimed that his death is not linked to threats against the film. "My brother cannot commit suicide, it appears to be a murder. Will demand for an investigation into the death," added Ram.
