Pop sensation Lady Gaga has revealed in an interview that she was raped when she was 19 years old. "I went through some horrific things that I'm able to laugh (at) now, because I've gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy and emotional therapy to heal over the years," the 28-yr-old singer said.
