Actor Arshad Warsi has said when his films weren't doing well at the box-office, there would be no one around him during events. However, he added, "(When) my films were doing well, I'd enter a party and would...be surrounded by...people." Arshad further said, "An actor....ends up being a commodity...as long as it works, people want to be connected to it."
