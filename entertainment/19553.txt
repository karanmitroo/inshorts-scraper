Talking about her struggling days in a magazine, 'Queen of Pop' Madonna (55) has revealed that she was raped at knifepoint in New York. "I was defiant. Hell-bent on surviving. But it was hard and it was lonely, and I had to dare myself every day to keep going," wrote Madonna, who arrived in New York with just $35.
