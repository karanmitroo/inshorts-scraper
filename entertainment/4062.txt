Aadar Jain has said he is not a product of nepotism as Aditya Chopra's production house Yash Raj Films (YRF) is launching him and not RK Films, established by his grandfather late actor Raj Kapoor. "Nepotism means favouritism towards relatives...Aditya is not my relative," added Aadar. He further said that he got the movie because he is talented.
