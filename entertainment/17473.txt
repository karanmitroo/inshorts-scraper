British singer Zayn Malik quit One Direction on Wednesday, leaving the band four-piece. "I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right", he said, ending a 5-year-old association. The band's world tour will continue with the remaining members, and the fifth album will be recorded this year.
