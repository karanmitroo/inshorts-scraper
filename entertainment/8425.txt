Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that since popular award shows have become very shallow, they should be shut down. He added, "Let's not call them award functions because awards are supposed to be prestigious. They've lost their seriousness and credibility." Nawazuddin further said that he hardly attends award functions and gets irritated when he is nominated.
