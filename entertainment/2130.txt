Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence, while talking about the hacking of her nude pictures in 2014, said she felt like she got gang-b**ged by the planet. "(I felt that) there's not one person in the world that isn't capable of seeing these intimate photos of me...That was a really impossible thing to process," added Lawrence.
