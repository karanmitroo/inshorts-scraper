Actress Celina Jaitly, who is pregnant with twins for the second time, has shared a picture of herself posing with her baby bump. "My reason to share this picture in a bikini during my pregnancy is because I believe it's important to break the stereotypes associated, with pregnancy specially when it comes to us - Indian women," said Celina.
