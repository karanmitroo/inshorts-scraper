The Chennai High Court summoned the CFBC for an explanation after a pregnant 13-year-old girl, who eloped with her boyfriend, claimed she was influenced by the Tamil film 'Kalavani'. A CBFC member appeared before the court on Monday where questions around Kalavani's 'U' certificate were raised. The film showed the male lead abducting and later marrying the female lead.
