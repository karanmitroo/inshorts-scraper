Sunny Deol, on being asked about his son Karan being launched by the Deols' production house 'Vijayta Films', asked what's the problem in it. "Doesn't Vijayta Films launch actors properly? Is there some kind of a glamour that goes missing when we launch anyone?" he further questioned. Sunny added there would've been ego clashes if another production house was involved.
