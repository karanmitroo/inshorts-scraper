Arya Samaj leader Swami Agnivesh Friday came out in support of 'PK'. “I think it is high time that a film like ‘PK’ must be welcomed by one and all. It should not be opposed on flimsy grounds by people who haven’t even seen it,” he said. He also suggested that the film should be made tax-free throughout the country.
