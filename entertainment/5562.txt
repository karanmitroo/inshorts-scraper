Actor Salman Khan has said that getting married is a waste of money and added that he doesn't believe in love at all. Speaking about relationships, he added, "There's companionship, habit.... emotional connect, or the fact that both of you have flaws but you're aware of the larger picture, and that you're happy together. But 'love' is, essentially, need."
