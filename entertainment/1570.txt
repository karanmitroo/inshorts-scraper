Irrfan Khan has said there are people who are ready to use their sexuality to reach somewhere in the film industry while there are also those who are against it. Irrfan added, "It's an individual choice. I don't want to judge anyone for this." He further said if society is sexually repressed, there will be exploitation by men or women.
