Ranveer Singh took to Twitter to share a collage of three pictures, featuring the characters Malcolm McDowell from 'A Clockwork Orange', Heath Ledger's character Joker from 'The Dark Knight' and Alauddin Khilji from 'Padmavati'. Earlier, talking about his character, Ranveer had said, "I fear if I go in, I may not come back. Like Heath Ledger. He didn't come back."
