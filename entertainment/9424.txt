The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) shows the premiere date of American television series 'Game of Thrones' season 7 as June 25 even though HBO is yet to announce the official premiere date. Earlier, Maisie Williams, who plays 'Arya Stark', said, "We only have seven episodes this time. But... there's just as much content. And you guys will not be disappointed."
