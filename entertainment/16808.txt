Salman Khan's upcoming film 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' will release in Pakistan on Eid but with several cuts, Chairman of the Central Board of Film Censors, Mobashir Hasan, said. It has become the first Indo-Pak themed film to get a clearance for screening in Pakistan. Previously, films like 'Ek Tha Tiger', 'Haider' and 'Baby' failed to get a release in the country.
