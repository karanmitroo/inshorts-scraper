Akshay Kumar has said that in his head, he made his acting debut two weeks ago. "I've never lost interest and passion. You play the song 'Waada Raha Sanam' (from 'Khiladi') and I will start dancing," he added. Akshay further said, "When I say it, I mean it that age is just a number because it has not affected anything."
