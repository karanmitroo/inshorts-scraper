Actor Salman Khan's father Salim Khan has said on Twitter that there is no place for discrimination on the basis of language, religion, cast and creed in Bollywood. "What works is talent & capability," he tweeted. His comments come after filmmaker Karan Johar's forthcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', was targeted by certain groups for featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan.
