Sharing a photoshopped poster of his film 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' on Instagram, actor Ayushmann Khurrana captioned it '#smog' while the title was changed to 'Dama (asthma) Laga Ke Haisha'. The characters from the film are seen wearing masks in the picture. His post comes amid many people in Delhi opting to wear masks owing to rise in air pollution.
