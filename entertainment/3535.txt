Kangana Ranaut has said she swings between "being a bi**h and Buddha" when it comes to how people perceive her and the prejudice she faces in Bollywood. Kangana added, "Have you heard that I'm a witch...This talk starts only because they want actresses to be dumb and pretty." She further said she can't act dumb and pamper the male ego.
