Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that he won't go anywhere without making a film with Shah Rukh Khan. He said, "I will write a film that will lure him. He should be attracted to it, he should be dying to do the film." Shah Rukh was Anurag's senior at Delhi University and helped the filmmaker during his struggling days.
