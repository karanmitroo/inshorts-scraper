Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has said that when it comes to the film business he is not thick skinned but quite practical. "My film is a product...I know my product will cater to a certain group of customers and not impress the whole world," said Rohit. However, he added, "But that does not mean I would abuse critics and get defensive."
