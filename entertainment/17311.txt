Priyanka Chopra is reportedly planning to produce a film for her cousin sister Parineeti Chopra. A source close to the actress said, "Pari has been asked to go through a few scripts. If she likes something, Priyanka is willing to produce the film." Parineeti's last two releases ‘Daawat-e-Ishq’ and ‘Kill Dil’ failed to perform well at the Box Office.
