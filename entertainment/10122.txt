Alia Bhatt has said that Karan Johar is the real life Santa Claus in her life as he gives her everything she wants and is constantly gifting her things. "Every time I visit his office he gives me something- from a new pair of sunglasses to anything he has bought for himself, but feels I should have too," said Alia.
