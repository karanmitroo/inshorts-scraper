Kriti Sanon, while denying rumours of being in a relationship with Sushant Singh Rajput, said, "People have asked me this question 10 times...I've always answered it. Asking it 50 times won't change my answer." She further quipped, "It's funny that people still don't get bored with it. So, I think I'll start thinking of new answers now."
