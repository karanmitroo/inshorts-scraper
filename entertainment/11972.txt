Actor Daniel Radcliffe has said that US presidential nominee Donald Trump "might not be as ideologically pure as Voldemort", the main villain in the 'Harry Potter' series. Radcliffe, who played Voldemort's arch nemesis 'Harry Potter', added, "[H]e feels like more of an opportunist - I don't know how much of this stuff he's saying he actually really, really believes."
