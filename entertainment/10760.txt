The Wall Street Journal confused actor Dev Patel for Kal Penn during a recent review of the movie 'Lion'. The review read "Saroo is played dazzlingly by Dev Patel, who gives his richest performance since The Namesake." Penn who starred in the 2007 film 'The Namesake', retweeted, "Dev Patel wasn't in the Namesake. Did you mean the other brown actor?"
