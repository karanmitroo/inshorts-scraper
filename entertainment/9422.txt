Comedian Kapil Sharma has called yoga guru Baba Ramdev a juicer mixer after he performed a yoga move during his appearance on The Kapil Sharma Show. Navjot Singh Sidhu during the episode asked Ramdev to churn his stomach. This prompted Kapil to joke about it, while adding that Ramdev does not require a juicer-mixer to make lassi.
