Actress Sonakshi Sinha has said that what she is in the industry is because of 'Dabangg'. "I was noticed in Dabangg and itâ€™s my very first film... Even if they need me for a guest appearance, I will do that role," said Sonakshi. She added that if 'Dabangg 3' features the character 'Rajjo', she will continue to play the role.
