Actress Priyanka Chopra has regained her 'Sexiest Asian Women' title, which she lost to Katrina Kaif last year. The 32-yr-old has topped the list in an annual poll conducted by a UK based magazine. Priyanka said, "I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve this but I'll happily accept this title." Last year's winner Katrina slipped to 4th place.
