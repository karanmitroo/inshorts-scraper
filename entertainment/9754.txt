US President-elect Donald Trump has called Meryl Streep "overrated" and a "Hillary flunky" after she denounced Trump while accepting an award at the Golden Globes. Streep had publicly criticised Trump for imitating a disabled reporter who he outranks in privilege, power and capacity to fight back. Trump denied the accusations and claimed Streep was attacking him without even knowing him.
