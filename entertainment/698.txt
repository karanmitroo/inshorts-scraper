Supermodel Kate Upton has accused fashion brand Guess' Co-founder Paul Marciano of sexually harassing women. The 25-year-old supermodel did not mention a specific incident but tweeted, "It's disappointing that such an iconic women's brand @GUESS is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director #metoo." Upton became a celebrity spokesmodel for Guess in 2011.
