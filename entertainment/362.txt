The Central Board of Film Certification censored the dialogue "Glory to Hanuman" by the character M'Baku, leader of Jabari tribe, from the film 'Black Panther'. Fans speculated it was done to avoid hurting sentiments because the tribe worships the gorilla god. While the gorilla god was called 'Man-Ape' in the comics, the word was changed to Hanuman in the film.
