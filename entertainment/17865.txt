Hardcore hackers Tuesday took over American singer Taylor Swift's Twitter account and threatened to release her nude pictures. The hackers posted tweets on Taylor's account, telling her 71 million plus followers to follow @lizzard and @veriuser - both of whom claim to have ties to a group of hackers called the Lizard Squad.
