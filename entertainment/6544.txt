Actress Manisha Koirala, while talking about being approached to play Nargis Dutt, said, "My first reaction was, 'What? I have to play Baba's (Sanjay Dutt) mother now?'" Manisha added, "I was always a tomboy on the set when shooting with Baba. I had my reservations as I would end up playing mother's roles. I know how the industry functions."
