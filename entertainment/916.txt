Karan Johar jokingly called Amitabh Bachchan's daughter Shweta Bachchan Nanda "nepotism ki brand ambassador and dukaan" while describing her as "Amitabh Bachchan ki beti. Jaya Bachchan ki beti. Abhishek Bachchan ki behen." When Shweta failed to name Bollywood's most overrated actor on a chat show, Karan said she wouldn't respond as she needed to remain politically correct being Amitabh's daughter.
