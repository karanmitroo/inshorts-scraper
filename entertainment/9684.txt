Actress Gul Panag has said the notion that women are not good drivers comes from a strong stereotypical conditioning. "Statistically, women are...better drivers...[T]here are lesser women involved in accidents than men but it's also because there are lesser drivers," she added. Gul further said the conditioning begins at a young age where girls are told to do only certain things.
