Disney has been criticised for casting Naomi Scott, who is of British-Indian descent, to portray Princess Jasmine in the live-action version of Aladdin. "All these Arab actresses...and they cast half-white, half-Indian Naomi Scott as Jasmine. Indian isn't middle-eastern, Hollywood," tweeted a user. "I don't love the "brown ppl are interchangeable" idea that H'wood believes in," wrote another user.
