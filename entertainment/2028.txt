Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, while talking about Rajkummar Rao, has said that the actor is a "gift". "We have been working together for quite some time now, and every time he works with me, or plays different characters, he has always surprised me," he added. Mehta has directed Rao in films like 'CityLights', 'Aligarh' and 'Omerta'.
