Grammy and National Award winning music composer AR Rahman has released the first music video of his new band NAFS. The band will be powered by an online multi-channel network Qyuki, founded by Rahman, Shekhar Kapur and Samir Bangara. "NAFS is a deep and a beautiful word with different meanings. It could be something that's whacky and naughty," said Rahman.
