A deleted nude scene from the film Dandupalya 2, which shows Kannada actress Sanjjanaa Galrani being physically abused by jail authorities, has been leaked online. The scene was reportedly deleted following objections by the regional censor board. Sanjjanaa said, "We are figuring out who is behind the leak and will give a complete clarification once director Srinivasa Raju...returns."
