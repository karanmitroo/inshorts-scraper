'King of Pop' Michael Jackson, along with two co-inventors, patented the 'anti-gravity' shoes, most famously used in the music video 'Smooth Criminal'. The shoes had specially designed heel pegs that would connect to the stage, allowing Jackson to lean forward at a 45-degree angle. Notably, today is Michael Jackson's 58th birth anniversary.
