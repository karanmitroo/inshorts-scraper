Director Shonali Bose's film "Margarita with a Straw", starring Kalki Koechlin, was cleared by the Censor Board with just one cut, said an elated Shonali. The Board changed its decision to cut a peeing shot of the lead character, and also a 12-second kissing scene between Kalki and her lesbian lover. However, it cut a 16-second straight couple sex scene.
