Singer Sona Mahapatra, who was recently abused on Twitter by Salman Khan's fans for speaking against the actor's 'rape' remarks, on Thursday called Salman a "thug". Claiming she has received threats to be put out of work, Sona wrote in a Facebook post, "Who will put us out of 'work'?? Salman Khan??!! That 'talented' (!?) thug? I don't think so".
