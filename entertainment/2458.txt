According to reports, American producer Harvey Weinstein hired highly trained ex-spies, journalists and military personnel who used fake identities to try to stop accusers from going public with sexual misconduct claims against him. Weinstein and his team reportedly compiled psychological profiles of the accusers with their personal or sexual histories in order to discredit them.
