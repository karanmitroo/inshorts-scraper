A student from Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad sent an invitation to Abhishek Bachchan's parody account on Twitter, mistaking it for his real account. The parody account received an invitation to be the Keynote speaker for a college event. "Read my Twitter bio and don't tear your CAT scorecard and your degree after that," read the reply from the account.
