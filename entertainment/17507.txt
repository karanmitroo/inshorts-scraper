Actor Aamir Khan on Wednesday lashed out at the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), saying he is totally against banning any kind of material in media or films. The censor board had recently sparked a controversy after it came up with the list of 28 'banned' objectionable words. However, CBFC chairman Pahlaj Nihalani withdrew the list later.
