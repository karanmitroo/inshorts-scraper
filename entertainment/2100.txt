The producer of 'Aksar 2' has said he's planning to sue Zareen Khan for her remarks against the film's makers. Zareen had said she was asked to wear minimal clothes and the duration of kissing scenes was increased for no reason. "All the clothes were approved by her....[And] a few kisses do not make a film erotic," said the makers.
