A clip of US President Barack Obama singing 'Amazing Grace' will be used as an interlude by British rock band 'Coldplay' in their new album 'A Head Full of Dreams'. Obama sang the gospel anthem earlier this year at the funeral of Charleston shooting victim Clementa C Pinckney. 'A Head Full of Dreams' is scheduled to release on December 4.
