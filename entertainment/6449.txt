The Shraddha Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor starrer Half Girlfriend "is confused, forced and takes the audience for granted," wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV called the film "a preposterously dimwitted romance, irresponsible enough to lead on many a stalker-to-be" while Times of India wrote the film is "thoda fun and largely exasperating". It was rated 2/5 (HT), 1/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (TOI).
