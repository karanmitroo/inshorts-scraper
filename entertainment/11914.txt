Filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has revealed that he changed the climax of the 2006 Aamir Khan starrer 'Rang De Basanti', a week ahead of its release. The original climax was supposed to show thousands of students on the streets for the funeral procession of the dead students. Mehra changed it as the audience seemed unhappy during the initial test screenings.
