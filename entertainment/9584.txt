Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he would like to be a parent as he has immense love to offer. "I don't know in what capacity, I don't know how it's going to happen," added Johar. He revealed that he realised about his nurturing quality when he launched Alia Bhatt, Sidharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan in 'Student of the Year'.
