Actor Annu Kapoor, who will feature in 'Jolly LLB 2' with Akshay Kumar, has said that the actor is the most commercially viable superstar of this era. "Akshay is the most saleable...trade analysts have declared," he added. Annu further said that bringing more star power to 'Jolly LLB 2' as compared to 'Jolly LLB' shouldn't be considered a crime.
