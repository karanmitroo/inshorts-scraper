Kirron Kher, who portrayed Abhishek Bachchan's mother in 'Dostana', has said that she was supposed to play a gay rights activist in the film's sequel, which had been planned but didn't materialise. "My character (was) to join politics and (run) something of her own," added Kirron. 'Dostana' completed nine years of its release on Tuesday.
