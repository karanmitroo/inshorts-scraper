Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui will be portraying Pakistan's short story writer Saadat Hassan Manto in filmmaker Nandita Das's upcoming biopic titled 'Manto'. "I was drawn to the interesting challenge of doing a period drama," said Siddiqui. Meanwhile, Das said that her project is not a "cradle-to-grave biopic" but will cover a period of seven years between 1946 and 1952.
