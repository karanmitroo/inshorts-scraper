Actress Radhika Apte has said that the nude scene from 'Parched', which features her and Adil Hussain does not "bother" her "at all" as she is not "ashamed" of her body. "[My body] is the one tool I use as a performer. I had no apprehensions doing bold scenes... I am very comfortable with my body," added Apte.
