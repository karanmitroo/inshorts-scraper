Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali has said that he, Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma wouldn't have been in films if they had faced nepotism. Imtiaz added he was welcomed with love and support when he joined films. Anushka said, "I've been launched by a banner like Yash Raj Films. They do not put anything before a new talent. That's their priority."
