The X-Men star, Hugh Jackman, was recently treated for his third basal cell carcinoma (skin cancer) in 12 months. This type of cancer is usually entirely treatable, but only if it's caught early enough. The Australian hunk had a basal cell carcinoma removed in November 2013 as well as in May of this year.
