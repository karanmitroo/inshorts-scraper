Jackie Chan, who received an honorary Oscar in 2016 said he didn't go to the Oscars and it is the Oscars that came to him. "(My films were considered) cheap action comedy movies. I don't care as I am not for awards, I am for the audience," he added. Chan further said one should always continue to give his best.
