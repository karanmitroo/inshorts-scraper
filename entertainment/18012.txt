Censor Board chief Leela Samson Tuesday defended the decision to give clearance to Aamir Khan starrer 'PK'. "Our job is to certify. That we have done. We are not a censorship board. Political or ideological groups may advice their followers not to watch it," Samson said. Right-wing activists have demanded a ban on the movie claiming it hurts religious sentiments.
