Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that nothing affects him as he has survived seven years of ban and seen more professional and personal failures in his life than most people. "I keep doing what I want to do," said Kashyap. Notably, 'Udta Punjab', which is being co-produced by Kashyap's Phantom Films has been facing certification issues with the Censor Board.
