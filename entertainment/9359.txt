The mother of the man, who died in a stampede caused by actor Shah Rukh Khan's visit to the Vadodara railway station for promoting 'Raees', has said that SRK is like her son. She added, "We have nothing against SRK as he is not at fault. My son fell prey to the crowd and succumbed to death due to suffocation."
