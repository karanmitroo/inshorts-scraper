Miss Philippines, Megan Young, was crowned Miss World 2013 on Saturday amid tight security on Indonesia's resort island of Bali, with Miss France and Miss Ghana finishing second and third respectively. With contestants from 129-countries vying for the crown, it was the biggest turnout in the pageant's history. India's Navneet Kaur Dhillon failed to make it past the top 20.
