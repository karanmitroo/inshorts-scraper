Actress Richa Chadha, while supporting Deepika Padukone starrer 'Padmavati', said, "I do not think our culture and religion is so fragile that a film of two hours can ruin that." "We're living in a democratic country where we have an appointed board that certifies our film, I see no reason for commenting on a film without watching it," she added.
