Denying reports that a modification suggested by the Central Board of Film Certification resulted in 300 cuts in 'Padmavati', CBFC Chairman Prasoon Joshi said it is absolutely untrue. He added, "CBFC's process is complete... Let's refrain from utilising CBFC's name unnecessarily." Prasoon also said the film has already been submitted with the five modifications that the Board suggested previously.
