'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' actor Eddie Redmayne has said he is a "proud Hufflepuff," in an MTV public service announcement. He says, "Hufflepuffs have been victimised," adding that he sees loyalty and hard work in them. He adds, "Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is a Hufflepuff... also, Hufflepuff is JK Rowling's favourite house, so frankly, f**k you."
