Abhishek Bachchan has said that nasty things written about his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's weight gain after she gave birth to their daughter Aaradhya really upset him. "'Water off a duck's back,' said Aishwarya when she saw me perturbed," he added. Abhishek further said, "Anyone who knows her would know that she has never spent a day in the gym."
