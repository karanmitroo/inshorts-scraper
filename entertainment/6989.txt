The premiere of 'Baahubali 2', scheduled to be held on Thursday, was cancelled after actor Vinod Khanna's demise earlier in the day. Karan Johar, who is the distributor of the Hindi version of the film, announced it on Twitter. "His screen presence is unparalleled even today...his superstar swag is what we grew up on," tweeted Karan about the late actor.
