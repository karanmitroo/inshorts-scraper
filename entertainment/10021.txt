Actor Rishi Kapoor's autobiography titled, 'Khullam Khulla', will release on January 15, 2017. "...This one's from the heart, my life and times, as I lived it," Rishi tweeted, while sharing the cover of the book. Notably, the book's title has been borrowed from the song 'Khullam Khulla Pyar Karenge Hum Dono' from Rishi's 1975 film 'Khel Khel Mein'.
