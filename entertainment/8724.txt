Actor Varun Dhawan has said that he wants to apologise to choreographer Saroj Khan for not inviting her to any promotional activity related to the remake of 'Tamma Tamma' song from his film 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania'. He added, "She has the rights to get upset with us." The song, from 1990 film 'Thanedaar', was originally choreographed by Saroj Khan.
