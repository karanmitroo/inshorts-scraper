This year, fans of late American singer Elvis Presley were charged $28.75 (â‚¹1,845) to visit his grave to mark his 40th death anniversary on Wednesday. The money was charged for a wristband that visitors were required to have in order to visit the grave. Several visitors were reportedly angry with this, with some saying they will not attend another vigil.
