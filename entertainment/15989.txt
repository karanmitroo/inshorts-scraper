'Hate Story 3' which released on Friday, has so many twists that one stops caring about them after a point, wrote India Today. "It is the tale of two very, very crabby men who hate each other with all their guts and hatch silly conspiracies," said NDTV. The film has been rated 2/5 (India Today) and 1/5 (NDTV and Koimoi).
