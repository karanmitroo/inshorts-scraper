The con-artist comedy "American Hustle" and the 3-D space odyssey "Gravity" lead the Academy Awards with 10 nominations each, with the historical epic "12 Years a Slave" trailing closely with nine nominations. The nominations announced Thursday set up a race between three very different films, all of which were nominated for best picture. The awards will be announced on Mar-2.
