Actress Sridevi has denied reports of her younger daughter Khushi Kapoor auditioning for a television dance reality show. "The other day, we were laughing at the rumour," added Sridevi. It was reported that Khushi auditioned for Remo D'Souza's dance show and didn't reveal her identity. Reportedly, she wasn't recognised until she performed before Remo.
