Chennai-based data management startup Fyndus has declared a holiday on July 22, on the account of release of actor Rajinikanth's movie 'Kabali'. The move is an effort to avoid piled up leave requests to the human resources department for the day. The startup is also providing free movie tickets to all of its employees to support anti-piracy.
