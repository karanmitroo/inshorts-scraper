American actor Neil Patrick Harris, while speaking on Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalises homosexual acts, said it is surprising that oppression still exists in 2016. "[T]here are so many examples... of the LGBTQ community representing well, and certainly not wreaking havoc," he added. Harris further said he hopes this "generational way of thinking" becomes archaic soon.
