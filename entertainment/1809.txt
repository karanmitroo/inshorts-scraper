Actress Sonakshi Sinha said that men in Bollywood are more insecure and also gossip more than the women in the industry. Sonakshi said this while talking about rumours of catfight with her 'Happy Bhaag Jayegi Returns' co-star Diana Penty. "I don't understand why that's said only about heroines...They (men) are the ones who gossip the most," added Sonakshi.
