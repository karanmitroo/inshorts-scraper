Anil Kapoor has said that he has always tried to reinvent, experiment and take risks in his 35-year-long career. "It has been my constant endeavour to do different things. And luck always favours the brave," he added. The actor, who turned 60 on Saturday, will make his digital debut with Amazon's sci-fi web series 'The Book Of Strange New Things'.
