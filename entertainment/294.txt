A complaint has been filed against singer Papon for allegedly molesting a minor girl on the sets of the reality show 'The Voice India Kids'. In a video clip, he can be seen applying colour on the contestant's face and then kissing her, allegedly by force. However, the singer's lawyer has denied the allegations and called the video misleading.
