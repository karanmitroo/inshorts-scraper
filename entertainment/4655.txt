Filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane, while dismissing rumours of a split in Phantom Films, has said that all the four co-founders Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Madhu Mantena and Vikas Bahl are still together in the production house. He also dismissed rumours of them making films, whether it is Kashyap's 'Mukkabaaz' or Mantena's Ramayana film trilogy, with banners other than Phantom Films.
