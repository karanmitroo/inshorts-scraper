Filmmaker Karan Razdan has said that actress Sunny Leone is willing to star in his upcoming film which has been inspired by the life of yesteryear actress Meena Kumari. "She is not the ideal choice, I would say. But she was the most enthusiastic about doing the role. I guess, she also saw this as her big chance," added Razdan.
