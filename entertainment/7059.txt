Actress Soni Razdan, while addressing rumours about her daughter Alia Bhatt dating Sidharth Malhotra, asked why Alia cannot have a nice social life. "Nobody is saying she is wasting her time with Sidharth and coming late on the sets or going early," she added. Soni further said when Alia is free, it is her choice how she spends her time.
