Singer Arijit Singh has said that this might be his last year in Bollywood. The singer said that every five to seven years in Bollywood, it is normal for "fresh voices" to replace current favourites. However, he added, "I might be able to change that. If I work really hard on specific genres, I might be able to stay longer."
