Singer Justin Bieber has purchased a €5 million (about $5.66 million) villa on the Lanzarote island in the Atlantic Ocean, after holidaying there with his rumoured girlfriend Sofia Richie. Real estate consulting firm Proto Group said Bieber paid €800,000 (about $905,520) more than the asking price of the villa. The 2,000-square-metre six-bedroom property offers direct access to the sea.
