Reacting to Shobhaa De’s tweet on the Indian Rio contingent “wasting money and clicking selfies”, a user tweeted, “Goal of Shobhaa De: Online aao. Tweet something senseless. Gaali khao, wapas jao.” Other tweets read, “India's shooting and archery teams can use Shobhaa De as target practice,” and, “#ShobhaDe what a waste of flesh and bones.”
