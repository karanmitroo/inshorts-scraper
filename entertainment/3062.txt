Akshay Kumar deleted his tweet in which he called manual scavengers 'cleaning soldiers of India' after being slammed for it. "I wonder how can anyone applaud manual scavenging. It's illegal!" commented a Twitter user. "What they are doing is against their civil rights," wrote another user. "Means you wish to continue manual scavenge? This is also 'untouchability'," read another comment.
