'Julie 2' actress Raai Laxmi, on being questioned about her ex-boyfriend cricketer MS Dhoni, jokingly asked, "Who's he?" She added, "This needs to have a full stop. It was a long time ago, he (Dhoni) is happily married now, he has kids." She further said that when certain things don't work out in life, one has to move on.
