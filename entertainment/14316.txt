John Boyega, who played the character of stormtrooper 'Finn' in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', has said that 'Star Wars: Episode VIII' will be "darker" and "bigger" as director Rian Johnson has a "different take" on it. Speaking about 'Finn' and Daisy Ridley's character​ 'Rey', Boyega added, "The romance... is something that’s going to be interesting in the next instalment."
