Actress Asha Parekh on Thursday said Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's claim that she "chased" him for the Padma Bhushan was "hurtful". "It was not the right thing for him to do...It didn't matter to me...Controversies are a part of the film industry," she added. Parekh told me she was entitled to the award for her contributions, Gadkari had claimed.
