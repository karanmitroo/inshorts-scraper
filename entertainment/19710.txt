An up-and-coming channel 'End Films' has reportedly bought the satellite rights of 'Chennai Express' for Rs.48-crore. Moreover, the company will cough up more money depending upon multiple predefined slabs north of Rs.100-crore, if the movie crosses the Rs.100-crore mark. Interestingly, this is the first time ever that a film's satellite rights have been sold with such a pre-condition.
