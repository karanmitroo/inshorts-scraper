Anupam Kher has said it's difficult for stars to carry a film on sheer star power and one has to deliver a good story. "I wouldn't say the lull is happening only now...[Back then] if there was a blockbuster like 'Sholay' there was a film like 'Immaan Dharam' (starring Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor), which was a flop," he added.
