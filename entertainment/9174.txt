Actress Kangana Ranaut, while commenting on patriarchy, said that men think intimidating women are not worth having sex with. "Bold, stubborn women, who are achievers, are desirable only to those who are strong and assured. (For some men) it's frightening to handle a woman who can speak her mind," added Kangana. However, she added, "Thankfully, that's not true of everyone."
