Actress Raveena Tandon asked on Twitter if she will be termed communal, Sanghi, bhakt, or a Hindutva icon for wearing a saree. Following this, she was trolled and one user described her tweet as "unnecessary politicisation of a piece of clothing". Later, Raveena tweeted that she didn't intend to hurt anyone and added, "My saree comment came keeping...trolling in mind."
