Filmmaker Shirish Kunder has filed a legal notice against Nepali filmmaker Aneel Neupane and sought an apology from Neupane for claiming that his short film 'Kriti' was a copy of Neupane's Nepali film. Kunder in his notice claims that the shooting for Kriti was completed in February and has counter-accused Neupane that he could have copied his film from 'Kriti'.
