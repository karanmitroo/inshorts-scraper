Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt has penned an open letter on Facebook to his daughter Krishna, who will make her directing debut with a "web original", in which he wrote, "You're the product of nepotism and that's fine." Bhatt added, "But nepotism will only give an opportunity and not success." He further wrote that success depends on talent and not opportunity.
