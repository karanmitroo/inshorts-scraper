Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif starrer 'Tiger Zinda Hai', which released on Friday, "is surely the most entertaining fare of 2017," wrote Koimoi. The film "could have done with more sense and subtlety," said NDTV while The Times of India (TOI) wrote, "This Tiger is alive and kicking". It has been rated 2/5 (NDTV), 3.5/5 (TOI) and 4/5 (Koimoi).
