Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman on Thursday said that she does not think Hollywood is an “even playing field” for women. The 47-year-old superstar reportedly said that women are given too few opportunities to demonstrate their talent. She further added,“We’re all working and banding together and trying to change that and that’s what’s needed".
