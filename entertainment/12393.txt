Actor Amitabh Bachchan has revealed that actress Deepika Padukone was paid higher than him for the film 'Piku'. "That says two things â€“ one that she is obviously more important than me and two I have lost my price tag (because) I have been working for so long. Maybe I am not so important," added the 73-year-old actor.
