While shooting a sequence for his upcoming film Kick, actor Salman Khan was required to hang from the 40th floor of “Palace of Culture and Science” - the tallest building in Poland. To the shock of everyone, Salman chose to do this scene himself without a body double. The entire sequence took around 5 hours to complete.
