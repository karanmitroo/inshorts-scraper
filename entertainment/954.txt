Karni Sena has threatened to not allow CBFC Chairman Prasoon Joshi to enter the upcoming Jaipur Literature Festival, which is scheduled to be held starting January 25. This comes after Joshi had passed Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmaavat' despite objections from the Rajput group. Joshi is scheduled to participate in the session 'Main aur Woh: Conversations with Myself' at the festival.
