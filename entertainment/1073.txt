Following a pay disparity row, actor Mark Wahlberg has agreed to donate $1.5 million (â‚¹9 crore) in his co-star Michelle Williams' name to Time's Up, which aims to fight harassment and gender inequality. "I...support the fight for fair pay," said Wahlberg. Michelle reportedly earned less than 1% of Wahlberg's pay for the reshoot of 'All the Money in the World'.
