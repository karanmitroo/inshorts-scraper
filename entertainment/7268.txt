Actor Uday Chopra tweeted that if fairness creams are racist, so is hair colour. This comes after Abhay Deol recently slammed Bollywood actors, including Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor for endorsing fairness creams and called such campaigns "racist". Uday further tweeted, "[Using fairness creams] is a self esteem issue. Don't [use them] if you think you're fine!"
