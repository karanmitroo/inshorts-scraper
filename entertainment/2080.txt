Actor Prakash Raj has sent a legal notice to BJP MP Pratap Simha for 'trolling' him over his remarks on journalist Gauri Lankesh's murder. Prakash has also threatened that he'll take criminal action against Simha if he doesn't reply to the notice. Simha had made personal remarks against Prakash after the latter questioned PM Narendra Modi's silence over Lankesh's murder.
