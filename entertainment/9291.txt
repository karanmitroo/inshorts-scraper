'Raees' and 'Kaabil' are likely to release in Pakistan on Monday, following the signing of a policy on the release of Bollywood films in Pakistan, by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Under the policy, once a film is imported the distributor will have it reviewed by the Ministry of Information and Censor Board before it is released in theatres.
