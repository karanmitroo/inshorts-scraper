Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was the first Bollywood actor to have his wax statue placed in the Madame Tussauds museum in London in 2000. His statues were later installed in branches at New York, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Washington DC. Amitabh Bachchan, who is also considered the first Asian actor to achieve the feat, turned 74 on Tuesday.
