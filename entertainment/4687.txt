The Maharashtra government reiterated on Thursday that no rules were broken in releasing actor Sanjay Dutt in the 1993 blasts case. It said that although no norms were flouted in remitting Dutt's sentence, the court could order him to be "sent back to jail". However, the court said it had "no such intention", and only needed affirmation in the case.
