Kangana Ranaut has said that several of her top-notch scenes have been cut from the film 'Rangoon'. She added, "I didn't think (I'll be appreciated this much) because many of my favourite scenes, which were important for my graph, were chopped off." However, Kangana said that the cuts were legitimate as Rangoon's director Vishal Bhardwaj explained why it was necessary.
