Singer Selena Gomez has donated money to the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine for its research on lupus disease. "I am hopeful for the millions of us around the world that may benefit from this," she said. Last year, Gomez had announced "some time off" from her career to deal with the side-effects of the autoimmune disease.
