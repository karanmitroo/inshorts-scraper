Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has said India will become like America only when actor Rajinikanth becomes the Prime Minister of the country. He added that India will then rise from "2.zero to 200.zero" while referring to Rajinikanth's upcoming release '2.0'. Rajinikanth had earlier announced that he will be entering politics with his own party.
