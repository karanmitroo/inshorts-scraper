Parineeti Chopra has said the biggest myth that people believe about actors is that they throw tantrums. "Actors are humble pies. They have to put themselves out there and the public scrutinises them," she added. Parineeti further said, "We have to be careful about everything we do. Our lives are demanding and not the same as a commoner's life."
