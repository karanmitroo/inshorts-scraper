R&B artist Jessie Braham has reportedly sued pop-star Taylor Swift for $42 million over the lyrics of 'Shake it Off', claiming that the song "borrows heavily" from a song he wrote in 2013. The song that he wrote is titled “Haters Gone Hate”. Braham has also demanded that his name be added to any new releases of 'Shake it Off'.
