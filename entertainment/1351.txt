Celebrity contestant Priyank Sharma has been evicted from the reality show Bigg Boss 11. "I'm only looking at the positives, now," said Priyank. He further said, "2017 has turned out to be a wonderful year for me... Three popular shows - Splitsvilla, Roadies and then Bigg Boss happened, and changed my life completely. From nothing, I have become something."
