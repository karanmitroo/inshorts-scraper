As per reports, actor Amitabh Bachchan has replaced Sanjay Dutt in the Siddharth Anand directorial 'Badlaa'. It was supposed to be Dutt's first film after being released from prison, but he opted out of the project citing creative differences. Anand, who last directed 2014 film 'Bang Bang!', will reportedly cast Disha Patani or Kriti Sanon as the female lead.
