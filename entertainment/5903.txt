Tom Cruise's 'The Mummy', which released on Friday, "is a ragbag of action scenes which needed to be bandaged more tightly", wrote The Guardian. "There's enough gruesome eye candy, and in-your-face action to enjoy...if you ignore the plot holes", wrote TOI. Hindustan Times said, "[The film] is sexist....characters are poorly written". It was rated 3/5 (TOI), 0.5/5 (HT).
