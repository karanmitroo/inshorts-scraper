Yoga guru Baba Ramdev carried actor Ranveer Singh over his shoulders and spun around while on stage at the event 'Agenda Aaj Tak 2016' on Tuesday night. During a session at the event, Ranveer invited Ramdev to join him on stage and the two started doing yoga poses together. They were also part of a friendly push-up challenge.
