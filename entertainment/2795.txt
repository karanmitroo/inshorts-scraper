Television actor Ram Kapoor has been approached to play a character inspired by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in an upcoming web film reportedly titled 'Casting Couch Ouch'. "The Weinstein episode is just as relevant here. I think the casting couch still exists in Bollywood," said film's director Shailendra Singh. Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault by over 30 women.
