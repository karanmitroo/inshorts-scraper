Lyricist Javed Akhtar, while slamming the silence of Pakistani actors on the Uri attack said that their silence was a "confession" that Pakistan was responsible for the attack. "I don't see any reason any Pakistani artiste should not condemn it. If they say, 'We are not responsible' then very good, come out and condemn it," added Akhtar.
