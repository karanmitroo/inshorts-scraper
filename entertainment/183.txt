BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said the facts reported in the media about actress Sridevi's death were inconsistent and that he thought it was a murder. Adding that Sridevi never drank hard liquor, Swamy questioned reports that traces of alcohol were found in her blood. The Dubai Police said Sridevi died due to "accidental drowning" in her hotel room's bathtub.
