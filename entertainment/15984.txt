Bollywood film 'Angry Indian Goddesses' which released on Friday is a decent watch if the expectations are kept in check, wrote Hindustan Times. "The film's pace is a problem and though things gear up in the second half, it ends as a loopy mess," said TOI. The Pan Nalin directorial has been rated 2.5/5 by HT, TOI and Indian Express.
