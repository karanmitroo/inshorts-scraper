Hollywood actor Eddie Redmayne has revealed that he "never" went out on a date with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. "We got to sing together (during 'Les Misérables' audition), which was a big moment for me. But no, we never went out," Redmayne said. Rumours of Redmayne dating Swift surfaced after they auditioned together for 'Les Misérables' in 2011.
