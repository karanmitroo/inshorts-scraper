Actress Kajol, while speaking about her equation with her co-stars in 1990s, said, "We were all drinking buddies. We knew each others' families, wives, and children." She added that the scenario has changed today and it's more about the individual as a brand. "There are a lot of insecurities and considerations to take into account now," added Kajol.
