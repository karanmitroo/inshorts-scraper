Actor Rishi Kapoor is facing outrage on micro-blogging platform Twitter for joking about actress Huma Qureshiâ€™s weight. Rishi wished Huma on Tuesday by tweeting, "Happy Happy Birthday dear @humasqureshi. God Bless" with an image which read, "The more you weigh, the harder you are to kidnap.. Stay safe.. Eat cake!" Following the flak, Rishi apologised and then retracted his tweet.
