Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that she can do backless scenes comfortably without using nipple sticking tapes. "I was lying on my stomach naked as I was giving a bare back shot. They wanted me to put tape around the body... It was just a back shot I don't know what was the fuss about," said Kangana.
