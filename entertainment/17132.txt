Bollywood power-family, the Bachchans, have reportedly made their first significant overseas equity investment by buying a minority stake in Meridian Tech Pte, Singapore, which owns ziddu.com, a free cloud storage and e-distribution startup. The Bachchans reportedly wanted to invest $500,000, but with government's maximum permissible amount at $125,000 per person per year, they invested $252,000.
