Actress-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt, while discussing the controversy where actresses accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of rape and sexual harassment, tweeted, "Many Weinsteins within Bollywood." She added that while the Oscars board expelled producer Harvey Weinstein with immediate effect over the allegations, producers associations in India have no unity and do nothing to protect workers.
