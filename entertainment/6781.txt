Deepika Padukone, while reacting to the criticism she received for her Met Gala outfit, said, "I am not dressing for you, my love. I am dressing for myself." "Sometimes you may like my look... sometimes you may not," she added. Deepika further said it's not about what celebrities are wearing but it's about the opportunity of being at the event.
