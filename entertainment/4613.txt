Actor Rana Daggubati, while speaking about Hyderabad drug racket case, has said he isn't bothered about actors taking drugs as they're adults, but he's worried about school children taking drugs. "When youngsters who don't have a mind of their own are doing drugs, it scares me," he added. Rana further said it's something that needs to be taken more seriously.
