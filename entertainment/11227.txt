As per reports, television actress Mona Singh was approached to play an Indian character on the American television series 'The Good Wife'. However, she is said to have turned it down as it clashed with the dates of her other commitments in India. Mona was reportedly offered the role to replace the character 'Kalinda Sharma', earlier played by Archie Panjabi.
