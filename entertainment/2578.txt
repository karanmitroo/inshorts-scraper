Tamil Nadu Police has arrested a youth, allegedly a fan of actor Vijay, for posting derogatory comments about PM Narendra Modi on his Facebook profile. The accused had written that the PM was "roaming around the country and will be taught a lesson". This comes after the BJP objected to scenes in Vijay-starrer 'Mersal' that mocked GST and Digital India.
