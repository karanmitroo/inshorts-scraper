Irrfan Khan and Deepika Padukone's next film will be directed by filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj. Earlier, it was supposed to be directed by Honey Trehan, who was an assistant director in Bhardwaj's 'Omkara'. Bhardwaj said, "Due to different artistic visions of the film, Honey and I...came to the decision that it would be best if I took over as director."
