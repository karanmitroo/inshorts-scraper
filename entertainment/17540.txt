Veteran Bollywood actor Shatrughan Sinha has come forward in support of the Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalaniâ€™s ban on cuss words saying, "I can't understand why we need to have gaalis for the villain to get taalis." Sinha, who himself played a villain in many films, added, "In my entire career as a villain, I never used one cuss word."
