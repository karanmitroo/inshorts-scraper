Actress Katrina Kaif has revealed that actor Salman Khan started laughing, when he saw her weep after she was chucked out of a film. "I started to think he's so mean," added Katrina. "Salman later calmed me down saying this doesn't mean anything, [and said] just keep your focus and work hard," said Katrina.
