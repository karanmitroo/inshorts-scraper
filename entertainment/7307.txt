'Begum Jaan', starring Vidya Balan, will not be allowed to release in Pakistan over the country's policy of not permitting the import of films which deal with the issue of partition. The film's producer Mukesh Bhatt said he requested the censor board of Pakistan to at least view the film and take a decision but has not heard from them.
