Researchers at the University of Leeds have created a "virtually immortalized" chatbox or digital version of 'Friends' character Joey Tribbiani that can generate new sentences in his style. The team built a series of algorithms that can recognize individual characters, capturing their body language, facial expressions and voice. The team plans to expand the technique to other characters.
