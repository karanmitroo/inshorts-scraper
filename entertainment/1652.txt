A co-passenger of the teen Bollywood actress who said she was molested by a middle-aged man on a flight has claimed that the alleged molester is innocent. "His fault was he kept his legs on the armrest, which was wrong. I did not see him misbehaving. He also apologised when the actor shouted at him," the passenger added.
