Raju Mahalingam, the Creative Head of Lyca Productions which is producing Rajinikanth starrer '2.0', has resigned from his post to join Rajinikanth's newly announced party. "Rajinikanth is known for his simplicity, honesty and straight-forwardness. I think that's the need of the hour," he said. Raju added he has registered just as a party member and doesn't hold any position yet.
