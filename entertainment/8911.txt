Actor Hrithik Roshan, when asked about being spotted often with former wife Sussanne Khan and their sons, said that they are not trying to set any example. He added, "This is how we are. Relationships should be healthy, mutually beneficial and adding growth to both the parties." The former couple officially divorced in 2014 after a nearly 14-year long marriage.
