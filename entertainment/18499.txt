The Delhi High Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by an NGO, seeking a ban on the film 'Finding Fanny'. The NGO had also asked the makers to remove the word 'fanny' from the film and posters. The court declared that, there is nothing wrong with the word or the title and refused to further stay its release on Friday.
