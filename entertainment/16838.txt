Indian epic film 'Bahubali' that released on Friday has 'out of the ordinary quality of VFX, occasionally gripping content and pretty strong final impact', said NDTV. The film, starring Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Tamannaah and Anushka Shetty, ends up being all sound and spectacle, said HT. The SS Rajamouli directorial has been rated 2/5 (HT), 3/5 (NDTV) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
