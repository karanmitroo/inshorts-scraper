Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam has announced that he will honour Saleem Mirza, the bus driver of last week's Amarnath attack, with â‚¹5 lakh as a reward. "Such people are always given a bravery award or medal for their actions by the government. But they should be financially rewarded for their goodness and amazing presence of mind," he said.
