'Kashmir Daily' is the first Kashmiri language film released in 30 years, however, there are no movie halls to screen it in Kashmir. The Valley has had no cinema halls since 1989 when the outfit 'Allah Tigers' banned them and threatened those operating them. It is being screened in a Srinagar event hall three times daily from May 23-26.
