Overruling its Wednesday order, the Delhi High Court Thursday cleared the release of Madhuri Dixit starrer "Gulaab Gang". The filmmakers of "Gulaab Gang", set to release on Friday, assured the bench that they will run a disclaimer that the movie is not based on the life of activist Sampat Pal (who formed the real life ‘Gulabi Gang’) and her work.
