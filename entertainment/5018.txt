Actor Ranbir Kapoor has said he doesn't have the frankness which his father Rishi Kapoor has. Ranbir added, "He's so honest, which is admirable. If there's a political question at a press conference, I'll have a hypocritical answer...but he won't." Ranbir further said that Rishi has an opinion on everything which gets blown out of proportion as he's an actor.
