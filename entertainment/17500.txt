Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie Tuesday announced in the New York Times that she has had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed over fears of cancer. "I lost my mother, grandmother and aunt to cancer," she wrote. Jolie carries a gene mutation that gave her an 87% risk of developing breast cancer and a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer.
