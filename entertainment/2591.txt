Vidya Balan, who starred in the recreated version of 'Hawa Hawai', has said she wasn't sure about the song because she thought it was suicide. "Then the director made me understand...we're not recreating her performance...we're just paying a tribute," added Vidya. She further said Sridevi's performance in 'Mr India', which featured the original song, was an encyclopedia on acting.
