'Kehdoon Tumhen' song from 'Deewaar' which was recreated as 'Socha Hai' for the Emraan Hashmi and Ajay Devgn starrer 'Baadshaho' has been removed over copyright issue with producer Rajiv Rai of Trimurti Films. Rai, whose Trimurti Films owned the rights to the lyrics and music of 'Kehdoon Tumhen', filed a case against T-Series for remixing the song without official permission.
