Robert Downey Jr walked out of an interview with British TV presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy while promoting "Avengers: Age of Ultron". The actor got angry when Guru-Murthy asked questions about his past drug addiction. Downey Jr found this inappropriate in a promotional interview of a super-hero movie that would have a child audience. The actor then called Guru-Murthy a "bottom-feeding muckraker".
