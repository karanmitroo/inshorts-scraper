The Haryana government has banned the screening of the Arshad Warsi, Aditi Rao Hydari and Boman Irani starrer 'The Legend of Michael Mishra' in the state. A government spokesperson said that Arshad Warsi has in a scene uttered "objectionable words which have the potential to outrage the religious feelings of the Valmiki community". Earlier, the film was banned in Punjab.
