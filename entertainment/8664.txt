British naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough will be narrating BBC's 'Blue Planet II', a seven-episode series on marine life. The series, which will air this year, contains footage that was filmed over four years. Latest marine technology, including two unmanned submersibles, allowed the production team to record footage from 1,000 metres under the Antarctic Ocean.
