Actor Varun Dhawan has said that the decision made to ban his film 'Dishoom' in Pakistan is wrong. He tweeted, â€œReally upset that #Dishoom is banned in Pakistan. I don't think the film eventually shows any country in a bad light." Pakistan reportedly banned 'Dishoom' as the country's censor board felt that the film showed Pakistan in a bad light.
