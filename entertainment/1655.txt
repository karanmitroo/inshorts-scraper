The Central Board of Film Censors (CBFC) of Pakistan has refused to grant the No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to 'Tiger Zinda Hai'. The board's Chairman said, "The image of Pakistan and its law enforcement agencies has been compromised (in the film)". He added the franchise's first instalment 'Ek Tha Tiger' was also not granted the NOC due to the same reason.
