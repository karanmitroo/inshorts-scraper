Oscar winning director Woody Allen has said that he never molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. His response was after Dylan's first public TV interview about how he allegedly molested her when she was seven. Woody added the Farrow family was using the 'Time's Up' movement to repeat this allegation, which was discredited after thorough investigation over 25 years ago.
