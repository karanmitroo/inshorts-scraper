The host of the 2017 Oscars, Jimmy Kimmel, sent two tweets to US President Donald Trump while on stage. "Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?" Kimmel wrote in his first tweet, while his second tweet read, "@realDonaldTrump #Merylsayshi". Kimmel also took a dig at Trump's immigration ban in an opening monologue by thanking him for making the awards less racist.
