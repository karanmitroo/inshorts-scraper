The Chopra sisters Priyanka and Parineeti are set to clash at box office with the release of their respective films 'Zanjeer' and 'Shuddh Desi Romance' on September 6. "She is my sister, my family. It is very cheap when people try to create controversy... It is Chopra weekend and people must enjoy it," Priyanka told reporters at an event on Wednesday evening.
