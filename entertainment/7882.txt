Shahid Kapoor has said that it's beneficial having a wife who's not in the same profession as the husband. He added, "Too much of the same thing can lead to monotony or lack of perspective. You tend to live in a bubble. Your exposure is limited." Shahid added that his wife Mira offers him a different viewpoint on numerous topics.
