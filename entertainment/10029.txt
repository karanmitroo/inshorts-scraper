Shakti Kapoor has denied reports of forcing his daughter Shraddha Kapoor to move out from rumoured boyfriend Farhan Akhtar's house. "It's shit news. Shraddha and I are laughing over it," he added. He added that all this news doesn't affect him at all. Earlier, news reports claimed that Shakti barged into Farhan’s apartment, and “dragged” Shraddha back to his home.
