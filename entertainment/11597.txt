Actor and filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, known for directing the 1994 film 'Bandit Queen', has been named the president of the jury for the first International Film Festival and Awards at Macau, a Chinese autonomous territory. "I'm excited to be chairing the Macau Film Festival as Indian storytelling has so much in common with Chinese forms of storytelling," said Shekhar.
