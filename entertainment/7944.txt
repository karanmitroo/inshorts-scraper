Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he would marry Shah Rukh Khan, if given the choice to kill, marry or hook-up with SRK, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan or Sidharth Malhotra. Johar added that SRK would be his choice because he loves the actor's bungalow. However, Johar refused to choose between Aishwarya and Sidharth for the other options of killing or hooking-up.
