Spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has said he loved watching Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmaavat' and found nothing objectionable about it. He added, "'Padmaavat' should be celebrated across India. It's about Rajput honour...will make (Indians) proud." Bhansali held a pre-release screening of the film for the spiritual leader at The Art of Living Foundation in Bengaluru on Monday.
