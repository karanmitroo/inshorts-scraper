As many as 87 bikes belonging to late American comedian Robin Williams have been put up for auction. The proceeds will go towards the support of two charity organisations which support people with disabilities. The favourites from Williams' personal bike collection were donated by his children to honour the passions of their father who was an ardent cyclist.
