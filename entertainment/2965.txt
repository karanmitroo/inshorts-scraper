Vidya Balan has said she was offered the remake of the 1983 Sridevi starrer 'Sadma' but she said no to the project. "I feel one should not touch a film like Sadma...These are timeless films. One can reinterpret it but I'm not one of those who'd go for it." She further said she'd never be a part of any remake.
