Filmmaker Karan Johar, while talking about Sridevi's daughter Janhvi Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor's half-brother Ishaan Khatter, said, "You will face many (firsts) in 2018...from promotion to Paparazzi to link-ups and trolling to fame and failures." Janhvi and Ishaan will feature in Karan's upcoming Bollywood production 'Dhadak', which is a remake of the Marathi film 'Sairat'.
