Actor Naseeruddin Shah has questioned the film industry's respect for yesteryear actor Rajesh Khanna when he was alive. "The fact is the industry created him, used him and cast him away when he was no longer a money-minting machine," said Shah. Earlier, Shah had called Khanna "a poor actor", who brought mediocrity in the film industry in the '70s.
