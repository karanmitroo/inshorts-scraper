An activist named Hemant Patil has filed a complaint with the magistrate's court against producers of TV reality show 'Bigg Boss-7' for insulting a religion. He claimed that the use of tridents (the weapon/symbol of Lord Shiva) by the show's participants hurt his sentiments because it is considered  to be holy symbol as per the Hindu mythology.
