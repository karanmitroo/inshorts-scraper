Oscar-winning music composer AR Rahman has said that when he wanted to enter Bollywood's music industry, he was told to change his name to become successful. He added, "I come from the South...in those days people (told) me, 'Nobody can cross this wall and nobody will help you enter Mumbai'." However, Rahman said everyone accepted him just as he was.
