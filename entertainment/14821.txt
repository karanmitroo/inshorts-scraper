Hindu Sena Chief Vishnu Gupta has reportedly threatened to interrupt the music launch of Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali-starrer movie ‘Ghar Wapsi’ in Delhi, which was scheduled to be held on Monday. The film's director Suhaib Ilyasi has lodged a complaint on the same. The music release of the movie was canceled in January due to Shiv Sena's opposition in Mumbai.
