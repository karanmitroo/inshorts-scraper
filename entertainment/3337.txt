Pakistani actor Ali Zafar has penned a handwritten note defending Mahira Khan over the criticism she has received for wearing a dress and smoking. "How we react defines our own character. Choose wisely, for we shall be judged," he wrote in the note. Earlier, several pictures of Mahira with actor Ranbir Kapoor in New York had surfaced online.
