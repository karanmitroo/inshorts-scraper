Filmmaker Vijay Galani, producer of Salman Khan-starrer 'Veer', has slapped a Rs 250 crore defamation case against the actor, alleging harassment over non-payment of dues. Earlier, Salman had sued the filmmaker for not paying him the promised sum of Rs 15 crore. Galani won the 3-yr-long case in court and has now sued Salman for defaming him.
