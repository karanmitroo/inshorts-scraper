Actress Alia Bhatt has said that Badrinath, the male character played by Varun Dhawan in her recent release 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania', is not a stalker. "From the beginning we were very clear on this... I wouldn't encourage that kind of attention. Yes the couple have their issues. But she is in love with him all the same," said Alia.
