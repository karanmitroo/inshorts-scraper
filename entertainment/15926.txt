Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan has recently said that he will not mind if 'Gerua' song from his upcoming film 'Dilwale' becomes the tagline of BJP. Notably, 'gerua' means orangish colour or saffron which is the symbolic colour of the BJP. Further, while promoting 'Dilwale' on a TV news channel, SRK said he was misquoted by the press over intolerance.
