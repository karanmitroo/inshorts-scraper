Filmmaker and reality show judge Farah Khan has said although she is concerned about "over-exposure", it is tough to say no to shows when the money is good. "Doing a reality show also gives you a lot of freedom. We shoot only once a week," she added. Farah is currently one of the judges on singing reality show 'Indian Idol'.
