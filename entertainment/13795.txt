Actor Varun Dhawan and producer Sajid Nadiadwala have denied that actress Jacqueline Fernandes is seen with a 'kirpan', which is a Sikh ceremonial dagger, in the song 'Sau Tarah Ke' from the film 'Dishoom'. "It’s an Arabic sword... It’s a misunderstanding," clarified Varun adding that being a Punjabi himself, he would never do something to hurt their religious sentiments.
