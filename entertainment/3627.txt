Priyanka Chopra's mother Madhu Chopra, while talking about Priyanka getting trolled, said that no one can bring her down with such silly things. "I don't give importance to trollers who just troll for two minutes of fame," she added. Madhu further said, "She is a public person and every fan has a right on her and she recognises that."
