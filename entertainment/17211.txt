A district court in Muzaffarpur (Bihar) on Friday ordered that an FIR be registered against singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya and jewellery designer Farah Ali Khan for making controversial remarks against people sleeping on roads. On Wednesday, after a sessions court's verdict in the Salman Khan hit-and-run case, Abhijeet compared the homeless with dogs while Farah blamed them for the actor's plight.
