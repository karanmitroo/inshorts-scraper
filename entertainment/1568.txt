Juhi Chawla has said she feels the film industry puts a lot of pressure on actresses while adding, "They're wearing tinier clothes, they are becoming size-zero." She further said, "They have to look cool...(be) comfortable with live-in relationships." She also said that women have a lot of freedom to work these days, but the majority of films still remain hero-centric.
