The Ajay Devgn and Emraan Hashmi starrer 'Baadshaho', which released on Friday, is "a rehashed '90s story with...gloss and a lot of disappointment," wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV called the film's actresses "pretty mannequins," while Indian Express wrote, "The film comes off as old wine, in a not very new bottle." It was rated 2/5 (HT, Indian Express) and 1.5 (NDTV).
