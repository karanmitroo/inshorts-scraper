The Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association has threatened to take action against Indian actors such as Ileana D'Cruz and Kunal Kemmu who have recently worked with Pakistani artistes. Further, the Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani said, "If they are working with Pakistani artistes, then it is their wish but they will face problems in the end."
