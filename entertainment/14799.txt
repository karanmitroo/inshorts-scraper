In connection with the 2002 hit-and-run case, Salman Khan has told the Supreme Court that he drank water, and not alcohol, hours before the accident. Khan added that the state police had framed him in the case on the basis of fabricated evidence. He further requested the SC to uphold the Bombay High Court's order acquitting him in the case.
