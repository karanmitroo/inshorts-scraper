Filmmaker Karan Johar, whose acting skills will soon be seen in Anurag Kashyap's 'Bombay Velvet', is 'stressed out' about whether the audience will accept his negative character in the film or not. "I am really nervous... it's my first foray into acting," Johar said. In the film, KJo plays a villain called Kaizad Khambatta, who has a flamboyant character.
