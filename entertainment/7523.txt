A plea by Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski, to end his 40-year-old rape case, has been rejected. Polanski's lawyers said he was willing to return to the US if he was assured he would not serve more time in jail. The director fled the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl.
