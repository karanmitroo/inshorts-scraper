The makers of late actor Om Puri's last film Rambhajjan Zindabad have agreed to Film Certification Appellate Tribunal's recommendation to rename the film to Omprakash Zindabad as a tribute to the actor. After the Censor Board's refusal to certify the film, the tribunal recommended an A (Adult) certificate. Words like 'izzat' and petticoat were reportedly muted in the film.
