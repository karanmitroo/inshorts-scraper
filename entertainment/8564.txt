Khaled Khatib, a Syrian cinematographer of the Oscar-nominated film 'The White Helmets', has been reportedly barred by the US immigration authorities over a finding of "derogatory information". Khatib had been issued a visa for the ceremony but now needs a passport waiver from the US to enter the country. Derogatory information includes anything from terror connections to passport irregularities.
