Veteran actress Hema Malini has said that she feels very happy that she has portrayed the role of Queen Padmavati in the television series 'Terah Panne' which used to air on Doordarshan. In a veiled reference to the Deepika Padukone starrer 'Padmavati' which faced protests against its release from various Rajput organisations, Hema quipped, "Mera toh release bhi hogaya."
