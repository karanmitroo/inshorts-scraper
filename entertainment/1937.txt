Karni Sena leader Sukhdev Gogamedi called Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Yadav's daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav a 'nachaniya' for performing on 'Ghoomar' song from the film 'Padmavati' at a function in Lucknow. He said people are getting wrongly inspired from the film and it should be banned. He added Yadav should quit politics and join dancing, if she doesn't agree with him.
