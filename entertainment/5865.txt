Former Bigg Boss contestant Diandra Soares, while sharing a picture of Katrina Kaif from an event, wrote a post about how women should age fearlessly and not mess with their beautiful faces and bodies. She added this isn't a hate post against Katrina. "Let's feed our body n mind with love not...bulls**t ideas of beauty fed to us..," wrote Diandra.
