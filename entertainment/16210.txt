Following an FIR being lodged against Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya over charges of molestation, he said, “It's sad that people would go to such lengths for media attention. They should realise that everyone has a family.” He also blamed the incident on “anti Hindu forces.” The singer was accused of molesting a woman inside a Durga Puja pandal in Mumbai.
