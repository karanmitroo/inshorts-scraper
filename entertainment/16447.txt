A court in Pakistan on Thursday rejected a petition soliciting an indefinite ban on Indian films in the nation. A few days earlier, the court had banned the release of Bollywood movie Phantom based on a petition filed by 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed. The court asked the claimant to bring up the issue with Pakistan's Ministry of Culture instead.
