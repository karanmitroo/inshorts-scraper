The music launch of Pakistani artist Ghulam Ali's movie "Ghar Wapsi" was on Monday cancelled, with the director citing security threats as the reason. However, the management of Royal Plaza, the event venue, said it was cancelled as there was "no information about it" and "no documentation". Earlier in the day, the Hindu Sena allegedly threatened to disrupt the event.
