Actress Radhika Apte has said that she "can’t have double standards" so she does what she believes in. "I want to explore. I’ve just begun and in an actor’s journey, you have to explore more," added Apte. She also clarified that her nude scene from 'Parched' was not leaked as the film has already been released in many countries abroad.
