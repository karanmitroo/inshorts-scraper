BJP leader Suraj Pal Amu, who had earlier offered a â‚¹10 crore reward for beheading Deepika Padukone and Sanjay Leela Bhansali over 'Padmavati' row, said, "(Deepika) desh ki beti hai, zidd par add gayi hai." Talking about his comment on burning cinema halls, Amu added that he's not trying to incite violence but the makers should understand Rajput sentiments.
