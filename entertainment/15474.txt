Indian cricketer Virat Kohli and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma have reportedly unfollowed each other's account on image-sharing app Instagram. While some reports later claimed that Anushka got unfollowed because of a technical snag in Kohli's account, there was no clarification from the actress' side. Further, media reports are speculating it as a hint to the couple's possible breakup.
