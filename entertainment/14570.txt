A US court on Monday allowed the sexual assault criminal case against stand-up comedian Bill Cosby to proceed. A preliminary hearing was sought even as the court turned down the motion filed by Cosbyâ€™s legal team to dismiss these charges. The 78-year-old actor is facing trial over a 2004 incident where a woman accused him of drugging and molesting her.
