Union Minister Giriraj Singh, while speaking about the recent 'Padmavati' row, said, "Does Sanjay Bhansali...have guts to make films on other religions or comment upon them?" He added, "They make films on Hindu gurus, gods and warriors. We won't tolerate this anymore." 'Padmavati' has been facing opposition from different organisations including Rajput organisation Karni Sena for distorting facts.
