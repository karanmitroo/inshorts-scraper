A 27-year-old British model Kimberley Miners was arrested and questioned after she allegedly used social media to communicate with the Islamic State. Miners reportedly had secretly converted to Islam and used to share pictures of Muslim women flaunting rifles which  brought her under the anti-terrorist cell's investigation. The model has since then been released on bail.
