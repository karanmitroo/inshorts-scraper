Actress Emilia Clarke, who portrays 'Daenerys Targaryen' in HBO series 'Game of Thrones', said she does not feel the need to justify herself on her nude scenes in the show. She has written an essay on feminism in which she has talked about her feminist upbringing. "I hope...boys and girls are raised to know they are equal," she added.
