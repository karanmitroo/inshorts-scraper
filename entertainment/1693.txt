The man accused of molesting 17-year-old Bollywood actress on a Vistara flight told the police that the incident was unintentional and he had apologised for the same when she raised an alarm. Claiming that the actress' allegations are false, the accused's wife said her husband was sleeping throughout the flight as he was upset because of his uncle's death.
