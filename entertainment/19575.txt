Actor-producer John Abraham was on Friday named the face of infotainment channel National Geographic. John, who claims to be a big fan of the National Geographic, will be a part of the channel's 'Unlock' campaign. "If given a choice, I would like to live my life with mountains, tigers and snakes. I love jungles and want to explore them,"says John.
