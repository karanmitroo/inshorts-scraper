Actress Konkona Sen Sharma has said that she doesn't get recognised by fans when she's her normal, jhalli self. "I do sometimes [get recognised], if I am dressed up," added Konkona. Konkona further said that she finds the culture of taking selfies invasive, and added that she's not fond of being photographed even for professional photo shoots.
