Actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote a blog post on the occasion of granddaughter Aaradhya's fifth birthday on Wednesday. "The most beautiful grand daughter in the whole wide world.... though she turns 5, her countenance lingers close to 55!" he wrote. "The children of this generation are so.... extraordinarily bright.... innocence on their faces is nothing to go by," he wrote further.
