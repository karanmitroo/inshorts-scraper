Singer Rihanna has released her new single 'Sledgehammer', a part of the soundtrack for the film 'Star Trek Beyond'. "It's such a big deal not only as a fan, as a musician... because Star Trek is such a big deal across the globe," said Rihanna. Notably, the video is the first music video to be shot entirely on IMAX cameras.
