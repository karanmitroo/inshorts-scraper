Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s Twitter account was hacked earlier on Monday. The actor took to Twitter to share the news and tweeted, "WHOA!..My Twitter handle hacked! Sex sites planted as 'following'! Whoever did this, try someone else, buddy, I don't need this!" The offending sex sites have reportedly been unfollowed after the incident.
