The members of Rajput organisation Karni Sena have set fire to the effigy of filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali in Nalasopara, Mumbai. Earlier, the members of the organisation vandalised the sets of the film in Jaipur and also physically assaulted Bhansali. The group alleged that Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati' had a romantic dream sequence between Alauddin Khilji and Rajput queen Padmini.
