Actress Anushka Sharma has said that the vandalism which happened on the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmavati' in Kolhapur is unacceptable. She added, "No sensible person, not just from the film industry but outside as well will accept this." The film's sets were set on fire by 40-50 unidentified men on Tuesday night.
