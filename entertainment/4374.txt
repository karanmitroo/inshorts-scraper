After the recent security breach at HBO, hackers of the US television network have reportedly leaked the phone numbers, home addresses and email addresses of Game of Thrones actors including Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, and Emilia Clarke. The hackers who reportedly stole 1.5 terabytes of data are demanding a ransom of an undisclosed amount to prevent further leaks.
