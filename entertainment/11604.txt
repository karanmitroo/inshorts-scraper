Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that he did not ask PM Narendra Modi to apologise, while clarifying his earlier tweet where he queried about Modi's trip in December 2015 to meet the Pakistani PM. "PM visited Pakistan for talks at the same time that a filmmaker was working with a Pakistani actor... Yet only one pays the price," said Anurag.
