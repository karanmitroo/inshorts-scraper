Shah Rukh Khan has said that the failure of his 2000 film 'Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani' made him, and his co-producers Juhi Chawla and Aziz Mirza stronger. "This one was special. It was a complete disaster and completely written off," added Shah Rukh. Notably, 'Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani' completed 18 years of its release on Sunday.
