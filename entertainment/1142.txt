Vidya Balan has acquired the rights to a project in which she will be seen portraying former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The project will be based on journalist-author Sagarika Ghose's book 'Indira: India's Most Powerful Prime Minister'. "I haven't decided yet whether it should be a film or a web series, but that'll take a while anyway," said Vidya.
