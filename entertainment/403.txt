Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that marginalising a woman and controlling her is 'subconsciously' ingrained in men's minds. "In college, my friends would tell me, 'Ladki agar mana bhi kare toh haath pakadna hai'," he added. Kashyap further said, "(It's) across the board and across the globe...it has been taught to us and it works on a very subconscious level."
