South Indian singer Vaikkom Vijayalakshmi has set a world record by playing 67 songs on Gayathri Veena non-stop for five hours at a concert in Kochi on Sunday. The visually-impaired musician bettered the previous record of 51 songs in a single sitting. The organisers of the concert said they would inform the Guinness Book of World Records about the achievement.
