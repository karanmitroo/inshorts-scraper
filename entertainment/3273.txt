Rajesh Mapuskar, director of Priyanka Chopra's Marathi production 'Ventilator', has said she and her mother Madhu were disappointed about 'Newton', and not their film, being chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars. "She (Priyanka) was always ambitious about (Ventilator). Had it been selected, she would have ensured...it was the most-talked-about film in the run to the Oscars," added Rajesh.
