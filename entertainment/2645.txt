Boman Irani, who will portray Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi in the film titled 'Jhalki', has said Satyarthi is a real-life hero just like Batman. "He has put his life on the line to pull people out of the darkness...similar to what Batman does," added Boman. Notably, Satyarthi left his job as a lecturer in 1980 to start Bachpan Bachao Andolan.
