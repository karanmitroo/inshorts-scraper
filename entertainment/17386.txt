Director-producer Arbaaz Khan said Monday that while the third Dabangg film was on cards, it may take one or two years to develop. Arbaaz added that he was waiting for his brother Salman Khan to finish all his pending film projects. He also revealed that he will only stick to producing 'Dabangg 3' and won't direct it.
