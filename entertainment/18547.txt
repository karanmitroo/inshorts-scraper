A complaint has been lodged by an activist, against noted filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma, after his 'atheist' comments on Ganesh Chaturthi went viral, and hurt people's sentiments. "The guy who couldn't save his own head from being cut , how he will save others heads is my question? But Happy Ganpathi day to morons!" Verma had written on twitter.
