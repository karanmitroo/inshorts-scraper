Actress Sridevi has said she was hurt by SS Rajamouli's interview, wherein he said Sridevi wasn't cast in Baahubali as they couldn't afford her 'demands'. She added, "There were rumours I asked for â‚¹10 crore, an entire hotel floor, ten flight tickets etc." Sridevi said she wouldn't have survived in the industry for 50 years had she made such demands.
