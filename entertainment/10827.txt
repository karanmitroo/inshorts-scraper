BCCI posted a video on Twitter of actor Amitabh Bachchan attempting Ravi Shastri's Tracer Bullet Challenge. In the video, Bachchan is heard saying, "He bowls a juicy half-volley & @imVkohli drives through the covers and it goes like a tracer bullet." The challenge requires the taker to imitate Shastri's style of commentary using the phrase, 'like a tracer bullet'.
