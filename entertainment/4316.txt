Speaking about his father Rishi Kapoor's remarks on 'Jagga Jasoos', actor Ranbir Kapoor said he doesn't necessarily agree with him. "My father is a very emotional man. Whatever he said was to protect me in some way," he added. Earlier, Rishi slammed director Anurag Basu for being "irresponsible" with the film, which was in the making for over three years.
