Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that initially he felt he was forced to dance but started enjoying dancing while doing the film Munna Michael, which stars Tiger Shroff. "I learnt a lot by observing Tiger's dancing steps... I think I have tried to reach nearly 5 per cent of his dancing skills," added Nawazuddin.
