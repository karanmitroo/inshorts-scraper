Actor Neil Nitin Mukesh took to social media to share a video in which his car can be seen moving through a clogged road in Mumbai during the heavy rains on Tuesday. "Driving in the sea," he wrote along side the video. Weather officials believe it could be the heaviest and longest bout of rain since July 2005.
