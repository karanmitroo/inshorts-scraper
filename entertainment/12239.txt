Responding to Rishi Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor hitting media persons during the Kapoor family's 'Ganesh visarjan', aâ€‹ journalist has written an open letter to Rishi Kapoor. The letter asks why "so much anger, abuse and violence" was aimed at the media for covering a "public" Ganpati visarjan, while adding that they could have behaved in a "civilised way".
