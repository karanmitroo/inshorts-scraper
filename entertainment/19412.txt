Actor Sunny Deol(57), who starred in 1990 revenge action drama 'Ghayal' along with Meenakshi Seshadri and Raj Babbar, says the sequel 'Ghayal Returns' has been jinxed, but he is determined to make it happen. Though he announced earlier that Rahul Rawail will direct 'Ghayal Returns', now he has refused to share the director's name and is tight-lipped about the project.
