Actress Priyanka Chopra has apologised for hurting people's sentiments after she was slammed for wearing a T-shirt deemed "insensitive" to refugees and immigrants on the cover of 'Condé Nast Traveller’. "I'm very affected and feel really horrible. The magazine... wanted to send a message about addressing xenophobia with labels, but it has been misconstrued," the 34-year-old actress said.
