Singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock, from the girl band 'Little Mix', has shared pictures of her bruised face following reports that alleged a diner slapped her when she was at the VQ restaurant in London. An onlooker claimed that the man was aggressive and while Leigh-Anne looked shocked and laughed it off initially, she then broke down in tears.
