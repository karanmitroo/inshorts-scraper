Pakistani actress Mahira Khan has said that she was completely shattered and broken after pictures showing her smoking with Ranbir Kapoor surfaced online. "I understand where all the criticism came from... It's the same disappointment that my nani or my mamu would have felt seeing that," she added. Mahira further said, "I am human, I make mistakes."
