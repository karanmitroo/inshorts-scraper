Emma Watson, on winning the first ever genderless Best Actor in a Movie award at the MTV Movie & TV Awards, said that this shows acting doesn't need to be separated into two different categories. "It indicates that acting is about the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes," added Emma. She won it for Beauty and The Beast.
