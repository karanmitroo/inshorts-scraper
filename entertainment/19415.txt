Shahid Kapoor is all set to go bald in Director Vishal Bharadwaj's next venture, 'Haidar' -- an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Unaffected with losing his hair, Shahid said that the role was so good that he did not mind shaving his head off completely. Haider is a dark revenge drama that will be shot in Kashmir.
