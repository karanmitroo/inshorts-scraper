The Chinese government has banned singer Justin Bieber from performing in the country as he has "engaged in a series of bad behaviours, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China". Bieber will perform in Asia later this year, with concerts scheduled in countries like Indonesia, Japan and Singapore, as part of his Purpose World Tour.
