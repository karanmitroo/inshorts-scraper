Actor Manoj Bajpayee has said that filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma (RGV) is the rockstar and superstar of the micro-blogging site Twitter. "His tweets always raise a debate. He is a fearless person. He has a right to put out his opinions. And it's not important that I should agree with him always," added Bajpayee.
