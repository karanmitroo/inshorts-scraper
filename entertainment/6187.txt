Actor Purab Kohli has said that the release of films on Fridays is like the appraisal period for actors. "Just like employees in corporate offices have their annual appraisal period, where they get nervous about what will happen with their salaries... we [actors] too, feel the first Friday jitters," said Purab. He added that ultimately audience is the best judge.
