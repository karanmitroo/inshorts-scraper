Actor Tusshar Kapoor has said that he never showed his son Laksshya's face initially as he was very superstitious. Tusshar is celebrating his son's first birthday by hosting a small get-together and playdate for kids. "I thought about the party from Laksshya's point of view. I wanted it to be small so that he enjoys it," added Tusshar.
