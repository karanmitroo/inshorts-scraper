The Supreme Court has asked Govinda to apologise to the fan he had slapped seven years ago while shooting in Mumbai to avoid prosecution. The complainant had moved the Supreme Court after the Bombay High Court rejected his plea for trial against the actor on alleged criminal intimidation. Govinda can be jailed for up to two years under section 506.
