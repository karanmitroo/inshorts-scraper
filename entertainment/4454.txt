HBO's Indian distribution partner 'Star India' has confirmed that it was accountable for the online leak of the fourth episode of 'Game of Thrones' season 7 before its official broadcast. "We take this breach very seriously," said a Star India spokesperson. However, the leak is reportedly a separate incident from the earlier hacking of HBO's data.
