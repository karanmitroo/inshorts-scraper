'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' which released on Friday is a flat and unfunny sequel, wrote Indian Express. The film lacks the freshness its prequel had, it added. "All the actors fit perfectly into their characters," said Hindustan Times. The film has been rated 1/5 (Indian Express, NDTV), 2.5/5 (TOI) and 3/5 (Hindustan Times).
