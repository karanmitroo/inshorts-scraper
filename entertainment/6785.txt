Actor Mukul Dev, in a series of Facebook posts, wrote that he was made to deboard a Jet Airways flight five minutes before take off after an "old dead" e-cigarette was found in his check-in bag. "The sad part is I was on my way to Amritsar to receive an award. Complete violation of air regulations," added Mukul.
