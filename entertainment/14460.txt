Actress Vidya Balan has said that she has the greatest admiration for Kangana Ranaut for standing up for herself in the legal row involving Hrithik Roshan. Vidya added, "I think that it is very creditable because as women we find it very easy to stand up for other people... but we rarely stand for ourselves."
