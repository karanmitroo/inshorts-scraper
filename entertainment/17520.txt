The Censor Board sparked a controversy while screening the Paresh Rawal-starrer film 'Dharam Sankat Mein'. The board invited a Maulvi and a Pandit at the film's screening to get their approval to avoid any controversy around the subject of the film. In the film, Rawal plays a Hindu man who later discovers that he was born in a Muslim family.
