British graffiti artist Banksy on Friday opened 'The Walled Off' hotel in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem and said that it has "the worst view in the world." The hotel rooms face a 30-foot concrete wall which separates Palestinian territories from Israel. The hotel is packed with artwork highlighting the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
