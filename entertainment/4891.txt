Saif Ali Khan, in an open letter, said he called Kangana Ranaut and apologised personally for taking a dig at her during the 'nepotism rocks' act at IIFA 2017. "I don't owe anybody else an explanation. The issue is over," he added. Talking about nepotism, Saif further wrote, "It's the audience that makes a film a hit, not... family members".
