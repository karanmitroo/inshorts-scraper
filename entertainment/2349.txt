Karan Johar has said he never got credit for making the short film on homosexuality in the anthology film 'Bombay Talkies' but if his name was Karan Kashyap, he would have got credit. Johar also talked about making films like 'My Name Is Khan', which is a "very real story", and 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', which had an unconventional ending.
