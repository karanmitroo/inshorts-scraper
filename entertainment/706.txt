Amitabh Bachchan has threatened to quit Twitter, accusing the social media giant of reducing his number of followers. He added, "Thank you for the ride... there are many 'other' fish in the sea - and a lot more exciting!!!" This comes after Shah Rukh Khan beat Bachchan to become the most followed Indian actor on Twitter.
