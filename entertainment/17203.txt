Two lawsuits have been filed against Bollywood choreographer Shiamak Davar in the BC Supreme Court (Canada), for allegedly sexually abusing two men from North Vancouver. Percy Shroff (40) and Jimmy Mistry (33), claimed that they have endured years of 'unwanted sexual touching' at the hands of Shiamak. "He began grooming me for sexual exploitation when I was 16," Shroff added.
