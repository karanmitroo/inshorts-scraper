Kunal Khemu-starrer 'Guddu Ki Gun' which released across India on Friday, "is a delightful adult comedy," wrote Economic Times. It's silly, but makes the audience laugh, wrote Koimoi. "[T]he script falters at the end when a climax is stretched much beyond its limit," said Mid-Day. The film has been rated 4/5 (Koimoi), 3/5 (ET, Mid-Day) and 1.5/5 (Catch News).
