Singer Zayn Malik has cancelled a concert scheduled for October 7 in Dubai owing to his "extreme anxiety" about major solo performances. He has assured that all tickets would be refunded. This is the second show that Malik has cancelled in three months after backing out from the Capital Summertime Ball in London in June, attributing it to his anxiety.
