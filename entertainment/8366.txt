Actor Shah Rukh Khan said that he needs chest hair to play Wolverine, while responding to a fan's tweet who said she wanted him to play the superhero character. He added, "Working on it though. Love Hugh & Wolverine." Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman recently said that since 'Logan' is his last film where he plays Wolverine, maybe SRK could replace him.
