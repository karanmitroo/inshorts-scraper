The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a petition seeking cancellation of the bail granted by the Bombay High Court to actor Salman Khan in the 2002 hit-and-run case. The High Court on May 8 had suspended Salman's five-year sentence and granted him bail in the case. One person was killed and four other pavement dwellers were injured in the accident.
