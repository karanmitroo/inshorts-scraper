Singers Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift recently indulged in a Twitter war after Minaj complained of her video 'Anaconda' not being nominated in the MTV awards. "If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated", Minaj tweeted, indirectly referring to Swift's 'Bad Blood' video. "It's unlike you to pit women against each other", Swift replied promptly.
