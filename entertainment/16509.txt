Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is pressing charges against the producers of Phantom for misrepresentation and allegedly endangering its workers' safety. The NGO has claimed it wasn't consulted over the movie's content. Katrina Kaif says she plays an MSF aid worker, who helps assassinate Pakistani militants and wields a gun. MSF reportedly has "a strict no guns policy".
