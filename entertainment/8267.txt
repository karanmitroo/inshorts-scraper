According to a popular theory, when movies were made during early 1900s, filming was done by hand held cameras. The speed of the film would vary between 8 and 22 moving pictures or frames per second. To make the images look like a continuous picture, filmmakers would insert slates between each frame, resulting in a constant flickering on the screen.
