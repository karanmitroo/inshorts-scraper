Actress Renuka Shahane took to Facebook to pen a tribute to late Reema Lagoo and also shared old pictures of the veteran actress which she had clicked herself.
"We used to share our Tiffin boxes, make-up rooms.....you were protective about me...," wrote Renuka in her post. Notably, Reema played Renuka's mother in the 1994 film 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!'.
