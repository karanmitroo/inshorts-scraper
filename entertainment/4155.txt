Sidharth Malhotra, while reacting to reports of his split with Alia Bhatt, asked, "Alia Bhatt and I breakup? For what?" The actor further said, "We broke some tables and chairs? Aap toh kuch bhi likh sakte hai, there's no point saying anything," he added. Sidharth is currently rumoured to be dating Jacqueline Fernandez, his co-star in 'A Gentleman-Sundar, Susheel, Risky'.
