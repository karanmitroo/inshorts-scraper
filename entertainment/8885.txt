Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone has shared a video on Instagram where he said that he worked out with his daughter Sophia and tried out Pilates. "This is an amazing workout but definitely not for the faint of heart," he wrote. "For anyone who hasn't tried Pilates, the name sounds cute but it ain't cute!," said Stallone in the video.
