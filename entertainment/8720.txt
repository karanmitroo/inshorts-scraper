Scarlett Johansson, who recently split from her husband Romain Dauriac, said she does not think it's natural to be monogamous. She said she considered the idea of marriage very romantic but a lot of work. "It's something I have a lot of respect for and have participated in, but... it definitely goes against some instinct to look beyond," added Scarlett.
