Hollywood actor Ben Affleck has apologised for an incident in 2003 in which he groped actress Hilarie Burton on the MTV show 'Total Request Live'. He tweeted on Wednesday, "I acted inappropriately toward Ms Burton and I sincerely apologise." The incident resurfaced after Affleck condemned producer Harvey Weinstein, after many actresses alleged that the producer sexually harassed them.
