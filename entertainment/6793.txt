Actress Deepika Padukone has said that it is racist and ignorant of the foreign media to mistake her for Priyanka Chopra in the US. "As a fellow Indian, you (the media) should also not (be) very happy about. I think just because people have similar skin tones, doesn't mean they are same people," added Deepika.
