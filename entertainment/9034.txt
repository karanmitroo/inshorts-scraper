Varun Dhawan has revealed that Salman Khan asked him to call him 'bhai', and further said he'd slap him if Varun called him 'uncle'. This happened when seven-year-old Varun had gone for a trial of 1997 film 'Judwaa'. Salman further told him, "I don't care if you're David Dhawan's son...won't allow you inside (the) theatre if you call me uncle."
