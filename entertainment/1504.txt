Jitesh Pillai, the editor of Filmfare magazine has slammed Kangana Ranaut for saying that she was called to receive an award in 2014 but since she couldn't attend the function the award was given to someone else. "Is she hallucinating... I didn't go to anyone's house or beg anyone to accept an award," he tweeted.
