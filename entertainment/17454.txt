Reacting to the 'My Choice' viral video featuring Deepika Padukone, actress Sonakshi Sinha has said that "women empowerment is not always about who you want to have sex with". "It is about employment, strength and stuff like that," she said. Calling it a good initiative, Sonakshi added, "...it (empowerment) needs to reach out to people who actually need it."
