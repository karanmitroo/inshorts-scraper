Sidharth Malhotra doesn't wish to address his rumoured relationship with Alia Bhatt, as it will "dilute" the importance of something "sacred." He reportedly said, "As far as Alia and I are convincing on-screen as lovers, romancing each other, that's all that should matter. What we do otherwise in our precious time should be sacred to us, to me."
