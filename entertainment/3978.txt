Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma took a dig at Congress leader V Hanumantha Rao for reportedly tearing a poster of the upcoming film 'Arjun Reddy', which shows actors Vijay Deverakonda and Shalini Pandey kissing. "Was he jealous because that beautiful girl was kissing Vijay Deverakonda or was it because HR himself would have never been kissed," wrote RGV on Facebook.
