Aamir Khan has revealed he had approached actor Rajinikanth for dubbing the Tamil version of upcoming sports drama film 'Dangal', but both of them felt his voice was too recognisable for it. "Rajini sir is so popular, his voice won't suit my face. We both felt that," he said. Aamir will be seen portraying wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat in 'Dangal'.
