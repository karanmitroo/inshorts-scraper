Actor Tom Hardy got a tattoo which reads 'Leo knows all' on his right bicep after losing a bet to Leonardo DiCaprio over getting an Oscar nomination. DiCaprio had predicted that Hardy's performance in 'The Revenant' would get him a nomination but Hardy didn't believe him. While both the actors were nominated for the Oscar, DiCaprio won the award.
