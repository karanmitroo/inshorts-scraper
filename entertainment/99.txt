Producer Prernaa Arora, while speaking about Pakistan Censor Board banning Anushka Sharma's 'Pari' saying it goes against Islamic values, questioned, "Can Pakistan define anti-Islamic?" "Evil, which the film portrays, has no religion," she added. Earlier, a member of the Censor Board said 'Pari' "stimulates viewers in favour of black magic and promotes thoughts that are contradictory to Islam".
