A Mumbai court has acquitted veteran actor Dilip Kumar in an 18-year-old case, allegedly related to a bounced cheque. Kumar was earlier the honorary chairman of Geekay Exim India Limited, a company engaged in the exports business, which had defaulted in the repayment of loans to its lenders in 1998. Kumar was granted exemption from personal appearance in the case.
