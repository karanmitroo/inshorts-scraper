The Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have decided to boycott an award ceremony where actor Prakash Raj will be awarded the 'Shivarama Karanth Hutturu Prashathi' on Tuesday in Karnataka's Udupi. The party is reportedly miffed with Raj's recent remarks criticising PM Narendra Modi over his silence on journalist Gauri Lankesh's murder and is against the actor being conferred the award.
