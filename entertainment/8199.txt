Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that Karan Johar is nobody to tell her to leave the film industry. Kangana said this while responding to Johar's recent statement that she should leave the industry if it's so bad. "Industry belongs to every Indian...is highly recommended for outsiders like me whose parents were too poor (to provide formal acting training)," added Kangana.
