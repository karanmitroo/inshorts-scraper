Actor-filmmaker Arbaaz Khan has tweeted that Sabbir Khan, who directed the Tiger Shroff starrer 'Munna Michael', was never approached to direct or write 'Dabangg 3'. Arbaaz further wrote that Sabbir's statement to an English daily was "untrue and rubbish". Sabbir had earlier said that he was happy to be one of directors selected to work on Dabangg 3's final script.
