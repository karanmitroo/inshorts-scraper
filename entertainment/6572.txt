Actor Kamaal R Khan (KRK), while sharing a picture with his mother, tweeted, "Wish you very happy #MothersDay Mom! Once upon a time, you wanted to give (me) poison but today you are proud of me." KRK explained she wanted to give him poison as she was angry with him for watching films and thought he'd destroy the family's reputation.
