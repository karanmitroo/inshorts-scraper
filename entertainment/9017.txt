Filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra has said that 'Dangal' would have become a hit even if it featured Hrithik Roshan instead of Aamir Khan. "Aamir is not KING, the story is the KING... This does not make Aamir small, but I am saying, the story is bigger," said Vidhu. He has worked with Aamir in films like 'PK' and 3 Idiots.
