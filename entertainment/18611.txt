Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor said that married actresses not getting good roles is a thing of past in Bollywood, as her career didn't suffer any setback after she tied the knot with Saif Ali Khan. She said she still gets to work with top stars like Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Ajay Devgn and is offered big-budget commercial films.
