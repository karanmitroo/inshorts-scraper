Actor Salman Khan's father Salim Khan has tweeted that we should all pray for the safe return of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national who has been sentenced to death by Pakistan for spying. Further, quoting Prophet Muhammad, he added, "To kill an innocent is equivalent to killing the entire humanity." Jadhav was reportedly arrested in March last year in Balochistan.
