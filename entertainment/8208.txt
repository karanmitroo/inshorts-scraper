'Kong: Skull Island', starring Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, is beautiful but is "mostly empty spectacle", wrote Hindustan Times. Times of India wrote, "This monster movie is immensely formulaic but... it doesn't have one dull moment," while Mid-Day wrote that the film is "impressive in terms of FX and CGI". It was rated 2.5/5 (HT, Mid-Day) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
