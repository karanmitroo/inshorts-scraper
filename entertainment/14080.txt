Actress Katrina Kaif has commented on the film industry saying "sometimes we mix the personal and the professional too closely". The 32-year-old actress added, "I think I no longer make friends in a way that I am too attached or dependent on people." Meanwhile, Katrina has finished the shoot of 'Jagga Jasoos' in Morocco which stars her ex Ranbir Kapoor.
