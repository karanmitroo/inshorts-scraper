American television host Jimmy Kimmel, while referring to the goof-up at the Oscars last year wherein the wrong film was named the Best Picture, said, "If it happens again, literally everyone at ABC should be fired." "If it happens a second time, no one's competent enough to be running a TV show," he added. Jimmy had hosted Oscars last year.
