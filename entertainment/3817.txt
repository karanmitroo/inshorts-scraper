The makers of 'Pehredaar Piya Ki' have compared taking the show off air to "suffering a miscarriage". "It's a very painful process to end the show abruptly," said producer Sumeet Mittal. He further clarified that the decision was not sudden and was being discussed since the I&B ministry had asked for a change in the time slot for the show.
