A South Korean man has been fined $4,400 for spreading fake news on his blog that rapper Dr Dre is marrying late South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung's wife. He said the marriage was intended to launder money he alleged belonged to the former leader. A Seoul district court found the man "violated the honour of the deceased and the bereaved".
