Actor Ranbir Kapoor has said that while preparing to portray Sanjay Dutt for the biopic on the actor, his obsession with Dutt became a bit of a sickness. "Every time I'd see him, I'd start observing him like a hawk â€” the way he scratches his beard, twitches his eye, drinks water, hugs," added Ranbir.
