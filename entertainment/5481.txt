Ekta Kapoor, who is presenting and distributing the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, has clarified that the middle finger in the film's poster is not for the Censor Board. She said that it is directed towards the patriarchal society. Ekta added that this is why this issue is not just about the Censor Board but is about ideology and patriarchy.
