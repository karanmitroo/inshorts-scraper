Nawazuddin Siddiqui, while speaking about his experience on working with Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, said that SRK is not content till the scene is right while Salman is a one-take guy. "Working with SRK feels like working with an 'actor'," he added. "Salman does a scene once and he's not going to do it again," Nawazuddin further revealed.
