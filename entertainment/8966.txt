The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by Rabia Khan, mother of late actor Jiah Khan, challenging the CBI's charge sheet which called Jiah's death a suicide and not homicide. Rabia had alleged Jiah was murdered by her then boyfriend Sooraj Pancholi. She had also sought the formation of a special investigation team to probe Jiah's death.
