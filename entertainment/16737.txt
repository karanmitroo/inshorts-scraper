Actress Kangana Ranaut on Sunday said she used to believe that all those people who refused to work with her were dumb. "When I was at rock-bottom, people refused to work with me. And I thought they are so dumb. I am evolved when it comes to these things", she said. Further, she said, "I'm not a conventional person".
