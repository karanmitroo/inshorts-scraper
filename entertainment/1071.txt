The Rajasthan High Court has directed the makers of 'Padmaavat' to screen the film for the court before January 23. This was in response to a plea by director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, where he appealed for quashing of an FIR in the state. The FIR, which was filed in March 2017, sought action against Bhansali, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.
