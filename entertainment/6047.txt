Actor Paresh Rawal said that he doesn't regret his tweet on author Arundhati Roy wherein he wrote that she should be tied to an Army jeep instead of a stone pelter. He added that his tweet was a message of peace. Paresh's tweet came after a fake report stated that Roy criticised the Indian Army's action in Kashmir.
