Actor Andrew Garfield has been dropped by producers as the Spider-Man in the next movie in the series. The 31-year-old was reportedly dropped after 'Amazing Spider-Man 2' underperformed at the box office, registering its name as the lowest grossing Spider-Man movie. Sony will introduce the superhero in a new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film.
