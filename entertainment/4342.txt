Viewers have started a petition, addressed to Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Smriti Zubin Irani, to get television show 'Pehredaar Piya Ki' off air. The show tells the story of a 9-year-old boy who is married to an 18-year-old woman.  "We don't want our kids to be influenced by such serials," read a part of the petition.
