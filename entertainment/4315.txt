Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has said unlike his previous films, he's not blowing up cars in his upcoming film 'Golmaal Again'. "It's a little unfair that you do so much hard work to make a 2.5 hour film and all they talk about is how I just blow cars," he added. 'Golmaal Again' will star Ajay Devgn, Parineeti Chopra among others.
