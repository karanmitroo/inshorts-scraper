Netflix has announced it will not be involved in any production of House of Cards featuring Kevin Spacey after the show's former and current employees accused Spacey of sexual harassment. Netflix, which also refused to release a movie starring Spacey, had earlier said the show would end in 2018 and that it was "deeply troubled" by the news concerning Spacey.
