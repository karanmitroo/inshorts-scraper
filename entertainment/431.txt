Sidharth Malhotra and Manoj Bajpayee starrer 'Aiyaary', which released today, "is sketchily-written and not compelling," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). The film has "measured performances that...make it a worthwhile watch," said The Times of India (TOI). Bollywood Hungama wrote the film misses the mark and is a huge letdown. It has been rated 1/5 (HT), 2/5 (Bollywood Hungama) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
