American actor-comedian Jack Black said in a recent interview that Bryan Cranston of 'Breaking Bad' fame, is a much better actor than this year's Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio. "But, Leo DiCap was like dying a lot, he was... coughing blood", Black said about DiCaprio's role in 'The Revenant'. Notably, Cranston was nominated alongside DiCaprio for 'Trumbo' at the 2016 Oscars.
