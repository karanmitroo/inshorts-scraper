Acclaimed Hollywood director Woody Allen recently said that he is too "lazy, stupid and middle class to make truly brilliant films." "I don't have the intellect or the depth or the natural gift. The greatness is not in me," the four time Oscar winner said. "If I was crazy I might be better", Allen, 79,  added.
