A Sri Lanka-based Christmas carol service mistakenly printed the lyrics to late rapper Tupac's Hail Mary instead of the traditional Catholic prayer, on thousands of brochures. Instead of reflecting the message, "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee," the brochures read, "Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting p***y." They were distributed at a festival.
