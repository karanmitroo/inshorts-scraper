Singer Rihanna launched her Spring 2018 'Fenty Puma' collection at New York Fashion Week on a runway with pink sand mountains as bikers performed stunts. Brightly-coloured biker suits, wide-legged pants, off-the-shoulder spandex, oversized jackets and high-heeled flip flops were showcased in the new collection. Towards the end of the show, Rihanna showed up on the stage on a bike.
