Amazon Studios has cut ties with US film studio The Weinstein Company in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against its Founder Harvey Weinstein. Amazon has also cancelled a Weinstein Company-backed television drama from director David O Russell. The move comes after actress Rose McGowan wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Twitter, claiming that Weinstein raped her.
