Veteran actor Paresh Rawal will soon be seen portraying PM Narendra Modi's character in a forthcoming biopic. The National award winning actor takes this as a huge responsibility and will not mimic Modi, but research his speeches. Co-produced by Rawal, the film's shooting will start in August. Rawal has also played the character of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel before.
