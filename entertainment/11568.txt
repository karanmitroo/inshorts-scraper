The Censor Board on Thursday told Delhi High Court that the film '31st October' was certified for release after relevant cuts. The film is based on the aftermath of the assassination of PM Indira Gandhi. The court is hearing a PIL opposing the film's release claiming that it is against the ideology of the "oldest political party of the country".
