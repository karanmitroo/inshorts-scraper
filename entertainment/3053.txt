A video shows a journalist mistakenly addressing Shah Rukh Khan as Salman Khan during an interview at the TED Talks event on Thursday. The journalist, named Lipika, immediately corrected herself and apologised for the error. Following this, Shah Rukh responded by saying, "Don't worry Deepika it's alright... Oh I am so sorry, Lipika."
