Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has revealed that the reason he took a year-long break from the music industry was due to struggles with substance abuse. Sheeran said, "All the pitfalls that people read about, I just found myself slipping into all of them." He added, "That was a wake-up call. I can't write songs under the influence."
