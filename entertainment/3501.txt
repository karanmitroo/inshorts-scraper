As per reports, Deepika Padukone will replace Jacqueline Fernandez in Salman Khan's 'Kick 2', the sequel to the 2014 film 'Kick'. A source said, "As Jacqueline and Salman are already working together in Race 3, it only makes sense to give audience a fresh pairing." Notably, this could be the first film that Salman and Deepika will feature together in.
