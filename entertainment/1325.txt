Former 'Bigg Boss 11' contestant Arshi Khan has said that since actresses do nude scenes all the time, people should not have a problem if she does something similar. She further said, "Our generation is very progressive. In today's time you cannot have backward thinking." She added that she does not care if people raise objections to her "hot videos".
