Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Khemu are all set to marry each other on January 25. Just like Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan's wedding, this is also going to be a registered marriage under Special Marriage Act. Reportedly, the wedding will be a private and low-key affair and only close friends and family members will be invited.
