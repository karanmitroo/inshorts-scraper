Meghalaya BJP on Saturday observed a two-minute silence to pay tribute to veteran actor Vinod Khanna, who is still alive. The party later issued a clarification that a few of its members had seen media reports regarding his death and believed them without verification. The rumours reportedly sparked off after pictures showing him in a bad shape went viral.
