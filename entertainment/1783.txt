Bryan Singer, who directed the 'X-Men' films, has been accused of raping a 17-year-old boy on a yacht in 2003. In a lawsuit, the victim alleged Singer told him he could help him get into acting if he didn't say anything about the incident. The lawsuit added that Singer said he could hire people who're capable of ruining someone's reputation.
