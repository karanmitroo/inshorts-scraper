Lata Mangeshkar has appealed the Maharashtra government via Twitter not to punish South Mumbaiâ€™s Campa Cola residents, who are facing eviction after Supreme Court dismissed their plea against an earlier order asking them to vacate their premises. She added that many people, including children and elderly people, will become homeless if the houses are razed.
