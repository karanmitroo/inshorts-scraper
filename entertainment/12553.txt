Singer Sting has said that the song '50,000' from his new album '57th & 9th' is about the consecutive​ deaths of celebrities including David Bowie, Prince and his friend actor Alan Rickman. "It was a strange time because you think that these people are immortal, but then suddenly they’re like the rest of us, they die," said Sting.
