Actor Shia LaBeouf is using Twitter to hitch-hike across the US on a month long journey, which he started from Colorado. Using the hashtag '#TakeMeAnywhere', LaBeouf has asked his followers to take him wherever they are going and is sharing his GPS coordinates on Twitter. The journey is a project which will be turned into a film about the experience.
