Singer Sona Mohapatra on Twitter slammed the media for ignoring singers and lyricists at the IIFA green carpet. "Sad how the more vacant minds in the industry are asked to opine on matters over & over again," tweeted Sona. She further wrote that despite celebrities "making a prettier picture with their army of stylists helping", what they say is questionable.
