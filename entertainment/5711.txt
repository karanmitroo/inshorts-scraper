Actress Kriti Sanon, reacting to the row over Priyanka Chopra wearing a dress while meeting PM Modi, said that people need to stop telling women what to wear. "Or else it should be mentioned that if you're meeting so and so, please wear a burkha," added Kriti. Priyanka was trolled for not "covering" her legs during her meeting with Modi.
