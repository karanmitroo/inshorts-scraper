Former footballer David Beckham's eldest son Brooklyn Beckham has been slammed for promoting gun violence in a photo shoot, in which he can be seen posing with a gun in his hand. "A gun? Really? What an idiot," commented a user on the photo. "Guns ain't cool man...Your biceps are a solid 100 but not the pistol," read another comment.
