Actor Emraan Hashmi has urged people to stop thinking of cancer as a dead end. "There is a misconception about cancer that it is not curable and that the patient would die... If diagnosed at the right stage, it even can be cured," he added. Emraan's son was diagnosed with cancer at the age of three in 2014.
