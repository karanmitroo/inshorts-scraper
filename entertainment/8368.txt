Singer Zubeen Garg has alleged that the Odia song 'Pakhi Pakhi', sung by veteran singer Udit Narayan, is a total copy of his Assamese song 'Pakhi Pakhi Ei Mon'. Garg has said that he is planning legal action against the music director and producer of the Odia film 'Tapori' for plagiarism. However, he added, "I have nothing against Udit Narayan."
