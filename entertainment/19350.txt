Actress Sunny Leone and her husband Daniel Weber, would be under cameras for the next 18 months for a film documenting their lives. Whatever they say, do, wherever they travel, will be recorded. The film, which aims to bring out the couple's uncut life on reel, will release in 2015. Reportedly, a Canadian production house has undertaken the project.
