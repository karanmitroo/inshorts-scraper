Director of the 'Baahubali' franchise SS Rajamouli has said he used to get goosebumps and tears in his eyes reading the story of Karna, a character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Rajamouli added, "Mythology is in my blood." He further said that he grew up reading 'Balaramayana', 'Amar Chitra Katha' comics and books on kings, which were available in Telugu.
