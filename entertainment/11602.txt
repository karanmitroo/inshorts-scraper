Kritik Kumar Pandey, a writer, has filed a case in the Bombay High Court against the Tiger Shroff starrer 'Munna Michael', claiming that the makers stole the story idea from him. Pandey said that he had created the film's titular character based on 'an ardent fan of Michael Jackson'. He further alleged that he earlier narrated the script to Tiger.
