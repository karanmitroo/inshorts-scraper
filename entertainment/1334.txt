Talking about Karan Johar's twins Roohi and Yash, actor Varun Dhawan said, "I wish I could protect them from getting papped all the time." Varun, who made his acting debut in Bollywood with Johar's 2012 film 'Student of The Year', is very close to the filmmaker. Karan became a father to the twins via surrogacy in February 2017.
