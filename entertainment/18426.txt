Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman said Friday that his son Ameen might sing in Mani Ratnam's yet untitled upcoming bilingual project. The 12-yr-old has already hummed to the tunes of "NaNa" from the American film 'Couples Retreat'. "A lot of filmmakers want Ameen to act, but I want him to concentrate on studying", Rahman added.
