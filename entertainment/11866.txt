Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan has revealed that her husband Saif Ali Khan likes the "typical Indian, Kamasutra-ish kind of woman". "My husband always tells me, 'I don't like size zero', he likes the more curvy, rounded kind of women," said Kareena. The actress added that she feels "awful" about 'Saifeena' being a 'brand name'.
