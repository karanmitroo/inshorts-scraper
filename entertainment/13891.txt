The eight episode of 'Game of Thrones' season 6, which aired on Monday, is "not the greatest episode of the season", wrote Forbes. The Washington Post wrote the episode "is devoted to the things the characters on 'Game of Thrones' do for love of house, of honor and of individual people". Meanwhile, TV Fanatic called the episode "an overstuffed hour".
