Comedy group AIB was slammed by BJP supporters for sharing a picture of PM Narendra Modi's doppelganger along with one of PM Modi with a Snapchat dog filter. AIB was later slammed by Congress supporters when it deleted the tweet. "Will continue making jokes. And deleting if necessary. And making jokes again. And Apologizing if necessary," AIB's Tanmay Bhat tweeted.
