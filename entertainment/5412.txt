Akshaye Khanna has said that it's a terrible feeling for an artiste when appreciation, work, love and attention start slipping away. He added, "As much as I say I am uncomfortable with too much attention...in essence that's what I, every artiste works for." Akshaye also said the feeling of insecurity is prevalent in acting because actors are dependent on others.
