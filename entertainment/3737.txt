Actor Dileep, who was arrested in connection with the abduction of a Malayalam actress, has been granted permission to attend his father's death anniversary rituals on September 6. He'll be taken home under heavy police protection. The prosecution had reportedly argued that the actor shouldn't be allowed to attend the rituals, claiming he didn't take part in them last year.
