On being asked in an interview what he would do if he woke up as Karan Johar, actor Ajay Devgn replied, “I won’t want to wake up as him.” Earlier, Devgn had accused Kamaal R Khan of taking ₹25 lakhs from Johar to slam 'Shivaay'. Notably, Devgn's 'Shivaay' and Johar's 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' will both release on October 28.
