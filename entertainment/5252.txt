BJP Delhi President Manoj Tiwari on Friday urged Delhi's traders to stop selling Chinese goods to give a big blow to the Chinese economy. He added that China's economy was largely dependent on Indian markets and boycotting their goods would teach neighbours a lesson. He further said China was acting like a 'goonda' and is disturbed by India's growing power.
