Varun Dhawan has filed a second complaint with the police after a female fan, who had been constantly messaging him, allegedly threatened to commit suicide if the actor didn't respond to her. The threat came after Varun blocked her number and had filed the first complaint on November 2. "(We) are in the process of finding out details," police said.
