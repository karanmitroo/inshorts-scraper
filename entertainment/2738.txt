Vidya Balan, while speaking on the recent Harvey Weinstein row, said that it's shocking that no one spoke about his abuse for so many years. Vidya added, "(This) is a reflection of how women, however successful they maybe, don't feel safe addressing sexual harassment." Over 30 women, including actresses like Angelina Jolie, have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and rape.
