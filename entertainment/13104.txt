Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that handling two careers in two continents is "hard". "Between Quantico, I’ve shot my Hindi film which was called 'Bajirao Mastani' that released in December and my Hollywood movie which is ‘Baywatch’, which will release next year," said Priyanka. She added that this leaves her with no time to pursue music, which is her passion.
