Scientists have named two new ant species discovered in Papua New Guinea after the dragons that feature on the Game of Thrones (GoT) TV series. Named Pheidole drogon and Pheidole viserion, the species have spiny barbs along their backs and shoulders with unusual muscles. The team realised the jet-black colour and cream of the two ants matched the dragon scales.
