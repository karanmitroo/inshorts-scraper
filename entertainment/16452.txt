Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson starrer 'She's Funny That Way' which released in India this Friday "is just not so funny", wrote Economic Times. The humor of the film, also starring Imogen Poots and Rhys Ifans, is a little too obvious and mitigating, said Mid-Day. The Peter Bogdanovich directorial has been rated 2.5/5 (Economic Times, Mid-Day) and 2/5 (Indian Express).
