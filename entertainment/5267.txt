CBFC Chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while reacting to Lipstick Under My Burkha director Alankrita Shrivastava calling him a criminal, said she's a liar. Speaking about when they met during the film's screening for certification, he said, "I was never aloof, [or] rude...with her." Nihalani added the only point of curiosity about the film is that initially, CBFC refused to certify it.
