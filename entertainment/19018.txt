Model and media personality Peaches Geldof, the second daughter of Irish singer Bob Geldof, was found dead Monday at the age of 25. There was no immediate word on the cause of Geldof's death, but police called it "unexplained and sudden". Notably, Peaches had acknowledged using drugs in the past but said in a 2009 interview that she had quit.
