Mocking Donald Trump's suggestion to arm teachers to prevent school shootings, Avengers' actor Samuel Jackson called the US President a "m*thaf*k*a". Pointing out that Trump has "never been in a gunfight", Jackson tweeted, "Can someone that's been in a Gunfight tell (Trump)...the flaws of his Arm The Teachers plan??!!" Trump suggested arming teachers over the Florida shooting that killed 17.
