Indian cricketers Ravichandran Ashwin, Hardik Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were mentioned in an episode of American sitcom 'The Big Bang Theory'. While explaining cricket, Indian character Rajesh Koothrappali says, "That's Ravichandran Ashwin, he's amazing. He makes Hardik Pandya look like Bhuvneshwar Kumar," to which his friend Howard replies, "Woah...Save some syllables for the rest of us."
