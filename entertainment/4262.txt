Hollywood actor Dwayne Johnson took to social media to share a collage showing a new tattoo, made after modifying the Brahma Bull tattoo on his arm, that he has sported ever since he became a WWE champion. Calling it 'Evolution of the Bull', Dwayne wrote about the new tattoo, "Every detail is a reflection of my own personal history."
