Actress Sushmita Sen walked the ramp for designer Sashi Vangapalli's label 'Mugdha Art Studio' at Lakm√© Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017. The 41-year-old actress was seen wearing a purple gown for the walk, for which her daughter Renee reportedly chose the music. Sashi's collection for modern Indian women deeply rooted to their traditional roots was inspired by the Bidri art form.
