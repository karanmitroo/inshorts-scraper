Mumbai Police on Thursday issued an e-challan to Varun Dhawan on Twitter for taking a selfie with a fan from his car, for which the actor then apologised. However, Mumbai Police later mocked his apology, tweeting, "Quite a galactic coincidence for the photographer to be on the same signal to capture your gesture, in a good intent nevertheless risky."
