Comedian Kiku Sharda has said that there's no reason for Kapil Sharma's team to steal jokes as they have a think tank to fall back on. Kiku said this in response to comedian Abijit Ganguly's allegation that he copied Abijit's joke on 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. He added, "We can't keep track of who cracked what joke and when."
