Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya on Wednesday sparked a controversy by sending out an abusive tweet to senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan for seeking a stay on Yakub Memonâ€™s execution. Bhattacharya's tweet read, "An appointment is needed to even beat Prashant Bhushan with shoes." "I will hit Prashant Bhushan's dead body with torn cheap shoes," another tweet from him read.
