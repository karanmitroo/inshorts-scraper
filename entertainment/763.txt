Filmmaker Boney Kapoor has said that his daughter Janhvi Kapoor is not trying to be like her mother Sridevi. He added, "She is trying to be herself which is good. She (Sridevi) has been an iconic figure... so being her daughter why should Janhvi ape her." He further said that their daughter has her own individuality.
