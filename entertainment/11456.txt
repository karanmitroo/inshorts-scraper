Actor Aamir Khan, referring to a prank during the shooting of 1992 film 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar', said whenever he spits on a heroine's hand, she becomes number one. "Aamir used to... (say) 'Let me read your hand'. And then he'd spit on it. He used to do this to everyone and he's still doing this," filmmaker-choreographer Farah Khan added.
