A judge on Friday dismissed the lawsuit against singer Taylor Swift by DJ David Mueller, whom she accused of groping her in 2013. The judge stated that since he couldn't prove that Taylor ruined his career over allegations, she won't be held liable for his subsequent firing from his job. Mueller had also sought up to â‚¹19 crore as compensation.
