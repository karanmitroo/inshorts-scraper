Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that salaries of actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan cause huge losses for producers when their films do not do well. Kashyap added that producers should be blamed for paying actors "such high amount". Notably, the four actors featured in Forbes' 2016 list of top twenty highest paid actors.
