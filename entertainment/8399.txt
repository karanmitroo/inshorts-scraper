Actress Freida Pinto, in collaboration with San Francisco-based company Copia, helped deliver the leftover food from this year's Oscars to various communities in need in Los Angeles, US. She revealed that over 800 people have been fed so far as a result of the initiative. "Our aim is to ensure that no one goes hungry," said Pinto.
