Actor Dhanush, who was critically acclaimed for his performance in his last release 'Ranjhanaa', said that he went through some 33 scripts before accepting 'Shamitabh.' The 31-year-old said, "A lot of scripts came my way after Raanjhanaa, but there was nothing solid to back up my first Hindi film... I kept waiting for about 8-months when R Balki offered Shamitabh."
