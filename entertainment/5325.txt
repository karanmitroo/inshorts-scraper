Rajkummar Rao took to Twitter to share a collage showing the change in his physique for films 'Behen Hogi Teri', 'Trapped' and upcoming web series 'Bose'. "Building a character. Nothing gives me more high than the process of exploring someone else's life on screen," he wrote. Directed by Hansal Mehta, 'Bose' will be based on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's life.
