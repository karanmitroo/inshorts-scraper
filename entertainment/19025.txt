A sessions court Wednesday adjourned actor Salman Khan's trial in the hit-and-run case to April-8, as three witnesses could not be examined due to their unavailability. The new trial will require re-examination of witnesses and evidence. In this case, the actor faces the charge of 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', which attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years' jail.
