Actress Emma Watson's recent braless photo for 'Vanity Fair' magazine has prompted a debate amongst people wherein some of them have questioned her position as a feminist. Others have, however, defended Watson and argued that feminism and nudity are not "mutually exclusive". Emma can be seen wearing a cut-out crochet open top and a white lace skirt in the photo.
