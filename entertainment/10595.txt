'Roundhay Garden Scene', a short silent film from 1888, is the oldest surviving film in existence, as noted by the Guinness Book of Records. It was shot by French inventor Louis Le Prince using the Le Prince single-lens camera. Originally the scene was shot at 12 frames per second but a digitally remastered copy rendered it to only 2.11 seconds.
