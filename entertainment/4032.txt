Actress Bidita Bag, who replaced Chitrangda Singh in the Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz', has said she can promise no one will miss Chitrangda in the film. "I'm not boasting but I add a different kind of flavour to the film. You cannot compare the acting," added Bidita. She further said that the director Kushan Nandy wanted somebody very different.
