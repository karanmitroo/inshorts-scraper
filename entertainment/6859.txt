A lawsuit filed against actor Johnny Depp by his ex-managers claims that Depp needs a "mental examination" to control his spending and "flagrant bragging" about his money. It further states that "psychological issues" may have led to his "compulsive spending disorder". The report alleges that Depp spent over $75 million (â‚¹480 crore) for 14 houses worldwide.
