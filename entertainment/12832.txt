An anonymous writer, who claims to be a former Warner Bros employee, has written a letter to the film studio's CEO, in which the writer has called their upcoming film 'Wonder Woman' "another mess". The letter, which slams director Zack Snyder, added, "It is almost impressive how you keep rewarding the same producers and executives for making the same mistakes".
