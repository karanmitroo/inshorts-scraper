CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani has sent a legal notice to IIFA and its organisers for allegedly defaming him in an act at IIFA Awards 2017. The notice said Nihalani's picture was used in an inappropriate manner during a skit and he was referred to as a 'watchman'. It also demanded an unconditional apology and a pledge to not defame Nihalani.
