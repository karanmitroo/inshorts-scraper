Rajkummar Rao, while talking about the physical transformation he underwent for his roles, said he isn't doing something extraordinary. "Gaining or losing weight...shaving my head half, is part of the job and nothing extra," he added. Rajkummar further said, "As an actor, it helps internalise the drive because I don't see my real self in the mirror, but my character."
