Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani on Wednesday compared filmmaker Anurag Kashyap to "a child being denied a toy". Kashyap earlier called Nihalani a 'dictator' over censorship in the film 'Udta Punjab'. Nihalani added, "The filmâ€™s dialogue explicitly states Punjab is banjar (barren) land and the people are kanjar (wayward, promiscuous). Tell me is this not vilifying the whole of Punjab?"
