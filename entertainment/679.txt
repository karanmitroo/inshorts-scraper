Dylan O'Brien starrer 'Maze Runner: The Death Cure', which released today, "is neither as satisfying as Harry Potter nor as campy as Twilight," wrote Hindustan Times. "There are several fast-paced action sequences...that will keep you engaged," said The Times of India. Firstpost called the film "an overlong and unworthy finale." It was rated 2/5 (HT, Firstpost) and 3/5 (TOI).
