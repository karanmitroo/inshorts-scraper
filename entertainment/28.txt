The 50th anniversary of English rock band The Beatles' visit to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ashram was celebrated in Uttarakhand's Rishikesh. The band had visited the ashram to practice transcendental meditation in 1968 and had written nearly 50 songs there. The ashram, now commonly known as 'Beatles Ashram', has been turned into an eco-friendly tourism destination by the state authorities.
