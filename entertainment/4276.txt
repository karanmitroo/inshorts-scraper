AR Rahman will compose music for 'Little Dragon', the upcoming biopic on late actor Bruce Lee. The biopic will be directed by filmmaker Shekhar Kapur. "The film will be a contemporary take on Bruce Lee... It is important that audiences today can relate their own lives to the journey of Bruce Lee," Kapur had said earlier.
