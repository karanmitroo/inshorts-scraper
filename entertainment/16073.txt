Former MMA and WWE star Dave Bautista, who plays a villain in the latest Daniel Craig Bond movie, 'Spectre', on Monday released a video challenging actor Varun Dhawan for a pull-up match. In the video, Bautista asks Dhawan if he accepts the challenge or if he is "just another 'darpok' (coward)". In reply, Varun tweeted, "Will respond to @DaveBautista tomorrow".
