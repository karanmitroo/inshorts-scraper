Former Spice Girl and singer Melanie Brown (Mel B) has claimed that she was drugged by her estranged husband Stephen Belafonte throughout most of their 10-year marriage. She has further accused Belafonte of domestic violence in the divorce trial. Belafonte had earlier claimed that Brown suffered from cocaine and alcohol addiction, saying it was a "major issue" in their marriage.
