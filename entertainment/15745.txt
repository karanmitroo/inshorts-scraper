After a threat review, Mumbai Police has reduced or withdrawn security cover for 40 Bollywood celebrities including Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan. "A lot of manpower gets wasted in providing security to celebrities, and it is at times unwarranted," police said. Security was withdrawn for 25 celebrities including Producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Directors Rajkumar Hirani and Farah Khan.
