Alia Bhatt's mother Soni Razdan has said Alia does not need her guidance to choose films. "[S]he's quite a sorted individual who follows a strong instinct... As her mother, I'm always there, but Alia knows what she wants both professionally and personally," she added. Soni further said she was impressed by Alia's performances in Udta Punjab, Highway and Dear Zindagi.
