The size of India's music industry is expected to grow 90.7% to ₹2,060 crore by 2020 from ₹1,080 crore in 2015, according to a FICCI-KPMG report. The rise in the number of downloads and time spent on music streaming apps will help boost business. Advertising, which accounts for 80-90% of the industry's revenue, will remain the primary source of income.
