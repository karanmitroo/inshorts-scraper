Former wrestler and actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has said that his running for US President is a real possibility. He added, "Personally, I feel that if I were president, poise would be important. Leadership would be important. Taking responsibility for everybody." He added that he wouldn't shut out people who disagreed with him but talk to them about it.
