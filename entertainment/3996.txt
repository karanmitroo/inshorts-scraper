The Huma Qureshi starrer 'Partition: 1947' has been banned in Pakistan. Sharing the news of the film's ban, director Gurinder Chadha tweeted, "It is unfortunate my film has been banned in Pakistan. It will always be the land of my ancestors." Reports suggest that the film has been banned for the alleged misrepresentation of Pakistan's first Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
