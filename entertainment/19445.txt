The Central Board of Film Certification has asked Sanjay Leela Bhansali to cut short Ranveer-Deepika's lip lock in his upcoming film 'Ram Leela' by 50%. Bhansali had to comply in order to get a U/A certificate, said sources. All-in-all 'Ram Leela' was given 12 cuts, including some scenes showing alcoholism in alcohol-prohibiting Gujarat and some hand gestures by Ranveer.
