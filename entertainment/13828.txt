The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the release of the Shahid Kapoor starrer 'Udta Punjab'. The apex court was hearing a plea filed by Punjab-based NGO Human Rights Awareness Association to halt the screening of the film. The court, however, allowed the petitioner to approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
