Lipstick Under My Burkha will be the opening film at the 2017 Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. It will be screened for the first time in Australia, said the film's director Alankrita Shrivastava. The film was initially refused certification by the Indian censor board for being lady-oriented, having sexual scenes and audio pornography but was later cleared with FCAT's support.
