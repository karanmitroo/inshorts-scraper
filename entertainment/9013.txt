Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Jolly LLB 2' is just a film and not a documentary. "There will be some fictionalisation. We cannot be over-sensitive about every comment or situation in a film," he added. Nihalani further said a film must not be judged on the basis of its trailer.
