A man slammed IIFA awards on Facebook for falsely claiming that the ceremony will feature Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Hollywood actors Julia Roberts and Matt Damon. He also shared posters of the event featuring these actors. He further claimed that people paid ₹19,000 to ₹32,000 for their kids to dance with Salman Khan but the activity didn't happen.
