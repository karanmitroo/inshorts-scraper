Kamal Haasan has revealed that the 1994 film 'Mahanadi', which he co-wrote, was inspired by a real plot to kidnap his daughter for ransom. Kamal wrote, "My household help, all of them, conspired...they even did a dry run. By accident I discovered their plan." Kamal, who has two daughters Shruti and Akshara, didn't specify which daughter he was referring to.
