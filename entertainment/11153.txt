Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he doesn't understand romance and it is "not his duty" to believe it as an actor. "It is your duty to make others believe in what youâ€™re doing as an actor," the 51-year-old actor added. He further said that he believes that "the art is important" and not the artiste.
