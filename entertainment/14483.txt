Wrestler and Hollywood star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has launched The Rock Clock, an alarm clock app for Android and iOS. Users can enter a personal goal, set the alarm and wake up with a new message from The Rock. It doesnâ€™t have a snooze button and stores 25 custom alarm tones created by The Rock.
