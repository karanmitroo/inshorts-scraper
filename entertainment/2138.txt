Egyptian singer Shyma Ahmed has been arrested for "inciting debauchery" over a music video in which she is seen eating a banana in front of a group of men. In the video which was apparently shot in a classroom, the singer was also seen scribbling words like 'Class #69' and 'vag'. The video was taken down following the singer's arrest.
