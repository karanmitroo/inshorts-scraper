Actor-producer John Abraham recently said that he would rather go broke than produce an adult comedy. "I would definitely not do it. Not because it’s wrong, but I, as a person, will not do it", John said.  He added, “Would I do a Fifty Shades of Grey? Maybe, but would I do whatever is coming out? Hell no".
