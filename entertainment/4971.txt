Nawazuddin Siddiqui, while speaking about his tweet about being discriminated in the film industry on the basis of his skin colour, said it was just a reply to someone in the film industry. Nawazuddin further explained that his tweet was not directed towards the entire industry. "These things are there everywhere, not just in Bollywood," he added.
