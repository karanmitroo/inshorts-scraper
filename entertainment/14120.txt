Actor turned filmmaker Sohail Khan will reportedly replace singer Mika Singh as a judge on the show 'Comedy Nights Live'. Mika's dismissal from the show was said to be based on him featuring in 'The Kapil Sharma Show' to promote his songs from the upcoming film 'Housefull 3'. "I hope things get resolved soon," said Mika on the issue.
