The first look of Aamir Khan's upcoming film `P.K.` is finally out. The bare-bodied actor is seen covering himself with nothing but a transistor. “What do you think guys? Tell me fast... butterflies in my stomach!!!,” tweeted Aamir. The movie, directed by Rajkumar Hirani, also features Sanjay Dutt, Anushka Sharma and Sushant Singh Rajput. It hits theatres on Dec-19.
