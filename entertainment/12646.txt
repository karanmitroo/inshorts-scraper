As per reports, 'Gangnam Style' singer PSY and Korean pop group iKON were blurred from the reality show 'Ganshi Yingxiong', aired on the Chinese regional channel 'Jiangsu Television'. A Chinese TV show also deleted scenes featuring Korean singer Hwang Chi-yeul. The move is reportedly in response to South Koreaâ€™s decision to deploy an anti-missile defense system, made by the US.
