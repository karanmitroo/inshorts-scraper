Actor Ranbir Kapoor has gained more than 13 kilograms to portray Sanjay Dutt in the upcoming biopic on him. "[It] is all muscle and no fat. Ranbir has an hour-and-a-half of intense workout session... He even wakes up at 3 am [and] has a protein shake," said Ranbir's fitness trainer Kunal Gir. The biopic will be directed by Rajkumar Hirani.
