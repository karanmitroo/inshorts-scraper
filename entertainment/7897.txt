Two photo journalists have claimed that they were abused and beaten up by some crew members of the Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar starrer '2.0' in Chennai. They said that the incident happened when they questioned the crew over causing public inconvenience by blocking roads especially during the morning peak hour as the shoot was on a busy road.
