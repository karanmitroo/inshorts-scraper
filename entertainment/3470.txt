Sanjay Dutt has revealed that when he was in jail, his wife Maanayata used to lie to their twins Shahraan and Iqraa and tell them he was away shooting in the mountains where there's no network. "Luckily the jail authorities allowed me one call every fortnight, and I would make that call to them," Sanjay added.
