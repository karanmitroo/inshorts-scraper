The Censor Board of Pakistan has banned the Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Raees' from releasing in the country as its content undermines Islam and a specific religious sect, portraying Muslims as criminals, wanted persons and terrorists. Director Rahul Dholakia tweeted, "#raeesbanned in Pakistan??? Outraged!! Dumbfounded!!" Notably, Pakistani actress Mahira Khan made her Bollywood debut with the film.
