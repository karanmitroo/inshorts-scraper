A Ludhiana court has issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against actress Rakhi Sawant for her alleged objectionable remarks against sage Valmiki. The complaint was filed against Rakhi last year for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of the Valmiki community. After a warrant was issued against her in April 2017, Rakhi claimed she never spoke against sage Valmiki and issued an apology.
