While talking about the Jauhar scene from his film 'Padmaavat', filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali said, "It was scorching (hot) and we shot with 350 junior artistes...the challenge was more emotional than physical." He further said, "To then have some cynics dismiss the sequence...as socio-politically incorrect is a huge blow to all the hard work that we all did."
