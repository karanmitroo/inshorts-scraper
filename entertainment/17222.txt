A case against actor Aamir Khan and four others was quashed by the Gujarat High Court on Friday. The Gujarat Forest Department had filed the complaint on charges of illegal commercial filming of Chinkara, a protected animal, during the shoot of movie Lagaan in Kutch. The court found out that the footage of Chinkara in the film was computer-generated.
