Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh has slammed the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC) for refusing certification for the upcoming Hindi film 'Udta Punjab' and blamed the state's SAD-BJP government over the issue. The film revolves around Punjab's drug problems. “If you think that by not clearing the movie you will hide the truth, you are mistaken,” added Singh.
