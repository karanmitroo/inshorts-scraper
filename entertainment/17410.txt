Kangana Ranaut, who recently won National Award for her performance in 'Queen', will be seen in a biopic playing the role of Bollywood actress Meena Kumari, to be directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia. Confirming the news, Kangana said, "...I would be doing Sujoy Ghosh and Hansal Mehta's films, so I won't be able to start with Meena Kumari's biopic before mid-2016."
