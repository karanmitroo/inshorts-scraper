Actor Akshay Kumar emptied a toilet pit in Reghwan village located in Madhya Pradesh along with Union Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation Shri Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday morning. They held up the compost found in the toilet in their hands to demonstrate that the exercise is perfectly safe and that there should be no stigma attached to it.
