Actor Tiger Shroff has said he's an overprotective brother and is the kind of person who wants to wrap his sister in a blanket. He added, "I know that after saying this, people will...say, 'Oh, he's a sexist,' and I'll be called all sorts of names. But I don't care." Tiger's sister Krishna Shroff is three years younger to him.
