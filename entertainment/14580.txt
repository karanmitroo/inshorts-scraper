Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma on Saturday took to Twitter to say that actor Shah Rukh Khan might lose his stardom to Salman Khan, just like Kamal Haasan did to Rajinikanth. "Megastar SRK becoming ordinary fan,dwarf etc is as big a same blunder as what Kamal Hasan did to lose his stardom to Rajnikant (Salman Khan)", Varma tweeted.
