A court in Punjab has rejected the anticipatory bail application of Rakhi Sawant and issued a fresh arrest warrant against her for failing to appear in court on Monday in a case of hurting communal sentiments. Judicial magistrate Vishav Gupta posted the matter for September 5. Rakhi's lawyers said she couldn't appear in court as she was in the US.
