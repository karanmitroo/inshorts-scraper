Lyricist Javed Akhtar took to Twitter to condemn the two cases of lynching which happened earlier this week. While a police officer was lynched by a mob outside Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, a teenager was lynched on a Haryana-bound train for allegedly carrying beef. "Brothers n sisters We all need to think calmly where are we going," read Akhtar's tweet.
