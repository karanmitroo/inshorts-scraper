Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, whose directorial 'The Salesman' has been nominated for Oscars 2017, will not be allowed to enter the US to attend the award function owing to President Donald Trump's ban on Muslim visitors. Farhadi's film has been nominated in the Foreign Language category. Notably, Farhadi's film 'A Separation' was the first Iranian film to win an Oscar.
