Salman Khan, while talking about the failure of his film 'Tubelight', said people don't want to see him crying in films. "You are just thrown off because that's not what you expect from the movie," he added. Salman further said, "Throughout the promotions, I kept on saying that if you're expecting some action, then don't go and watch the movie."
