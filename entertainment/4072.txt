Actress Sayani Gupta has said that Indian TV is sh*t right now, while adding, "There's no good show on offer, and I won't work in anything that I myself won't watch." She further said Indian TV actors don't have much control when it comes to the development of a character. Currently, Sayani is seen in the web series 'Inside Edge'.
