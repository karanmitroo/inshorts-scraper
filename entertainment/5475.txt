Preity Zinta has launched Kavach Safety, an emergency response service for women. The "pro victim-anti perpetrator" service assures safety at the press of a button by helping in preventing incidents and assisting victims through medical services and trauma support. "I feel like we have a duty to the women of India to reduce the risk of violence," said Preity.
