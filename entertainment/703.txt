Responding to Swara Bhasker's open letter criticising 'Padmaavat' over the Jauhar scene, Deepika Padukone said she must have missed the disclaimer in the beginning of the film which states that it does not glorify Jauhar. "You probably went out to buy some popcorn," she added. Deepika further said it's important to see in which period the film was set.
