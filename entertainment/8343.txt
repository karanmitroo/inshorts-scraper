The owners of a theatre in US have opted not to screen 'Beauty and the Beast' because it features a gay character. "If we cannot take our 11-year-old granddaughter and 8-year-old grandson to see a movie we have no business watching it," read a statement. The film will be the first to feature a gay character in Disney's history.
