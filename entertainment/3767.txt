Actor Chunky Panday, while reacting to filmmaker Farah Khan's comment on his daughter Ananya's photo that she should undergo a DNA test as she is "too lovely to be Chunky's child", said he takes it as a compliment. "Farah...and I have a dark sense of humour, so we often crack such jokes about each other," added Chunky.
