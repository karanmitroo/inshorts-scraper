A producer filed a petition claiming the title and story of Rajinikanth's upcoming film 'Kaala Karikaalan' belongs to him. Further, he claimed that the film's title has been registered with the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce, and alleged that the chamber is misusing rules to "favour influential people". He asked the court to restrain the film's makers from shooting.
