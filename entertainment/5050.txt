National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam has demanded an apology from actor Kamal Haasan for publicly naming the victim in the Malayalam actress abduction case. Kumaramangalam said the actor's statement revealed the â€œpatriarchal mindset" among "VIPs, big guys...whether they are in politics or not in politics". "It also shows lack of humility in him," she added.
