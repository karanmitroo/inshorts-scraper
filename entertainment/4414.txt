Actress Bhumi Pednekar has said that when she was bigger in size, she was getting equal attention from men. "Nobody made me feel uncomfortable by looking at me in a different way. I wore clothes that I wanted to...flaunted my skin as per my wish," added Bhumi. She further said that men's attitude towards women is slowly but steadily changing.
