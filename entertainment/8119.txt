Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that with Salman Khan, there is a sense of seniority as the latter started working in films before the former. "I was new for four years, while he had been working," he added. While Salman made his Bollywood acting debut with 1988 film 'Biwi Ho To Aisi', SRK's debut film 'Deewana' released in 1992.
