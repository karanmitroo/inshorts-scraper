Around 15 unknown assailants attacked a clerk and broke windowpanes of a booking counter at a multiplex selling advance tickets for "Golion Ki Rasleela: Ram-Leela" in Rajkot. The multiplex later stopped ticket sales for the opening day shows. Kshatriya community members, who had objected to the use of certain words in the film, denied any involvement in the attack.
