Comedian Kapil Sharma has said it's very important to listen to people who do not flatter you. "Very often we actors and entertainers get cut off from reality because we surround ourselves with yes-men," he added. Kapil further said Rajiev Dhingra, the director of his film 'Firangi' is a friend who doesn't flatter him and tells him when he's wrong.
