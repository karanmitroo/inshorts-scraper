Actor Aamir Khan has decided not to release 'Dangal' in Pakistan after scenes featuring the Indian flag and Indian national anthem were asked to be cut by their censor board, as per reports. Aamir reportedly found the two cuts surprising as he felt Dangal does not portray extreme patriotism. Earlier this year, Pakistan lifted the ban on screening Indian films.
