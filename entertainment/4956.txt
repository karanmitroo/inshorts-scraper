Apoorva Lakhia, director of the upcoming film Haseena Parkar starring Shraddha Kapoor, has said that he had first approached Sonakshi Sinha to play the titular role. "She (Sonakshi) was doing Force 2 at that time and John was injured. Shraddha was totally my second choice. I knew she could play a 17-year-old and a 45-year-old too," said Lakhia.
