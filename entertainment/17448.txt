South African comedian Trevor Noah is set to succeed Jon Stewart as the host of Comedy Central's 'Daily Show.' Stewart had announced his plans to retire in February after a 17-year long run with the show. Critics claimed Comedy Central was probably influenced by the broader debate about racial diversity in comedy in their selection of the young biracial comedian.
