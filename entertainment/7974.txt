Actress Alia Bhatt has said that people are talking too much about the existence of nepotism in the Indian film industry. She added, "We need to stop." The debate on nepotism, which means the practice of using influence for favouring relatives or friends, began when actress Kangana Ranaut called filmmaker Karan Johar the "flagbearer of nepotism".
