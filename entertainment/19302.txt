Actor Manoj Kumar (76) has sought a meeting with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to get back 45 acres of his land, which was acquired by the Delhi government in 2005. "I have written 6-7 letters to the L-G and to the Delhi government, but not one has been answered. Now I want to see what Kejriwal can do," says Manoj.
