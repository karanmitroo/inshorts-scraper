Singer Sonu Nigam Sunday came forward in support of godwoman Radhe Maa by putting out a series of tweets. While one of it says “Kaali Maa is depicted in lesser clothes than Radhey Maa”, another one reads, "Men Saadhus can walk naked. Dance embarrassingly, but it takes a rape charge to put them behind bars. So much for Gender equality?"
