Actor Rana Daggubati, while talking about the success of Baahubali 2 in USA, said, "The high is the BBC or the Wall Street Journal speaking about us." He further said that an Indian film being number three in terms of releases in America, shows that franchises can cut across barriers. "We followed the old Indian way of story-telling," added Daggubati.
