Comedian Tanmay Bhat, referring to his 'Sachin vs Lata Civil War' video for which he was slammed, said the controversy's worst part is that the silly joke is the only thing cricketer Sachin Tendulkar will ever know him for. Tanmay wrote this in a note wishing Sachin on his 44th birthday. "Irrespective of jokes, I'll always love you," wrote Bhat.
