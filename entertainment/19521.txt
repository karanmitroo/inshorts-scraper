Hansal Mehta's 'Shahid', based on the life of human rights lawyer Shahid Azmi, released this Friday. The movie, starring Raj Kumar Yadav, Prabhleen Sandhu and KK Menon, has been awarded a 4 star by India Today, IBN Live, Deccan Chronicle and Indian Express. Azmi was murdered, presumably for defending a 26/11 accused, who was later acquitted by the Supreme Court.
