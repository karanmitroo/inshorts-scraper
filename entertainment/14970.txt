A sequel to the 1999 film 'Sarfarosh', which featured Aamir Khan, will happen next year, director John Mathew Matthan has said. “The sequel will have a different story. We are yet to zero-in on an area around which the plot would revolve,” John said. He added, "Once I am ready with the script I will talk to Aamir".
