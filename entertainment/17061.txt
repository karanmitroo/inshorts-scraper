Actress Vidya Balan has reportedly turned down an offer to star in the forthcoming biopic on the Bengali actress Suchitra Sen. "...I loved the script but I feel I have absolutely no physical resemblance with her," Vidya said.  "It is a Bengali-film so I feel Raima Sen, her grand daughter, who looks like her, should be doing it," she further added.
