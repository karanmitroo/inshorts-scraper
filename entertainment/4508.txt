The Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) has threatened to go on strike from August 15 if their demands of salary increments and eight-hour shift are not met by producers. The FWICE president said employees work for nearly 14-16 hours without security. "We don't have any problem with film (producers) but there is exploitation in television," the president added.
