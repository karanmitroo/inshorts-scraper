Actor Andrew Garfield, while talking about the effect his gay role in the play 'Angels in America' had on him, said, "I am a gay man right now just without the physical act." However, Andrew clarified he is not gay in real life while adding, "Maybe I'll have an awakening later in my life, which I'm sure will be wonderful."
