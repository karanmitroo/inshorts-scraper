A Pakistani TV channel has claimed PM Narendra Modi and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had killed actor Om Puri because he spoke in favour of Pakistani artistes. The channel claims Puri was recently summoned by Doval at his residence where he was beaten up, stripped, abused, and asked to go to Uri martyr's village and apologise for his remark.
