Several religious organisations in Senegal have called for the cancellation of singer Rihanna's visit to the country, accusing her of planning to promote homosexuality, which is illegal in the West African country. Rihanna is scheduled to arrive in Senegal on Friday for an education conference and had also planned to attend a Freemasons' conference which has now been cancelled.
