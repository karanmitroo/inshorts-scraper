Reacting to actor Kamal Haasan's remark on 'Hindu terror', the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha on Friday said that he and others like him should be shot dead or hanged. It further claimed that those who use abusive language for people belonging to the Hindu faith do not have "the right to live on this holy land".
