British-Indian composer Anoushka Shankar, daughter of late sitar player Pandit Ravi Shankar, has revealed when she was 14, a musician asked her if she would go up to his room. Talking about the #MeToo campaign through which many women shared their experiences of sexual assault and harassment, Anoushka said, "It's not enough if we don't try to make actual change."
