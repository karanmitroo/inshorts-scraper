Actor Rishi Kapoor has questioned public spaces in India being named after the Gandhis.
"Do they consider it their father's property?" tweeted Kapoor. "Why Indira G airport International? Why not Mahatma Gandhi or Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar or on my name Rishi Kapoor," he added. He further said that 'Film City' should then be named after Dilip Kumar or Amitabh Bachchan.
