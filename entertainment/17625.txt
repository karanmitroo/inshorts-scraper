Actor Sharman Joshi is all set to go nude in his upcoming film Hate Story 3. "We all enjoy erotica privately, so what's wrong if one is doing it in a film made for mass consumption?... If the script requires me to go butt-naked, I am willing to drop my pants", Joshi said. The film also features Zarine Khan.
