Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority on Tuesday announced it will suspend the licences of media outlets airing Indian content without any prior notice. Earlier, Pakistani channels were allowed to air 6% Indian content during a 24-hour transmission cycle. PEMRA recommended that permission to air Indian content should be linked with Indian government's decision to air Pakistani content.
