In a letter to his twins Yash and Roohi, filmmaker Karan Johar wrote, "Mothers of your classmates will come to drop them in school, but you'll have your father." "While your classmates' mothers will make a WhatsApp group to discuss your homework, I'll be the only father in it," he added. Johar further wrote being different doesn't make them wrong.
