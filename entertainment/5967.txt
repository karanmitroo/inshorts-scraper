Comedian Kapil Sharma, while responding to a fan's query about Sunil Grover returning to his show, tweeted, "Jab b unka dil kare...I told him many times." Sunil hasn't shot for the show after he and Kapil were involved in a brawl on a flight in March. Kapil reportedly physically assaulted Sunil and threw a shoe at him.
