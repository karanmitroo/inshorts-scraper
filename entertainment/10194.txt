Actor Rishi Kapoor, while slamming people for trolling the name of Kareena Kapoor's newborn baby, tweeted, "Why are people so bothered what the parents want to name their child, please? Mind your business, it's got nothing to do with you". "A lot of people are going to be blocked if any more arguments happen," he further wrote.
