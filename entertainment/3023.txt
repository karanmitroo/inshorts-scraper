'Baahubali' actor Prabhas said even after being in the industry for 13-14 years now, he still doesn't know how to handle stardom. "I'm still shy when I go to interviews. I want a lot of people...to watch my film but I can't face (that many) people," added Prabhas. He further said he's better than before and is trying to improve.
