According to reports, actress Kangana Ranaut has hired her rumoured ex-boyfriend Hrithik Roshan's former manager Anjali Atha. Anjali had worked for Hrithik during the legal battle between him and Kangana. The spat between them began after Hrithik sent her a legal notice over Kangana calling him a "silly ex" in an interview in 2016.
