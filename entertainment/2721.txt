Ayushmann Khurrana, while speaking about nepotism in Bollywood, said had he been a star kid he'd have been launched by the age of 22 or 23. "Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Ranbir Kapoor are talented. They're not getting films just because they're star kids. But yes, they did get opportunities faster," he added. Ayushmann made his acting debut at 27.
