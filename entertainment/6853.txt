Deepika Padukone broke down on the sets of 2013 film Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela because of some last-minute changes in the dialogues, revealed the film's writer. "She's (Deepika) usually very good with memorising her lines but the change meant completely upsetting her pattern," said co-writer Garima Wahal. The writers later worked on the lines till Deepika was comfortable with them.
