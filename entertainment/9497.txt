Actor Rishi Kapoor revealed that he was two-years-old when he first started taking 'bribes'. He explained that he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoor's film 'Shree 420' and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. He said this during a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival.
