Talking about rape-accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, actress Kate Winslet said, "He was just so horrible to deal with... He didn't like me because I wouldn't be bullied by him." The actress added, "I was one of the ones he would label 'difficult' because I wouldn't do the things he would ask for me to do on a business-level."
