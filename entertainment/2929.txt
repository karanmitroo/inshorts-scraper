US rapper Eminem called President Donald Trump a "kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust" in a freestyle rap played at 2017 Black Entertainment Television Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday. Adding, "Racism's the only thing he's (Trump) fantastic for," Eminem slammed Trump over the North Korea issue, his response to Puerto Rico and the NFL national anthem protest.
