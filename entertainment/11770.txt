Actress Dia Mirza has said that patriotism in its true spirit does not propagate hatred. "Patriotism that propagates hate is not patriotism. United we rise. Divided we fall. Politicians polarise to rule, not serve society," the actress wrote on Twitter. The post comes amidst the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan.
