According to Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali, Pakistanis too are victims of terrorism. Referring to the recent Peshawar school terror attack, Shafqat said, "Sometimes, out of a terrible incident, something good evolves. I think for the first time, people have realized that we (Pakistanis), too, are the victims of terrorism, and not terrorists, what they have been thinking all along."
