A third poster of the Amir Khan starrer 'PK' was unveiled on Tuesday. The motion poster shows Khan dressed in an over-sized police uniform. It also features Sanjay Dutt wearing the same band member uniform that Khan wore in the second poster. PK asks audiences in the motion poster, "Phir tukur tukur dekothe ho? Confusiya gaye? Ae hum naahi hai".
