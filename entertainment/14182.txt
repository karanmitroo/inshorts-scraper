Commenting on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's purple lipstick, Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor said that the former Miss World "wanted to be discussed" which is "the whole idea of fashion and make-up". Calling Aishwarya's move 'great' and 'cool', Sonam added, "I have done purple lipstick in the past, I have even done black for a shoot... People havenâ€™t spoken about me."
