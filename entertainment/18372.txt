Following objections by southern superstar Rajnikanth, director Faisal Saif changed the name of his film from 'Main Hoon Rajnikanth' to 'Main Hoon Rajni'. Feeling that the title and content might upset fans, Rajnikanth had filed an interim injunction. Saif said that the name had to be changed as the producer's money was at stake. The film will release on Oct-17.
