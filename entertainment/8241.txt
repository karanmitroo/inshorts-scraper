Delhi-based designers Shivan and Narresh have accused Prabal Gurung of copying the design of the gown worn by actress Faye Dunaway at the Oscars. "It's really shocking. You could be inspired from a particular artist, but this is going a little too far," said Shivan. However, they said they do not plan to take any legal action against Gurung.
