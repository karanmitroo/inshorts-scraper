The US Federal Trade Commission has revealed that Warner Brothers paid YouTube celebrities for positive review videos for its game ‘Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor.’ Rather than labelling videos as promoted content, the celebrities put a disclaimer in the video description, making it less likely to be seen by the viewers. The company, however, wasn't ordered to pay any fine.
