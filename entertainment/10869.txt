Model Gigi Hadid, who hosted American Music Awards 2016, imitated USA's next First Lady Melania Trump at the event. "I gotta do the face right," she said, before going on to enact Melania, saying, "I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children, Sasha and Malia."  Following this, she was slammed on Twitter for being "racist" and a "bully".
