Ekta Kapoor has said Indian television content is not regressive while questioning, "Why don't we call Game of Thrones regressive?" She added, "It is the same thing - you watch a woman give birth to dragons there, you have a red woman killing, a red wedding." Ekta said that writers, who write one show for eight years, should be applauded.
