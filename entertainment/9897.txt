Swara Bhaskar has demanded the resignation of Karnataka's Home Minister G Parameshwara while tweeting, "[Y]ou share the mentality of the molesters." This was in response to the alleged mass molestation which took place in Bengaluru on New Year eve. Swara added, "Shameful that law breakers, law makers & law keepers are united in the warped logic that women invite rape/molestation."
