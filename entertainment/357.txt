'Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai' actor Sumeet Raghavan has said that in India, it's like living in a sex starved nation. He said this following the incident where a man inside a BMW car started masturbating in front of the actor's wife. "It was the case 30 years ago too...even when our parents were children, such cases came to light," added Sumeet.
