A witness in Salman Khan's 2002 alleged hit-and-run case has stated that the actor did not have a licence at the time of the incident, and procured it only in 2004. "The witness deposed in lieu of a charge framed against Khan under the Motor Vehicles Act for not possessing a licence," special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat said.
