Responding to a troll on Twitter who said filmmaker Anurag Kashyap does not have the courage to call out on "Islamic terrorism", Kashyap called him a "kiraye ke deshbhakt". Kashyap also reminded him of his film 'Black Friday' which was made on the 1993 Mumbai blasts. The troll further wrote that Kashyap doesn't know the difference between hooliganism and terrorism.
