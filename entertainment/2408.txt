Actress Mahira Khan has said regardless of how she conducts herself, what she wears, or how she speaks, nobody is allowed to harass her. "I've been lucky with the people I've worked with," she added. Mahira further said, "Also, I started acting after I became a mother, I wasn't as vulnerable as maybe if I was a teenager."
