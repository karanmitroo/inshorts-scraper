Zareen Khan has said that people have no right to judge others saying 'Oh! She is a girl, she is wearing a short dress and she is a Muslim'. Zareen said this while responding to the criticism that Mahira Khan received for smoking and wearing a dress. Zareen added, "Everybody has an opinion...as if they're out to...correct the world."
