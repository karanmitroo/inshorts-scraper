Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui will be rapping for his upcoming film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz'. "When you get down to actually doing it, you realise it's not that difficult," he said. Nawazuddin further said that since he does not have a problem in remembering long dialogues, he is not worried about remembering the rhyming lyrics of the rap.
