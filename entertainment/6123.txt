Actress Priyanka Chopra has been slammed on Facebook by a user who wrote that she should have the "basic sense of covering" her legs when she met PM Narendra Modi in Berlin. Other users pointed out that she should have worn an "Indian dress" and should not have been sitting cross-legged in front of the PM.
