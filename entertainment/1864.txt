Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted that his office received condolence calls following the demise of veteran actor Shashi Kapoor on Monday. "Reports of my demise are, if not exaggerated, at least premature," added Tharoor. The calls came after Times Now, in their tweet about Madhur Bhandarkar's condolence message on Shashi's demise, made a typographical error and wrote Tharoor's name instead.
