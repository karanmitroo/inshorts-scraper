Actor Hrithik Roshan has slammed the lifestyle brand 'Tommy Hilfiger' for reportedly using a photo of him and his sons without permission to endorse its Spring/Summer 2017 collection. "Dear Tommy. I don't wear you, neither do my kids endorse you... Please (hil)figure yourself out," he tweeted. The brand has not responded to Roshan's tweet yet.
