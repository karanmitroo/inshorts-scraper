NRI filmmaker Mitesh Patel is all set to make a Rs 40-crore movie on Narendra Modi's journey from a common man (tea-stall worker) to the CM of Gujarat. The yet untitled movie is likely to go on floors in September. The film's director and cast are still to be locked but the producer has his eyes set on Paresh Rawal.
