Actor Rajeev Khandelwal is likely to return to the small-screen with producer Srishti Arya's show. Khandelwal, once a popular face of television, went on to try his luck in Bollywood and managed to give a critically acclaimed performance in 'Aamir'. Reportedly, he has been offered the role of a strongly-opinionated person in the show, expected to go on-air next month.
