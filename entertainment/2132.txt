Former Chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Pahlaj Nihalani has said a state cannot ban a film before it has been certified by the board. Nihalani added that a state can ban a film after certification only if it threatens to disrupt law and order. He further said, "A certificate is yet to be issued to 'Padmavati'."
