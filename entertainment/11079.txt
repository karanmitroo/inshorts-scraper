The Farhan Akhtar starrer film 'Rock On 2' collected ₹2.02 crore on its opening day, reportedly due to the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes. "It did cross my mind to push the release date of the film but it was too late because our overseas delivery was already done," said the film's producer Ritesh Sidhwani.
