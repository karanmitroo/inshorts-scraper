The UP Police Twitter handle on Friday shared a photo collage of criminals who surrendered voluntarily in the wake of recent encounters, with a reference to Salman Khan's movie 'Dabangg' in the caption. The image, which showed news clippings of the criminals, was captioned, "Police se nahi, crime se darr lagta hai sahab."
