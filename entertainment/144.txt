Singer-composer Shankar Mahadevan has said that the music industry is like fashion, while adding, "Things keep coming, things keep going, trends keep changing." He added, "There is good music, bad music, and mediocre music." "Everything co-exists but at the end of the day, it is a good song which wins," Mahadevan further said.
