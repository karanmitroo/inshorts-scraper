Actress Fatima Sana Sheikh has said that she hopes to work with actor Kamal Haasan again following the 1997 film 'Chachi 420', where Fatima appeared as a child actor. In the film, Fatima had played the role of Haasan's daughter. "I don't remember much about working with Kamal Haasan sir as I was too small," added Fatima.
