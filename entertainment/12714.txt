British band 'Coldplay' has released the official video for the fourth single from their new album 'A Head Full of Dreams'. The video, which begins with Charlie Chaplin's speech from the 1940 film 'The Great Dictator' shows the band cycling on the streets of Mexico city. It also features shots of the band's concert in Mexico City back in April.
