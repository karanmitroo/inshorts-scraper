Music composer AR Rahman has said that his production '99 Songs' is set to go on floors after four years of work. He added that it is a Hindi film with a hero from Kashmir. "We are releasing a virtual reality promo, not exactly a promo, but a gist of the whole thing, probably in a month," said Rahman.
