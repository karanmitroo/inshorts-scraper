Rabiya Khan, the mother of actress Jiah Khan who committed suicide in 2013, has written an open letter to PM Narendra Modi seeking justice for her daughter. In the letter, Rabiya wrote that the Central Bureau of Investigation failed to conduct a proper investigation and injuries on Jiah's body suggest it was a murder made to look like a suicide.
