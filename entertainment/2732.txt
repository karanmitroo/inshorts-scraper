Oscar-nominated writer-director James Toback has been accused of sexual harassment by 38 women. Many of the women have alleged that the 72-year-old approached them on the streets of New York City and promised to cast them in films. They further claimed he would invite them to his hotel room for meetings and would masturbate in front of them.
