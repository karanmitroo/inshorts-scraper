The Film Certificate Appellate Tribunal has given clearance to a documentary about Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal by ordering the Censor Board to issue UA certificate. The Censor Board had earlier asked the documentary makers to get no objection certificates from political personalities and delete references to the Congress and BJP. The tribunal overruled this saying it would kill documentary cinema.
