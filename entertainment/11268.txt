Late television actress Pratyusha Banerjee's lawyer Neeraj Gupta has claimed that her boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh forced her into prostitution. Gupta's allegations are based on Pratyusha's last telephonic conversation where she tells Rahul, "I didn't come here to sell myself, I came here to act. Where are you putting me today?" The word "prostitution" was also mentioned in the conversation.
