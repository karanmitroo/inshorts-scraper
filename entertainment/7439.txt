Chairperson of National Film Awards jury Priyadarshan has asked why people are questioning Akshay Kumar's National Award win. He added, "When Ramesh Sippy was jury head Amitabh Bachchan won. When Prakash Jha was jury head, Ajay Devgn won. No one questioned them." This comes after numerous social media users attributed Akshay's win to his friendly equation with Priyadarshan.
