Reacting to Texas' The Alamo Drafthouse theatre announcing a women-only screening of 'Wonder Woman', a user tweeted, "Calm down, bros. you still have like, everything else." Another tweet read, "If you had a guys only screening of Thor 3, there'd be an uproar and you know it." Meanwhile, another user tweeted, "Not impressed Alamo. Feminism is about equality, not gender-exclusivity."
