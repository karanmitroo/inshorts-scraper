Amitabh Bachchan, while speaking at the press meet held to announce the launch of 'Global Citizen Festival' in India, questioned why a woman or wife should "walk ten steps behind their husband". "Fifty percent of the strength of our nation should be women. They need their dignity, their presence and honour in our society," added Bachchan.
