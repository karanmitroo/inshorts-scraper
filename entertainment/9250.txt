Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali in an official statement has clarified that there is no dream sequence or any objectionable scene between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in 'Padmavati'. "We are confident that Mewar will be proud of the film made on their revered queen," added the statement. However, it mentioned the vandalising of sets as damaging to Jaipur's image.
