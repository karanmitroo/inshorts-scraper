Riteish Deshmukh starrer 'Bangistan' has been banned in the UAE, producer Ritesh Sidhwani said. “It is very disappointing that the censor board finds the film offensive as there is no such content in the film. We shall be sending it to the re-examining committee,” Sidhwani said. The film is about two suicide bombers who are brainwashed into an explosive mission.
