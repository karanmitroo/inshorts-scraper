While referring to the â‚¹10 crore reward for beheading Deepika Padukone and Sanjay Leela Bhansali over 'Padmavati' row, comedian Kapil Sharma said that it's a democratic country but one cannot chop someone's head off. "CBFC should see it (the film). If they find something objectionable, they are a government department. (But) the threats are wrong," added Kapil.
