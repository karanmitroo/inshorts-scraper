Actress Deepika Padukone has said she never thought that she could be a heroine in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's films. "Ten years ago, thinking that I don't fit the mould...and today working in three films with him back-to-back...It's been a pretty incredible journey," added Deepika. She further said Bhansali has helped her improve as an actor and as a human being.
