Talking about his memoir 'An Unsuitable Boy', Karan Johar said writing things that he didn't want to address and share opened up his soul even more. He added, "Sometimes, talking...conversing helps." The memoir included chapters where Karan and his co-writer Poonam Saxena described his fallout with Kajol and also addressed the filmmaker's sexual orientation.
