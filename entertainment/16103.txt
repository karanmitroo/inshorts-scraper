Salman Khan starrer 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo', which released on November 12, has become the second highest opening day grosser of all time. With a collection of about ₹40 crore at the box office on its opening day, PRDP failed to break the record of 'Happy New Year' (HNY). Notably, HNY had earned over ₹44 crore on its foremost day.
