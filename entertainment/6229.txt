Actress Priyanka Chopra, on her appearance on 'Dirty Laundry', revealed that a jacket which she often wears to airports belongs to an ex-boyfriend. She added, "Things get exchanged. It stopped being him...after it stayed back in my house once and I just kind of wore it." Priyanka added she refused to return the jacket when the ex-boyfriend asked for it.
