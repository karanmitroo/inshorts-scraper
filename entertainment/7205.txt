Mumbai-based maid hiring service BookMyBai has banned Bollywood celebrities from hiring maids through its platform after over 20 celebrities allegedly mistreated their domestic help. BookMyBai's Co-founder Anupam Sinhal said the maids were abused physically and verbally, refused emergency leaves and even denied adequate meals. "We're fine if we don't earn money from a certain employer," he added.
