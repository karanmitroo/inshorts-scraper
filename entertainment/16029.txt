According to media reports, the government is likely to sack Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC) chief Pahlaj Nihalani for making a video praising PM Narendra Modi. Reportedly, the I&B Ministry took the decision after watching Nihalani's interview on a news channel wherein calling himself "sanskari", he confessed not watching 'Spectre' but being happy with the cuts in the film.
