A lot is expected out of the auction that will offer more than 140 items from Madonna's life, next month at Beverly Hills. Besides costumes, gowns and jewellery, it will also feature the wedding dress, veil and shoes she wore while marrying Sean Penn, and also their annulment papers. The in-house and online auction starting Nov-7, can raise about $500,000.
