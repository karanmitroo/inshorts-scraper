Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he hated having to sit and declare his nationalism in a video message before the release of his film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil',
wherein he said he won't work with Pakistani actors in the future. He added, "I looked like I had a gun to my head...Brought to my knees with a hostage video."
