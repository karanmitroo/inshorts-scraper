The Punjab government has banned the movie 'Santa Banta Private Limited' with immediate effect for portraying the Sikh community in a denigrating and defamatory manner. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Managing Committee pushed for the ban and said there was a unanimous feeling in the Sikh community that the movie was making a laughing stock of the community.
