Actor Sooraj Pancholi has said that ninety percent of rumours about actors are true. "It is sad that an actor's personal life is out there. But it comes with the job. People want to know about you," said Sooraj. However, he shared how when he went out with a cousin, it was reported that he was "spotted with a girl".
