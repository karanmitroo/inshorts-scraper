Supporting PM Narendra Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Film and TV Producers Guild has urged its members to not display posters of their films on public walls and government-maintained structures. Guild president Mukesh Bhatt said he wished to set an example by ensuring that the posters of his forthcoming film 'Khamoshiyan' are not pasted on public walls.
