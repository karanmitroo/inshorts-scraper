Actor Ranveer Singh has said that he loves being looked upon as a sex symbol. He further revealed that he has been "hit on" by men, and it has been happening to him for years, even before he was "famous". "I have had my phase of philandering and
promiscuity. You eventually evolve out of that," the 31-year-old actor added.
