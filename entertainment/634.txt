Reacting to backlash over her letter to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, actress Swara Bhasker said, "It was unfortunate that having a different...opinion could be seen as dissent and dissent could be passed off as sedition." She added, "There's a real problem of intolerance of opinion in India." Swara had earlier said that she felt "reduced to a vagina" after watching 'Padmaavat'.
