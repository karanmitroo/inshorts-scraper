Bollywood actress Karisma Kapoor's husband Sanjay Kapur has filed a fresh petition in a family court alleging that his wife married him only for money. He has further claimed in the petition that the actress has failed not only as a wife and daughter-in-law, but also as a mother. Notably, Karisma had recently withdrawn her consent from the divorce petition.
