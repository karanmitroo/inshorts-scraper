Anya Singh, who will make her acting debut opposite Raj Kapoor's grandson Aadar Jain in 'Qaidi Band', said people told her that she doesn't have the height or looks to be an actress. "I feel things have changed...it's more about your art...our industry has progressed," added Anya. She further said she is fortunate to be launched by Yash Raj Films.
