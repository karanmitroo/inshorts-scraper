Air India is planning to warn comedian Kapil Sharm over his unruly behaviour during a recent Melbourne-Delhi flight. Air India chief Ashwani Lohani has sought a report into the incident, wherein a reportedly drunk Sharma slapped and hit comedian Sunil Grover with a shoe. He verbally abused his colleagues, including Ali Asgar, before the pilot was forced to intervene.
