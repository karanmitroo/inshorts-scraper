A defamation case has been filed against actor Kamal Haasan for hurting religious sentiments a day after he stated that 'Hindu terror is now a reality in India'. In a column for a Tamil weekly magazine, Haasan further wrote, "Hindu right-wing groups have unprecedentedly started indulging in acts of violence." The hearing in the case has been scheduled for tomorrow.
