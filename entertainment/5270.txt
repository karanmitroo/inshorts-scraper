Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while reacting to Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam's letter to show him 'Indu Sarkar' before censoring, said, "Why's he asking the CBFC to show him the film?" He added, "He should ask the producer or director." Nirupam had written that he wishes to see the film to ensure that Congress leaders aren't shown in bad light.
