Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani has said that 'Munna Bhai 3' will be his last film in the 'Munna Bhai' film series. He added that after this film, someone else could take the franchise forward but it has to be equally good. The film will mark the return of Sanjay Dutt as 'Munna Bhai' and Arshad Warsi as his sidekick 'Circuit'.
