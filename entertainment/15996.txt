Disney on Sunday sued the producers of Vacaciones de Aventuras (Adventure Holidays) for illegally copying their prominent characters including Spider-Man and Captain America. Millions of dollars have been demanded by Disney for the use of its trademark characters. The same company was sued earlier by Disney for copying its mouse house characters in the show Aventura Congelada (Frozen Adventure).
