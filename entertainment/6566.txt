David Hasselhoff, who played the character of Mitch Buchannon in the original Baywatch television series, said that Priyanka Chopra's 'Baywatch' is funny, pushing the envelope, but is not Baywatch. He added, "This is gonna make a lot of money, but it's still not Baywatch. You can't re-create David Hasselhoff." Dwayne Johnson will play Hasselhoff's character in the upcoming film.
