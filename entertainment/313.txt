Singer-turned-BJP MP Babul Supriyo has said Bollywood should show solidarity and take a stand against working with Pakistani artistes. "With our soldiers being martyred, it's not appropriate for us to work with Pakistani artistes," he added. Babul had earlier demanded that Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's song from the film 'Welcome to New York' should be removed.
