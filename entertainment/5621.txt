Hollywood actress Emma Watson announced on Twitter that she will be hiding copies of Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Handmaid's Tale' in Paris. This is a part of her collaboration with The Book Fairies, an organisation that hides books around cities for people to discover and read. Previously, she dropped off feminist books at various women's memorials on Women's Day.
