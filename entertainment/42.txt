Filmmaker Abhinay Deo has said Irrfan Khan never showed any signs of illness during the shooting of the film 'Blackmail'. "I haven't called him because... during such a time, [he and his family] need their privacy," he added. Deo further said the release date of 'Blackmail', which is currently scheduled to release on April 6, will be postponed if needed.
