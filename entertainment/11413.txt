Singer Arijit Singh has criticised 'Wajah Tum Ho' music composer Abhijit Vaghani on Facebook for tuning his voice in the song 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas' for the film. "I don't understand why people act smart... I'm so ashamed of this rendition," the singer said. "Thank you really for cheating me. A classic insult to the original song," he added.
