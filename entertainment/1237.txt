Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that Bollywood is twenty years behind Hollywood when it comes to making women-centric commercial films. "In Hollywood there are many female-oriented films that are such big blockbusters. We don't have such films in India," she added.  Sonam will be seen along with three other actresses in her upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding'.
