Actor Shahrukh Khan has refused to comment on his relationship with film star Salman Khan, and prefers to remain mum on the much hyped hug with him. The two stars who were not in talking terms after an incident at Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif's birthday bash in 2008, hugged each other at an Iftaar party in Mumbai, fuelling rumors of patch-up.
