Kristen Stewart, while hosting the comedy show 'Saturday Night Live', said, "I don't think Donald Trump hated me, I think he's in love with my boyfriend." She said this to explain Trump's tweets slamming Kristen in 2012 after she got back with her then boyfriend Robert Pattinson following a brief breakup. "Robert should dump Kristen," read one of Trump's tweets.
