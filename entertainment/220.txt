Late actress Sridevi was paid ₹11 lakh for 1987 film 'Mr. India'. Producer Boney Kapoor, who later married Sridevi, said, "When she asked for ₹10 lakh, I offered her ₹11 lakh because I wanted to be close to Sri." Sridevi once said, "It took me many years to finally accept the fact that I was destined to be with Boney."
