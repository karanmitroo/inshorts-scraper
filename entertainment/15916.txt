Veteran actor Dilip Kumar, 93, was presented the country's second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan, by Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Mumbai on Sunday. He was known as the 'Tragedy King' for his performance in movies like Devdas, Mughal-e-Azam and Saudagar. He could not receive the award at the presentation ceremony in Delhi this April owing to health restrictions.
