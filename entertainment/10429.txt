Tamil actor Rajinikanth has said the recently-deceased CM Jayalalithaa had lost the Tamil Nadu state assembly elections in 1996 because of a speech he made. "If Jayalalithaa is voted back to power, even God cannot save Tamil Nadu," Rajinikanth had said. Calling her a "kohinoor diamond" while paying his last tributes, Rajinikanth praised Jayalalithaa for standing strong against patriarchy.
