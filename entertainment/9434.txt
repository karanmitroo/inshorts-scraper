Actress Priyanka Chopra has said she was misquoted and she didn't say that Indian male actors don't have the guts to try in Hollywood. "I didn't use the word- 'guts', I said, 'Maybe because they haven't tried.' I don't know where 'guts' came from," she added. Priyanka also added that whatever she had said was in a lighter vein.
