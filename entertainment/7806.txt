An FIR has been filed against filmmaker Shirish Kunder in Lucknow for his recent tweet on the new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Kunder had earlier slammed Adityanath's appointment as the new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, while saying that even Dawood Ibrahim can now be made the CBI Director. However, his tweets were later deleted.
