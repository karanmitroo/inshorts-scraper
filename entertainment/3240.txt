The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has provisionally suspended coach Kripa Shankar for an "objectionable" social media post in which he equated the federation with a mule. Shankar, who trained Aamir Khan for 'Dangal', had criticised WFI for partial implementation of new rules in a national event. Shankar had also posted an image of a mule on WFI's logo.
