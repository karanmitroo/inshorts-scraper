The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a plea filed by Adarsh Cooperative Society members to stay the release of Sidharth Malhotra and Manoj Bajpayee-starrer 'Aiyaary'. The plea alleged that the film showed petitioners in a bad light, which could adversely affect the trial of Adarsh scam. Earlier, Defence Ministry had demanded changes to scenes they found objectionable in the film.
