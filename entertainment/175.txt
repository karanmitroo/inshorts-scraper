Reality television personality Kim Kardashian took to Instagram to share the first picture of her newborn daughter Chicago West. "Baby Chicago," she wrote in the photo's caption. The baby was born via surrogacy in January, as Kim had earlier suffered pregnancy-related complications. Kim has two other children, North and Saint, with husband Kanye West.
