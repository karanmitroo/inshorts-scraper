'Taare Zameen Par' writer Amole Gupte has said that children being made to participate in reality shows is cruel and inhuman. He added, "They're made to shoot for countless hours, sometimes in humid non-air conditioned rooms. It's barbaric." Gupte further said that the government needs to enforce laws against children being made to work long hours.
