Saif Ali Khan starrer 'Kaalakaandi', which released on Friday, "is a thriller at best and an attempted comedy at worst," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). "Barring Saif Ali Khan, 'Kaalakaandi' has nothing to offer," wrote Times of India (TOI). NDTV called it a "fizzy, freewheeling film." It has been rated 2/5 (HT), 2.5/5 (TOI) and 3/5 (NDTV).
