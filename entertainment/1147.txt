A French court has ordered that Mallika Sherawat and her boyfriend Cyrille Auxenfans be evicted from their apartment in Paris over non-payment of rent. The owner of the apartment said she only made a single payment. Although the couple's lawyer said they were in financial difficulty, the apartment's owner dismissed the argument claiming she earned millions during the rental period.
