Singer Alka Yagnik, while talking about Bollywood singers in the present times, said, "Gaadiyan (cars) chahiye, ghar chahiye. People have started working only for money." She added that though there are many talented singers, they do not know how to find a footing in the industry. She further said that for today's singers, showbiz and glamour are the top priorities.
