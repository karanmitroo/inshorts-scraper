Neerushaa Nikhat, the producer of late TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee's last short film, has claimed that Pratyusha kept saying she wanted to commit suicide. "She was very upset. One day, she started vomiting blood (on sets)," added Nikhat. Pratyusha had committed suicide by hanging herself in her apartment on April 1 last year, one-and-a-half months after the film was shot.
