Actor Anupam Kher has said that he comes from a family where in his childhood the entire family used one toilet, which was in a poor condition, for 19 years. Anupam added, "I felt and smelt the issue...open defecation is a huge issue, especially for ladies." He further said that not having access to toilets is an assault on privacy.
