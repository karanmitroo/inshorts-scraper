Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Irrfan Khan starrer 'Jazbaa' will be dubbed in many international languages, including English, Arabic, Portuguese and Spanish, film director Sanjay Gupta said. "There are cuts of the film being readied, dubbed and released widely... So there are international cuts with a slighter shorter length that will be going out apart from the diaspora release," Gupta added.
