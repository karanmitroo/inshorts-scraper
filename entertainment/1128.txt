Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said the biopics made in Bollywood are "not honest", adding that such films have become a formula now. "People with [just one] achievement have a biopic being told about them. Or people whose life is not over yet," he added. Kashyap further said he finds Bollywood biopics very "manipulative" and doesn't like most of them.
