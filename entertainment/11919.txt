Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has said that he will not allow the release of 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and 'Raees', which stars Pakistani actors Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan respectively, in India. He added that theatres have been asked not to release the films. "[T]he producers are more at fault than those artists," said Thackeray.
