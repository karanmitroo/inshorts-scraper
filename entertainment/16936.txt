The trailer of the Sunny Deol, Sakshi Tanwar starrer “Mohalla Assi” has been reportedly leaked on the internet. It shows the film’s action in Varanasi’s Assi Ghat, where people conveniently switch between sanskrit mantras and cuss words. Deol is seen as a Sanskrit teacher, Tanwar as his “loud-mouthed wife” and Ravi Kishen as the “exclusive-to-foreigners tourist guide” in the film.
