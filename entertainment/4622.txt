Following the demise of Linkin Park's vocalist Chester Bennington, his wife Talinda Bennington said she has lost her soulmate and their children have lost their hero. She added, "He was a bright, loving soul with an angel's voice. And now he's pain free, singing his songs in all of our hearts." Bennington was found dead in his residence last week.
