Actress Dia Mirza has said that there is "no value of talent in Bollywood". "One gets a job due to profiling," she said while describing how an actor's films being hits or flops form the base of a "report card", which the industry uses to judge the actor. Mirza will next appear in an upcoming Indo-Iranian movie 'Salaam Mumbai'.
