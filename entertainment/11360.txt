Actress Parineeti Chopra has said that she and her contemporaries Alia Bhatt and Shraddha Kapoor share an "encouraging, friendly and positive relationship", similar to what Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor and Sidharth Malhotra share. Parineeti added that the three of them are very different when it comes to their personalities and their work, so directors consider them for different roles.
