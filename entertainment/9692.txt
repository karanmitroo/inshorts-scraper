The police said in a statement that permission for French DJ David Guetta's concert, which was scheduled to be held on January 15 in Greater Noida, has been denied. The permission was denied in view of the imposition of Section 144, ahead of the impending Uttar Pradesh elections. This comes after Guetta's concert was cancelled in Bengaluru and Mumbai recently.
