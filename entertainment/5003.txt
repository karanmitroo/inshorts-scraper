Actress Gwendoline Christie, known for her role as Brienne of Tarth in the HBO series Game of Thrones, has said that unlike other shows, GoT puts women at the forefront. Gwendoline added that the series explores female characters in an unconventional way, as "people in their own right", and not simply as mothers, sisters, girlfriends or wives.
