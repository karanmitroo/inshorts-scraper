While the hearing of Salman Khanâ€™s bail plea was under process in the Bombay HC, a fan of the actor reportedly tried to commit suicide outside the court. The man distributed pamphlets before attempting suicide which read that he used to send scripts to Salman and if he doesn't get bail, his dream of becoming a scriptwriter would remain unfulfilled.
