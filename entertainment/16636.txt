Riteish Deshmukh and Pulkit Samrat-starrer Bangistan has collected Rs 3.75 crore in its first weekend. Directed by first-timer Karan Anshuman, Bangistan is a comedy film which tells the tale of two suicide bombers set in a fictional place. Salman Khan-starrer Bajrangi Bhaijaan, which was in its third week, was stronger at the cash registers than Bangistan.
