TV show Qubool Hai is set to wrap up in August. The cast of the show, which underwent a major shuffle twice after the original male lead Karan Singh Grover exited, failed to impress. Karan was replaced by Raqesh Vashisth and then by Karanvir Bohra after the show took a generation leap. The cast is yet to be informed.
