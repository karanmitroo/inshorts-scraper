Luv Ranjan, the director of the 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama' series, recently said if a third film in the series is made, it will be from a "woman’s perspective". "Our film has opened up a certain amount of debate, so there’s ample scope to do so", Ranjan said. "It will be a fun film from a female perspective", he added.
