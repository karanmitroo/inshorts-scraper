The first look of the much awaited film 'Dhoom 3', with a shirtless Aamir Khan (48) flaunting his chiselled back, is out. He will be playing the negative role in the action-thriller slated to release this Christmas. The film features Katrina Kaif opposite to Aamir, besides Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra who were a part of both the Dhoom prequels.
