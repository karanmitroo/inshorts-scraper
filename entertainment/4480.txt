Singer Yash Wadali was arrested on Friday for allegedly molesting a woman at a party in Mumbai's Goregaon. The 39-year-old woman told the police that the professional singer 'pulled her collar and molested her' on Wednesday. Wadali, however, told the police that the complaint was false and that the woman was 'drunk and not in her senses'.
