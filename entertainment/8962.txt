Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali, in a video shared on Facebook, said he was never confident about the Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor starrer film 'Jab We Met'. "[B]ut when the scene of Geet kissing Aditya came, I knew chahe kuch ho jaye yeh film banegi," he added. The 2007 film will complete 10 years of its release in October this year.
