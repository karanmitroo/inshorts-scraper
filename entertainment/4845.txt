Actor Kunal Kapoor has said that patriotism in current times has become like a social media post. "You feel you put something on social media, you abuse someone... that's your extent of patriotism. Lynching somebody is patriotism...[but] that's not patriotism." Kunal further said that dissent is not anti-national but a very important part of patriotism.
