Shabana Azmi, while speaking about nepotism in Bollywood, questioned how would one explain the success of actors like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vidya Balan and Deepika Padukone, who did not have a direct connection with the film industry. Shabana further said, "Of course, [nepotism] is an easy way into an industry...After that, if you are not good, you don't stick around."
