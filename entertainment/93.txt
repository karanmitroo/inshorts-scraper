At Oscars 1974, photographer Robert Opel ran naked across the stage while the host David Niven was presenting. As he ran, David quipped, "Isn't it fascinating to think...the only laugh that man will ever get in life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?" It is believed Opel's appearance was facilitated by the show's producer as a stunt.
