Actress Parineeti Chopra has asked if being an actor makes her any less of a human being. She said this while speaking about actors taking a break. Parineeti added, "In this age of paparazzi, there's little scope to make mistakes. If my feet hurt and I step out in chappals, they'll circle my footwear and question why I wore them."
