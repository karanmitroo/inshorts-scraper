In a setback to Salman Khan, three witnesses in the 2002 hit-and-run case on Tuesday identified him in a sessions court saying they had seen him getting down from the car which met with an accident in suburban Bandra on Sep-28, 2002. The court is conducting the re-trial of this case after the charges of culpable homicide were added recently.
