Talking about recreating 'Ek Do Teen Char' song, which originally featured Madhuri Dixit, Jacqueline Fernandez said, "I (would) never be able to match up to Madhuri...because you can not replicate someone like (her)." Jacqueline added, "My actress friends were like, 'We are so jealous that you're doing Ek Do Teen'." The recreated version will feature in the film 'Baaghi 2'.
