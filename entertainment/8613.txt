Two skeleton puppets, said to be dressed as US president Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May, were part of singer Katy Perry's performance at BRIT Awards 2017. The puppets wore similar clothes to what Trump and May wore when they met in the US in January. Katy sang her new single 'Chained To The Rhythm' at the event.
