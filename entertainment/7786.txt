Filmmaker Shirish Kunder has apologised on Twitter, after an FIR was lodged against him for tweeting about the new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. "I unconditionally apologise. I never meant to hurt anyones feelings or sentiment," said Kunder. Kunder had earlier tweeted that if Adityanath could be the Uttar Pradesh CM, then Dawood can become the CBI director.
