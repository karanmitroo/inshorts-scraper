Actor Rishi Kapoor, in a now deleted tweet, jokingly wrote that Ranveer Singh has announced if Rajput organisation Karni Sena stops the release of 'Padmaavat', he "will do Johar". Rishi's tweet was in reference to the act of 'Jauhar' or self-immolation. Karni Sena has been staging protests against the film's screening in theatres.
