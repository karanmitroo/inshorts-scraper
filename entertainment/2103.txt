Kangana Ranaut, who suffered an injury while shooting for 'Manikarnika- The Queen of Jhansi', jokingly said she was secretly hoping that she gets hurt. "It has been 60 days of action so far and... non-stop 30 nights of fighting armies," she added. Kangana further said, "I [wanted to] go back and hide in my house for some time."
