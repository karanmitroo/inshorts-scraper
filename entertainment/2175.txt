Censor Board chief Prasoon Joshi has slammed the makers of 'Padmavati' for holding private screenings of the film for media persons before the film has been certified by the board. "This compromises the role of systems and balances that are part of a functioning industry," he added. Prasoon further said the Board is being targetted for delaying the film's certification.
