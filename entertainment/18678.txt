Just like last year, the Chopra cousins Parineeti and Priyanka are set to clash at the box-office this year as well. But the former is unfazed and hopes both the films do well. Parineeti's Daawat-E-Ishq and Priyanka's Mary Kom, hit the theatres on September 5. In 2013, Parineeti-starrer Shuddh Desi Romance and Priyanka-starrer Zanjeer came out on the same day.
