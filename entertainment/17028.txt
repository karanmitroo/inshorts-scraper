Actor Shahid Kapoor has denied the rumours of him getting married to Delhi girl Mira Rajput on June 10. "Itâ€™s surprising how others know more about my wedding than I do. I want to tell the people out there that like I update them about my films, I will also update you about my personal life," he said.
