The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a stay on the ban on 'Padmaavat' by Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh while clearing the film for an all India release. The court also restrained other states from banning 'Padmaavat'. Earlier, the producers had moved the court challenging the ban as these states had banned it despite clearance from the Censor Board.
