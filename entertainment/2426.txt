Late singer Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson has apologised for her tweet amid the mass shooting in Texas in which at least 26 people were killed. "Why the f**k do people keep dying," she had tweeted before the incident. "Realised how insensitive to the families my last tweet must seem...to clarify, that was about a friend," she later posted.
