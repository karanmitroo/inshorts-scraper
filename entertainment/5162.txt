Ileana D'Cruz has said that it's unfair to subject her boyfriend Andrew to harsh comments just because she is a celebrity. Ileana added, "He is entitled to his privacy and respect and he deserves both in equal measure...it did affect me when people left harsh comments on my social media posts. But I do give it back to nasty trolls."
