A DJ in Goa was allegedly beaten up by a group of friends after he refused to play their requests beyond the permissible hours. According to a Facebook post, the DJ had played some songs requested by the group but stopped later to play other guests' requests before 12 am. This enraged the group who assaulted him after closing time.
