The Uttar Pradesh government has said that a film will be entitled to subsidy based on the number of days the shooting takes place in the state. If 50% of the shooting days are spent in UP, the film will get a Rs 1 crore subsidy. Previously, the same amount was paid if 50% of the film was shot there.
