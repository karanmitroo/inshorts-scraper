Commenting on the lowest-ever viewership for Oscars 2018, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday joked, "We don't have Stars anymore - except your President." The 90th Academy Awards drew an average 26.5 million viewers as compared to 33 million viewers in 2017. Notably, several winners at the Oscars used their acceptance speeches to criticise Trump.
