Malaysia has banned playing the song Despacito on government-owned radio and television based on complaints by the public that the lyrics are obscene. A leader of the National Trust Islamic Party said that the song contains "sexy and violent lyrics" which are not suitable in accordance with Islam. The song is by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee.
