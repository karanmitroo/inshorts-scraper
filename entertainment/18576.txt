A complaint was filed in a local court, on Wednesday, against Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat, over her 'obscene' poster from the film 'Dirty Politics'. The poster shows the actor wrapping the tricolour around her in a semi-nude pose while sitting atop a red beacon vehicle. The film is based on Bhanvari Devi murder case in Rajasthan.
