Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan has said that having a family and a child does not mean that a woman is home-bound. "I have always balanced my work and my marriage... I am going to continue to do that. I think women know how to multi-task," she added. Kareena further said she will start shooting for her upcoming film in April.
