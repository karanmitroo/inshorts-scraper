Mallika Dua has penned an open letter after she was criticised for speaking up against Akshay Kumar who had made the remark 'Aap bell bajao, main aap ko bajata hun' on a laughter show. "What stayed with me was why and how is that statement a joke, and why was it necessary to crack [it] with a colleague," she added.
