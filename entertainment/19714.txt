An Ahmedabad magistrate-court issued notices to the producer of Kaun Banega Crorepati and Amitabh Bachchan among others after advocate Davinder Singh Rakkad filed a complaint alleging that its promos are offending the legal profession. A KBC-promo where an advocate is shown yelling "I object" before the court proceedings begin, is derogatory and creates negative impression about the profession, complained Rakkad.
