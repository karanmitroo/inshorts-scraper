Filmmaker Karan Johar has said he hopes actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan becomes a superstar. "Not because he's Shah Rukh's son, but because he is a bundle of talent. I hope he can rise from the criticism," he added. Talking about Aryan's Bollywood debut, Karan had earlier said that he will be a big part of it.
