Actor Arjun Kapoor has said that he has a simple belief that if a producer has invested ₹10, even in the worst case, they should get at least ₹11 back. He added that business and art go hand-in-hand especially in filmmaking. Arjun further said, "I am very happy that in my last three films, makers got their money's worth."
