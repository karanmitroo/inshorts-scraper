A British forensic expert hired by late actress Jiah Khan's mother Rabia has said in his report that Khan's hanging was "staged". The forensic expert's report is in contradiction with the conclusions of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which had pronounced her death as suicide. The latest findings will reportedly be taken into account by the court.
