Author JK Rowling has put her luxury yacht named 'Amphitrite' on sale for $19.8 million, a few months after buying it for $29 million. The yacht, which features five rooms and exterior dining, was previously owned by actor Johnny Depp and named 'Vajoliroja' after his former partner Vanessa Paradis. Depp sold the yacht after he married Amber Heard in 2015.
