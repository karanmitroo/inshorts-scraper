Jacqueline Fernandez will feature in the recreated version of Madhuri Dixit starrer song 'Ek Do Teen Char' in the upcoming film 'Baaghi 2'. "It's an all-time favourite [song] and I have asked choreographer Ganesh Acharya to retain Saroj Khan's famous hook steps," said the film's director Ahmed Khan. 'Baaghi 2' will star Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani in lead roles.
