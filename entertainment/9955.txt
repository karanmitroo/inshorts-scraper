Actor Sushant Singh Rajput has said that had he been offered 'Befikre', he wouldn't have done it. "If 'Befikre' was representing new-age Indian youth and romance as it was claiming, it would have been great... But unfortunately, it didn't do that...," he added. Sushant further said that it's extremely important to know and then claim what film one has made.
