Angelina Jolie was tested for drugs to get a role in the film 'Tomb Raider', former head of Paramount Pictures has revealed in a book. This was because studio executives were concerned about her alleged drug use. Jolie had told the film's makers, "I know what my reputation is, and I'll do anything you want to prove that I'm worthy."
