Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone, while talking about Rambo's Hindi remake, wrote, "I'm sure Tiger will put his heart and soul into it." "We're all just derivatives of you! There will always and only be ONE "eye of the tiger" for us cubs you rule the jungle!", Tiger responded. Stallone had played the lead in 'Rambo' series' four films.
