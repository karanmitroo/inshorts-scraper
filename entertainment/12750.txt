Actress Priyanka Chopra, while talking about acting roles for 'women of colour' has said that "the girl next door is no longer...blue-eyed." "Storytelling cannot be based on what someone looks like...[C]asting needs to happen based on the best person for the job, not the Indian girl or the black girl," said the 34-year old actress.
