American singer Richard Marx said he helped subdue a "dangerous" passenger onboard a Korean Air flight from Vietnam to South Korea, when he turned violent. Marx and the cabin crew were reportedly forced to use ropes and stun guns to restrain the passenger. Thought to have been drunk, the passenger had started attacking the crew, kicking and pulling their hair.
