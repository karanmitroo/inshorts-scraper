Maharashtra police Thursday booked actor Salman Khan for hurting religious sentiments of Muslims, after a complaint was lodged against him by the president of Vidarbha unit of All India Qaumi Tanzeem, Mohd Asim Ali. The complaint said that Khan’s NGO “Being Human” had organised a fashion show, in which a model had the word “Allah” displayed on her gown.
