Tiger Shroff has said, "The concept of femininity and masculinity is stereotyped. To criticise the way I dance is to criticise the likes of Michael Jackson, James Brown and Hrithik Roshan." The actor added that some people like to take potshots at him. Tiger is currently shooting for Munna Michael, which will also star Nawazuddin Siddiqui and debutante Nidhhi Agerwal.
