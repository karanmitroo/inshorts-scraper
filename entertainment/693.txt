Actor Kamal Haasan has been invited by the Harvard University to deliver a speech on February 10. "The topic is Tamil Nadu. I chose to speak on it out of sheer necessity... I yearn to see my state rise to the height it deserves," said Haasan in a statement. He had earlier spoken at Harvard University in 2016.
