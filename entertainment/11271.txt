The Indian National Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party have written to Maharashtra's State Election Commission demanding the postponement of the Coldplay concert. The Congress alleged that BJP is using the concert, part of the Global Citizen Festival India, to woo voters. Tax exemption for the event was given when the code of conduct was in force, added the party.
