'Simran' writer Apurva Asrani in a Facebook post alleged that Kangana Ranaut has been lying about co-writing the script. Asrani, claiming that he wrote nine drafts for the script, said that he was told Kangana is turning director and demanding a co-writer credit after the film's first cut. He added that he eventually agreed to give Kangana additional writing credit.
