BJP MP-actress Hema Malini, while discussing the Emergency imposed in India in 1975, said, "Political leaders opposed to the Emergency used to take refuge in jam-packed theatres where Sholay was being screened." The politicians could evade arrest as the police couldn't find them in crowded halls. "I too played a small role among those who opposed the Emergency," added Hema.
