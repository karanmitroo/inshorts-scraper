Late Hollywood actor Robin Williams was rejected for Hagrid's role in the 'Harry Potter' film franchise, as per casting director Janet Hirshenson. She added that this was because only British actors were being cast. In 2011, Robin had said, "There were a couple of parts I would have wanted to play, but there was a ban on [using] American actors."
