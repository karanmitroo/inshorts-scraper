British singer Elton John, who wanted to speak to Russian president Vladimir Putin on LGBT rights in Russia, became the victim of a prank call by two Russian pranksters. The pranksters called the singer pretending to be Putin and his press secretary. Only after Russian officials denied the conversation, did the singer come to know of the prank.
