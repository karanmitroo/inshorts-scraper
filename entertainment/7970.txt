Actress Vidya Balan has said that it's upsetting when words like molestation, feminism and sexual harassment are used loosely. She said this after certain reports in the media stated that she was molested by a male fan recently. Vidya added, "Someone behaved inappropriately with me and I objected to it. But to grab headlines...and say I was molested is incorrect!"
