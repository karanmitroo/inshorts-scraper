Actor Amitabh Bachchan has said that it was "a bit disturbing" for him to be a part of the 'Global Citizen' campaign along with younger actors like Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Farhan Akhtar. "They talked about efforts that should be made for the future 15 years to come... which kind of excluded me from it altogether," he added.
