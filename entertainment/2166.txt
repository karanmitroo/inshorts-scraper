Sweden will host its first 'man-free' music festival, the Statement Festival, from August 31 to September 1, next year. Swedish comedian Emma Knyckare suggested the idea of a women-only music festival after the Bravalla Festival was cancelled following reports of sexual assault and rape. The festival had raised over â‚¹38 lakh through a crowdfunding campaign.
