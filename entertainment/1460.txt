After WWE wrestler John Cena shared a video of actor Shah Rukh Khan's speech at TED Talks, the actor replied, "Thanks for taking out time to 'see' it. Wish I can 'see you' some day." "Love and health to you my man," he added. Shah Rukh's response is a reference to John Cena's signature phrase 'You can't see me'.
