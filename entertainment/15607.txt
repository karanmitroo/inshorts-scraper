Addressing a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literary Festival on Friday, Filmmaker Karan Johar said India is a "tough country". "[T]o speak about one's personal life in today's time can land you in jail," he said. Johar added, "I feel bound on every level... I feel like there is always some kind of a legal notice awaiting me".
