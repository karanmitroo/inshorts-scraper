Actor Arshad Warsi has revealed that he was jobless for three years before he got films including 'Munna Bhai MBBS', 'Waisa Bhi Hota Hai' and 'Sehar'. "After my first film everybody said 'damn good'. But when the next two-three (films) died... I was left with no job," said Arshad. He added that his wife paid the bills during this time.
