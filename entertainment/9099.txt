Rapper Travis Scott fell into a hole on the stage while performing along with Drake and Young Thug in London. A giant globe under the stage, which had come out at previous concerts, reportedly stopped working after Travis' fall. Reacting to the fall, Drake told the audience, "I'm doing this s**t for free tonight. I don't give a f**k."
