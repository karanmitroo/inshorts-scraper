As per reports, a major portion of the Shahid Kapoor-starrer 'Udta Punjab' was on Wednesday leaked online, two days before its release. It was spotted on torrent sites for illegal download. However, the links were later "removed due to copyright complaint". The illegal copies were reportedly ones submitted to Censor Board for reviewing as they bore a 'For Censor' watermark.
