"Blurred lines" singers Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke have been ordered to pay $7.4 million in damages to the children of late Marvin Gaye. A Los Angeles court on Tuesday ruled that 'Blurred Lines' had been copied from Gaye's 'Got to give it up', rejecting Thicke and Pharell's claims that their intent was to “evoke an era.”
