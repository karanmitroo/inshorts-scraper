Aamir Khan, while talking about reality shows on television that feature kids, said that these shows shouldn't be so aggressive that they rob children of their childhood. "I haven't seen those reality shows...it cuts both ways. There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it (reality shows) gives them an opportunity."
