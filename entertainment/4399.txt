While responding to reports that the makers of 'Baadshaho' have deleted some intimate scenes in fear of the Censor Board, actor Ajay Devgn said that they haven't made a porn film. "I don't know where this story came from," he added. "This is a straightforward film and is not likely to get into any trouble," said director Milan Luthria.
