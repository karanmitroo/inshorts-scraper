Actress Neha Dhupia said she once caught a woman filming her for one hour and forty minutes while she was sleeping on a flight. "I was like, 'What are you doing?' She said, 'No, you look great when you sleep'," added Neha. She further said, "Fans often cross the line, and most of the times, you can't help (it)."
