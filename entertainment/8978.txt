Television actor Kushal Tandon rescued his co-star Jennifer Winget from a fire accident on the sets of their serial 'Beyhadh'. The original scene was to show a mandap on fire. However, Kushal realised the scene was going wrong when fire embers started falling on him. The video shows him leaving the mandap but returning again almost immediately to rescue Winget.
