Actor Saqib Saleem has said one doesn't need to have six-pack abs to become an actor. "Every role demands something from an actor... I had to get a body of a gym trainer for my upcoming film 'Dil Juunglee'," he added. Saqib further said, "It is just a matter of putting your head down and thinking about what you want."
