The spokesperson for actress Katrina Kaif has said the "entire episode" regarding the actress threatening the paparazzi with police complaints "has been inaccurately reported". "Katrina didn't get upset with the media waiting outside at all and in fact greeted them," said her spokesperson while adding that her driver just requested the paparazzi to move as they were blocking the car.
