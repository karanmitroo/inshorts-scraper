Filmmaker Karan Johar has said he is yet to make a film like 'Lagaan' or 'Rang De Basanti', which he believes are "defining iconic films". "I may have contributed to the pop culture but I don't think I have contributed to the brilliance of cinema as yet," he added. Johar further said his 19-year-old career has been a "terrible record".
