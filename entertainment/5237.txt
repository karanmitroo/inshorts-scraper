Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has said that he admires PM Narendra Modi and Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia as individuals, but that does not make him pro-BJP or anti-Congress or vice versa. He added, "What I am trying to say is that I have friends and well wishers in Congress, Shiv Sena and BJP and I have attended their functions."
