Actor Sanjay Dutt has said that when his daughter Trishala wanted to be an actress, he wanted to break her legs. "I've invested a lot of time and energy to put her in a good college and she has done very well. She has specialised in forensic science... And I think that's the great thing to do," said Dutt.
