Hrithik Roshan has revealed that when he was 21, the "best doctor of the country" told him that he didn't have the genetics to do things an actor needed to do in a Hindi film. This included things like dancing, jumping, falling, twisting and break dance. Hrithik called it a 'big blow' when he was asked to re-think his career.
