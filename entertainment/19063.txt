Five members of a cooperative housing society in Bandra (Mumbai), including two senior citizens, have voted against actor Aamir Khan buying 20,000 sq ft area to build a bungalow for himself. The duo filed a complaint with deputy registrar of cooperative societies, claiming that Khan is following a wrong manner to take over the place by pressurizing them for redevelopment.
