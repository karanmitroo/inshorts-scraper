Actress Huma Qureshi, while speaking about brand endorsements, said she won't sell poison for money. She added, "I think as actors, we have to be a little more responsible. If your conscience allows you to be part of something then you should do it." Huma further said that actor Abhay Deol was right in slamming actors for endorsing fairness creams.
