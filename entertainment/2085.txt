'Padmavati' has been cleared by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) without any cuts for release on December 1. It has been given a 12A certificate, which means it cannot be viewed by a child below 12 unless accompanied by an adult. The film's producers, however, said it'll not be screened in British theatres before it's cleared in India.
