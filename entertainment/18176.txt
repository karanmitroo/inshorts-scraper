Akil Malik, the 24-year-old youth who slapped TV host Gauahar Khan during a reality show shoot, has told the Mumbai police he slapped her so that she never wears skimpy clothes again. Akil decided to 'teach Gauahar a lesson' as he felt that if he was sexually attracted to girls who are skimpily clad, other youths could be too.
