Actor Randeep Hooda has disclosed that during the shooting of 'Highway' he felt that director Imtiaz Ali was partial to Alia Bhatt because she is Mahesh Bhatt's daughter. "I started detesting the whole thing... I expressed it to Imitiaz in a strong and wrong way. But I am sure he understood me", Randeep added.
