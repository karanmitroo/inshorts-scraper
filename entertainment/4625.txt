A new satirical animated series focusing on US President Donald Trump is set to be made by Stephen Colbert, the host of American talk show 'The Late Show' for the television network 'Showtime'. "I know a lot of people wanted to do this, and I'm honoured that the Cartoon President invited our documentary crew into his private world," said Colbert.
