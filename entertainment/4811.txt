The Bombay HC is set to hear the plea asking for a stay on Madhur Bhandarkar's film 'Indu Sarkar' by a woman claiming to be late Congress leader Sanjay Gandhi's daughter. She had alleged that 'Indu Sarkar' showed 'her father' Sanjay in a bad light. Her lawyer has said that Bhandarkar should delete the film's 30% portion, which is fact-based.
