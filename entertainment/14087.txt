The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a petition which challenged the anticipatory bail granted to Rahul Raj Singh, who has been accused of abetting the alleged suicide of his girlfriend and television actress Pratyusha Banerjee. Filed by Pratyusha's mother, the petition stated that the Bombay HC's bail had denied the police a chance for conducting a custodial interrogation of Rahul.
