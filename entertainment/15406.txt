Actors Emma Watson and Benedict Cumberbatch have been appointed as 'Visiting Fellows' at Oxford University's Lady Margaret Hall College. The Visiting Fellow position lasts around three years and the fellows are invited to join the University at social events. "We want them to form a bridge between our own academic community and the worlds they inhabit", the college's Principal said.
