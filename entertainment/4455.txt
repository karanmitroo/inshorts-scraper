With over 3 billion views in seven months, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito has become the most-viewed video in YouTube's history. It surpassed Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's See You Again, which had become the most-viewed video only last month. Daddy Yankee said, "Breaking the record is overwhelming, and I'm happy to keep (inspiring) others to do the same."
