Dia Mirza, while talking about being trolled on social media, said she used to get frightened by the rape and acid attack threats she received online for expressing her opinion. Dia added, "Elements...who are faceless and nameless...who harass people, (don't) need to be taken seriously...we need to be like ducks and let (trolling) be like water sliding off our backs."
