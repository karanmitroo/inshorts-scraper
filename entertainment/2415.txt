Jaipur-based organisation Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha demanded a screening of 'Padmavati' for a 15-member panel of experts before the film's release. The organisation's president Suresh Mishra said, "If...the film doesn't distort historical facts...only then will we take back our opposition." He further said if the same doesn't happen till November 15, they will ensure 'Padmavati' is not released.
