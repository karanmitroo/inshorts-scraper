Farhan Akhtar has said he would credit his sister Zoya Akhtar for recognising the acting potential in him and making him an actor. "My mom and dad (Honey Irani and Javed Akhtar) always felt yeh kuch nahi karne wala hai. But Zoya...thought I had something in me," added Farhan. He further said it was Zoya's belief that got him focused.
