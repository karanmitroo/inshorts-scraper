Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has slammed Bollywood award functions for not paying any tribute to late actor Om Puri, who passed away in January. "Oscars paid homage to late #OmPuri, but in #bollywood award functions nobody converse single word for his contribution... SHAME," he tweeted. Puri was paid a musical tribute during the 'In Memoriam' segment at Oscars 2017.
