'Avatar' director James Cameron has referred to the character 'Wonder Woman' as "an objectified icon". He added, "All of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood's been doing over 'Wonder Woman' has been so misguided." He further said that though he liked the film it's a step backwards as it's just "male Hollywood doing the same old thing".
