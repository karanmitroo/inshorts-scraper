In the new reboot of Marvel's Spider-Man comics, the lead character with spider-like superpowers will be a 13-year old black, Hispanic teen named Miles Morales. â€œWhat Miles represents is: anyone can be Spider-Man", the comic's creator Brian Michael Bendis said. This reportedly is a part of Marvel's efforts to include diversity in its comics.
