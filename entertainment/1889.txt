Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani has said that they banned the film 'Padmavati' because of the way women have been represented in the film. "We respect women in Gujarat," added Rupani. Further talking about protests against 'Padmavati', Rupani said the threat of violence can spoil the environment during elections so the ban is keeping the law and order issues in mind.
