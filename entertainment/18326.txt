Actor Emraan Hashmi has reportedly refused to share screen space with the adult movie star-turned-Bollywood actress, Sunny Leone, for a promotional song for his next film 'Ungli'. The production team had decided to rope in Sunny for the song, but when Emraan got to know about it, he refused to be in the same frame with her, sources said.
