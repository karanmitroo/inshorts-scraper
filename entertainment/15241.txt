Late Rajesh Khanna's bungalow 'Aashirwad' in Bandra, Mumbai, is being demolished by its new owner. After the actor's death in 2012, the bungalow was sold to Shashi Kiran Shetty, founder of AllCargo Logistics, for â‚¹90 crore. Shetty reportedly wants to build a four-storey residence in its place. Khanna had bought the bungalow from actor Rajendra Kumar in the late 1960s.
