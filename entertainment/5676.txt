Actor Randeep Hooda has said that cinema has moved away from goody two shoes (very well-behaved) heroes a long time back. He added, "There are always shades...I find them (anti-heroes) more real." Randeep is known for his role in films like 'Sarbjit', 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster' and 'Jism 2', among others.
