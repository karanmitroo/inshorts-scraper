Actress Katrina Kaif said that she has always had a "tu-tu-main-main" relationship at work with Ranbir Kapoor. Katrina added, "We pull each other's leg... if I say... how obnoxious he is, and who would want to work with him, it's a joke." She also said that their personal equation is between them and people are never going to get it.
