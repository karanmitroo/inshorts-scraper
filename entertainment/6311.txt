Sonam Kapoor has said that comparisons to Deepika Padukone and Aishwarya Rai at Cannes are foolish. Stating that comparisons are not in her hands, she added, "It's what the media is doing, so they have to decide whether it is fair or unfair." She further added media is pitting women against each other, whereas, they should be celebrating all women.
