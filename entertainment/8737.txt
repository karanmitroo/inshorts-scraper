Oscar-nominated film 'Moonlight' is "the story of a lifetime," wrote Hindustan Times. "An underwhelming story of human connection and self-discovery... This is a film for the purists," wrote Mid-Day, while Times of India called it "a brutally honest portrayal of inferiority and how it infests young minds; shapes or spoils adulthoods." It was rated 4/5 (HT, TOI) and 3.5/5 (Mid-Day).
