Actor Pankaj Tripathi, known for films like 'Masaan', has said star kids get spotted but not actors like him who have been in the industry for over 10 years. However, he added, "Spot hona asaan hai, to gain respect, you need to have the know-how of your craft." Tripathi further said the audience today fails to appreciate real art.
