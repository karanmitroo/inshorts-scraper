With a production cost of nearly $7 million, pop-star Michael Jackson's music video 'Scream', also starring Janet Jackson, is the most expensive music video of all time. The 1995 video takes place on an elaborately-built spaceship set, and won a Grammy for the 'Best Short Form Music Video' that year. Notably, Monday was Michael Jackson's 58th birth anniversary.
