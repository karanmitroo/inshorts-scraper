American singer-songwriter Demi Lovato, while talking about her sexuality, said it's irrelevant to what her music is about. Demi added, "I feel like everyone's looking for a headline and they always want their magazine or TV show...to be the one to break what my sexuality is." When asked if she was bisexual, Demi had earlier neither denied nor confirmed it.
