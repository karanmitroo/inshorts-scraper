Actress Parineeti Chopra has called herself a "fat-to-fit story" while talking about her journey to fitness after struggling with weight issues. "I wanted to work on my body, I am 27 years old. I wanted to wear shorts and better clothes and not worry about anything," said Parineeti. She added that it took her a year-and-half to get fit.
