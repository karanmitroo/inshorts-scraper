'Game of Thrones' actor Maisie Williams has said that she does not feel that she "owes" her fans anything. She also said that her refusal to click photographs with fans does not make her "mean". "[I]f I was really in love with someone, I wouldnâ€™t just want a picture. I would want to hang out with them", she added.
