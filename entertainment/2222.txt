Actress Deepika Padukone has been given special security by the Mumbai Police after the Rajput organisation Karni Sena on Thursday threatened to cut her nose over her upcoming film 'Padmavati'. Karni Sena's president had said, "We will do to Deepika what Lakshman did to Shurpanakha." Earlier, the film's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali was also provided security cover amid growing threats.
