Actor Sanjay Dutt has said that portraying him onscreen in the upcoming biopic on him is a difficult role for Ranbir Kapoor, who is playing Dutt. "He calls me every day. He wants to spend days and weeks with me, but I can't spend more than half an hour with anybody... He is a fine actor though," added Sanjay.
