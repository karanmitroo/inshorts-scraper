Director of 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha' Shree Narayan Singh, while responding to plagiarism charges by documentary filmmaker Praveen Vyas said, "Any film on open-air defecation would have generic similarities." He added that his film's script was registered in 2014 and Vyas's film Manini was uploaded in 2016. "This is...nuisance litigation meant to harass filmmakers...at the last minute," added Singh.
