In a letter to Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, Prasadrao Peshwe, a descendant of Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I, on Thursday raised objection over Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Bajirao Mastani'. Peshwe alleged that Bhansali has "altered" historical facts in the film. He urged the Maharashtra government to investigate the matter and take an appropriate decision after reviewing the film.
