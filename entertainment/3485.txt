The Kangana Ranaut starrer 'Simran', which released on Friday, "could have been way more rewarding and involving," wrote SpotboyE. NDTV wrote, "Kangana Ranaut's solid performance keeps the film watchable, but 'Simran' is ultimately an exhausting film," while Times of India wrote, "Kangana shines but 'Simran' falters." The film was rated 3/5 (SpotboyE), 2.5/5 (NDTV) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
