The Kajol and Dhanush starrer Tamil film 'VIP 2' is "a tiring watch, despite Dhanush trying to hold it...with his strong screen presence," wrote Hindustan Times. Firstpost wrote, "Sequel lacks the punch of the original," while Times of India wrote the "film feels like it is running around in circles." It was rated 1/5 (HT) and 2/5 (Firstpost, TOI).
