Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma (RGV) has slammed the poster of the Telugu film 'Khaidi No 150', which features actor Chiranjeevi, calling it "the height of narcissism". "Can I please have the name, number and address of the designer and others around Mega Star who convinced him to put out a pose like this," tweeted RGV while sharing the poster.
