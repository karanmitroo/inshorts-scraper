Opening up on the ongoing row involving Ajay Devgn and Kamaal R Khan, Karan Johar said that he does not need to provide answers to justify himself. "My self-respect, reputation, company reputation and my upbringing doesn’t allow me to dignify this question with a response," he said. Devgn has accused Khan of taking ₹25 lakhs from Johar to slam 'Shivaay'.
