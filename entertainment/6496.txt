Actor Sanjay Dutt plans to set up affordable drug rehabilitation centres across India and is in talks with the government for necessary approvals. "I could opt for [expensive de-addiction] treatment and rehab in America because my family could afford it. Not everyone can," said Dutt. Earlier, he confessed trying every drug available after the death of his mother Nargis Dutt.
