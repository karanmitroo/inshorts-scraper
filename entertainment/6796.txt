Priyanka Chopra, while responding to a video which showed the Western media mistaking Deepika Padukone for her, said she is the most popular brown face. "Every brown girl does not look the same...  Let's try and tell us apart," she added. However, Priyanka said that mistaking Deepika for her is not fair as Deepika is a 'massive star' from India.
