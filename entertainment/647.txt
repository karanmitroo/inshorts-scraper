Actress Deepika Padukone has said 'Padmaavat' is a celebration of the fact that this is the most expensive Indian film made with a female protagonist. She added, "I view that as a victory. Not just for myself but for women in films." Deepika further said this would lead to opportunities for producers to back female-centric and big budget films.
