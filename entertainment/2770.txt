Rajkummar Rao has said doing films like 'Trapped' and the yet-to-release 'Omerta' can take a toll on one's mental health. "[On the other hand], doing a film like 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' will not affect you," he added. Further talking about losing weight for his upcoming film 'Fanney Khan', Rajkummar said, "[It was] a task as I had to sacrifice food."
