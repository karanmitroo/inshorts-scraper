Over 11,000 people have signed a petition against casting actor Leonardo Dicaprio as a protagonist in a biopic of the Persian poet Rumi. They have demanded the producers to cast a Middle eastern actor to play the poet. “Casting Leonardo DiCaprio.... takes possession of Muslim accomplishments and gives the credit to a white man,” the petition read.
