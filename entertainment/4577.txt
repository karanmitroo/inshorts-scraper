Actor Akshay Kumar has said that talking about toilets is still considered a taboo in India. He added, "It's also about the mindset. In places where I've gone, I heard people saying, 'We don't do it (defecate) in the same house where we cook food'. But how can they openly defecate on the field, from where the food is coming?"
