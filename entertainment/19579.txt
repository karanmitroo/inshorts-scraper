Actor Ranveer Singh was diagnosed with a severe case of dengue after getting admitted to a suburban hospital following high fever. He was shooting in Durgapur near Kolkata for "Gunday" since the past few days and despite fever, he continued to shoot to avoid any inconvenience to the production. He only underwent tests once he was back in Mumbai.
