Athiya Shetty, while speaking about taking decisions for herself, said she's going to learn from her father Suniel Shetty's mistakes. "But that doesn't mean I won't be making my own. I know what I want to do when I look at him and his career," she added. Athiya further said she isn't insecure about being seen in very few films.
