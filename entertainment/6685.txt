Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has tweeted that he will make a biopic on Bruce Lee and release it at the same time as Shekhar Kapur's authorised biopic on the legendary martial artist-actor. RGV added, "I have nothing against Shekhar... but it's just my obsessive fascination for Bruce Lee." RGV also claimed that only he can do justice to Lee's biopic.
