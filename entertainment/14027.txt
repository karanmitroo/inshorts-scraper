Freya, a six-year-old dog, known as 'Britain's loneliest dog' is set to star in 'Transformers: The Last Knight', the latest in the 'Transformers' franchise. Director Michael Bay confirmed this and further tweeted, "Freya, has epilepsy and has been in a shelter her whole... life." Notably, Freya was given the tag as she was reportedly rejected by over 18,000 potential owners.
