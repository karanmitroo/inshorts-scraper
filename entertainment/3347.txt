Taapsee Pannu, while defending Amitabh Bachchan for uploading an all-male picture on 'Pink' completing one year, said it wasn't intentional. "It's not possible that he deliberately chose a picture in which we weren't there. It might have been that it skipped (his mind) or he didn't realise," she added. 'Pink' starred Taapsee, Kriti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang in lead roles.
