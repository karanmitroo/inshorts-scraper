Recently appointed Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani struck a controversy by issuing a list of 36 Hindi and English words to be banned from films. The word 'Bombay' is among the list, which came along with orders to ban the portrayal of violence against women, glorification of bloodshed, and double-meaning words. The move has been called the "murder" of creativity.
