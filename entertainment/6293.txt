Sonam Kapoor, in reference to being wrongly tagged as Deepika Padukone, has tweeted, "One picture in a milieu of 1000s tagged right is an error not a misidentification." She further wrote, "Gets your facts right don't believe PR's." Earlier, an American stock photo platform had referred to Sonam as Deepika, while posting a picture of the actress from Cannes.
