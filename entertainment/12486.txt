Actor Amitabh Bachchan has recorded the Ganapati aarti for the Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai. "The Siddhivinayak temple authorities requested me to sing it... Whether they play it during aarti time is the temple authoritiesâ€™ call, but it will be available on the Internet and CDs," said Bachchan. Further, filmmaker Shoojit Sircar will shoot a video to accompany the recording.
