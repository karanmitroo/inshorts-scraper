Anupam Kher has said that standing up for the National Anthem shows the upbringing of a person. "If people can wait at the restaurants, stand...in front of the cinema halls...why cannot they stand for 52 seconds for the National Anthem in the cinema halls," added Kher. He further said getting up for the National Anthem shows respect towards the nation.
