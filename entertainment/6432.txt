Israeli culture minister Miri Regev was slammed for wearing a gown that had the skyline of Jerusalem's Old City printed along the hemline at this year's Cannes Film Festival. "This year we are celebrating 50 years since the liberation and reunification of Jerusalem," said Regev. Her choice was called "a scene from the colonialist horror movie" in a news report.
