Taylor Swift has won a sexual assault case against former DJ David Mueller, who she alleged had reached under her skirt and groped her in 2013. Swift was awarded the symbolic $1 in damages she had sought. Mueller had originally tried suing Taylor for $3 million, alleging her claims cost him his $150,000-a-year job, but a judge dismissed his lawsuit.
