Comedian Sunil Grover, much in the news in 2013 for his hasty exit from Kapil Sharma's show, is set to resurrect his beloved creation ‘Gutthi’ in a different avatar on his own show. The show will air on Star Plus later in January, and the new female character that Grover would introduce on his show would be called ‘Chutki’.
