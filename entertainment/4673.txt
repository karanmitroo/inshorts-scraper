Filmmaker Jai Prakkash has claimed that the Sunny Leone and Emraan Hashmi starrer song 'Piya More' from the film 'Baadshaho' has been copied. Prakash said it has been lifted from a song named 'Nasha Sar Pe Chadke Bole', from his 2014 film 'Dee Saturday Night'. Both the songs have been composed by music director Ankit Tiwari.
