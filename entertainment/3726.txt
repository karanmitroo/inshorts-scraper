Actress Sayani Gupta has said that she did not feel like watching the film 'Baahubali' after seeing its trailer. "You can't compare 'Baahubali' with Hollywood action-genre projects like film '300' and TV series 'Game of Thrones (GoT)'," she added. Sayani further said, "Those projects ('GoT' and '300') have mind-blowing stories."
