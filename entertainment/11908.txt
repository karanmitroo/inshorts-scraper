Amrita Singh has said that her daughter Sara Ali Khan would not listen to her even if she tried to tell her how to lead her life. "Sara chose to complete her studies before pursuing acting," said Amrita. She added that her name was unnecessarily being used in reports claiming that she is unhappy with Kareena Kapoor's influence over Sara.
