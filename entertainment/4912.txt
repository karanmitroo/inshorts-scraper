Filmmaker Shyam Benegal said the media should question Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Minister Smriti Irani on what happened to the report submitted by the special committee, which he heads, for reforming the Censor Board. Benegal added, "Why haven't they taken any action on the proposed changes?" The report had suggested that board should not impose censoring but only certify movies.
