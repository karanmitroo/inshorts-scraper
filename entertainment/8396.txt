Accountants Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), who were responsible for the wrong announcement of 'La La Land' as Best Picture at Oscars 2017, have received death threats on social media. PwC has hired security for them, after pictures of their houses and families surfaced online. Meanwhile, Cullinan and Ruiz have been banned from all future Oscar events.
