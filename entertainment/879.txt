Producers of John Abraham and Diana Penty starrer 'Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran' have announced its release date as March 2, clashing with Anushka Sharma's 'Pari'. "There are 4,000 theatres, so it's not about clashing. For me, it's like bringing two films of different genres together," the co-producer of both the films, Prernaa Arora said.
