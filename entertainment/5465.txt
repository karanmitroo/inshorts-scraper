A woman named Priya Singh Paul, claiming to be the daughter of late Congress politician Sanjay Gandhi, has sent a legal notice against the release of the Madhur Bhandarkar directorial Indu Sarkar before she views the film. Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani said, "Unless the Gandhi parivaar acknowledges her claims, we can't act on Ms Singh's objections to the film."
