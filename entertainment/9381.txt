Politician Amar Singh has claimed that actor Amitabh Bachchan and wife Jaya had been living separately even before he met Amitabh. "One of them was living in Pratiksha and the other lived in his other bungalow Janak," he added. Amar further said that there've been speculations about problems between daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai and Jaya, but he's not responsible for it.
