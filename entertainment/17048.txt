Rajkumar Hirani’s “PK” on Saturday became Bollywood's highest-grosser in a foreign market ever, by collecting $10.45 million in China. The collection was made within a week of its May 22 release, with 18,000 shows across China. Analysts described the collection as 'game-changing' since the majority of the audience was the local Chinese population and not Indian-origin viewers settled abroad.
