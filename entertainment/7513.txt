Parineeti Chopra has said that being an actor or acting was never her dream. However, she added, "But I knew I was living my dream when my first film released, and I saw thousands of people go out there, watch my films, love me and then mob me on the road." Parineeti made her debut in 'Ladies vs Ricky Bahl'.
