Filmmaker Karan Johar has revealed Farah Khan turned down an opportunity to choreograph the songs in the 1995 film 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' as she had committed to do a Marathi film. "Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra personally called for Farah... but she refused to take up the project... That's the level of commitment she has," he added.
