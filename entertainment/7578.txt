Party workers of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) slammed the film 'Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo Deewana' while stating, "According to our Hindu rituals, a lady cannot get married when she is pregnant." They protested outside producer TP Aggarwal's office in Mumbai. Aggarwal said they would release the film on April 7 as the Censor Board passed it without any cuts.
