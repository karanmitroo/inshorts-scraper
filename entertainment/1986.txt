Filmmaker James Cameron has revealed that on the night his 1997 film 'Titanic' won the Oscars, he almost got into a fight with producer Harvey Weinstein and hit him with his Oscar trophy. Cameron revealed that the reason behind the altercation was the way filmmaker Guillermo del Toro was treated by Weinstein's company Miramax on del Toro's directorial 'Mimic'.
