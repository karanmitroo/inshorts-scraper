Radhika Apte, who will be seen opposite Nawazuddin Siddiqui in 'Manhji- The Mountain Man', has said the leak of the film online, 10 days before its release, is saddening "[W]hatever possible measures are to be taken, are being taken care of", Apte said. She added, "If you want to stop piracy, you should definitely watch it on the big screen".
