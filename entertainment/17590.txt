Director Dibakar Banerjee revealed on Tuesday that the man behind the mask who appears in the trailer of his film 'Detective Byomkesh Bakshy', is not Aamir Khan. He said that Aamir was approached, but he turned down the offer, as he was already playing a villain in Dhoom 3. The villain will be revealed with the movie's release on April-3.
