Raj Kumar Yadav, who impressed the audience and the critics alike with his acting chops in 'Shaahid', was removed from the action-thriller project 'NH10' on Anushka Sharma's insistence, who is the co-producer of the movie. A source close to the film told, "When Anushka came on board, she made it clear that she doesn't want Raj Kumar in the project."
