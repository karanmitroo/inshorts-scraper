Singer Adele hosted a private screening of the film 'Despicable Me 3' for children affected by the Grenfell Tower fire which occurred in June this year. She also invited people dressed as minions to cheer up the children. The singer had earlier called for donations to be made to the Grenfell Tower victims during her concert at London's Wembley Stadium.
