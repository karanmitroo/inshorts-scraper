An audio of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino defending Roman Polanski of raping a 13-year-old has resurfaced. "That's not rape. To me, when you use the word rape, you're talking about violence, throwing them downâ€”it's like one of the most violent crimes in the world," he can be heard saying. "She wanted to have it and dated the guy," Tarantino added.
