The Censor Board has asked Sony Pictures Network's channel Sony Le PLEX HD to cancel the broadcast of Oscar-winning film 'The Danish Girl'. The biographical film stars Eddie Redmayne in the leading role portraying Lili Elbe, one of the first known people to undergo sex reassignment surgery. The Board said the film's subject is unsuitable for children.
