Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that currently, her "legs sell like 12 or 15 products" in India. She explained that she was a tomboy as a teenager. â€œI had scars, I was always falling on my knees. They were not the prettiest legs in the world, and then I taught myself how to take care of my body," said Priyanka.
