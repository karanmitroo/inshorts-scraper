Actor Sanjay Dutt, who has been out of jail on parole for the last two months due to his wife Manayata's illness, has been granted another 30 days parole extension. Reportedly, he got the extension after the police submitted a medical report of his wife Manayata Dutt. However, after this there will be no more extension, Pune Divisional Commissioner said.
