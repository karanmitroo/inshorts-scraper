Actor Shah Rukh Khan has revealed that he has been caught by the police in Delhi many times when he was younger. "For jaywalking or hanging out at night, or getting out of parties really late - I have done all that... So we got caught many times and we weren't jailed, in the literal sense," said SRK.
