Jacob Staudenmaier, a high-school student who asked actress Emma Stone to be his prom date, has claimed she sent him a letter responding to his proposal. "I'm in London working, but I hope you have the best time at prom," he read out from the letter. Jacob said he re-wrote the lyrics to the film's opening song in his video.
