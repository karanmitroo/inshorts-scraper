Actress Malaika Arora, when asked about reports suggesting that she is dating Arjun Kapoor, responded by asking, "What is the need to gossip?" "Everybody is laughing, happy and talking to us. Talk about [the event]...I think that's more interesting, right?" she added. Earlier, Malaika had denied the dating rumours and said that Arjun is a "very good friend" of hers.
