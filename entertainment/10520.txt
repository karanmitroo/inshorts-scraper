Former J&K CM Omar Abdullah slammed a 'bullet pellet effect' look created using makeup for designer duo Shantanu and Nikhil's 'Kashmiriyat' collection, which was showcased at the GQ Fashion Nights 2016 recently. "These pellets have blinded scores, to have the injuries recreated for a fashion show is inexplicable," tweeted Omar. Another user wrote that it was in "poor, poor taste".
