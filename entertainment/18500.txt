A Florida art gallery announced Wednesday that it will be featuring the leaked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton in a new show. The show, titled “No Delete”, is meant to fuel the debate on privacy in the digital age. The controversial pictures will be displayed unaltered on life-sized canvas prints as part of “Fear Google” campaign.
