Speaking at a literary festival, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said that giving violent threats and announcing rewards for physical harm was not acceptable in a democracy. He added that there were some films where people feel their sentiments were hurt and they go overboard and announce rewards while protesting, but the rule of law should not be undermined.
