Reacting to singer Ludacris' fake six-pack abs in his new music video, a user tweeted, "Wtf is Ludacris doing on my screen with computerised abs? I am uncomfy". "Ludicrous indeed... Did you really photoshop you a chest and some abs?" read another tweet. Another user wrote, "Are we just gonna ignore Ludacris thought Bat suit abs were gonna go unnoticed?"
