Actress Ileana D'Cruz took to Twitter to slam a fan for reportedly 'misbehaving' with her. "I'm a public figure...But that doesn't give any man the right to misbehave with me. Don't confuse 'fan antics' with that. I am a woman at the end of the day," she tweeted. However, she hasn't given any specific details about the incident.
