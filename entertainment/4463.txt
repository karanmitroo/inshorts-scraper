Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, talking about facing rejections during his struggling days, said that people told him, "We can't take you... we have to put extra light to make you visible, you are dark." Siddiqui added, "Even after 12 years, nothing much has changed. (People) say... a dark skinned man is too unusual to become a hero of a mainstream film."
