It is believed that the concept of releasing Bollywood movies on Fridays was adopted in 1950s, influenced by the Friday release of 1939 Hollywood film 'Gone With The Wind'. According to one theory, movies were released on Fridays to make up for office half-days. Additionally, producers believe that Friday, being a day of Goddess Lakshmi, would bring them wealth.
