Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that there are only six actors in Bollywood currently who are able to "sell" a film. He said that the industry is going through a crisis with only a few viable and saleable stars but "many filmmakers and stories to be told". Johar added, "If you take someone new then you won't get budget."
