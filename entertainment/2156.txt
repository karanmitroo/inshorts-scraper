A biopic on sweet-maker Nobin Chandra Das, who is said to have invented the sweet Rosogolla, will release in December 2018 marking the 150th anniversary of the sweet's invention. "We felt that something needs to be done to make people aware of Rosogolla’s inventor,” said the biopic's producer Nandita Roy. Titled 'Rosogolla', it will be directed by Pavel.
