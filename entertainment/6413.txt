Actor Sushant Singh Rajput has said that link-up rumours with co-stars before a film's release is boring gossip. "Gossip columns do not bother me as they are fictional stories...media should write interesting gossip about me, that is a good read," added Sushant. Sushant has been linked with actress Kriti Sanon, with whom he'll be seen in the upcoming film 'Raabta'.
