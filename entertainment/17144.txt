Taxi service Uber has launched an on-call helicopter operation 'UberCopter' to fetch Cannes Film Festival-goers from the airport to the venue in just seven minutes. At a cost of $180, Uber is offering the sky-high option through deals with two local helicopter firms including Helipass. The Cannes Film Festival will run until 24 May with more than 125,000 visitors attending.
