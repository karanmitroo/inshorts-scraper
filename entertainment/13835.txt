Director-producer Anurag Kashyap on Thursday took to Facebook to ask people to "wait till Saturday" before downloading the leaked copy of his film 'Udta Punjab' from the internet. "[N]o one can stop your right to download a film. This time its a different fight, its a fight against censorship", he added. 'Udta Punjab' is scheduled to release this Friday.
