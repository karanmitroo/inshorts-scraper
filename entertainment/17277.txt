Stand-up comedian Vir Das has written an open-letter on Facebook after cops interrupted his show in Delhi on Saturday. Police claimed they came to the venue after a man from the audience complained against the show. "The gentleman who filed the complaint is nowhere to be found. He just left... leaving us to deal with this messy situation...", Das wrote.
