National award-winning lyricist Prasoon Joshi, who has written the script of the upcoming biopic on legendary athlete Milkha Singh, has decided to direct a film based on the athlete's post-retirement life. "In 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' we have only documented his career, but I felt there was so much more to the man than just his professional endeavour," Joshi said.
