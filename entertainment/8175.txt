Kangana Ranaut has said she will never work with Shah Rukh Khan or any other Khans as she does not want to get overshadowed by them. "After 'Tanu Weds Manu', I realised that if in a film, I am not the hero, it will disappoint everyone," she added. Kangana further said it is a professional strategy that she has adopted.
