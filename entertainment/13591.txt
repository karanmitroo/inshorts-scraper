The Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Margot Robbie starrer 'The Legend of Tarzan', which released on Friday, "is too simplistic to be entirely involving", wrote India Today. Hindustan Times called it "a wonderfully old-fashioned Hollywood epic" while Times of India wrote that the film "lacks the visual finesse and palpability". It has been rated 2.5/5 (India Today, TOI) and 4/5 (HT).
