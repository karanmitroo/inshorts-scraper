Arjun Kapoor, who has worked in two films adapted from Chetan Bhagat's novels, has said that he never read a book by the author in his life. He added that he never faced any problem while working on '2 States' or 'Half Girlfriend' as the scripts were substantial to understand the character and Chetan kept the character's essence in scripts.
