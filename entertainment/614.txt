Twinkle Khanna has said women shouldn't use menstruation as an excuse to take a leave. She added a lot of people think women should stay at home, so one shouldn't give them an excuse to stop women from doing anything. Twinkle further said, "If there's too much pain...one can take an off just like they do for any other sickness."
