John Lennon's wife Yoko Ono will be credited as the co-writer of 'Imagine', 46 years after the song's release. In a 1980 BBC interview, Lennon revealed that 'Imagine' was partly inspired by lines in Ono's conceptual art book Grapefruit. The song, which calls for a world without division, has received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, among other honours.
