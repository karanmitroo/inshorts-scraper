The Vijay starrer Tamil language film 'Theri', which released on Friday, exposes "Vijayâ€™s limitations as an actor", Indian Express wrote. There is "little novelty in a plot that only appears rehashed", wrote Hindustan Times. The director, Atlee, "takes too long to narrate this familiar story", TOI said. The film has been rated 2/5 (Indian Express), 2.5/5 (HT) and 3/5 (TOI).
