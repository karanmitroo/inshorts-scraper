North Korea expressed strong condemnation, as Sony Corporation released its controversial film "The Interview" online, after delaying its release temporarily. The film, depicting the assassination of N. Korean Premier Kim Jong-un by American journalists, has sparked outrage. A North Korean diplomat called it an "unpardonable mockery of our sovereignty and dignity of our supreme leader."
