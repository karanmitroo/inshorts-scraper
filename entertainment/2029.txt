Fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee has said when he dressed actress Vidya Balan for the Cannes Film Festival in 2013, he became a national terrorist. "We expect creativity at...click of a button. This is juvenile fashion behaviour," added Mukherjee. He further said, "I think style is about a woman, who is 5'1" and wears flats to a party."
