Actor Rishi Kapoor admitted that he bought a popular magazine award for his 1973 film 'Bobby' in his autobiography 'Khullam Khulla', which was released on Sunday. "It was a mistake, and I'm owning it up...but that doesn't mean after that I bought all my awards," he said in an interview. "I was so naive then...a 20-year-old brash bacha," he added.
