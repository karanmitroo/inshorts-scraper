Actor Pulkit Samrat has dismissed reports that he started dating actress Yami Gautam after his now estranged wife Shweta Rohira suffered a miscarriage. "It’s misusing a miscarriage that happened four years ago, when somebody (Yami) wasn’t even in the picture," said Pulkit. The actor further alleged that "there is a particular campaign being run to malign" his image.
