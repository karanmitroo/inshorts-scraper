Ustad Bismillah Khan, who died 10 years ago on August 21, 2006, was buried with his shehnai in Varanasi. After the death of his wife, Khan referred to his shehnai as 'begum'. Khan is accredited with popularising the instrument, most notably with his concert in the Calcutta All India Music Conference in 1937.
