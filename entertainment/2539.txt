Eight former and current employees of Netflix show 'House of Cards' accused actor Kevin Spacey of sexual harassment claiming that his "predatory" behaviour included non-consensual touching and crude comments. They alleged he made the work environment "toxic for young men". This comes after Spacey came out as gay while apologising for making sexual advances at then 14-year-old actor Anthony Rapp.
