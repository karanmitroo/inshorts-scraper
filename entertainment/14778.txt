Shah Rukh Khan has said that it will be logical to avoid the clash of his film 'Raees' with Salman Khan's 'Sultan', both of which are scheduled for an Eid release. “I think logic will be to shift (the release dates). We will try and figure out a way so that it doesn’t eat into each other’s business", he added.
