Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor-starrer 'Ki And Ka' that hit the screens on Friday, has been termed as a film with 'bad execution' by India Today and Indian Express. Director R Balki's writing is inconsistent and the gender role-reversal drama is worth a ticket, wrote TOI. It has been rated 1.5/5 (India Today), 2/5 (Indian Express, NDTV) and 3/5 (Mid-Day).
