Ousted Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that even after his exit, the Prasoon Joshi-led board is still asking directors to make cuts in their films, but nobody is calling the board 'sanskari' now. The board had reportedly asked for 45 cuts in 'Love Sonia', a film on child trafficking, and ten cuts in Kangana Ranaut's 'Simran'.
