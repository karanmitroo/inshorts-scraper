Christopher Nolan's Interstellar has been named the most over-rated film of 2014 by Metacritic users, as they felt that Nolan and Matthew McConaughey were revered by default. It is followed by 'Boyhood' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Film-maker David Cronenberg had recently criticized sites like Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes for blurring the line between film criticism and public opinion.
