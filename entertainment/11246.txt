Anurag Kashyap, while speaking on evoking emotions through his films has said that he is a "filmmaker" and "not an NGO". "I don't want to put out a message whose impact is over as soon as the movie is over," said Kashyap. He added that he likes to make the audience think about his film rather than giving a statement.
