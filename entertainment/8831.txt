Singer Rihanna was seen drinking liquor from a bejewelled flask at the Grammy Awards on Monday. During the show, a video shows Rihanna mouthing the words, "I think it's time for another shot," to the person sitting next to her. "We now know how Rihanna gets through all these award shows #GRAMMYs," tweeted a user.
