Nandita Das, who's directing the biopic on Indo-Pakistani writer Saadat Hasan Manto, has said it will not be a typical Bollywood song and dance film. She added, "It's a very big project for me. We don't have a big budget so...we'll try to shoot it as fast as we can." Nawazuddin Siddiqui will be seen portraying Manto in the film.
