Television actor Shashank Vyas, known for playing the character Jagya in Balika Vadhu, has said that he does not want to do serials where the male actors are just standing in scenes like furniture. "I want to see myself doing more of realistic work, and where the male actor has substantial part to play," added Vyas.
