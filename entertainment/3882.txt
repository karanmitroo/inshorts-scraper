As per reports, Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) was served a notice for violating the Juvenile Justice Act by putting out a picture of Sunny Leone's adopted girl with 'unpleasant and objectionable' statements. CARA's CEO, in a now deleted tweet, had written, "Without looking at colour, background and health status, Sunny Leone happily took the child in adoption."
