The Censor Board has reportedly ordered for four verbal cuts in the Shraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur starrer 'OK Jaanu' and given it a U/A certificate. "The times are changing. At one time couples couldn't even meet before marriage," said Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while adding that the film's theme of live-in relationships was now a "social reality".
