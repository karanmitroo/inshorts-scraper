Iranian TV reportedly censored actress Charlize Theron's dress when she named Iranian film 'The Salesman' as the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. The special effect covered the actress' arms and legs in a 'polo neck' before blurring out her entire torso. Anousheh Ansari, who collected the award, was also covered up by the news agency.
