Pooja Batra has said that audiences abroad feel shocked when they get to know that actors don't sing in Bollywood films but there are playback singers for the same. She added that this is because actors sing in musical films abroad. "But that apart, people are well versed with Indian cinema much better that earlier, say ten years," said Pooja.
