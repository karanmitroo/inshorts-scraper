The first look of Manoj Bajpayee-starrer 'Aligarh', where he is playing a gay professor, is out. Bajpayee is seen with grey hair, beard and a brown suit, clinging on to his bag in the picture. 'Aligarh' is reportedly based on the real-life of Dr Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras, who was terminated from AMU because of his sexuality and later committed suicide.
