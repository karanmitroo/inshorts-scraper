The Madras High Court on Friday directed actor Dhanush to appear before it on February 28 in connection with a case filed by a couple who claimed he was their son. He has been summoned to verify his personal identification marks. The man, who claims to be Dhanush's father, alleged that the birth certificate filed by Dhanush is not genuine.
