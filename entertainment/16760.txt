Rapper Snoop Dogg accused Swedish police of racial profiling when the vehicle he was travelling in was pulled over after a concert because police suspected the star was intoxicated. Police spokesperson Daniel Nilsson said, "he was arrested and taken to the police station to take a urine test." The rapper has vowed to never return to Sweden.
