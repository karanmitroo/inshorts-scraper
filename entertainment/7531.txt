Nearly 200 independent movie theatres across the United States on Tuesday screened the film '1984', based on George Orwell's novel about a dystopian future in what organisers said was a stand against US President Donald Trump's administration. The book features a government that spies on its citizens and forces them into accepting contradictory versions of the truth.
