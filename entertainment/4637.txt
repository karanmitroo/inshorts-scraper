Linkin Park member Mike Shinoda took to Instagram to share an old picture of the band, which also features late singer Chester Bennington. "1997 or 1998... I think this was the first photo we ever took together," he wrote alongside the photo. Mike further wrote, "No flame tattoos yet, no red hair yet, most of us were still in college".
