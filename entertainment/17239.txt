West Indies and Chennai Super Kings cricketer Dwayne Bravo launched a music single, 'Chalo Chalo' on Sunday in Chennai. The song blends Soca (a Carribean music genre) with western and Indian influences, and also has Indian-origin Trinidad singer Nisha. A video will be released later, featuring Bravo's team-mates from West Indies and the Indian Premier League.
