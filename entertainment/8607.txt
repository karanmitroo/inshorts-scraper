Actor Rajkummar Rao revealed that he survived on just coffee and carrots for almost 20 days to prepare for his character in the film 'Trapped'. "It was physically and mentally exhausting for me... There were times when there was a blackout," he added. The film is about a man who gets trapped in his own house with no escape route.
