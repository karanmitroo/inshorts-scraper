Indian-origin actor Kal Penn tweeted that US Vice President Mike Pence reminds him of the character Kantaben from 2003 film 'Kal Ho Naa Ho'. Kantaben was portrayed as a "homophobic" character in the film who would feel uncomfortable on seeing Shah Rukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan's characters together. Meanwhile, Pence has often been criticised for opposing gay rights.
