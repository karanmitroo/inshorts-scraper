Actor Naseeruddin Shah is set to star in 'The Tashkent Files', a film based on former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri's death. The film will also star actor Mithun Chakraborty. "Both Naseeruddin and Mithun are powerhouses and were obvious choices for the film. This film also brings them together onscreen after a long time," said the film's director Vivek Agnihotri.
