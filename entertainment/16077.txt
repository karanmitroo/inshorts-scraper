'Spectre', the 24th James Bond movie, which released in India on Friday, "is probably the most formulaic Bond film that (Daniel) Craig has ever done," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). India Today said, "Christoph Waltz doesn't really come across as very convincing as the villain". The two and a half hour Sam Mendes directorial was rated 3/5 (HT and India Today).
