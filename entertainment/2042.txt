Actor Ayushmann Khurrana has said stars like Akshay Kumar and Aamir Khan have set a benchmark for socially relevant films. "People haven't labelled them, so I don't see any risk," he added while talking about doing such films. Ayushmann further said, "They're an inspiration and I certainly won't have any apprehensions signing other such films if they come my way."
