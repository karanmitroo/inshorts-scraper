Falling below expectations, Akshay Kumar's farcical movie 'Entertainment' collected a total of Rs. 11.57 crore on its opening day. The film, released in 3,200 screens worldwide, is behind 7 films like 'Kick', 'Jai Ho', 'Ek Villain', '2 states', and Akshay's own 'Holiday', when it comes to first-day collections. However, it is expected to get a boost over the weekend.
