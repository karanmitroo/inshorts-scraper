Actor Jada Pinkett Smith and Director Spike Lee on Monday said that they will boycott the Academy Awards ceremony (Oscars) on February 28 as no black actors feature in the  nominations. The two criticised the Academy for not doing enough to promote diversity as all 20 nominations under the Actor category are white for the second consecutive year.
