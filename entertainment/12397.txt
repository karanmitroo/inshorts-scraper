Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said that there is too much importance given on Katrina Kaif's breakup with Ranbir Kapoor. "[I]t should just end now. She is fabulous in the film and her work will speak for her," said Sidharth about his 'Baar Baar Dekho' co-star. He added that Katrina's positive quality is not taking her position and experience for granted.
