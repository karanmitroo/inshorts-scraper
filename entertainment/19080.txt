Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber reportedly had a private dance lesson Saturday. The 'Baby' hitmaker and the 21-year-old singer, who have dated on/off since 2010, were spotted enjoying a two-hour session with a choreographer in Texas. Both were reportedly seen together having breakfast and they even hugged and kissed each other during their outing at a restaurant.
