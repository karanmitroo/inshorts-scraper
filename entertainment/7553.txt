The poster of the upcoming film 'Behen Hogi Teri' shows the male lead Rajkummar Rao dressed up as Lord Shiva while sitting on a bike. Rajkummar said that the film is not a typical Bollywood potboiler, or romantic-comedy but a very relatable, human film with lot of interesting moments. Directed by Ajay K Pannalal, the film also stars Shruti Haasan.
