A new documentary by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Nanette Burstein accuses McAfee antivirus maker, John McAfee, of rape of a female business partner and murdering two men. The two murders include killing a Belizian man while another suggests McAfee getting his neighbour killed for poisoning his dogs. McAfee has denied the allegations and accused Burstein of paying locals for fabricated interviews.
