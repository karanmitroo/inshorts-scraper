Actor Amitabh Bachchan has said that instead of shying away from criticism, he takes it as an "incentive". “It (criticism) is important for us, it helps in improving yourself... I don’t look at criticism as it is rubbish and not read it", he said. Further, Bachchan added,  "[I]t’s wonderful to have another view point, you get a different perspective".
