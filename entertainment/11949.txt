DC Comic writer Greg Rucka has said Wonder Woman "must be queer" and has "obviously" been in love and had relationships with women. Wonder Woman is known as the warrior princess Diana in her homeland of Themyscira, an island populated only by Amazonian women. She leaves the island for New York, where she falls for a man called Steve Trevor.
