Freida Pinto and Amy Jackson were among the celebrities who attended shows at the ongoing London Fashion Week. While Freida wore a Burberry ensemble while attending the label's show, Amy was spotted wearing a printed outfit from 'Rat and Boa' for Peter Pilotto's show. Model-turned-actress Cara Delevingne also attended Burberry's show, which was inspired by Virginia Woolf's novel 'Orlando'.
