Singer Ed Sheeran deleted his Twitter account on Monday, after announcing earlier this month that he's taking a break from the social media platform. "I go on it and there's nothing but people saying mean things," he had said earlier. Notably, the singer was trolled for his cameo appearance on Sunday's premiere episode of 'Game of Thrones' season 7.
