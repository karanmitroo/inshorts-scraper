After actor Abhay Deol attended the Screen Awards (on Jan-14) with a black eye to protest against T-Series for not releasing his film ‘One By Two’s’ music, the record company has given an official statement. T-Series, which reportedly wants Abhay to get composer Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to sign a clause first, Thursday contended that none of its agreements were against the law.
