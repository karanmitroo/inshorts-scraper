Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence has slammed people mocking her for wearing a 'revealing' Versace dress on a winter day during the promotions for her upcoming film 'Red Sparrow'. "I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because...that was my choice," Jennifer wrote on Facebook. She added, "This is sexist...this is not feminism."
