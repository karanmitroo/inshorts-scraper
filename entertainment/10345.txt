Hollywood actor Dwayne Johnson has shared a video message for a 15-year-old fan from Ireland, Tommy Hanley, who is battling stage IV cancer. "I have to remind you to eat to give you strength. You have to rest to give you strength," he said in the video. "I'm pulling for you man...Stay strong," Dwayne further said.
