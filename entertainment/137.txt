Anushka Sharma starrer 'Pari' has been banned in Pakistan by the Central Board of Film Censors. A member of Pakistan's Censor Board said the decision was taken as the film goes against Islamic values. "This film stimulates the viewers in favour of black magic and promotes thoughts that are contradictory to our religion," the Censor Board member added.
