The Oscar trophies were made of painted plaster for three years, owing to a metal shortage during World War II. Following the war, the recipients of the awards were invited by the Academy to exchange the plaster figures for gold-plated metal statuettes. The statuettes are usually made of solid bronze and plated in 24-carat gold.
