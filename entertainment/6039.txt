The Ranbir Kapoor starrer biopic on actor Sanjay Dutt has postponed its release date to March 30, 2018. The film was earlier set for a release on Christmas this year, which would have been the same release date as the Salman Khan starrer Tiger Zinda Hai. Hirani reportedly did not want to release the biopic alongside another big-budget film.
