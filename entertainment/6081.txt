Author Chetan Bhagat has reached an out-of-court settlement for a defamation case with the royal family from the erstwhile princely state of Dumraon in Bihar, over alleged references to the family in his book 'Half Girlfriend'. Bhagat also apologised for the "fictional" references to the royal family. The defamation case claimed male family members were portrayed as alcoholics and gamblers.
