In an apparent attack on Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Raees', BJP National General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has said, "Raees that couldn't be of its own country is of no good and we should support Kaabil that is patriotic". "The right of the one who is Kaabil shouldn't be snatched by dishonest Raees," read a poster that he shared on Twitter.
