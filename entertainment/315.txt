Actress Sonam Kapoor slammed a journalist who asked her if she had deleted a video of Deepika Padukone taking the 'Pad Man' challenge, wherein celebrities had to pose with a sanitary napkin in their hand. "There was an issue with my account...The post is still there," she said. Sonam added, "Don't create a controversy when there is none."
