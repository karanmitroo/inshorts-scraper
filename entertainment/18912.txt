Actress Vidya Balan has rubbished reports which talked about an alleged link-up between her husband Siddharth Roy Kapur and a newcomer actress. "I think these rumours started because I opted out of Sujoy's film, and IIFA awards. I said that there's a niggling health issue. But people said, 'Maybe it's not'... I think it's just extremely judgmental," Vidya said.
