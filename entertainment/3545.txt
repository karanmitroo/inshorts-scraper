Hollywood actor Jim Carrey, during an interview, called a New York Fashion Week event celebrating icons "meaningless". Carrey, who was part of the event himself, added, "Celebrating icons? That is just the absolute, lowest-aiming possibility that we could come up with." In the beginning of the interview, the actor can be seen circling the interviewer before starting to speak.
