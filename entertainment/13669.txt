Actor Shahid Kapoor has said that he is "taking a full-fledged paternity leave" to be around his wife Mira Rajput, who is currently in the third trimester of her pregnancy. "This is my once in a lifetime opportunity or twice in a lifetime opportunity, maybe (laughs)," said Shahid. The couple had tied the knot on July 7 last year.
