The Chairman of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Pahlaj Nihalani has said that he is still waiting for actor Manoj Bajpayee's career to start. "Apart from Satya, which was a very good film, Manoj has not featured in any hits in the 10-12 years of his career," said Nihalani. Earlier, Bajpayee had referred to Nihalani as a "spent force".
