Scriptwriter Salim Khan on Monday refused to receive the Padma Shri award, the 4th highest civilian honour by the government, claiming that he deserved more, and should have received the award earlier. However, the scriptwriter, who has co-written iconic films like Sholay, Deewar, Mr. India, and Seeta  Aur Geeta, was happy that the government recognized his contribution.
