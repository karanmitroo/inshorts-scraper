The Mission Impossible star Tom Cruise helped NASA redesign its website in the early 2000s, according to a former chief of the space agency Sean O'Keefe. Cruise reportedly visited NASA's offices in 2002 to make his views known. The Top Gun actor was unimpressed by the layout of the website and urged the team to make changes, O'Keefe revealed.
