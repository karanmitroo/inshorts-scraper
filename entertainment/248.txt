In a tweet mourning actress Sridevi's demise, the Twitter handle of Congress wrote, "An actor par excellence...She was awarded Padma Shri by UPA Govt in 2013." However, the tweet was later deleted after facing backlash from users. "Is that line even necessary? Please stop politicising...death," wrote a user. Another tweet read, "Also mention, she was born when Nehru was PM."
