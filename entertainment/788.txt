Censor Board Chief Prasoon Joshi has backed out of the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival. This comes after Rajput organisation Karni Sena threatened to not allow him to enter Jaipur. "I am doing this so that the dignity of the event doesn't get compromised...and also so that the lovers of literature get to focus on creativity and not controversy," said Prasoon.
