Talking about interacting with people while shooting in public places, actor Rishi Kapoor said, "Sometimes, when they (people) become unruly and start abusing and hitting each other, then you have to, at times, turn them away." However, Rishi also said, "When public behaves well with you, you also extend yourself (to them)."
