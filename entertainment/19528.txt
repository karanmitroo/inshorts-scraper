Hrithik Roshan, the lead in 'Krrish-3', has used 600-700 masks for his superhero-role, costing over Rs.8,000-each. Rakesh Roshan revealed that due to hot climate of Hyderabad, where majority of the movie has been shot, the masks would start melting since they were made of a special wax, due to which Hrithik had to use more masks as compared to Krrish-2.
