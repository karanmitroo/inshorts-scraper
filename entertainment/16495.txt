The Delhi High Court on Monday ordered filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma to pay a fine of Rs 10 lakh for duplicating the copyrighted work of the film 'Sholay' by directing its remake 'Aag' in 2007. The HC maintained that Varma infringed the moral rights of the original movie makers by producing and releasing 'Aag' without authorization from the owner and author.
