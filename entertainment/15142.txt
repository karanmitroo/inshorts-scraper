An oak chair used by author JK Rowling while penning down the first two books of the Harry Potter series will be put up for an auction in New York in April. Dubbed as the 'Harry Potter chair', the furniture product is expected to fetch over $45,000. The dining chair belongs to 1930s-era and Rowling owned it in 1995.
