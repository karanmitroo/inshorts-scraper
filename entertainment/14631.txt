The Chris Hemsworth starrer film 'The Huntsman: Winter’s War', which released on Friday, is "totally worthless, despite Hemsworth", wrote Hindustan Times. The Indian Express called out the 'Winter’s War' for "not (having) one decent battle", while the Times of India wrote "it's the visual dazzle that keeps this one afloat". It was rated 1/5 (Indian Express, HT) and 2.5/5 (TOI).
