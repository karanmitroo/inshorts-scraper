A 23-year-old photographer has accused Indian-origin American actor Aziz Ansari of sexual assault while she was on a date with him. She said Ansari tried to pull her hand towards his penis multiple times and asked her repeatedly, "Where do you want me to f*** you?" Ansari reportedly later apologised to her through text message, saying he misread things.
