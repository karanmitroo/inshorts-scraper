More than 22,000 people were evacuated on Saturday after a fire broke out on one of the stages at Tomorrowland Unite music festival in Barcelona, Spain. It is believed the fire could have been triggered by a firework display which was part of the show. Firefighters managed to extinguish the flame and no injuries have been reported, said the organisers.
