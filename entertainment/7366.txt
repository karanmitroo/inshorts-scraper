Comedian Sunil Grover has posted a picture on his Instagram showing the sole of his shoe along with the caption, 'Shoe size US 10'. This post comes amid his ongoing row with Kapil Sharma, whose show he was a part of. Notably, Kapil reportedly hurled a slipper at Sunil during a fight when they were onboard a flight.
