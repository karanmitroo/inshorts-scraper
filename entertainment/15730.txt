BJP MP Manoj Tiwari on Saturday claimed that he did not call actor Aamir Khan a 'traitor'. He said he would send a notice to the newspapers for publishing false news and tarnishing his image. It was earlier reported by some newspapers that he had called Aamir Khan a 'traitor' during a Parliamentary Standing Committee meeting on Friday.
