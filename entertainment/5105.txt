TV-film producer Ekta Kapoor has said that if the audience does not want to see star kids, they will throw them out like bad apples. Ekta added that no one in Bollywood promotes a relative or friend but it's usually done for the film to get some "curiosity value". However, if the star kid doesn't work, they aren't cast again.
