The first look of Rana Daggubati as a naval officer in the upcoming film 'The Ghazi Attack' was unveiled on Tuesday. The film is reportedly based on the sinking of PNS Ghazi, Pakistan's submarine during the Indo-Pak 1971 war and how an executive naval officer and his team remained underwater for 18 days. It will release on February 17, 2017.
