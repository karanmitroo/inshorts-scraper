The Lucknow district administration has asked all multiplexes in the city to run a free show of the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Rustom' on Independence Day. The purpose behind this is to "inculcate a sense of patriotism"â€‹ in the masses. The ticket windows for this special show will open from Friday, with tickets available on a first come first serve basis.
