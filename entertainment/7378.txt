American television host Jimmy Kimmel has slammed United Airlines after a video showing a passenger being dragged down the aisle by security officers has surfaced online. "I've been to a hundred games and stadiums with 50,000 seats, they never sell the same seat two times to one person, but for some reason, airlines cannot figure this out," said Kimmel.
