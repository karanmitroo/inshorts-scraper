Filmmaker Shyam Benegal, who headed the committee for bringing reform in the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), has said that it's not the Board's job to interfere if real names have been used in a film. "It's up to those specific individuals or their surviving families to sue the filmmakers in court for libel," added Benegal.
