Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has criticised the December 20 concert of Enrique Iglesias in Colombo, wherein women had hurled their underwear at the singer. Calling the women "uncivilised", Sirisena said the organisers "should be beaten with toxic stingray tails". The organising company, owned by former cricketers Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, have apologised for the chaos.
