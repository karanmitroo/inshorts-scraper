Music festival organisers in UK are planning to allow people to test illegal drugs, in an attempt to reduce drug-related deaths. People will be able to take drugs to a testing tent, where they will be told the drugs' contents, before they are destroyed. The scheme was tested last year when about 200 people tested their illegal drugs in England.
