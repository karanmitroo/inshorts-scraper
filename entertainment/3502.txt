Rajkummar Rao, while responding to reports about his cameo in Kangana Ranaut's 'Simran', said, "This Simran doesn't need any Raj." "Ja beta ja tujhe Raj ki zarurat nahi hai," he added while imitating a dialogue from 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'. Kangana and Rajkummar starred together in 'Queen', where Kangana's character goes alone on honeymoon after being ditched by Rajkummar's character.
