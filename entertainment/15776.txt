Trinamool Congress spokesperson Derek O'Brien on Tuesday tweeted that Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali and his son Aamir Ali will perform in Kolkata on January 12. Protests by the Shiv Sena had led to Ali's concerts in Mumbai and Pune getting cancelled in October. Earlier, Ali had said that "until things are settled down," he would not return to India.
