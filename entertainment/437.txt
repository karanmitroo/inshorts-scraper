Malayalam actress Priya Prakash Varrier, while speaking on the controversy over the song 'Manikya Malaraya Poovi', wherein a Muslim youth claimed that the song's lyrics are insulting to the Prophet, said, "It is actually unnecessary. And unwanted." "It's actually a Muslim traditional song and I don't think there's any kind of an element which is insulting to anyone," she added.
