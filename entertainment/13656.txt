SS Rajamouli, the director of the film 'Baahubali', has said that the film would not have happened with Bollywood actors. "When I started 'Baahubali: The Beginning'... we knew that I need my stars to give me their dates for two years. Can you think of any of the Bollywood stars who can give their dates for two years", Rajamouli said.
