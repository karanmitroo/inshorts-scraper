The makers of 'Pehredaar Piya Ki' have said they haven't received any legal notice from the Information and Broadcast Ministry to take the show off air. "If we get it, we're ready to give our explanation because... we haven't shown anything wrong in the story," they added. They further asked people not to judge the show without watching it.
