Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani on Tuesday reportedly said he will "have no problem" resigning if any of the cuts made to 'Spectre' were found to have violated rules. Nihalani said there had been no controversy when lengthier cuts were made to earlier Bond movies. He claimed the producers had written to him, glad it was released with minimum cuts.
