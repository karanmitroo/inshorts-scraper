Television actress Jennifer Winget, while speaking in support of her co-star Aneri Vajani who was recently body-shamed for being too skinny, said that people should respect personal space of actors. Jennifer added, "We're happy being us- skinny, fat or flabby... we too are trying to figure our body out." Jennifer and Aneri work together in the television serial Beyhadh.
