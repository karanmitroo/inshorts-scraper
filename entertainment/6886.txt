Veteran actress Asha Parekh has said that Rishi Kapoor is right in getting upset with younger generation of actors for skipping late actor Vinod Khanna's funeral. She added, "Youngsters need to respect veterans. It's very sad to know they didn't turn up." Rishi had slammed actors as they skipped the funeral but many attended Priyanka Chopra's party a night before.
