Actor Ranveer Singh, while thanking his fans for the response to the trailer of 'Padmavati', wrote, "Sanjay Sir, my crazy genius, the master craftsman...has fought, suffered and sacrificed for this film." "I assure you that what you've seen thus far is just a tiny fraction of what the film has to offer," Ranveer further wrote.
