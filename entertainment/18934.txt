After nearly 40 years of allowing only stars and crew to pass through its gates, Filmcity in Mumbai, known for hosting countless Bollywood films, opened to tourists this year. The weekend tours are organized by the tourism board of the Maharashtra state government. It is one of Indiaâ€™s largest studios where scenes can be shot outdoors and indoors.
