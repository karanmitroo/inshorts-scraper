Online youth entertainment network 'The Viral Fever' (TVF) on Wednesday released a 12-minute video on YouTube featuring Bollywood actors Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. The video, titled 'Bhaag Jeetu Bhaag - The Jodi Awakens', is a funny take on "a world obsessed with romance" and how SRK-Kajol fans react when someone calls their onscreen pair 'kind of okay' or 'overrated'.
