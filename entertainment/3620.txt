The Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol starrer 'Poster Boys', which released on Friday, is "occasionally funny, but never actually engrosses audiences," wrote Hindustan Times. Indian Express wrote the film, "is a sorry mess of a film," while Times of India called it "a light-hearted...clever take on the population problem." It was rated 2.5/5 (HT), 0.5/5 (Indian Express) and 3.5/5 (TOI).
