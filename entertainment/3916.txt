The Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez starrer 'A Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky', which released on Friday, is "full of clich√©s and typecasts the characters," wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV wrote Jacqueline's character "does not evolve into a woman of substantial significance," while Indian Express wrote, "the plot... keeps sliding." It was rated 3/5 (HT) and 2/5 (NDTV, Indian Express).
