Actress Prachi Desai has said that she wants an all-girls-band film like 'Rock On' to be made.    "I don’t know why anyone hasn’t thought about that. Today, Bollywood is getting so much more experimental, why should women be behind," said Prachi. The 27-year-old actress has starred in the 2008 film 'Rock On!!' and will also appear in 'Rock On!! 2'.
