The teaser of the short film 'Come Swim', which marks actress Kristen Stewart's directorial debut in films, has been released. "It's not a small movie," said Stewart. The film's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival coincided with the release of 'Bringing Impressionism to Life with Neural Style Transfer in Come Swim', a research paper on artificial intelligence co-authored by Stewart.
