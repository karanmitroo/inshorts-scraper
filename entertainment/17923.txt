Supermodel Miranda Kerr, who recently posed topless for a magazine, says she likes being naked. "I love taking my shoes off and being in the grass. Or sunbaking naked. I wish I could go skinny-dipping in the ocean. If I didn't have to worry about anyone taking my picture, I'd totally be out there," the former Victoria's Secrets model said.
