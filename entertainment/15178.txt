Sam Smith, who called himself the first ever openly gay man to win an Oscar, apologised for saying so on Tuesday on Twitter. Smith, who won the 2016 Oscar for the Best Original Song, retracted his comment after several openly gay Oscar winners challenged his statement. "My point was to shine some light on the LGBT community," Smith clarified.
