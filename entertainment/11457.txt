Actor Shahid Kapoor has revealed that though his wife, Mira is an outdoor person, she cannot go out freely anymore as people recognise her. "She complains that 'now people recognise me, I hate it'," the 35-year-old actor said. The actor added "it's nice to be with someone who's connected to reality" because he had "missed that side of his life".
