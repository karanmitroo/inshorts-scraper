Malaika Arora has written a post on the safety of women in India in the light of the Bengaluru molestation case. In the post, she questioned the belief that a woman's safety is her own responsibility. "Girls wearing short clothes and drinking and partying are copying the Western culture. Boys who molest them are copying the Indian culture???," she wrote.
