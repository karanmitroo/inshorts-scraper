Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu is not leaving the comedy show 'The Kapil Sharma Show', as per Preeti Simoes, the show's Creative Head. "There's no notice served by Navjot Singh Sidhu to Sony Entertainment Television... All propaganda that he's leaving is false," said Simoes. Earlier, Sidhu's wife said that he was leaving the show to focus on his political career.
