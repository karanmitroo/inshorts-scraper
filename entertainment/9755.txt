Satirical newspaper The Onion has signed a deal with Lionsgate to develop three films based on its ideas. Onion Studios said, "We’ve plotted our takeover of the film industry...We’ll make room on our award shelf for some Oscars. To the basement you go, Pulitzers." Interestingly, its headlines have included, "Ryan Gosling sneaks past paparazzi in full-body red carpet camouflage."
