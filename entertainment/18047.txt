The Bombay High Court Friday refused to grant a stay on hosting the Sunburn Electronic Dance Festival, slated to start in Goa from Saturday. The court was hearing the public interest litigation filed by Congress party's Goa spokesman Sunil Kawathankar. The petition had pleaded the festival be stopped as it accused its organizers of evading tax on sale of tickets.
