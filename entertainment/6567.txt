Actress Kriti Sanon has said that she doesn't see any reason to justify her relationship with actor Sushant Singh Rajput. She added, "We know what the truth is. Over a period of time, I have realised that link-ups with co-stars are part and parcel of the industry." The duo reportedly started dating while shooting for their upcoming film 'Raabta'.
