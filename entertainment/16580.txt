The first recording contract ever signed by the English band The Beatles will be auctioned in New York next month for an estimated amount of $150,000. It was signed in 1961 during the band’s early days in Germany by Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and then-drummer Peter Best. It was a part of late German record-producer Uwe Blaschke’s memorabilia.
