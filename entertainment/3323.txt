Karim Morani, who produced films like Chennai Express and Ra.One, surrendered before the police in Telangana on Saturday in connection to a rape case. Morani allegedly raped a Delhi-based woman on multiple occasions, who filed a case against him in January. This comes after the Supreme Court dismissed his plea challenging Hyderabad High Court's verdict to cancel his bail.
