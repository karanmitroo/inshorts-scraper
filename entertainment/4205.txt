Kriti Sanon has said that she is not a high maintenance girlfriend. "I...(prefer) enjoying a meal at home, watching a film in my pyjamas, or walking around the beach instead of going on an expensive date," added Kriti. She further said that she is romantic at heart and is a diehard fan of 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'.
