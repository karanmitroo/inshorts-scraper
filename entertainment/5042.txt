In a blog post, Amitabh Bachchan wrote that during a visit to a "foreign land", he was called a third rate actor from a third world country. He further wrote that it's painful to hear India being called a third world country and added, "In time it shall no longer be developing but DEVELOPED...and become the 1st world than 3rd!"
