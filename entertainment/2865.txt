Sanjay Leela Bhansali has said late filmmaker Lekh Tandon's 1966 film 'Amrapali' inspired his films 'Bajirao Mastani' and 'Padmavati'. Bhansali added, "The way he recreated the war scenes, and...presented the amazing Vyjayanthimala ji in those incredible songs...were definitely my reference points for Deepika Padukone in (these films)." Notably, Tandon passed away on Sunday aged 88.
