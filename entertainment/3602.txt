Singer Rihanna, on being asked by magician David Copperfield where she'd want to go if she was made to disappear and reappear anywhere in the world, said she'd like to time travel to ten minutes before she lost her virginity. "I'm holding you to that offer," she said to Copperfield. Rihanna earlier revealed her first kiss was in high school.
