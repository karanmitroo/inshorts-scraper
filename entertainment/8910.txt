The former Jaipur royal family will take disciplinary action against officials for allowing the makers of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati' to shoot without providing complete details about the film. Former Rajmata Padmini Devi said, "Anyone attempting to twist...Rajasthan's history won't be tolerated." She added that the film's story will be checked before giving permission for further shoots.
