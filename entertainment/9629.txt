Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali has revealed that his upcoming film 'Love in Tokyo', an Indo-Japan collaborative venture, will have an Indian hero and a Japanese heroine. "It is not a remake of the old film... we have just borrowed the title... The story is rooted in their respective cultures and the film would be shot mostly in Hindi," added Imtiaz.
