Singer Chris Martin met Ken, a fan suffering from stage IV cancer before performing at a concert in Philippines. Ken could not attend the band's concert owing to his medical condition. The concert's organiser came to know about him after his brother wrote a post on Facebook, in which he said Ken had purchased a ticket for the concert.
