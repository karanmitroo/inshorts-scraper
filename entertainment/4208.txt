Hollywood actor Tom Cruise got hurt while shooting a stunt for his upcoming film 'Mission: Impossible 6' (M:I 6). The video shows the actor jumping between two buildings with the assistance of a harness and missing the edge of the second roof and banging into the building. He can later be seen limping, before collapsing near crew members.
