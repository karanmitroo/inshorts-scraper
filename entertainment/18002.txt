A day after Bollywood actor Salman Khan campaigned for Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lankan actor-turned politician Ranjan Ramanayake on Tuesday asked Salman to stay away from the country's politics. Ranjan, who is also an opposition parliamentarian, advised Salman not to "sell" himself to "the corrupt politicians". Ramanayake further urged the Indian actor to go back to India.
