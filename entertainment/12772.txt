An eight-minute video shows New York-based jazz group Brooklyn Qawwali Party performing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's 'Mustt Mustt' on a ten-piece orchestra. The tribute band reworks Khan's music into a blend of jazz and Qawwali using four horns, three percussionists, a guitar, a bass, and a harmonium. The Pakistani Qawwali legend passed away 19 years ago on August 16, 1997.
