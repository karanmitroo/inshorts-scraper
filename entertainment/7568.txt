Actress Parvathy has claimed that casting couch exists in the Malayalam film industry while adding, "I haven't faced it (issue of casting couch) at all in any other industry." She further said, "There was a time when it was expected of me, people asked me very openly, be it actors or directors... That too by seniors in the industry."
