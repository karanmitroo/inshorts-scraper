Priyanka Chopra said that she wanted to get married ever since she was twelve. "During the fancy dress competition in school, I'd dress up as a dulhan... I loved being a dulhania," added Priyanka. She further said that her life's dream was for her wedding jewellery, trousseau to be made and for her family to be dancing and singing together.
