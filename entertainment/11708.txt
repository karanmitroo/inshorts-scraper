Music composer trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, while commenting on working with cross-border artistes, have said that "right now, they would like to work with Indian artistes only", keeping in mind the prevailing sensitive atmosphere in the country. However, the composers refused to comment about the ban on Pakistani artistes. Previously, singer Shaan had spoken in support of the Pak artistes' ban.
