Ousted Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani will produce a film on the Babri Masjid demolition titled 'Kabir Ka Ayodhya'. "I'm being told that there's a fear my film wouldn't be in keeping with the Bharatiya Janta Party's ideology. But I want people to stop worrying," he said. Pahlaj added, "I am not afraid of the truth, no matter how bitter."
