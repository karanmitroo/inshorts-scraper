London-based street artist Bambi has reimagined US President Donald Trump dancing with UK PM Theresa May as part of a graffiti parody branded 'Lie Lie Land', based on a promotional poster of musical La La Land. It recalls Trump's meeting with May in Washington DC when he held her hand at a press appearance.
