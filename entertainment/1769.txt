Actress Jennifer Lawrence has said producer Harvey Weinstein was 'paternal' to her. "I had known him since I was 20...so I needed a moment to process everything because I thought I knew this guy, and then he's being accused of rape," Lawrence added. She further said, "We all knew he was a dog...(but) didn't know that he was a rapist."
