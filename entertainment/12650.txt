A Mughal-e-Azam theme park will be developed in Uttar Pradesh's Etawah to attract tourists, a government official has said. This comes after the directions of Uttar Pradesh's CM Akhilesh Yadav to promote tourism in the state. The park themed on the 1960 film starring Dilip Kumar and Madhubala, will also highlight its director K Asif who hails from Etawah.
