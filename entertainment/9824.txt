Singer-actor Meiyang Chang has said that Bollywood needs to dignify the portrayal of gay characters as "it has created a[n]...incorrect perception of the gay community". "In the real world, gay men come in all sizes, shapes and types, just like anybody else," he added. He further said the West has handled gay and lesbian characters with "sensitivity and grace".
