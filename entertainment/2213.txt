Actress Sunny Leone has said she didn't face casting couch in Bollywood as she was sheltered by her husband Daniel Weber and her team. "But does it exist in the industry? Absolutely! It's not just the women, men too face similar issues," she added. Sunny further said, "I can say yes or no to whoever without having any fear."
