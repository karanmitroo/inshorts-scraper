Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, who is quite active on different social networks, has been named the Social Media Person of the Year, by the Internet and Mobile Association of India. The event is still due to happen in Delhi, but as Bachchan wonâ€™t be able to make it, he was honoured in advance. He received the award in Mumbai Tuesday.
