Raveena Tandon has said that in her childhood, she had a huge crush on Sanjay Dutt. Raveena added, "I used to be very scared while working with him [Dutt] as...couldn't believe that I was actually doing a film with someone whose poster were all over my room's wall." The two have worked together in seven films, including Vijeta and Kshatriya.
