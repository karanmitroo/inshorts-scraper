Following threats of protests by an NGO against screening of Pakistani film 'Jago Hua Savera', the organisers of 18th Jio Mumbai Academy of Moving Image Festival have decided not to screen the film. The NGO had reportedly slammed the organisers for "hurting Indian nationalist sentiments". The film was scheduled to be screened as part of the festival's Restored Classics Section.
