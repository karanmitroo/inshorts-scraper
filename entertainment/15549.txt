Actor Leonardo DiCaprio met Pope Francis on Thursday at the Vatican to discuss the issue of climate change. DiCaprio showed the Pope a book of 15th-century artist Hieronymus Bosch whose paintings have elements which, according to the actor, represent "what's going on in the environment" currently. Notably, the actor initially addressed the Pope in Italian.
