Nawazuddin Siddiqui took to Twitter to thank the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal for clearing his film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' with minor cuts. The Pahlaj Nihalani-led Central Board of Film Certification had earlier ordered 48 cuts in the film, after giving it an 'A' certificate. Directed by Kushan Nandy and also starring Bidita Bag, the film will release on August 25.
