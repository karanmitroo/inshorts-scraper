Television-film producer Ekta Kapoor has said that when sex is prohibited, it actually encourages sexual crime. "I think, as a nation we should stop having a problem with sex," said Ekta. However, she admitted she cannot make stories on TV which are bold as even a kiss on the small screen seems discomforting if her father Jeetendra is around.
