Talking about her upcoming film Kamasutra 3D, Shrleyn Chopra says, "I don't enjoy watching porn. It has no depth. My film is not just about sexual positions. When I asked if it would be soft-porn, Director Rupesh Paul told that this would be one of the most emotional, passionate love sagas of all time. That was it. I was sold."
