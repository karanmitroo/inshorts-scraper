Aamir Khan has said that his dream project is to make the Hindu epic Mahabharata, in which he might play the character Krishna. Aamir added, "My favourite character is Karna, but I don't know if I'll be able to play him due to my physique." He further said he is afraid to start the project as it'll take 15-20 years.
