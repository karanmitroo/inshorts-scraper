The members of Rajput organisation Karni Sena have demanded that the title of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati' be changed. They have also demanded to form a screening committee to review the film before its release. The protesters from the organisation had earlier attacked Bhansali and vandalised the film's set, claiming that the film distorts facts.
