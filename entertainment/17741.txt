The makers of 'MS Dhoni - The Untold Story' have decided to dedicate a song 'Phir Se' to the Indian Cricket Team that is geared-up for the World Cup. Film's director Neeraj Pandey said, "The idea was to sum-up the mood and emotion for the entire nation. 'Phir Se' is an anthem, plea, prayer, dream... all rolled in one."
