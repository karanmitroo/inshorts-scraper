Kumar Sanu, while speaking about Bollywood music these days, said sometimes he feels singers today are not singing but shouting out loud. "Where's the melody?...You can't make just foot-tapping numbers or take inspiration from Western music," he added. Kumar Sanu further said that Bollywood compositions today also lack variety and sometimes, different songs by one composer sound similar.
