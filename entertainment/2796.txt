Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence has revealed that at the beginning of her career, a male producer told her she wasn't fat and was 'perfectly f*ckable'. Lawrence added that this happened after she protested against a female producer, who forced her to pose naked alongside thinner girls in a bid to have her lose weight for a role.
