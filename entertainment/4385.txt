Filmmaker Karan Johar has started following actress Kajol on Instagram after she reportedly liked the picture he shared of his twins Roohi and Yash on the social media platform. Johar and Kajol had a major fallout in 2016 after she supported her husband Ajay Devgn over a controversy regarding the same day release of 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and 'Shivaay'.
