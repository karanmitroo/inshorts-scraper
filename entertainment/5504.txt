Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he would like it if Salman Khan considers making a guest appearance in his upcoming film with director Aanand L Rai. "We are still working on it... Whether he is playing himself or not, just like Gogo Pasha's role (in Tubelight), we will keep it a secret till the end," added SRK.
