Actor Shah Rukh Khan is set to play the role of a dwarf in filmmaker Aanand L Rai's next film. "He is a gutsy actor. He always takes challenges. It is a delight to have him in the film," said Rai. The director, who is known for films including 'Tanu Weds Manu: Returns', is yet to finalise a female lead.
