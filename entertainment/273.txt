Pakistani actress Mahira Khan has slammed the media for defaming actor Javed Sheikh over a video in which she can be seen flinching away while Sheikh tried to kiss her on the cheek during an award ceremony. "Don't use anything and everything to make news...He is a legend and a mentor to all of us in this industry," Mahira tweeted.
