Mumbai Police are in search of actor Om Puri(62), who has been accused of hitting his estranged second-wife, Nandita, with a rod after an argument.  Nandita, who had earlier filed a case against Puri demanding maintenance, said, "He wants me to leave the house and shift to Kolkata. He has not been paying proper maintenance and has been avoiding court-hearings."
