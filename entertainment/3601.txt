Shreyas Talpade took to Twitter to slam Kamaal R Khan for badmouthing his directorial debut film 'Poster Boys'. KRK had commented on the "zero" star power of Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol, who star in the film, and Talpade's directorial abilities. He further wrote that the Deol brothers should hang Talpade upside down for "destroying" their career.
