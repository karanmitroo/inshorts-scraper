Veteran actor Randhir Kapoor has said that he doesn't plan to divorce his estranged wife Babita, mother of Kareena Kapoor and Karisma Kapoor. He added, "She found I was a terrible man who drank a lot...and I didnâ€™t want to live the way she wanted. We preferred to stay separately, [but] we are not enemies." The couple separated in mid-1980s.
