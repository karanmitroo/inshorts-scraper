Hollywood film 'Everest', which released this week, is shot beautifully and is eminently watchable in 3D, wrote Indian Express. The Baltasar Korm√°kur directorial is strangely abstract and lacks the gravity of genuine tragedy, said New York Times. The film, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Kelly and Josh Brolin, has been rated 4/5 (The Independent), 3.5/5 (Indian Express) and 2/5 (The Guardian).
