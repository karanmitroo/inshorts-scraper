'Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai!' producer duo Binaifer Kohli and her husband Sanjay have filed a criminal defamation case against television actress Shilpa Shinde, who earlier portrayed 'Angoori bhabhi' on the serial. This comes amid the FIR filed by Shilpa accusing Sanjay of sexually harassing her. Shilpa had left the serial in 2016 alleging that the makers "mentally tortured" her.
