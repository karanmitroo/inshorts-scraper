Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali, while speaking about Ranbir Kapoor completing 10 years in Bollywood, said, "Ranbir is a 'bada janwar'. He is meant for big things." "His success or failure cannot be measured by the rat race because he is not a rat," Imtiaz added. Ranbir's debut film 'Saawariya' released on November 9 in 2007.
