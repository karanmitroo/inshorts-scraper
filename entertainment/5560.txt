Akshaye Khanna, while speaking about his break from films, said it was torturous as he has been working since the age of 19. He added that after he joined films post the sabbatical, he wanted to start with slightly smaller, but quality roles. Akshaye, who's known for films like 'Taal', 'Dil Chahta Hai', will be next seen in Sridevi's 'Mom'.
