Actor-producer Uday Chopra has said that actress Nargis Fakhri is still his "close friend". "The press has done a wonderful job of creating stories out of thin air and I applaud their creativity. However these are all untrue", he added. Earlier, media reports had claimed that the actor had broken up with Nargis, prompting her to leave for the US.
