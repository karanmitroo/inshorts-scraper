Pakistani actress Mahira Khan has said she feels bad that she cannot promote her Bollywood debut film 'Raees' in India due to the tension between India and Pakistan. "When you put so much effort and hard work in a project, you wish to see the results," she added. She further said that 'Raees' is a very special film for her.
