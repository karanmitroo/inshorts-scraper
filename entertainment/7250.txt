Singer Zubeen Garg left his concert mid-way in Guwahati on Friday after the organisers interrupted the concert and raised objections over him singing Hindi songs. The organisers argued that there was a tradition of presenting only Assamese music during the event. "I will sing whatever I like, you cannot dictate me," said Zubeen before leaving the stage.
