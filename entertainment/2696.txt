According to reports, Karan Johar has refused to launch Prabhas in a Bollywood film as he demanded â‚¹20 crore as his fee. "No South Indian actor, not even Rajinikanth, has that kind of commercial clout in Hindi cinema. Prabhas has clearly out-priced himself," a source was quoted as saying. Johar's Dharma Productions had distributed the Hindi version of Prabhas' 'Baahubali'.
