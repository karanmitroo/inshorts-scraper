Australian commentator Michael Slater addressed actress Anushka Sharma as Virat Kohli's wife during his commentary on the final day of the third Test between Australia and India in Melbourne. Realising his mistake, Slater then quickly corrected his statement and called Anushka as Kohli's 'fiancee'. Anushka was seen on the stands cheering Virat who was chasing a target set by Australia.
