Actor Will Smith on Thursday confirmed that he would follow his wife Jada Pinkett Smith's decision to boycott this year's Academy Awards over lack of nominations for black actors. "I’ve been nominated twice for Academy Awards and I’ve never lost to a white person," said Smith. Earlier, Smith's performance in 'Concussion' was expected to fetch him an Oscar nomination.
