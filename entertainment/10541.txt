Actress Vaani Kapoor, while denying reports of getting plastic surgery done on her chin, said, "I can't afford surgery, I am only one-film old." She further said, "I have lost weight; my face is bound to look different. We shot in Paris when it was freezing; the cameras keep zooming in and out. The face looks different from different angles."
