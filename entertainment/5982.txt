Filmmaker Karan Johar tweeted that he's dying to show a picture of his late father Yash Johar with martial artist Bruce Lee to his mother Hiroo Johar. The picture was originally shared by filmmaker Shekhar Kapur while conducting research for his upcoming film on Lee. Kapur tweeted that he was as excited as Karan on seeing the picture.
