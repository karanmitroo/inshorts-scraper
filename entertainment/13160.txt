Web streaming sites Netflix India and Hotstar engaged in a fight on Twitter over a picture posted by Netflix on Kevin Spacey's birthday. Hotstar claimed that the picture was inspired by their tweet used for promoting the comedy group 'AIB'. Netflix India responded to the claim using a GIF containing the dialogue 'Insecurity bores me' and the spat continued.
