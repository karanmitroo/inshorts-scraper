Former adult star Mia Khalifa has started her own YouTube channel with a review of Christopher Nolan's directorial 'Dunkirk'. In her video review, she said, "I don't know if the whole thing lasted 23 hours or if the rescue mission took two-and-a-half-months." Mia also slammed 'Dunkirk', while tweeting, "I love Nolan...but Dunkirk sucked more d**k than I did in 2014."
