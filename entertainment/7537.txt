Marvel's vice president of sales David Gabriel, while talking about dwindling sales of Marvel comic books, said, "What we heard was that people didn't want any more diversity... They didn't want female characters out there." However, Gabriel added that the new heroes were not going anywhere as Marvel is proud to introduce unique characters that reflect new voices and experiences.
