The poster of 'Ittefaq' which showed actor Akshaye Khanna lighting a cigarette has been taken down by the film's makers. This comes after the producers were served a strict compliance notice by Delhi Health Department for promoting smoking in the film. Any remaining posters will be in violation of the notice and legal action will be initiated against the producers.
