Actor Johnny Depp dressed up as 'Captain Jack Sparrow', the character he portrays in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film series, when he visited children at the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London. The visit was aimed to be a Christmas special. Notably, Depp's daughter Lily-Rose was treated for renal failure in the same hospital in 2007.
