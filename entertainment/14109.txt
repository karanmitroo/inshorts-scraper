Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Saturday said "Who says I'm Big B?" while responding to a schoolgirl's question on his stardom at the 'Ek Nayi Subah' event, which marked the Modi government's second anniversary. The actor further sat down on the floor and added, "Look I've become small... No one is Big. One has to... work hard to reach one's goals."
