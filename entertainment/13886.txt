Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the CBFC has lost its meaning following the Bombay High Court's verdict on 'Udta Punjab'. "[D]oors for films with obscene, vulgar content are open... I have come to know that the board is not here to censor movies". He added that he was not â€œangry" with the decision.
