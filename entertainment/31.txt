Apurva Asrani, co-writer of Kangana Ranaut's 'Simran' revealed he has been diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, a condition which causes loss of facial muscle movement. "Mine was accompanied by severe vertigo, and I couldn't stand without falling over," he added. Apurva further said, "One senior neurologist told me to be prepared that if there was nerve damage, I might never recover".
