Actor Emraan Hashmi announced on Twitter that he has started working on a documentary on cancer. He wrote, "It's [the documentary] in its initial stages. It's important to create awareness about 'the C word'." Last year, Emraan published a book on his son's battle with cancer titled 'The Kiss of Life: How A Superhero and My Son Defeated Cancer'.
