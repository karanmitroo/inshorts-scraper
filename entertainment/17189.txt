Actress Kalki Koechlin, ex-wife of filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, recently replied to Kashyap’s emotional statements about her. "… he makes it sound like I’m dead! I’m still alive and I’m very much there for him so I don’t think he has lost me at all…,” Kalki said. Kashyap, in a recent interview, had said that losing Kalki was his "biggest loss”.
