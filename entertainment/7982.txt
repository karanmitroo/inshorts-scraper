NASA paid tribute to late American singer-songwriter Chuck Berry by including his song 'Johnny B Goode' to 'Music from Earth' in the deep-space Voyager mission. The Voyager mission includes two probes launched 40 years ago, which have reached beyond the Solar System, carrying a 'Golden Record' containing selected sounds and images from Earth intended to communicate with probable extraterrestrials.
