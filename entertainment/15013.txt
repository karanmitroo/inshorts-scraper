Late Ghazal singer Jagjit Singh's wife, Chitra Singh, has moved Delhi HC against an event organising company for scheduling his 'live' concert in Delhi, almost five years after his death. The HC has asked the event organising company to submit â‚¹5 lakh for running misleading advertisements of the concert. The concert would reportedly have used Jagjit's voice from past concerts.
