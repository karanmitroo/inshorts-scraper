Bihar police claimed that showing the movie 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo', which has good, old family values, helped them win over children from Maoist-infested villages and discourage them from joining Maoists. Police interacted with over 100 children and their guardians at the screening on Sunday. Gaya police officials also distributed books and study material to the children.
