English singer Sir Elton John has denied a sexual harassment claim by Jeffrey Wenninger, a captain in the Los Angeles police department who had earlier served in his security team. A legal representative for John said that the claims were "baseless" and made "to extract an undeserved payment". Wenninger had accused John of groping him and making sexually suggestive comments.
