Hrithik Roshan, while talking about his row with Kangana Ranaut, said, "Only time I actually had tears in my eyes was when I saw this huge Amul hoarding with my brand Krrish." He added the hoarding made him look like a disgusting creep. Hrithik recalled how Amul earlier made a hoarding on his debut film while calling him a phenomenon.
