Kanpur-based group Kshatriya Mahasabha has announced a cash reward for anyone who would chop off actress Deepika Padukone's nose over the row on 'Padmaavat'. "We have collected a bounty of crores of rupees from Kanpurites to be given as reward," claimed President Gajendra Singh Rajawat. The organisation also staged a dharna on Wednesday to protest against the film's release.
