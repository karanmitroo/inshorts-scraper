Hollywood filmmaker Martin Scorsese has announced adapting Kenneth Branaugh's stage adaptation of Macbeth into a film. The film will reportedly be more of a documentary than an adaptation and will be filmed at the Second World War Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire. Scorsese and Branaugh are trying to get the original cast together which had Branaugh himself as the Shakespearean anti-hero.
