Actor Anupam Kher was stopped at the Srinagar airport and denied permission to visit the NIT Srinagar campus on Sunday. He was visiting the students to give them "a sense of warmth," he said. Kher had earlier praised NIT students for protesting against those who allegedly raised anti-India slogans after India lost to West Indies in the World T20 semi-final.
