Baijiraj Trivikrama Kumari Jamwal, a direct descendant of the Mewar royal family, has said that instead of making clear that 'Padmavati is a Bollywood 'masala', it's being masked as history. "The sad part is that the film is getting free pre-release publicity...using my family's name," added Jamwal. She further said that exploiting someone's pride for such shallow purposes is unacceptable.
