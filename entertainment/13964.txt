Actress Huma Qureshi and actor Vidyut Jammwal have featured in 'Dillagi', the new single by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. The song is a rendition of the qawwali 'Tumhen Dillagi Bhool Jaani Padegi' by late Pakistani musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. While the song's original composition is attributed to Nusrat, the current version has been composed by music duo 'Salim-Sulaiman'.
