Shekhar Suman's son Adhyayen Suman has said that online trolls, being paid to abuse him online, should use that money to "watch the film and save the Titanic from sinking". He is said to be referring to his ex-girlfriend Kangana Ranaut's film 'Rangoon' and its box-office performance as sinking 'Titanic'. Adhyayen added that his failure as an actor was "debatable".
