Shyam Rangeela, a contestant on 'The Great Indian Laughter Challenge', has revealed he was asked to avoid mimicking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. "In the end, I performed...with just two days' rehearsals and got eliminated," said Rangeela. He added that the channel Star Plus did not air his mimicry of PM Modi.
