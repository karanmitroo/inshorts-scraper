Sony Pictures Studios has announced that Spider-Man's villain 'Venom' will be getting a standalone film, which will release on October 5, 2018. The character's first appearance was in the 2007 film 'Spider-Man 3' opposite Tobey Maguire, who played Spider-Man. However, the film will not be related to the 2017 film 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' as the latter is a Marvel Studio co-production.
