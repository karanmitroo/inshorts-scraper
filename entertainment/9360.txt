Rakesh Roshan has said he will quit the film industry if exhibitors succumb to pressure, while reacting to his film 'Kaabil' getting lesser screens than Shah Rukh Khan's 'Raees'. "I don't want to make films if this is the way [exhibitors] are behaving," he added. Rakesh further said exhibitors have shown their weakness by not providing a 50-50 screen count.
