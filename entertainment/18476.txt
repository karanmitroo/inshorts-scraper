Emraan Hashmi's Hollywood debut 'Tigers' will release in January 2015 in India. The film, which is inspired by a true story of a salesman, Syed Aamir Raza, was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) recently. Directed by Oscar-winning Bosnian filmmaker Danis Tanovic, the film delivers a harsh judgement on the practises of MNCs in developing countries like Pakistan.
