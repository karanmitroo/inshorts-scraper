Actor Bobby Deol has said that critics are very confused as they'll praise a film throughout their article and then give it 1.5 stars. Bobby added, "Everybody has...freedom to speech and they can write or say what they want, so you can't feel bad about it." However, Bobby said he'll choose response of fans over opinions of critics any day.
