Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi has slammed singer-actor Suchitra Krishnamoorthi for her tweet wherein she described the morning Azaan played on loudspeakers as "extreme imposed religiosity". He said, "Those who...drink at 2 am in parties in hotels, and sit with their arms on shoulders of strange men and talk, who have spoilt Indian culture have suddenly started criticising [Azaan]."
