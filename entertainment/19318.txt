Policemen were deployed outside actor Amitabh Bachchan's Juhu bungalow on Saturday, fearing protests by Samajwadi Party (SP) workers, after the actor recently shared dais with MNS chief Raj Thackeray. Mumbai SP chief Abu Azmi had slammed the development between Thackeray and Bachchan, saying it was an "insult" to north Indians. Azmi had also asked the actor to clarify his stand.
