Singer Taher Shah, known for his songs 'Angel' and 'Eye to Eye', left Pakistan on Tuesday after receiving death threats. "It seems like haters are not admiring his approach of using arts to the benefit of mankind," his agent said. He added that Shah was left "heartbroken" as the government didn't provide him security and decided to leave the country.
