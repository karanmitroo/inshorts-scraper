Actor Channing Tatum has cancelled his directorial debut alongside Reid Carolin with The Weinstein Company amid the sexual harassment allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein. "The brave women who had the courage to stand up and speak their truth about Harvey are true heroes to us," wrote Tatum. The film was an adaptation of Matthew Quick's book 'Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock'.
