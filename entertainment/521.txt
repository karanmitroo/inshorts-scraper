Filmmaker Gauri Shinde, wife of 'Pad Man' director R Balki, has said she's proud the film on menstrual hygiene was handled by men. "Sometimes it's nice to take a backseat and watch men when they do something for women," she added. Gauri further said, "I love to take credit for whatever Balki does, but that's not the truth this time."
