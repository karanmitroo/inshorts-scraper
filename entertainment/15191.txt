Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan in the upcoming film, 'Udta Punjab', will be playing the role of a doctor. "Itâ€™s (the role) very simple and nice, good Samaritan kind of a thing. But the whole atmosphere of the film is so... dark that the role is very different," said  Kareena. The film scheduled for a June release explores Punjab's drug-related problems.
