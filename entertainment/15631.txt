Online portal 101India is launching a new web series 'Hip Hop Homeland' about India's underground Hip Hop culture on January 20. The 11-episode series features artists from across India singing in local languages about issues they care about. "India can absorb elements from other cultures and come up with a potent form of its own", the show's creator said.
