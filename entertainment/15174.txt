Actor Sanjay Dutt has been asked to become the brand ambassador for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and Smart City initiatives of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). The 56-year-old actor has reportedly shown interest in the deal where NDMC plans to use the star's image as "a leading youth icon." Notably, Dutt was recently released after completing his jail term.
