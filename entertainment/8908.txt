The 'He will not divide us' livestream, started by Hollywood actor Shia LaBeouf to protest against US President Donald Trump for four years, has been shut down in under a month. The webcam was called an "ongoing public safety hazard" by the hosting museum in New York. LaBeouf himself was arrested last month after a confrontation with a Trump supporter.
