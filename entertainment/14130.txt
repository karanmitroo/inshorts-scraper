A day after Censor Board banned Udta Punjab for excessive swearing, 'SHAME ON CENSOR BOARD' was trending on Twitter on Friday. A user reacted to it by tweeting, "Stalling the release of a social-film like UDTA PUNJAB just proves how backward CBFC in India is. Shame on Censor board". While another tweet read, "SHAME ON CENSOR BOARD for their mentality".
