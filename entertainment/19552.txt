Tigmanshu Dhulia is back with a bang with his latest 'Bullett Raja' starring Saif Ali Khan, Sonakshi Sinha, Gulshan Grover and others. Apparently a 'dabangg gunda', Saif is the eponymous Bullett Raja sporting guns and romancing Sonakshi on the Kolkata streets. The trailer screams out an action packed thriller and the film is slated to release on November 29, 2013.
