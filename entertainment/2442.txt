US President Donald Trump met Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen singer Pikotaro during his Japan tour on Monday. Pikotaro, whose song PPAP went viral in 2016, was reportedly chosen to perform for Trump as Japanese PM Shinzo Abe wanted to keep the mood upbeat. Pikotaro, who was wearing his leopard print outfit, said, "I have had a very valuable experience in my life today."
