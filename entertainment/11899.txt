Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that his 1998 film 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has a "very unusually silly theme" while revealing that he was 24 when he wrote the film. "When I see Kuch Kuch Hota Hai today... I myself wonder, 'Why did I write this'," said Johar. However, he added that the film did have "an organic innocence".
