Actor Aamir Khan's younger brother Faisal Khan is set to make a comeback with filmmaker Sharique Minhaj's tentatively titled film 'Mental'. "It is a new-age film; especially for the generation next who are madly obsessed with one-sided affair and who take wrong decisions," said Faisal. Notably, Sharique and Faisal have previously worked together in two films.
