An official from Hemraj Advertising has clarified that Raveena Tandon wasn't shooting for an advertisement in the 'no camera zone' inside the premises of Sri Lingaraja Temple, Odisha. "She was casually talking about Bhubaneswar's heat and saying that skin will look nice by using paste of some leaves. Other devotees were clicking pictures," he added.
