Speaking out in support of filmmakers who returned their National Awards, actor Rajkummar Rao has called their move "courageous". "It's a way of protest... I respect their decision,” he said. Further, Rao added, “Being from FTII, I can absolutely understand what the students are going through". Rao won a National Award in 2013 for his performance in 'Shahid'.
