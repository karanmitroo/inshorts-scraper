Composer Shamir Tandon, while defending the use of Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's voice in 'Welcome to New York', questioned why Rahat's songs 'Jag Ghoomeya' and 'Mere Rashke Qamar' weren't removed from the films featuring them. He added, "If as...an industry, we take a...stance against working with artistes from across the border, I'm happy to adhere to the same."
