Aamir Khan's film 'Dangal' was leaked online within a day of its theatrical release on Friday. It was reportedly available for download as well as for watching online on some websites which were eventually blocked. On Facebook, a user claiming to be a Dubai resident leaked the film, which received almost 45,000 shares before getting deleted due to copyright issues.
