Ousted Censor Board Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani on Monday launched trailer of the upcoming erotic thriller 'Julie 2' as the film's presenter and distributor. "Julie 2 should be given an 'A' certificate without any cuts. There is no vulgarity, obscenity or even a language problem," said Pahlaj. He further called the thriller a "good expose with a message for aspiring actors".
