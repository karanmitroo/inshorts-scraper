Filmmaker and stage director Feroz Abbas Khan has adapted the 1960 film 'Mughal-e-Azam', which starred Madhubala and Dilip Kumar and was directed by K Asif, into a live musical. Feroz said that no known faces had been cast as the play's format required actors who could sing and attend extended rehearsals. The musical will premiere in Mumbai on October 21.
