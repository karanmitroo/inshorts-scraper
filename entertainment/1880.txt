Rapper Jay Z has admitted to infidelity in his marriage with singer Beyonc√©. "You know, most people walk away...divorce rate is like 50 percent or something...The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone's face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself," said Jay Z. He added, "We were using our art almost like a therapy session."
