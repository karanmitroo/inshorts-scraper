Superstar Rajinikanth's much awaited 'Kochadaiiyaan' will not release on May-9, as originally scheduled. The film's release has now been postponed to May-23. The reason for the delay, the producers claimed, was "to cater to the demand for releasing multiple-language and 2D and 3D versions on the same day." However, there are speculation of other reasons for the delay.
