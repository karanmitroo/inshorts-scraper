Rapper Drake visited the Drake University in the United States on Wednesday, after its students launched the #BringDrakeToDrake social media campaign. The rapper arrived around 2:30 am, when most of the students were asleep. He posted a video saying, "Look Kappa Kappa Gamma, I’m outside your sorority house right now. And you’re all sleep…Kappa Alpha Theta...We waiting on you."
