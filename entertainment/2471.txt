Actress Kangana Ranaut will play Arunima Sinha, the world's first female amputee to climb Mount Everest, in an upcoming biopic. A source said, "The makers had to decide between Kriti Sanon and Kangana... But Arunima took the final call on the lead." The film will reportedly be shot in a straight 60-day schedule after Kangana finishes shooting for 'Manikarnika'.
