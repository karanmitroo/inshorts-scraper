A film is reportedly being planned by Warner Bros on 'Willy Wonka', a character from Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' series. The film will not be an original tale, but a standalone movie on Wonka and his early adventures. The film will be produced by Michael Siegel and David Heyman, who has previously produced the 'Harry Potter' films.
