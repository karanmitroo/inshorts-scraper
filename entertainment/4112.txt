The makers of the Saif Ali Khan starrer 'Kaalakaandi', which was scheduled to release on September 8, have decided to change the release date after the Central Board of Film Certification suggested some cuts. It has been reported that the film has been given 73 cuts. A new release date for the film is set to be announced shortly.
