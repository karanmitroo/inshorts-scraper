Musician Sting has said he will reopen Paris' Bataclan theatre on November 12, the eve of the first anniversary of the ISIS attack there that left 90 dead. The revenue will go towards charities working with the victims. Eagles of Death Metal, the band performing when the attack began, will reportedly attend the unveiling of a plaque on the anniversary.
