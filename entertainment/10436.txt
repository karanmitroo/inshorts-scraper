Threatening to launch a country-wide protest, Shia leaders have claimed that certain scenes in Shah Rukh Khan's upcoming movie 'Raees' have "hurt their religious beliefs". They demanded an apology and removal of the scenes from the actor. In the movie's trailer, Khan is shown jumping over a Muharram procession which is carrying the 'Alam-e-Mubarak', and that is being considered 'disrespectful'.
