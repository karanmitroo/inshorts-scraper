'Harry Potter' author JK Rowling, in a question and answer session on Twitter, said the film series 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is too big to fit in one movie. "Our story starts in 1926 and ends in 1945," Rowling revealed. The fantasy film series, starring Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp, will have four more films.
