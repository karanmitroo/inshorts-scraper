Reacting to All India Muslim Personal Law Board's (AIMPLB) statement that those who misuse triple talaq will face social boycott, lyricist Javed Akhtar questioned the meaning of "misuse of triple talaq". He further tweeted, "Tomorrow we may hear of misuse of molestation. Misuse of rape misuse of wife beating." Javed further called AIMPLB's decision a hoax.
