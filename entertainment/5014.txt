Comedian Sudesh Lehri gave examples of Dangal and Sultan, while speaking about comparisons between Krushna Abhishek's show 'The Drama Company' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. "People assumed...Dangal and Sultan would be the same as they revolve around wrestling but the content was so different." Sudesh, who'll feature in The Drama Company, added that comparison between the two shows is inevitable.
