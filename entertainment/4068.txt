Actor Chris Evans, known for playing superhero character 'Captain America', took a dig at US President Donald Trump for misspelling the word 'heal' as 'heel' while tweeting about a free speech rally in Boston. Trump's tweet was deleted and replaced with a tweet which had the proper spelling. Earlier, Chris said he feels "rage" on Trump being elected as President.
