Six women, including Hollywood actress Olivia Munn, have accused 'Rush Hour' director Brett Ratner of sexual harassment. Recalling an incident that took place in 2004, Munn said Ratner masturbated in front of her. Meanwhile, model-turned-actress Natasha Henstridge claimed Ratner forced himself on her when she was 19. However, Ratner has denied all the allegations through his attorney.
