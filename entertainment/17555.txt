Five residents of Bandra (Mumbai), who are die-hard Salman Khan fans, have opened a Salman-themed restaurant in Carter Road, called 'Bhaijaanz'. The restaurant, that pays tribute to Salman, has an entrance inspired by Khan's residence Galaxy Apartment. 'Bhaijaanz' offers food items called 'Andaaz Apna Apna' and 'Ek Garam Chai Ki Pyaali Ho'. Most food-items on the menu are Salman's favourite.
