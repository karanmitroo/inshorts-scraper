Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar has called actor Rajinikanth's gesture of returning money to distributors, after the failure of his film 'Baba' at the box-office, the biggest sign of a superstar. "Rajini sir is not a superstar, he is an entire galaxy. If anybody has got swag, be it (lighting) cigarette or putting on coat or anything, it's him," added Akshay.
