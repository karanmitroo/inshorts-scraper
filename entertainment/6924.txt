Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that the 'Chal Na Katrina' line in Baywatch's Hindi-dubbed trailer is her girl love homage to Katrina Kaif. In the English trailer, the dialogue is "Easy, Britney". Priyanka added, "This was my idea. Britney Spears is a huge star. I had to find a modern day icon...[and] Katrina is a major icon for Hindi cinema."
