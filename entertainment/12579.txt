Composer-singer Vishal Dadlani on Saturday apologised for his tweet mocking Jain monk Tarun Sagar for addressing Haryana Assembly in nude. Dadlani had shared the monk’s picture with a tweet “If you voted for these people, YOU are responsible for this absurd nonsense. No #AchcheDin, just #NoKachcheDin”. Later, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that Tarun Sagar Maharaj should not be disrespected.
