Kangana Ranaut, while speaking on Hrithik Roshan's interview about their row on a news channel, revealed she was initially called by the channel for the interview but she had refused it. She added, "This (journalist) who keeps asking everybody to apologise, hasn't asked him a single question, why is that?" Kangana further said such kind of "selective journalism" shouldn't exist.
