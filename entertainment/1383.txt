Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Tuesday tweeted that the first time his father, veteran poet late Harivansh Rai Bachchan, had an emotional breakdown in front of him was when he returned home after the 'Coolie' accident. Amitabh was hospitalised for several weeks and was in a coma-like state following the accident on Coolie's sets in 1982.
