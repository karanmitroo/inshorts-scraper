A case in which international pop star Shakira was accused of plagiarising a Dominican rapper's song "Loca" has been dismissed by a US judge. "Loca" was Shakira's hit Spanish-language single that topped the charts in 2010. The judge has said that the claimant lied and the cassette tape on which his claims were based were fake.
