Filmmaker S S Rajamouli’s epic historical fiction, 'Baahubali', is set to release in over 6,000 screens this May in China. The move will reportedly make 'Baahubali' one of the "biggest ever release for an Indian film in China" overtaking Aamir Khan’s ‘PK’, which was released in 5,000 screens. Currently, shooting for the film's second part is in progress.
