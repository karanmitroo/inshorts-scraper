A seven-year-old girl named Prarthana passed away after she tried to imitate a scene showing a girl dancing on fire in the Kannada television serial 'Nandini'. "We have lost our daughter but we want other parents to be cautious. Please do not make children sit along with you and watch serials," said Prarthana's mother.
