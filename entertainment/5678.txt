Pritam's team has claimed that the song 'Galti Se Mistake' from the film 'Jagga Jasoos' is not a copy of Mexican band 3BallMTY's song 'Intentalo'. In a statement, the team said that the song is based on Bihu folk melodies. The similarity might be due to some samples of a licensed Cumbia tribal library which've been used, added Pritam's team.
