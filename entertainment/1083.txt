Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap took to Twitter to warn his fans about a fake Facebook account in his name which asked aspiring actors to share their private pictures. He further wrote, "Don't fall into his trap...we have reported him." Last year, filmmaker Boney Kapoor's Twitter account had been hacked and the hacker had asked for â‚¹10,000 from one of his acquaintances.
