Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has said that he is proud of his daughter Alia Bhatt's films but added that she should "taste failure" as well. "She has evolved from a reasonably good talented beginner to an extraordinary actor in 'Udta Punjab'," Bhatt added. He further said he will be a supportive father if Alia gets the opportunity to do Hollywood films.
