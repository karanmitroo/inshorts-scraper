In a letter written to civic authorities, Poonam Mahajan, the BJP MP from Mumbai North Central, has requested the demolition of an illegal ramp outside a private bungalow, which residents say is a reference to Shah Rukh Khan's Mannat. According to several local residents' bodies, Shah Rukh's ramp constructed on Cement Road is an obstruction to others using that road.
