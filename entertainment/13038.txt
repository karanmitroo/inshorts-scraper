Coke Studio has started Coke Studio for the Deaf, an initiative in its Pakistani edition to enable the hearing-impaired people to experience music. Using a combination of lights and vibrations, the makers attempt to create a musical experience which the hearing-impaired community can enjoy. The initiative was in collaboration with the Deaf Reach program of the Family Education Services Foundation.
