Actress Priyanka Chopra in a recent interview questioned how someone's opinion on Twitter can become front page headline. Priyanka added, "Trolling and speculative movie announcements are two things that really need to get out of entertainment news." She further said, "I'm not someone who's into like 'yeh main kar rahi hoon. Yeh announcement karo'."
