Filmmaker Martin Scorsese has written that he was stunned when Margot Robbie slapped Leonardo DiCaprio and screamed 'F**k you!' at him during her audition for 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Scorsese wrote this in his tribute to Margot, who featured in Time's 100 Most Influential People list. Margot had improvised the scene to make herself stand out at the audition.
