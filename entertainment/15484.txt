Censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani on Sunday said that the ongoing controversy over the certification of the trailer of 'Aligarh' was a "cheap controversy". The film's director, Hansal Mehta, has criticised the board for giving Aligarh's trailer an A certificate. However, Nihalani defended it, saying that the topic of homosexuality is not for kids or teenagers to watch.
