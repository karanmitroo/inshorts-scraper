Actress Marilyn Monroe, whose death anniversary is marked on Friday, sang 'Happy Birthday' to wish the US President John F Kennedy at a celebration for his forty-fifth birthday on May 19, 1962. "I can now retire from politics after having had Happy Birthday sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way," said Kennedy. They both reportedly had an affair.
