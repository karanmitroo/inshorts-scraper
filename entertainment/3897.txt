Filmmaker Ashim Ahluwalia has said that Arjun Rampal is an under directed actor. "He has potential and I feel to actually maximise someone's potential you need to know what they can offer, you have to be able to push them," he added. Arjun will next be seen in the upcoming film 'Daddy', which has been directed by Ashim Ahluwalia.
