YouTube channel Kahanikaar has released its first video, which is a short film titled 'Seat No. 39'. The film is written by Navin Sharma and shot by Deepak Sharma and Ghanshyam Upadhyay. It has been described as a short romantic story that lasts for only a brief duration because of the alleged social stigma attached to such tales.
