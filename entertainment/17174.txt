Salman Khan has begun shooting the last leg of his upcoming film Bajrangi Bhaijaan in the Kashmir valley. The actor was sentenced to five years imprisonment by a sessions court in the 2002 hit-and-run case which was later suspended by the Bombay High Court. Director Kabir tweeted, “@BeingSalmanKhan is back in Kashmir... Last 5 days of shooting left for #BajrangiBhaijaan”.
