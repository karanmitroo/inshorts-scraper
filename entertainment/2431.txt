The film on Babri Masjid demolition titled 'Game of Ayodhya' will release on November 24. The film's director Sunil Singh said, "I (have) tried to tell...real story of the...demolition through the lens of a love story and how a journalist helps them." It was earlier banned by the Censor Board, but it was eventually cleared by Film Certification Appellate Tribunal.
