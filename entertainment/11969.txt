Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali's show in Bengaluru, organised by Radio Mirchi, has been cancelled. "We took this decision in the aftermath of Uri attacks... The concert was cancelled on September 20, much before the saffron parties raised the issue, demanding cancellation of the event," said Srinivas, Radio Mirchi Group Manager (Sales). The concert was originally scheduled for September 30.
