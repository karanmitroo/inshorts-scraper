Speaking about getting the maximum attention for his role of 'Alauddin Khilji' in 'Padmaavat', Ranveer Singh said, "I'm not into one-upmanship at all." "I have done a two-hero film, I have done an ensemble film. I'm not into all this at all," he added. Ranveer further said, "It's a very collaborative process. You are only as good as your co-actor."
