Actor Irrfan Khan has refuted the rumours that claimed he will be playing the title role in the Sarabjit Singh biopic. “I haven’t been approached to play Sarabjit at all. This news is definitely not true,” Irrfan said. The film that is being directed by Omung Kumar of 'Mary Kom' fame, will feature Aishwarya Rai as Sarabjit's sister.
