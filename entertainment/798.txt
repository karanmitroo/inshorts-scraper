Shahid Kapoor has said he is used to being the favourite of all his filmmakers but working on sets of 'Padmaavat' was the first time that he was like an outsider. He added this was because his co-stars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone had already worked with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Shahid said 'Padmaavat' made him feel like a newcomer.
