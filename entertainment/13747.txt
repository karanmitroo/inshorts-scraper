As per reports, the Jimmy Shergill-starrer political drama 'Shorgul' has been banned in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh as it is said to be on "sensitive issue(s)". Furthermore, the Censor Board reportedly asked for words like 'Godhra' to be muted in 'Shorgul'. However, Shorgul's producer Vyas Verma said, "We have repeatedly stated that 'Shorgul' is not a depiction of any specific incident."
