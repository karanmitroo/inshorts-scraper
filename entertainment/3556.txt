Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli has said that she will beat up actor Kamaal R Khan (KRK) as he said that instead of him, she should have chosen to abuse the person who threw acid on her face. Earlier, Rangoli had responded to KRK's tweets, where he had accused her and Kangana of lying and abusing Aditya Pancholi's wife Zarina Wahab.
