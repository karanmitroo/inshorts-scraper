Filmmaker Steven Spielberg has revealed that he was rejected twice by producer Albert 'Cubby' Broccoli, when he offered to direct 'James Bond' films. When 'Jaws' became a hit in 1976, "I called up Cubby and offered my services but he didn't think I was right for the part", Spielberg said. The second time, Cubby could not afford to hire Spielberg.
