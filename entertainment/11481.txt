Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo handed Scottish actor Gerard Butler his shoe, filled with Red Bull, on the US Grand Prix podium and asked him to drink. Ricciardo, who finished third in the race, is known to celebrate by drinking champagne from his shoe, a celebration called the 'shoey'. The actor was conducting interviews for the race's podium finishers.
