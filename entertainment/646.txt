Actress Disha Patani took to Twitter to slam a news channel for calling an old picture of her 'ugly'. "You are absolutely right! I should have worn a beautiful gown and done up my hair and makeup nicely before heading to my 7th standard class," she wrote. Disha added, "You couldn't get a better breaking news than that?"
