Kangana Ranaut has said that the film industry should not reject someone because they can't speak English or if they have sweat patches due to travelling in a rickshaw for an audition. Talking about people who come to Bollywood from unconventional backgrounds, Kangana added that people shouldn't be shamed for sharing an apartment with 10 people at an 'uncool' location.
