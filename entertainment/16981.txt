Andria D'Souza, the Dubai-based actress who has worked in 'Kamasutra 3D', will be seen playing the lead in Faisal Saif's 'For Adults Only'. "This will be my debut as a solo lead. It’s going to be a bold film, but... we’ll keep Indian sentiments intact in the story,” Andria said. The multi-lingual film may feature Kim Kardashian in a cameo.
