Actor-comedian Kevin Hart has issued an apology to his pregnant wife and children as a video, which claims to show him and a woman in a sexually provocative situation, is being investigated by the FBI. The investigation is owing to a multi-million dollar extortion attempt regarding the video. Kevin said someone was trying to seek financial gain over his "mistakes".
