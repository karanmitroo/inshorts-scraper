Actor Saif Ali Khan has said that he would have been a better actor in English as it is his primary language. He said that he became an actor as he was not interested in academics. He further said, "It's that nepotism thing again. Being mum's (actress Sharmila Tagore) son would give me more chances here (India)... than in America."
