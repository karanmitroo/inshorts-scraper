London West End’s Palace Theatre will open its new play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” on July 30, 2016, with its story starting where the closing book of the series “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” ended. The play is co-written by JK Rowling and centres on an older and overworked Harry and the youngest of his children, Albus.
