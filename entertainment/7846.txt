Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that he finds censorship pointless in the age of internet. He added, "What are you trying to block people from? You have to start treating your audiences as adult people who can think for themselves." Significantly, films directed by Kashyap like 'Gulaal' (2009), and 'Bombay Velvet' (2015) have faced issues with the Censor Board.
