The Khan Market Traders' Association of Delhi is planning legal action against Salman Khan over his recently launched online portal, 'khanmarketonline'. Association president Sanjiv Mehra said, "Salman is neither part of the market, nor has he approached anyone here. He cannot use the name". He added that before taking a legal action, he would request Salman to change the name.
