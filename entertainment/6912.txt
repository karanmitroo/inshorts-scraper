Actor Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in four films, revealed he was frustrated with the films at one point. He added, "I wanted Bond to get a little more gritty, real...and dirty...but the scripts would come along with the same outlandish scenarios." Brosnan played Bond in 'GoldenEye', 'Tomorrow Never Dies', 'The World Is Not Enough' and 'Die Another Day'.
