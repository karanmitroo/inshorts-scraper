Actor Irrfan Khan has said that at some point, he wants to be free from the need for fame and reach a point when he "needn't care about anything else other than the story." "No, I'm not away from that need right now. I do need acknowledgment... (but) I'd want to be free from this need," the 49-year-old actor added.
