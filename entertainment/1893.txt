Karan Johar has apologised for objectifying women in item songs like 'Chikni Chameli' featured in films produced by him. "The moment you put a woman in the centre and a thousand men looking at her lustingly, it's setting the wrong example," said Johar. He added, "As a filmmaker, I have made those mistakes and I will never do it again."
