Reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who recently posed nude for Paper magazine, Tuesday said she did it for herself. “I’m not saying anyone else should do that, but for me, I did it as an art project that was going to make me feel confident and good. And it taught me to do what you want to do,” she added.
