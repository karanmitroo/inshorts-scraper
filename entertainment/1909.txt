While talking about being body-shamed, actress Vidya Balan said the word 'moti' is not an expletive for her. "But I don't like when people comment on my body. Because if I talk about your brain... Brains don't sell, that's why we don't talk about it," she added. Vidya further said, "We have no right to comment on anyone's appearance."
