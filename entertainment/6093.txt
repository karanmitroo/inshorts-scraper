Actor Amitabh Bachchan, when asked questions on the row over Priyanka Chopra wearing a dress while meeting PM Modi, said, "I am neither PM, nor Priyanka Chopra. How can I answer them?" Earlier, users on social media had slammed Priyanka for "exposing her legs" and sitting cross-legged when meeting PM Modi in Berlin.
