Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he would "love to act on television again" as some stories cannot be told in two hours but require ten hours. He added, "I hope we can get into the zone of one-hour shows, short series... like the American TV industry."  Notably, SRK made his onscreen debut with the 1989 TV series, 'Fauji'.
