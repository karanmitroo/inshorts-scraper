In the video, US President Barack Obama can be seen dancing to Drake's song 'Hotline Bling' at a musical event in the White House, featuring musicians like Usher. In the speech before the event, Obama jokingly said "There will be no twerking tonight. At least not by me". Notably, this was the last musical event hosted by Obama as President.
