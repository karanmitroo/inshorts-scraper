Actress Deepika Padukone, daughter of former badminton ace Prakash Padukone, has said that her mother is the "real hero" of her family. "...it's my mother who inspires me the most. She is the backbone of our family. My father is a celebrity and my sister started her golf career, but my mother was never in the spotlight," Deepika said.
