Sunny Leone starrer 'Ek Paheli Leela' which hit the screens Friday is painfully pointless, says NDTV. The weakest part of the film, also featuring Jay Bhanushali and Rahul Dev, is 'acting', writes India Today. The Bobby Khan directorial, based on a 'punar-janam' or rebirth phenomenon, has been rated 1.5/5 (India Today), 0/5 (Indian Express), 1/5 (NDTV) and 3.5/5 (Zee News).
