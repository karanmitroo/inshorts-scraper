The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a stay on criminal proceedings against Malayalam actress Priya Prakash Varrier and Omar Lulu, the director of 'Oru Adaar Love'. It also said an FIR can't be lodged in any state against them. The Hyderabad police had earlier registered an FIR based on a complaint that a song from the film hurts religious sentiments.
