Actor Aamir Khan has said that it is not fair when only the three names of Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and his are taken while talking about stars. "There are several talented stars in our film industry, who are extremely popular. Akshay's film 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha' is doing good and people are liking it," added Aamir.
