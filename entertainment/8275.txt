A video shows film critic Anupama Chopra interviewing actors Prabhas, Sathyaraj and filmmaker SS Rajamouli on the sets of 'Baahubali: The Conclusion'. "Rajamouli's passion for the film kept us going... Without him, none of us would have been here," said Prabhas. Further, Sathyaraj, on being asked why his character 'Katappa' killed 'Baahubali', answered, "Because my director told me to".
