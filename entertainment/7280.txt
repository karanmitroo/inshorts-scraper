Journalist Barkha Dutt, while responding to Censor Board's decision to edit out 'Dutt' from her name in the film 'Noor', tweeted, "Barkha without the Dutt dear Censor Board is kinda like poori minus channa". "I am a public person after all... Rather whimsical I think to now make my name a subject of censorship!" she added.
