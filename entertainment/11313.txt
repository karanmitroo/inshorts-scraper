Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has said that she can't help but "giggle" at the "pretentiousness" of public life. "I find so many aspects of public life ridiculous," the 43-year-old actress added. Commenting on giggling on chat shows, she said, "I am laughing along... because honestly, it's ridiculous to answer them (questions) with a straight face... I'm only keeping it real."
