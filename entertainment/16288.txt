NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured images of the sites that featured in the novel-based Hollywood movie "The Martian". The movie used actual locations as the landing sites in its fictional "Ares 3" and "Ares 4" missions. The orbiter has taken more than 39,000 images since it reached Mars in 2006 and they are available to view online.
