Taapsee Pannu opted out of an event she was supposed to be a part of after she learnt that it was being organised by a fairness cream. "[W]hen I got to know... I will have to pose with the fairness brand... I decided to take my name out," she said. Taapsee further said she'll not propagate fairness in any way.
