Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o has revealed producer Harvey Weinstein offered to give her a massage while his children were at home. "I panicked...and thought...to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically," added Lupita. She further said Weinstein wanted to take off his pants, to which she protested and later left his house.
