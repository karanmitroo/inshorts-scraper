Actress Alia Bhatt has said that her upcoming romantic-comedy 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' is not a sequel of the 2014 film 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania'. "It’s a franchise. It’s a different story, it has another person and dulhania with a common thread," said Alia. The actress will once again work with actor Varun Dhawan and director Shashank Khaitan for the film.
