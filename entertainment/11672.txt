The Home Ministry on Friday stated the government has no plans to withdraw the visas granted to the Pakistani artistes. “We cannot arbitrarily withdraw visas granted to Pakistani actors unless they have violated rules or broken the law,” a Home Ministry official reportedly said. The Indian Motion Picture Producers Association had recently passed a resolution banning Pakistani actors in India.
