Muhammed Azeem, the father of Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch, has said that he misses his daughter and the way she spoke. Baloch, known for her videos on social media, was strangled to death by her brother in July, in a bid to save the familyâ€™s "honour". Notably, over 1,100 women in Pakistan become victims of honour killing every year.
