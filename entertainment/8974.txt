Actor Govinda has said that filmmaker David Dhawan is the jealous kind and if someone's film is working well, he doesn't like it. Speaking on why he didn't work with Dhawan after 2007 film 'Partner', he said, "I think the pressure of me being a part of politics was coming on him, so he just went away."
