Actress Deepika Padukone recently said she shares "a very special equation" with ex-boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor. "Something that one can’t explain and describe in too many words,” Deepika said. Deepika and Ranbir, who dated for a year, were last seen together in 'Yeh Jawani hai Deewani' and will share the screen again in Imtiaz Ali's upcoming film 'Tamasha'.
