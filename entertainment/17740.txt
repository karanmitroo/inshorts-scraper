After 'Raanjhanaa' and 'Shamitabh', Dhanush has signed his third Hindi film, with Raanjhanaa director Anand Rai. "It is an intense love story, the kind I havenâ€™t done so far," Dhanush revealed. "When I heard the script, I felt this would take Aanand Rai Sir and me beyond what we did in Raanjhanaa. We will start it... in December", he added.
