Singer-music composer Ankit Tiwari has said that people like singers as long as they sing playback for major stars or till the time the singers' songs are featured in films. He added, "Singing for someone else means... singers aur musicians ki apni koi pehchaan nahi hoti." Ankit further said that he is searching for his identity through his independent singles.
