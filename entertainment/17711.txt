After an FIR was registered against 14 people involved in the AIB Roast, including Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt, Mahesh Bhatt has questioned why Sonakshi Sinha's name was excluded. "Sonakshi Sinha, the daughter of person who is part of the present dispensation was also in the audience, why was she not named in the FIR?", Bhatt said.
