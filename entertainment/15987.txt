As a promotion tactic for ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’, a new virtual reality (VR) feature called ‘Jakku Spy’ has been added to the official Star Wars app. Users can experience a nine-episode series in 360° that unlocks periodically until the movie releases on December 18. Any VR device including Google Cardboard can be used to view the immersive story.
