Priyanka Chopra took a dig at her own Met Gala outfit, which was believed to be the world's longest trench coat. The gown, designed by Ralph Lauren, featured a 20-foot-long train which Priyanka removed for the after-party. She shared the before and after picture on Instagram with the caption, "Ingenious design by @RalphLauren... #SpotTheDifference #wardrobeHacks #TheCaseOfTheMissingTrain."
