Parineeti Chopra, while speaking on Pakistani actress Mahira Khan being slut-shamed for wearing a dress and smoking with actor Ranbir Kapoor, said it is unfair. "Everybody knows it is unfair, and it will stop," she added. Parineeti further said that in today's time, everything becomes too big a deal because of social media.
