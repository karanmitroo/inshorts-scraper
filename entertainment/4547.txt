Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he would have never made 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' if actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan would have declined the role of 'Saba' in the film. "I was pretty sure Aishwarya would make for an indispensable fit for this role," he added. The film also starred Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in lead roles.
