'Avatar' director James Cameron has said that he didn't find anything "groundbreaking" in the Gal Gadot starrer superhero film 'Wonder Woman'. Cameron added, "She (Gadot) was Miss Israel, and she was wearing a kind of bustier costume that was very form-fitting...To me, that's not breaking ground." Cameron had earlier referred to the character 'Wonder Woman' as "an objectified icon".
