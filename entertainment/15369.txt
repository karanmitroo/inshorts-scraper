The Aditya Roy Kapur and Katrina Kaif starrer film 'Fitoor', which released on Friday, is a "superficial affair and a disappointing adaptation of Charles Dickensâ€™ Great Expectations", wrote Hindustan Times. The film is "laudable in parts" and "gets the best out of Tabu and Aditya", India Today wrote. It has been rated 2/5 (HT), 3/5 (India Today) and 3.5/5 (NDTV).
