National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has restored 13 Tamil cinema classics and has made 35 mm prints of each “masterwork”. The preserved films include pioneer director A. Muthuswami Iyer’s "Nandanar" (1942), Arabian Nights-based "Gulebakavali" (1955) and the Tamil version of Zorro "Malaikkallan" (1954). Most of these films are from houses like AVM Productions, Gemini Studios and Modern Theatre.
