In an appeal to PM Narendra Modi, actor Aamir Khan on Saturday said that India is “very tolerant” but people who spread hatred must be stopped. "Our Prime Minister has also expressed concern. His slogan is ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas'," added Amir. He clarified his earlier statement on intolerance saying, “I never said India was intolerant, I was wrongly quoted."
