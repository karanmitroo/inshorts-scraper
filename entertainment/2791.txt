Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali has said putting artificiality in a film and trying to make it spicy for that moment results in the film being redundant. "Keeping it pure is essential in order for it to be remembered," he added. Imtiaz further said, "When making a movie, you try to do your best...you try to make it as natural and fun."
