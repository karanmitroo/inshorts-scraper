Actor Ralph Fiennes has said he feels "possessive" about his character 'Voldemort' and  would find it hard to turn down a return to the part if the opportunity comes along. "I would feel... protective. I would not like to let that go," he added. He, however, admitted that playing darker characters takes an actor to "weird places" in the head.
