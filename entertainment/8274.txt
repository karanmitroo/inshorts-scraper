Actress Alia Bhatt has described her character 'Vaidehi Trivedi' in the upcoming film 'Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya' as more of a feminist. "Vaidehi wants to fly, as she doesn't want to only get married. She is a strong, mature, ambition driven... kind of character," said Alia. The film is the second film in the 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania' franchise.
