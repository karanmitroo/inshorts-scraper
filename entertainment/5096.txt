Actor Salman Khan has said that the only date he remembers is actress Katrina Kaif's birthday despite being bad at remembering dates. Salman joked, "It's a national event. In India, July 16 is a holiday, who knows USA might also announce it as a national holiday soon." He made the comments at an IIFA Awards 2017 event in New York.
