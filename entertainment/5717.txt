John Avildsen, the Oscar-winning director of 1976 boxing saga Rocky and 1984 karate drama The Karate Kid, passed away on Friday aged 81 at a hospital in United States' Los Angeles. Avildsen had been suffering from pancreatic cancer, his son said. Interestingly, Rocky was made for $1 million but generated $225 million in ticket sales.
