Priyanka Chopra's American television series 'Quantico' is being pulled off its Sunday night prime time slot, reportedly owing to low TRP and viewership of the show. The show, which has already aired its mid-season finale, will air on Monday night at 10 PM from January 23 onwards. The show's writers tweeted that the show will be "more intense than ever".
