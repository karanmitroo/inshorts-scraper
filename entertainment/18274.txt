The Supreme Court has opposed the 59-year-old union ban on female make-up artists in the country's film industry, saying that the ban is illegal and must be lifted. This comes after nine women had petitioned in January 2013. "We don't see a reason to prohibit a woman from becoming a make-up artist if she is qualified," the court added.
