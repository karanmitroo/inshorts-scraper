Veteran actor Randhir Kapoor(66) said that that Indian cinema have improved technically, but degraded content-wise. Change in social-life may be a reason for it, he speculated. He was in Delhi to promote Prabhudeva's Ramaiya Vastavaiya along with the film's cast.  The film, starring Girish Kumar and Shruti Haasan, is the remake of Prabhudeva's directorial debut Telugu blockbuster 'Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana'.
