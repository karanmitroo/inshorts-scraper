Actor Naseeruddin Shah has said that his struggle in the film industry "was not as long or hard" as that of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Irrfan Khan. "Now they are getting success but it took a lot of time. They both struggled a lot," he added. Shah added that commercial filmmakers should not make biopics as they end up "ruining" them.
