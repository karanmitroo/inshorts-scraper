Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi has claimed that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim financed the Bollywood film 'Padmavati'. He added, "With what authority does Deepika Padukone challenge us today saying that the film will be released?" Earlier on Sunday, the film's producers announced that Padmavati's release was being postponed from its original release date of December 1.
