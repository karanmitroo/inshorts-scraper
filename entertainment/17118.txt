Producer Valeria Richter, who has part of her left foot amputated, has claimed that she was stopped at the Cannes Film Festival for not wearing heels. "They pointed their finger at my shoe and were waving their fingers at me," Richter, who was eventually let in, said. However, the festival said heels aren't a part of the official dress code.
