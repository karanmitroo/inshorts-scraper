A day after Rakhi Sawant was granted bail, a Ludhiana court on Friday cancelled it and issued fresh warrants against her in Valmiki 'objectionable' remark case. The bail was dismissed as Rakhi didn't appear in court for the hearing and didn't submit a bail bond from a local resident. She has been directed to appear in court on August 7.
