According to reports, the spa in Versove (Mumbai), raided by the police earlier this month for fronting a flesh trade racket, belongs to actor Priyanka Chopra. She had apparently given-out the property on rent to the spa owners. Priyanka's mother Madhu and her brother Siddharth were also present at the spa launch. Madhuâ€™s clinic is situated next to the place.
