Singer Sonu Nigam has criticised Jet Airways' act of suspending its crew members, for allowing him to perform impromptu on the aircraft's address system, as "real intolerance". "I have witnessed an elaborate fashion show in an aircraft. I have heard of small concerts happening in an aircraft," added Nigam while criticising the airlines for punishing someone for 'spreading happiness'.
