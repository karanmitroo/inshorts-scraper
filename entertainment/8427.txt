American rap artist Meek Mill shared a video on his Instagram stories where he is seen asking a homeless man to do ten pushups for $20 (around â‚¹1300). Meek tells the man, "We ain't giving out no free money. Go ahead." Slamming this act, a Twitter user wrote, "Shame on you for degrading a homeless person."
