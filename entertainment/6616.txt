A life-size statue of actor Amitabh Bachchan was installed at a Kolkata temple by the All Bengal Amitabh Bachchan Fans Association (ABFA). The statue is similar to Amitabh's character Subhash Nagre from the 'Sarkar' film franchise. The 25-kilogram statue, which took three months to create, is slightly taller than Bachchan to make it visually appealing, said ABFA state secretary.
