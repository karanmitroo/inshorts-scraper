Actor Dharmendra has said that Amitabh Bachchan acknowledges now that he was recommended by Dharmendra for the 1975 film 'Sholay'. "If he is saying that from where he is now, from such a dizzying height, people will talk about his greatness. He never said earlier that I had recommended him," Dharmendra added.
