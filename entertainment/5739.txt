According to reports, the CBFC has asked the makers of the film 'Tubelight' to remove the expletive 'h***mz*da' in the film. "Normally we would have let it remain. But there is such a charming innocence about Tubelight we felt that word jars the film's sensibilities," said a source. The film has reportedly been passed with a 'U' certificate.
