According to reports, Salman Khan has agreed to star in 'Race 3' on the condition that actor-choreographer Remo D'souza directs the film. Meanwhile, Salman and Remo's upcoming film 'Dancing Dad' is said to have been shelved as the actor felt the role did not suit his age. This would make 'Race 3' their first project together as director and actor.
