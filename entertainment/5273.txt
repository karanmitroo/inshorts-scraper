Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has said that people are threatening him on social media, saying they'll blacken his face over his film 'Indu Sarkar'. He added, "My film is 70% fiction and only 30% is based on real events and that's scaring them." Madhur's Indu Sarkar, which is based on the Emergency, is scheduled to release on July 28.
