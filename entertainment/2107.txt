Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he believes women are superior to men, while adding that he's not ashamed of the fact that he is a little shy and scared of women. He further said, "Women bring...a calm energy to the universe....So, any form of violence happening to any woman is the (most) horrible thing (that) can happen."
