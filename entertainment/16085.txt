Mohini Karkarey, who claims to be a descendant of Peshwa Bajirao I, has written an open letter to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, highlighting errors in the script of his upcoming film 'Bajirao Mastani'. Karkarey wrote that the song 'Pinga' has "a lot of undesirable elements". She added that "Mastani was not a courtesan or dancer", but the daughter of a king.
