Actress Sunny Leone, while talking about the row that emerged over Priyanka Chopra wearing a dress when meeting PM Narendra Modi, said, "Let's judge her based on her actions and not her clothes." Leone added, "If he (Modi) had a problem with it he would've said something. But he didn't and I don't think anybody has the right to troll."
