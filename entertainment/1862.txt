Filmmaker Shekhar Kapur said that he used to say Indian films will be very popular in China and the 2016 film 'Dangal' proved his point. He is working on an upcoming biopic on Bruce Lee, which will be an official co-production for US and China. Shekhar, who will co-write and direct the biopic, said, "We are working on the script."
