Late actor Vinod Khanna's son Rahul Khanna shared a picture of himself with his father on Twitter. In the black and white photo, Vinod is seen swinging Rahul and his brother Akshaye at a beach. "Feels like yesterday," read the caption alongside the picture. This is Rahul's first Twitter post after his father's death last week.
