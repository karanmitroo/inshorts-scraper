Actor Rishi Kapoor tweeted about the rescue efforts of firefighters, police and medical professionals during the Grenfell Tower fire in London and called them the real heroes, not him. He further wrote that singing songs, romancing or fighting in films is no heroism. "The Real Heroes. "9/11" Firefighters entered Twin Towers knowing eminent death," he further tweeted.
