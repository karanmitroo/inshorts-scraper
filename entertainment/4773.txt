Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while responding to reports about him being asked to quit as the Board's chairperson, said he has not heard any such plans from the government. "I leave the decision entirely to the government. If now I am asked to leave, I'd do so... swiftly, wishing my successor all the best," he added.
