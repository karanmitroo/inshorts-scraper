Actress Priyanka Chopra, while speaking about what it takes to woo her, said, "I like to be given attention, not like creeper-worthy attention... But I like to be pursued." "If [the man] is not cerebral, if he's not smart and cannot engage me, then it cannot happen," she added. Priyanka further said she is "mushy" and loves romance.
