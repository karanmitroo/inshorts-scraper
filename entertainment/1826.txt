An aid watchdog has called charity appeals by Oscar-winning British actor Eddie Redmayne as "poverty porn" for reinforcing white saviour stereotypes. A clip released by UK's Disasters Emergency Committee shows Redmayne appealing to people to donate to those in need in Africa. The watchdog also slammed singer Ed Sheeran and actor Tom Hardy for making similar appeals.
