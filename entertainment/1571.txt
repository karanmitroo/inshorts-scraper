Prernaa Arora, who is co-producing the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Pad Man', has said that she is not a feminist and finds men superior to women. "I respect every man, get inspired by them, and they're my role models...I'm not into that 'auratein mahaan hoti hain'. Sab mahaan hote honge, but I'm someone who believes in a man's world," she added.
