Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he is quitting his role as host of reality show "The Celebrity Apprentice," blaming US President Donald Trump's ongoing role as executive producer for low ratings. Schwarzenegger took over as host last year replacing Trump. Schwarzenegger's first season, which premiered in January, has been watched by around 50 lakh viewers.
