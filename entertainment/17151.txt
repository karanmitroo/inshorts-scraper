Australia's farm minister has given actor Johnny Depp a notice of two days to get his pet dogs back to the United States or get them quarantined if he doesn't want them euthanised. Depp is shooting for the fifth movie in the Pirate series in Australia and flew his Yorkshire terriers on his private jet without declaring them to customs.
