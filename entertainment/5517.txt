Actor Anil Kapoor, while talking about how his son Harshvardhan is still naive, said, "For example, he'll say no to very big filmmakers... I wish he'd at least spoken to me before." Anil further added that he hopes the filmmakers understand that Harsh really wants to work with them and means well, but he's not ready to do those films.
