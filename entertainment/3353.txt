Rajput organisation Karni Sena, while responding to a promotional tweet for 'Padmavati', warned its makers over the Rajput queen's portrayal. Its members had earlier vandalised the film's sets and slapped director Sanjay Leela Bhansali as they weren't happy with "distortion of facts" in the film. It was reported that the film features romantic scenes between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji.
