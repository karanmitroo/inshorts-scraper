Singer Adnan Sami has slammed those who claim to be staunch Muslims on Twitter, but are seen stalking the Twitter timelines of female users during the holy month of Ramzan. He further went on to call such people 'tharkee', which roughly translates to lustful. Responding to Adnan's tweet, a user wrote that 'kattar Muslims' should not be using social media.
