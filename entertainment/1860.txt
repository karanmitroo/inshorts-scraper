Kate Winslet re-enacted the ending of her 1997 film 'Titanic' with American talk show host Stephen Colbert portraying Leonardo DiCaprio's character 'Jack', where she ended the scene by saying, "There's room for two!" This was in reference to fans speculating how Jack could have survived by sharing space on the wooden plank with Kate's character Rose after the ship sank.
