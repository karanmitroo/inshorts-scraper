Actress Jennifer Lawrence has apologised for her 'butt-scratching' on sacred Hawaiian rocks, while saying, "I meant absolutely no disrespect to the Hawaiian people." Earlier, while narrating the incident, Lawrence had jokingly said, "One rock that I was butt-scratching on ended up coming loose... It... almost killed our sound guy. [A]ll the Hawaiians were like 'Oh my god, it's the curse.'"
