Singer Diljit Dosanjh said that just because he never drinks alcohol doesn't mean he can't sing about it. He added, "I acted in 'Udta Punjab' which was based on drugs [and alcohol], even though I never drink." Diljit further said that awareness can be spread through entertainment, and people have to choose what they wish to take away from it.
