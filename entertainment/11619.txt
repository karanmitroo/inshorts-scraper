Reacting to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s statement on surgical strike carried out by Indian Army in PoK, actor Kamaal R Khan has said, “It’s clear that it’s a political strike not surgical”. In a video message, Khan said that if Pakistan is denying it, why is the government constantly claiming the attack and welcoming the neighbour to launch a counter-attack.
