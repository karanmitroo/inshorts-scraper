British actress Lysette Anthony has told police that producer Harvey Weinstein raped her in the 1980s. Lysette said Weinstein began stalking her after meeting her and turned up unannounced at her house. "He pushed me inside and rammed me against the coat rack. He was trying to kiss me... Finally, I just gave up," she added while recalling the ordeal.
