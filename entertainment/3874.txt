Emraan Hashmi has said along with actresses, he was also objectified in film series like 'Murder' and 'Raaz'. Speaking about the serial-kisser tag these films got him, he added, "I've kissed those franchises goodbye, but I thank those films for helping me get this far." He further said women have always been central to the plot in all his films.
