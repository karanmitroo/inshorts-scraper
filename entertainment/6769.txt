As per reports, model Kendall Jenner was paid ₹1 crore by the organisers of Fyre Festival for a single post on Instagram, which has since been deleted. Other "influencers" who advertised the festival were paid nearly ₹12 lakh for a post, reports added. Notably, the festival was cancelled due to lack of food, tents and toilets on the festival grounds.
