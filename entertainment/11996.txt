Lata Mangeshkar, who turned 87 on Wednesday, was included in Guinness World Records in 1974 for singing the most number of songs, estimated at 25,000. The entry was challenged by Mohammad Rafi, claiming he sang over 28,000 songs. Guinness included Rafi's claim as a special mention along Lata Mangeshkar's entry, but both were ultimately removed from the book in 1991.
