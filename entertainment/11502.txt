A member of the academy that awards the Nobel literature prize has described this year's laureate, Bob Dylan as arrogant, citing his total silence since the award was announced last week. "It's impolite and arrogant," said the member. Dylan has not responded to repeated phone calls from the Swedish Academy, nor reacted in any way in public to the news.
