Filmmaker Karan Johar has said men should be unapologetic about wearing jewellery, while adding, "If you think to wear a chain, a bracelet or a ring suits you...one should go for it." Karan further said if he launches a men's collection, Ranveer Singh would be his brand ambassador, while adding, "You know...he walks the talk when it comes to fashion."
