Despite not being taken too well by the critics, Ranbir Kapoor-starrer 'Roy' managed to collect Rs 10.40 crore on its opening day. A pre-Valentine's Day release and a good cast helped the film perform well despite having a boring and confusing storyline. The movie registered 50% occupancy in theatres. Meanwhile, 'MSG: The Messenger' gave a dull performance.
