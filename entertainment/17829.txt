Legendary British author Salman Rushdie's first new novel in 7 years will be released in September, publishers said. The title, "Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights", is a reference to the Arabian Nights. "It's not long. It will be something like 250 pages, which is like clearing my throat. I have finally learned how to shut up," Rushdie said.
