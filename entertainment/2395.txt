Filmmaker Subhash Ghai has revealed that Shah Rukh Khan had turned down a film with Amitabh Bachchan and Dilip Kumar in 2003. Ghai added, "He wanted to do a solo hero film then, but mine was not." "The script was ready and three songs were also recorded, but at the last minute Shah Rukh backed out," he further said.
