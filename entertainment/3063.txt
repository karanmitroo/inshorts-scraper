'Baahubali' actor Prabhas, while speaking about rumours of dating his co-star Anushka Shetty, said, "I admit sometimes when such stories start doing the rounds, then I too start wondering if there is, indeed, something between us." "When an actress works with an actor in more than one film, then people tend to make them a pair," he added.
