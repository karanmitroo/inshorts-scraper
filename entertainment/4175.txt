Filmmaker Omung Kumar, while responding to rumours of Kareena Kapoor Khan rejecting his film, said, "Which biopic, what script... I have no idea." A source had said, "Kareena had issues with the script and she told Omung very politely that she won't be doing the biopic." Omung has earlier directed the 2014 sports drama 'Mary Kom', which is a biopic.
