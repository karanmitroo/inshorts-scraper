Nawazuddin Siddiqui, while speaking about portraying Indo-Pakistani author Saadat Hasan Manto in the upcoming biopic on him, said he had to "purify himself" to play Manto. "Manto had always been true and wrote what he saw around him," he added. Nawazuddin further said, "The greatest challenge for me was that I'm not like him. I tell a lot of lies."
