Actor Ed Skrein has quit the upcoming 'Hellboy' reboot over the whitewashing row on his casting for the character 'Major Ben Daimio', which features as an Asian in the comics. Whitewash is a practice in which white actors are cast in non-white character roles. Skrein wrote in a statement that he was unaware that the character was of Asian heritage.
