Sidharth Malhotra, when asked about being pitted against Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt with whom he made his acting debut, responded by asking why he would care about Varun and Alia's careers. "I have too much on my plate to worry about anyway," he added. Sidharth further said what matters is competing with one's last performance, and not with others.
