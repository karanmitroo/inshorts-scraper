Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt has said that he doesn't think actors John Abraham and Bipasha Basu credit him for their careers though he doesn't think he did a favour to them. Vikram added, "I needed talented actors for my films, and I saw potential in them. They, in turn, needed a platform. I didn't do them a favour by casting them."
