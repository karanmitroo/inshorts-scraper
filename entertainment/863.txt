A group of people protesting against the release of film 'Padmaavat' vandalised a mall and nearby shops in Ahmedabad's Memnagar. They also set fire to several vehicles in the area. Pointing out that they had put up boards announcing that 'Padmaavat' will not be screened, officials managing the mall said protestors continued the violence ignoring the clarification.
