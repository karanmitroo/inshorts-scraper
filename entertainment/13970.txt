Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap on Tuesday asked Congress, AAP and other political parties to keep away from the controversy with the Censor Board over cuts and title change reportedly demanded in the film 'Udta Punjab'. "Don't colour my fight with any political affiliation," added Kashyap. Earlier, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said "I completely agree" while re-tweeting Kashyap's tweet slamming censorship.
