Actor Varun Dhawan has said that actors should stop behaving like it's only their film while adding that putting all the pressure on the actor is also wrong. "The actor should also stop behaving like 'main karta hoon, main kar lunga, meri picture hai'," added Varun. He further said, "I feel we give less credit to our directors."
