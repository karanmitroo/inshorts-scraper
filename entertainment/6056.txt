The creator of Ramayan serial Ramanand Sagar's great granddaughter Sakshi Chopra went topless to slam trolls who criticised her pictures. Alongside the picture, Sakshi wrote, "You can call me cheap, all kinds of names. I don't give a f**k. I am happy. I do what makes me happy." Sakshi, who attended the Trinity University in London, makes YouTube videos.
