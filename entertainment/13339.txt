Actor Irrfan Khan has said that a person's "work speaks more" than being in the news or creating news does. "I think media plays a vital role in shaping your perception, (in) both positive and negative ways," said Irrfan. Meanwhile, speaking about competition in the film industry, the 49-year-old actor said, "I don’t believe in the concept of replacing people.”
