Actor and BJP MP Paresh Rawal tweeted that author Arundhati Roy should be tied to an Army jeep instead of stone pelter. Arundhati Roy, who won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997, is known for highlighting human rights issues. Notably, last month a Kashmiri man was tied to a jeep as a shield against stone pelting.
