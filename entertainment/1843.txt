Production for the final season of Netflix series 'House of Cards' will resume next year with actress Robin Wright as the new lead. The release date for the new season, which will have eight episodes, hasn't been announced yet. In November, Netflix had suspended the show and fired the previous lead actor Kevin Spacey following sexual harassment allegations against him.
