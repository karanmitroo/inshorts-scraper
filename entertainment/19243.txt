Former "Baywatch" actress Pamela Anderson has married her ex-husband, producer Rick Salomon. The 46-year-old confirmed the marriage on Saturday and said, "We're very happy. Our families are very happy and that's all that matters". Anderson and Salomon were previously married in Oct 2007, but she had filed for divorce just two months later.
