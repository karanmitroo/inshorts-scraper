Actress Shabana Azmi has said that filmmakers should decide if they want to cut scenes in their film and not any board. She added that the Censor Board should only certify films and not censor scenes. "However much you say CBFCâ€‰is an autonomous body...people taken on the board...have some kind of affinity with the ruling party," added Shabana.
