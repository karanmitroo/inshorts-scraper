Irish actor Liam Cunningham, known for playing the character 'Davos Seaworth' in the HBO series 'Game of Thrones', said the character Arya Stark is not a role model for girls but is a serial killer. "A lot of young ladies are using her as a role model...in five, ten years time, let's not examine where that might go," added Liam.
