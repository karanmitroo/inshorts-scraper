The Indian Jam Project, a fusion platform, has created an Indian rendition of UK-based music band Coldplay’s popular song ‘Fix You’. The version features classical Indian instruments like sitar and sarangi. Tushar Lall, the founder of the platform, said it took over three weeks to complete the tribute video. Notably, Coldplay is rumoured to be performing in India this November.
