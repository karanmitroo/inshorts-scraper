Twitter users have slammed Taylor Swift for her new video 'Look What You Made Me Do' as they felt a portion of the video recreated the scene of Kim Kardashian's robbery in Paris. "There's so many things you can be "shady" about, but a robbery at gun point isn't," tweeted a user. Another tweet called Swift "a disgusting human being".
