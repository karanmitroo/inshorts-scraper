Manish Paul, Pradhuman Singh, and Ali Zafar-starrer 'Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive' which hit the screens on Friday "is not a funny sequel", wrote HT. "The film generates start-up potential, some smiles, some laugh-out-loud lines, but it keeps petering out," said Indian Express. The Abhishek Sharma directorial has been rated 2.5/5 (HT) and 2/5 (NDTV, Indian Express).
