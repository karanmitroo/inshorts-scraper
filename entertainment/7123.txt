Sonam Kapoor has been trolled for allegedly misquoting the National Anthem in a column. "National Anthem pata nahi aur chale National Award lene," tweeted a user. "Never knew [she] is so ignorant," commented another user. "Listen to the national anthem one more time. 
Recall the line you heard as kids, 'Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Issai'," read a part of Sonam's column.
