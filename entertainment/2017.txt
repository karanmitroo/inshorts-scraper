Actress Kalki Koechlin has said celebrities should personally relate to the cause or opinion that they are backing. "If they just put a face to the cause, without knowing about it, it doesn't serve the purpose," she added. Kalki further said she agrees with the fact that when a public figure supports a cause, it makes a big impact.
