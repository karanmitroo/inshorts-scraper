A statue of rapper Kanye West depicting him as the Christian god Jesus Christ has been displayed on the Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The gold-coloured statue, bearing the tag 'False Idol', has been made by the anonymous street artist Plastic Jesus. The artist said, "The piece is as critical of us as consumers as it is of Kanye himself."
