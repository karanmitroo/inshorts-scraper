Markandey Katju compared singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya to a donkey, after the singer criticised Lieutenant General Panag for tweeting that the image of a civilian tied to an army jeep as "human shield" will haunt the Army. Responding to Panag, Abhijeet had called him a Pakistan supporter, and added, "Wish you were kicked, beaten & humiliated on streets of #Kashmir."
