Zareen Khan has said if it wasn't for Salman Khan, she wouldn't have been a part of Bollywood. "Because of him, I am here. Don't know what he saw in me that he gave me this chance," she added. Zareen further said, "At the same time, I also understand he's a busy person...I cannot be piggybacking him all the time."
