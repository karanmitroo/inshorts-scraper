Actor Jim Carrey’s girlfriend Cathriona White was found dead in her Los Angeles home on Monday. The death is being seen as an “apparent suicide” from drug overdose, as several pills were found near White’s body. The 30-year-old make-up artist had met Carrey in 2012 and had been in an on-and-off relationship with him until they broke up last week.
