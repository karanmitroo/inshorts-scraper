Joss Whedon, director of the ‘Avengers’ series, has reportedly left Twitter after he faced strong criticism for portraying Scarlett Johansson's character as a typical 'damsel in distress' in ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’. Some users even urged him to “die” or “commit suicide” over points they didn’t like about the movie. Whedon, however, didn’t mention anything on Twitter before leaving it.
