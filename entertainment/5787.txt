Filmmaker Anurag Basu has said that music composer Pritam is one of the greatest strengths behind his movies. Basu added, "Our association started from television days since 1998. Jagga Jasoos is in fact, our fourth movie together." Basu further said that Pritam "is family", while wishing the composer bigger success on his 46th birthday on Wednesday.
