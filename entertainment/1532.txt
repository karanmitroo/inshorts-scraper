Model and ex-Bigg Boss contestant Sofia Hayat, while backing Rakhi Sawant for speaking up against the Information and Broadcasting Ministry's restriction on condom advertisements, said she should probably do a condom ad dressed as a nun. "[This will] promote the spiritual nature of love making," she added. Sofia further said, "Condoms are respectful! Sex should be sacred, pleasurable and safe."
