Actor Harshvardhan Kapoor has said that he does not take relationship advice from his father actor Anil Kapoor while adding, "That's too personal. I'm very private (in these matters)." He further said that he is very comfortable around women because of the amount of time he has spent with his mother Sunita Kapoor and sisters Sonam and Rhea Kapoor.
