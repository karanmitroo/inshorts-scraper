Actor Salman Khan has said that he advised Aamir Khan not to opt for a six-pack abs look in 'Dangal' as he plays the role of a wrestler. "He (Aamir) said Sushil Kumar (real life wrestler) and all have made it, but I told him ‘you don’t do it’," added Salman. Aamir portrays real-life wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat in 'Dangal'.
