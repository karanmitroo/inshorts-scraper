Actor Ranveer Singh, who will be seen doing a striptease in his upcoming film 'Befikre' has said that he has "no problem with nudity". "People say actors nange hote hai that doesn't mean they are literally naked. It means when an actor is performing it is completely convincing, but they are acting, they don't really feel it," added Ranveer.
