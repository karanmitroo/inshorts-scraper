Reacting to actor Salman Khan eating strands of threads from his own jeans at a press conference for his film 'Tubelight', a user tweeted, "For someone who is used to eating his own words, jeans is just a cloth." Another tweet read, "Guys it's not Salman who is eating, it's his driver. Salman won't do this type of things."
