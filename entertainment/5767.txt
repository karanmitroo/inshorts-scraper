Salman Khan has said that he felt incompetent as an actor when he was watching Sunil Grover imitating Amitabh Bachchan as part of a special television show. He added, "How Mr. Bachchan is in real life, he's got the real-life nuances. I haven't seen anything like that." Salman and Sohail Khan were on the show promoting their upcoming film Tubelight.
