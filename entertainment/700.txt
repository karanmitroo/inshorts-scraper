Karni Sena leader Suraj Pal Amu resigned from the primary membership of BJP on Wednesday. This comes two days after he was supposed to be produced in a Haryana court over his remarks on the film 'Padmaavat', but was admitted to a hospital after he fell ill. Amu had offered a â‚¹10-crore bounty to behead the film's actress Deepika Padukone.
