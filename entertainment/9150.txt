Actress Sonam Kapoor has said that she doesn't like pulling other people down to pull herself up. "You need to have some integrity and that earns you a lot of respect. I don't believe I'm in the race. I'm here to work and make my choices," she added. Sonam further said that one needs to focus on themselves to succeed.
