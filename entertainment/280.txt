Raveena Tandon, while slamming singer Papon for kissing a minor girl, tweeted, "Disgusting! Shameful! Perverse! This man should be arrested!" Lyricist Kausar Munir wrote, "Forcibly 'kissing' an 11yr old girl-child is not fatherly affection. Its sexual opportunism at the very least!" Meanwhile, Monali Thakur, while defending Papon, said it's a "misinterpretation of a man's gesture of affection".
