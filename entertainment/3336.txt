SS Rajamouli, director of the 'Baahubali' franchise, tweeted that the reports about him being appointed as a consultant, designer and supervisor for Andhra Pradesh's new state capital Amaravati, are false. Talking about his contribution in the process, he said that he's just "interpreting the vision" of Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu to the British architectural firm 'Foster + Partners'.
