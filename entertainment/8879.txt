As per reports, the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Jolly LLB 2' has been banned by Pakistani censor board for referring to the Kashmir militancy issue. As per a source, in the film, Akshay comes across the case of a man who's killed and declared a Kashmiri militant, while the real Kashmiri militant goes into hiding, which wasn't acceptable to the board.
