Bollywood diva Deepika Padukone has once again fallen victim to wardrobe malfunctioning. During an event of a clothing brand in Mumbai, the actress “accidently” flaunted her underwear while answering to questions of journalists at the event. Earlier, Katrina Kaif, Kangana Ranaut and many more have been a part of this embarrassing situation.
