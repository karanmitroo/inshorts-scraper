Lokendra Singh Kalvi, the convener of Rajput organisation Karni Sena, has said Deepika Padukone is dancing in "less clothing" in the film 'Padmavati'. He further questioned, "How are you trying to portray Indian women?" "This is the fire of 'jauhar', a lot of things will burn," Kalvi added while threatening to burn down theatres which will screen the film.
