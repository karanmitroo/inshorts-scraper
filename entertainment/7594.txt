Late TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee's last short film 'Hum Kuchh Kah Naa Sakey' was released on her first death anniversary on Saturday by her friend Kamya Punjabi. The film's story reportedly bears similarities to Pratyusha's life, and has a character named Rahul, said to be a veiled reference to her boyfriend.
