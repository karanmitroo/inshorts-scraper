Reacting to the Supreme Court's decision to allow an all India release for 'Padmaavat', Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said, "We will examine the decision and see if there is a scope of appealing against it." He added that the SC's stay order on the ban on 'Padmaavat' in states including Haryana, was announced without listening to their grievances.
