The governing body of the Oscars on Friday announced to make changes in its voting requirements, recruiting process and governing structure, to increase the racial diversity in Academy Awards. It aims to double the number of women and minority members by 2020. The announcement came after the 2016 Oscars received criticism over its all-white nominations for a second consecutive year.
