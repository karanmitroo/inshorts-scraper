Opening up on Kareena Kapoor's decision to move in with then-boyfriend Saif Ali Khan, sister Karisma Kapoor said that she and her mother were initially "shocked".  "Our family is slightly conservative but then we accepted that this was Bebo, all heart and all sentiment", added Karisma. Saif and Kareena married in 2012 and are expecting their first child in December.
