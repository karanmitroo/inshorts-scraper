Filmmaker Hansal Mehta whose upcoming movie 'Aligarh' is about a homosexual professor, said that according to section 377 majority of Indians are criminals. â€œSection 377 is not just about homosexuality or about consenting adults having sex... Even I am a criminal in the eyes of the law because anybody who has had oral sex is a criminal," said Mehta.
