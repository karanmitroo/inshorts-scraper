Filmmaker Sam Mendes has confirmed that he will not return as a director for the next James Bond film. "I’m a storyteller. And at the end of the day, I want to make stories with new characters,” said Mendes. Notably, Mendes had directed the last two films in the franchise 'Spectre' and 'Skyfall', which featured actor Daniel Craig as Bond.
