Pakistani actress Mahira Khan tweeted a disclaimer for her film on the issue of rape titled 'Verna', which read, "Everything in this film is imaginary. Imaginary because reality is too bitter to be told or shown." The disclaimer added, "Events shown in this film are jokes compared to what has been happening in countries like ours."
