Singer Shaan, while speaking on the ban on Pakistani artistes working in India, has said that as the artist exchange has always been one-sided exchange, "we will not miss much". "They have been banned and I respect that decision," said Shaan. Pakistani singers including Ali Zafar, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Shafqat Amanat Ali have sung for Bollywood films.
