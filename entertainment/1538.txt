Filmmaker SS Rajamouli, who directed Prabhas in the 'Baahubali' film franchise, jokingly said he and Prabhas have been together for five years and they need a break from each other. He said this on being asked if he will cast Prabhas in his upcoming film. "We'll of course work together again in the future," added Rajamouli.
