Accountants Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz from PricewaterhouseCoopers who were responsible for the wrong announcement of 'La La Land' as Best Picture at this year's Oscars have been banned from all future Oscar events. Academy President Cheryl Isaacs said the wrong envelope was handed to the presenters because Cullinan was distracted as he had been tweeting Emma Stone's photo backstage.
