After working with actor Sanjay Dutt in two Munna Bhai films, director Rajkumar Hirani is all set to make a biopic on him. Actor Ranbir Kapoor would play Dutt in the movie. "Sanju has lived a life which is unbelievable. We don't want to glorify him or anything. I want to tell the story with all his flaws," Hirani said.
