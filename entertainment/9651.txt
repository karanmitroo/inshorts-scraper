Musician Amaal Mallik, while questioning nominations at award shows in a Facebook post wrote, "Sarbjit had Randeep Hooda almost kill himself to bones...and you nominate only Aishwarya Rai Bachchan." He further wrote, "I'm ashamed to be nominated for 'Baaghi'...it was a very pathetically average album". "New awards to keep people happy are coming up," read his letter's concluding lines.
