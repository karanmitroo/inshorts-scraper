Hollywood actress Faye Dunaway has said that she felt very guilty for the wrong announcement of 'La La Land' as Best Picture at this year's Oscars. Dunaway, who presented the award with actor Warren Beatty, added, "I thought I could have done something, surely." Dunaway further said she felt that Beatty was joking when he showed her the envelope.
