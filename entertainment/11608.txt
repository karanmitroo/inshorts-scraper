Actor Ranbir Kapoor's name was mistakenly printed as Ranbir Singh by Filmfare magazine in its content section in the latest issue. The mix-up is said to be with Ranbir's contemporary Ranveer Singh's name. Filmfare's cover story featured 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' co-stars Ranbir and Aishwarya Rai in the article titled, 'Steamy! Aishwarya-Ranbir scorch it up'.
