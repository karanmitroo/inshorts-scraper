Rajput Karni Sena President Lokendra Singh Kalvi, while at a protest in Gujarat against the film 'Padmavati', said, "It is not a film, it is history. You cannot just show anything in the name of a film." Similar protests against the film's release also took place in Mumbai, where the police detained fifteen members of the Akhand Rajputana Sevasangh.
