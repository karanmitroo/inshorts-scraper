Comedian Bharti Singh has said she joined 'The Kapil Sharma Show' at a time when the show's TRPs were low to help her 'brother' Kapil. "He's my Guru. He has taught me the nuances of comedy when I was in college," she added. Bharti further said she's happy she could help Kapil as her episode increased the show's TRP.
