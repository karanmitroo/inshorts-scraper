Activists from Rashtra Chetna Manch staged a protest against the film 'Padmavati' in Delhi on Friday. They set fire to an effigy of Sanjay Leela Bhansali after hurling shoes at it. "The censor board does not know history. Before giving permission for such movies, the board must consult the descendants of the royal families and good historians," said a protester.
