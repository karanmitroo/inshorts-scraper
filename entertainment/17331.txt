Bollywood actor Salman Khan alleged during the final arguments in the 2002 hit-and-run case Wednesday that the evidence presented against him was fabricated. "When the FIR was registered (on September 28, 2002), no reference, whatsoever, was made about any section related to drunken driving. This entire story (of drunken driving) was created only on October 1 (2002)," Salman's advocate said.
