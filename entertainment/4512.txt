Rapper Kanye West is suing insurer Lloyd's of London for refusing to pay him after he was forced to cancel shows due to a mental breakdown last year. The singer sought $10 million (over â‚¹63 crore) in damages. The lawsuit also accuses the insurance company of leaking damaging information including his alleged marijuana use, which Kanye branded as 'irrelevant facts'.
