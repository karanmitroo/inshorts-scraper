Aamir Khan has said his 5-year-old son Azad Rao Khan prefers the real dad and not the reel one. Talking about how Azad cried during the screening of his film 'PK', he added, "When he saw me getting punched and...bleeding, he thought I was hurt and that upset him." Aamir further said Azad cries every time he watches his films.
