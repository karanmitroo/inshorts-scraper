American actress and singer Selena Gomez (21) reportedly doesn't want her parents to be her managers anymore and has now decided to recruit a professional to help her run her schedule. ''Selena feels she's outgrown her parents," said a source. The singer's mother Mandy Teefey and her step-father Brian have controlled her affairs since she shot to fame in 2007.
