Hollywood actress Rose McGowan, while responding to Harvey Weinstein's statement that the sexual encounter between him and Rose in 1997 was consensual, said, "Stop calling it consensual, you pig." "He can fall off the planet. My statement is truth, and reality," she added. In her memoir, Rose has revealed that Weinstein forced oral sex on her and masturbated.
