The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has threatened to "beat" filmmakers like Karan Johar and Mahesh Bhatt if they try to cast Pakistani artistes in their films. "For MNS, our country and our soldiers are important, and not the Pakistan artistes," said Amey Khopkar, the MNS film wing's President. MNS had earlier demanded a ban on Pakistani artistes working in India.
