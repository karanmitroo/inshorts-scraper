Politicians and activists in India and Pakistan have launched a campaign to ban Japanese cartoon cat Doraemon from television claiming it encourages children to misbehave at school and at home. Pakistani activists raised concerns over the use of Hindi words in the cartoon, which they claim mars the purity of Urdu and distorts "religious beliefs" of Urdu viewers in Pakistan.
