A Madurai court has summoned actor Rajinikanth and others in connection with a lawsuit that alleged that the storyline of the movie 'Lingaa' was stolen. The Madras High Court had transferred the case to Madurai with directives to complete the trial by April 30. The film's producer had released 'Lingaa' in 2014 after depositing a court-ordered bank guarantee.
