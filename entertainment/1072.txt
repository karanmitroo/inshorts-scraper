Himachal Pradesh CM Jai Ram Thakur said his government has no intention of banning Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmaavat' in the state. "If there's nothing controversial in it, we have no objection in releasing it here. I want the film to be screened in theaters," added Thakur. Earlier, he had said he respects art but one should avoid hurting people's sentiments.
