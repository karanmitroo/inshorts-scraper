Actress Deepika Padukone on Wednesday attended the 70th Cannes Film Festival, seven years after her first appearance at the festival in 2010. She wore a deep purple and green gown by Marchesa to the festival's opening gala. Deepika's stylist Elizabeth Saltzman said, "It's a little naughty this dress because even though you are showing nothing, you are showing everything."
