Veteran actress Shabana Azmi has said that the portrayal of Hindi film heroine, from the 'sati-savitri' she used to be, has changed completely. "I think there is a lot of difference now...as reflected by the many films that Vidya Balan or Alia Bhatt have done," she added. Shabana further said there's still a lot more that needs to be done.
