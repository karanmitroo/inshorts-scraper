Actress Kalki Koechlin has revealed that she was sexually abused at a tender age of nine. Kalki said that she decided to speak about it not to gain sympathy but to give others a confidence to talk about their such encounters. She further urged parents to remove the taboo around words like 'sex' so that kids can speak openly.
