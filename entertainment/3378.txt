Karan Johar has said he's jealous of filmmakers in his company who're making movies. "I want to be a director again. "Producing movies is amazing...but the pleasure you get out of directing a film on your own...is another thing," he added. Johar further said he has never been more lost in his life about what he wants to do next.
