Richa Chadha will be a part of the jury at the upcoming 'Nara International Film Festival' in Japan, which will be held from September 17-22. "It's a huge honour because I have been invited by none other than Naomi Kawase (the festival's director)," said Richa. The actress was also a jury member at the Marrakech International Film Festival in 2015.
