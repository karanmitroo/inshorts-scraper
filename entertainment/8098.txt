Actress Sonam Kapoor has said the row between Kangana Ranaut and Karan Johar is mudslinging of the worst kind. She added that she finds dragging someone down or criticising someone or having a public spat very distasteful. Sonam further said, "You can set examples without washing your dirty linen in public."
