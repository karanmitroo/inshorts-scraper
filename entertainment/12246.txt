Domingos Montagner, a television actor in Brazil, has drowned after swimming in a river, which was close to where he had been filming scenes for the television serial 'Velho Chico'. Ironically, the actor played the role of a farmer who in a scene was shown being shot multiple times and drowning in the same river only to reappear weeks later.
