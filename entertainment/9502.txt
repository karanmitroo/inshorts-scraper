Actress Deepika Padukone has said that it is nice being less recognised in the US. "I enjoy it, at least for now," she added. Deepika further said that she feels welcome in Hollywood and is having a lot of fun being there. Notably, Deepika's Hollywood debut film 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' released globally a week after its India release.
