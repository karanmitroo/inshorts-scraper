While speaking on the ongoing row over Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Ameya Khopkar said that they will not protest against the film just for the sake of it. "We'll watch the film first and if something is found objectionable then will discuss it with Bhansali and take a stand," added Khopkar.
