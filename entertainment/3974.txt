As per reports, Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Chairman Prasoon Joshi has denied certification to the Punjabi film 'Toofan Singh', the first film that came under his consideration after he took over from Pahlaj Nihalani. It was reportedly denied certification due to "excessive violence". A source said, "Toofan Singh is a terrorist... they've (filmmakers) compared him to Bhagat Singh."
