Transgender model Martina Robledo will be the first ever transgender person to serve as a 'trophy handler', the people who bring the trophies on stage, at the upcoming Grammy Awards. This year the line-up will also include a man. "The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one's gender," said the president of the Recording Academy.
