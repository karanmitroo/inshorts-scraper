Randeep Hooda-starrer 'Main Aur Charles' which hit the screens on Friday "came off as a slapdash, confused collage of scenes", wrote Indian Express. Randeep was convincing and his physical resemblance to serial killer Charles Sobhraj and accent helped bring the latter alive, said TOI. The film, also starring Richa Chadha, has been rated 1/5 (Indian Express) and 3/5 (TOI, NDTV).
