Actress Sunny Leone sang India's national anthem ahead of a Pro Kabaddi League match in Mumbai. "Itâ€™s a proud moment for me....I feel...honored. I was very nervous," said Sunny while adding that she rehearsed to get the words right. However, a complaint has been filed against her in a Delhi police station alleging that she sang the national anthem incorrectly.
