Actor Morgan Freeman, while pointing out what's wrong with the trophies of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, said, "It works from the back, but from the front, it's gender-specific." The trophy called 'The Actor' shows a nude male figure holding a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy. The veteran actor was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award.
