Hollywood actress Brooke Shields has revealed she once turned down a date from current US President Donald Trump. She said that Trump called her right after he got a divorce from his second wife Marla. "He said, 'I really think we should date because you're America's sweetheart and I'm America's richest man and the people would love it,'" added Shields.
