Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that she would rather be homeless than be a puppet in someone's hands. She said this in a veiled reference to Aditya Pancholi, who abused her physically when they were in a relationship. Kangana further said, "I always chose open skies, even if it comes with sleeping food-less and on pavements."
