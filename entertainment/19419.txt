Lady Gaga's urine has been bottled up as a perfume. On the show, Late Night, the 27-year-old singer couldn't make it to the bathroom and hence ended up squatting in a trashcan, the Mirror reported. The show's presenter Andy Cohen revealed that he had the pop star's urine made into perfume, which he referred to as a pop culture artifact.
