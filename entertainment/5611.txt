CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani criticised the new poster of the upcoming film 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' and said, "Showing the middle finger is impolite in any society. And it should be discouraged." Slamming film associations for clearing the poster, he said, "Maybe...they're playing the pseudo-liberal card to appear fashionable." Notably, the CBFC had earlier denied certificate to the film.
