BJP MP-actor Paresh Rawal said that actor Aamir Khan has now earned more goodwill than Tata and Birla. He added, "People come to watch his films as they know it will be good. His many years of continuous hard work has enabled him to earn...[this] goodwill." Paresh further said that Aamir is a complete package and doesn't rely on charm.
