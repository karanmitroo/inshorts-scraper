Swara Bhaskar has said she wanted to be a popular actor like Shah Rukh Khan and not simply a Bollywood heroine. She added, "An actor can become a star, but to retain that position like SRK, Salman or Aamir for 25 years is difficult." Swara said that those like her who work in Bollywood without any reference are tagged outsiders.
