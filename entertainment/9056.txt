Actor Aamir Khan has said that he doesn't choose films thinking about how much business they will do at the box-office. "When I did films like 'Sarfarosh' (1999), 'Rang De Basanti' (2006), 'Taare Zameen Par' (2007), I did not think about numbers," he added. Aamir further said that he does films which touch his heart.
