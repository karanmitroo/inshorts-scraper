Kajal Aggarwal has released her statement on Twitter following the arrest of her manager Ronnie in the drug racket case allegedly involving Tollywood actors and filmmakers. She wrote, "I am absolutely shocked...about this whole incident...I'm in zero support of this...just because I care for people who run errands for me does not imply that I can control their personal lives/choices."
