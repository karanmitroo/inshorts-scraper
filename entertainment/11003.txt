Actor Aamir Khan has backed out of British rock band Coldplay's concert in Mumbai, which is part of the Global Citizen Festival's maiden India edition. Although keen to attend the event, the actor reportedly backed out of the event owing to pre-production work on his film 'Dangal'. However, actors including Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra will attend the event.
