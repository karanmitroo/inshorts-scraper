CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani has slammed the IIFA Awards for not nominating Aamir Khan for 'Dangal' and Akshay Kumar for 'Airlift' or 'Rustom'. "They haven't...nominated [them] just because they wouldn't attend their weekend holiday plans masquerading as an awards function," he added. Nihalani further said the award function lost its relevance whenâ€‹ Amitabh Bachchan opted out of it in 2011.
