Suniel Shetty has said that all this talk of nepotism should stop while adding, "If my kids are interested in films because of me, who's to judge?" Talking about how he joined Bollywood, Suniel said, "I never had a godfather in my career. I've never stuck to a successful director to be successful. I did it all on my own."
