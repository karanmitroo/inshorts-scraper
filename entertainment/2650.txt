Singer Sonu Nigam has said if the National Anthem of Pakistan is played and all Pakistanis are standing, he will also stand out of respect for that country. Talking about India's National Anthem, he added, "The National Anthem is a prestigious and sensitive thing and I think it should not be played in certain places like movie theatres or restaurants."
