Oscars 2018 host Jimmy Kimmel, while talking about the Oscar statue, said, "Just look at him (Oscar statue). He keeps his hands where you can see them...And most importantly, no pen*s at all." In his speech at the event, Kimmel added, "He is literally a statue of limitations... that's the kind of men we need more of in this town."
