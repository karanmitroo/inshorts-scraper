Telugu actor-politician Pawan Kalyan, while reacting to tweets by filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma (RGV), said, "Why would I listen to a man who says he collects pornographic films at this age?" RGV criticised Kalyan's failure to turn up for a protest he himself called for demanding Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh. RGV tweeted, "When is (Kalyan) coming to battlefield?"
