Actor Salman Khan, whose film 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is due to release on Friday, has said that Bollywood films should try and match the success of recently released hit south Indian film 'Bahubali'. "'Bahubali' is a good film, but our cinema should make those numbers," Salman said. When asked if Bahubali's success scares him, Salman said, "Of course it scares me."
