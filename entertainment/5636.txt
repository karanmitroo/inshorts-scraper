Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Daniel Day-Lewis, known for films like Lincoln, My Left Foot and Gangs of New York, has announced his retirement from acting. The 60-year-old actor's spokesperson said it was a "private decision" and he was "immensely grateful to all... his collaborators and audiences". Phantom Thread, scheduled to release on December 25, is likely to be Daniel's last film.
