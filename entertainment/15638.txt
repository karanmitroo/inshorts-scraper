Joseph McBratney, who claims to have collected over 100 sketches made by late pop star Michael Jackson, has announced his plans to sell them to create “a non-profit endowment to help kids”. The drawings reportedly include those of the Beatles, Abraham Lincoln and Princess Diana among others, and are signed by Jackson. Reportedly, McBratney first found Jackson's drawings on eBay.
