Comedian Sunil Grover has said that he has not signed a show on any channel. He added, "I am a performer and my job is to perform and act. There are offers, but nothing has been decided yet, but I will be doing something for sure." Earlier, Grover was part of The Kapil Sharma Show but left after a fight.
