Actress Taapsee Pannu, who attended a special screening of her film 'Pink' at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, said she was like an over-enthusiastic child while having dinner with President Pranab Mukherjee. "Even though he was very sweet... and interactive, I was very cautious that I shouldn't violate any protocol," she added. Taapsee further said that the President also praised the film.
