The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition filed against the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati'. While dismissing the petition, the Supreme Court said that the Censor Board has not yet issued a certificate to the film. It added that the Censor Board is an independent body and therefore it should not intervene in their jurisdiction.
