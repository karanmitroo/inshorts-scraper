Aamir Khan, with his brother Faisal Khan's help, has reportedly finalized script for his next directorial venture after 2007’s ‘Taare Zameen Par’ that won him a National Award. Faisal reportedly reads scripts alongside Aamir and also suggested him do Dhoom-3. Aamir confirmed these reports saying he bought the rights already, although he’s yet to set a date for this project.
