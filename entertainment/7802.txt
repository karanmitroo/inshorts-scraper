Actor Sanjay Dutt has said that he wants to change the release date of his comeback film 'Bhoomi' to avoid a clash with Aamir Khan's film 'Secret Superstar'. "Aamir is a dear friend and I wouldn't want my comeback film to be pitted against his. In this industry, we should all make an effort to help each other," said Sanjay.
