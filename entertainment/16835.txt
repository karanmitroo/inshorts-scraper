Producer-director Karan Johar has debunked the reports that claimed he would replace stand-up comedian Kapil Sharma as a host in the show 'Comedy Nights with Kapil' following the latter's ill health. "I canâ€™t replace Kapil Sharma, I am not that stupid," Johar said to Bollywood Life. Furthermore, actors Arjun Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh have also denied hosting the show.
