The popular saga Game of Thrones is likely to continue for three more seasons, confirmed Michael Lombardo, HBO programming president. Asked about the possibility of a prequel series, Lombardo said he believed there's 'enormous story material' to be mined for such a project. The fantasy drama series completed five seasons in June and has been renewed for a sixth season.
