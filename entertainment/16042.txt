Following Aamir Khan's remarks on intolerance, a short-filmmaker filed a complaint against Khan in Delhi's Ashok Nagar police station. “Celebrities should think about their status and duties before making such statements," the filmmaker said. They shouldn’t scare people by speaking about intolerance, he added. The actor had said at an awards event that he fears India's "growing despondency".
