Bollywood actor Aamir Khan Saturday criticized established actors and filmmakers for being afraid of experimenting. "Everything has become about numbers. I don't think so that should be the way. Audience wants films that can enrich them but we don't do that," Aamir said. However, he was impressed by young directors for daring to tell new stories, Khan said.
