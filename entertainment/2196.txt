Gunshots were fired at Rajasthan's Chittorgarh Fort, where Rajput organisation Karni Sena held a protest against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmavati'. Tourists visiting the fort were requested to go back after the Fort's entry was closed on Friday for the protest. According to a protester, the entry to the fort has never been blocked since India's independence.
