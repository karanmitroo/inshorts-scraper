Actress Sumona Chakravarti, while speaking on the brawl that took place between Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover on a flight in March, said she is lucky that she was not there. "When you work with a particular team for three-four years...some sort of disagreements happen," she added. Sumona further said although she misses her co-stars, the show must continue.
