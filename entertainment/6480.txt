Actor Sathyaraj, who portrayed Kattappa, didn't disclose the answer to Baahubali: The Beginning's question as to why his character killed Baahubali even to his family. Sathyaraj's daughter said, "I did bully him once saying I would tell all my friends! He would simply smile and say nothing." She added that the family got the answer only on watching Baahubali 2.
