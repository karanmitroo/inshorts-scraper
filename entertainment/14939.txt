Actress Sunny Leone's husband Daniel Weber has denied reports of Sunny slapping a journalist for asking her about her charges for ‘night performances’ in Surat on Thursday. The reports also carried a quote from Daniel saying that Sunny would think a thousand times before coming to Gujarat again. "There is not a single fact of truth to this," added Daniel.
