Actor Akshay Kumar, who had auditioned for 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar' said he was removed from the film as he was apparently crap. Akshay added, "I went there. Apna screen test diya maine... And they (the makers) didn't like it." The role for which he had auditioned was eventually played by actor Deepak Tijori.
