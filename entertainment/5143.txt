Mithun Chakraborty has said comedian Kapil Sharma is one of the biggest talents he has seen in his career. Talking about Krushna and Kapil who are often pitched as competitors, he added, "I have no idea about it. But I feel no one should compare. His (Kapil's) show is huge, it will take time (for Krushna's show) to reach there."
