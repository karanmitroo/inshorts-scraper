Veteran actor Dilip Kumar got his first acting offer after he was spotted selling fruits by actress Devika Rani. Ashok Raj in his book 'Hero: The silent era to Dilip Kumar' wrote, "It was by...chance that the shy shopkeeper had only replaced his father that day." Dilip, who turned 95 on Monday, debuted with Rani's 1944 film 'Jwar Bhata'.
