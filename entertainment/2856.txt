The release of Benedict Cumberbatch's 'The Current War' has been postponed by The Weinstein Company in the light of rape allegations against ousted chairman Harvey Weinstein. It has been pushed to an undecided 2018 release. The film's writer Michael Mitnik also dropped out of New York Film Festival panel, thinking it'd be inappropriate to promote it due to the controversy.
