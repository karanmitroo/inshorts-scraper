Actor Irrfan Khan in a recent interview said that in the west, Academy awards or Golden Globes are significant but awards in Bollywood do not affect an artist's career growth. Meanwhile speaking about National Film Awards, the 49-year-old actor added, "(Winning a national award) is a great satisfaction for an artist... But it has no impact on an artistâ€™s career."
