The motion poster of 'Baahubali 2' was revealed on Saturday at the ongoing MAMI Mumbai Film Festival. The poster, which was released a day ahead of actor Prabhas' birthday, shows his look as the titular character of the film, which is a continuation of the 2015 film 'Baahubali: The Beginning'. "One film like Baahubali is like 100 films," said Prabhas.
