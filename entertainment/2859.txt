Actor George Clooney has denied his 'ER' co-star Vanessa Marquez's claim that he "helped blacklist" her for reporting on-set harassment. "I had nothing to do with casting. I was...only an actor. If she was told I was involved in any decision about her career...she was lied to," added Clooney. Marquez was a guest star till the show's third season.
