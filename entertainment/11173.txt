Actor Sonu Sood has said that the death of two Kannada actors, Anil and Uday, while shooting a scene for a film, was a "purely criminal act" by the filmmakers. "I am shocked, sad and angry... I saw the video and there were no safety precautions taken for those actors... I think it is unpardonable," added Sonu.
