A dating reality show called 'Kiss Bang Love', where people find their match based on kissing strangers while blindfolded, will air in the US starting January 3. In each episode, a new participant kisses ten potential suitors and narrows down the options based on the kisses. Versions of the show have already aired in Australia, Denmark and Germany.
