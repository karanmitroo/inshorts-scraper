Production of the upcoming action film 'Mission: Impossible 6' (M:I 6) has been halted, reportedly for six weeks to three months, after lead actor Tom Cruise broke his ankle while performing a stunt for the movie. "The hiatus itself is unknown...Nothing that we're looking at right now is going to affect the release date," said the film's director Christopher McQuarrie.
