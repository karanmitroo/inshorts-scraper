Navjot Singh Sidhu, who features on 'The Kapil Sharma Show', said that it's his duty to bring Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover together again on the show. He added, "Being a senior member of the show...this is my duty." This comes after it was reported that Sunil will quit the show, after Kapil reportedly assaulted him on a flight recently.
