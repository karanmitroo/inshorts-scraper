Actress Amy Schumer, when asked who she was wearing on the red carpet of the Emmy Awards, said, "Vivienne Westwood (dress), Tom Ford shoes and an OB tampon." Amy chose the candid comment as her response to the question, which is often asked only to actresses at such events. The 35-year-old actress attended the Emmys with her sister Kim Caramele.
