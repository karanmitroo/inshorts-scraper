The Delhi High Court on Friday stayed the telecast of adult movie Grand Masti as it observed the film was not certified for unrestricted public viewing. The court said even if a warning is shown at the start of the movie, it would not serve as a safeguard. The film was scheduled to be aired on Zee Cinema on Saturday.
