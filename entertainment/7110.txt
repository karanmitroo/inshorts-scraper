Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that content of reality shows, crime shows and daily soaps on television is crossing all limits. He added, "Women are raped in incestuous attacks, housewives and minor girls are shown to be violated." Nihalani further said that this free flow of content must stop as it affects the natural psychological development of kids.
