Actor Aamir Khan, who directed child-centric film 'Taare Zameen Par', has voiced the issue of negligibility of content for children in films and television. At the Ficci Frames 2015 conclave, Aamir said that this unavailability has forced children to watch what’s not meant for them. He added that Bollywood can contribute to India’s growth by serving healthy content to children.
