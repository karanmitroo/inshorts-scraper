Sridevi has said she refused to do many films and doesn't understand why rejecting 'Baahubali' has become such a big issue. She added, "Two parts of Baahubali have come out... now they are asking me. I have my own reasons [to reject the film]." Sridevi was initially approached to play Queen Sivagami, a role eventually portrayed by actress Ramya Krishnan.
