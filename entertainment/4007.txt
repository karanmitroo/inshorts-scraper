Actor John Abraham has said he will soon be producing a film that will be based on football under his banner JA Entertainment. "It's a true story and a fantastic script... I think nobody understands football the way I do (in the film industry)," he added. Notably, the actor owns an Indian professional football franchise named NorthEast United FC.
