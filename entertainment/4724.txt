Late veteran actress Madhubala is set to get a wax figure at the Madame Tussauds in New Delhi. The wax figure will be styled as her character Anarkali from the 1960 film 'Mughal-E-Azam'. The wax museum, which will open later this year, will also feature wax figures of Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, singer Shreya Ghoshal, among others.
