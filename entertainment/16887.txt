Actor Alok Nath, who is often comically referred to as 'sanskari babuji', was trolled after he tweeted an abusive message. After activist Kavita Krishnan accused PM Narendra Modi of "stalking daughters" and called him a "lame duck PM", Nath tweeted, "@Ra_Bies @kavita_krishnan jail the bitch". Although Nath quickly deleted the tweet, Twitter users started sharing the screenshots of the post.
