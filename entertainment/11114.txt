A new teaser for the Scarlett Johansson starrer upcoming science-fiction film 'Ghost in the Shell' has been released. The film was criticised of 'whitewashing' for casting Johansson as 'Major Motoko Kusanagi', which is originally a Japanese character in the Manga series on which the film is based. Directed by Rupert Sanders, it is scheduled to release on March 31, 2017.
