A Pakistani Twitter user was trolled after tweeting a picture of Pakistani cricket captain Sarfaraz Ahmed waving to a crowd, captioned, "SRK who?" A user commented, "SRK- he whose films have more crowd than this.. that too in theatres in Karachi, Islamabad & rest of Pakistan." "Never Underestimate Papa," read another tweet accompanied by Shah Rukh's pictures waving to fans.
