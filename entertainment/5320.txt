Ex-Bigg Boss contestant Mandana Karimi has clarified that she has not filed for divorce from her husband Gaurav Gupta but has only filed a domestic violence case as she still loves him. Mandana added that on her husband's behest, she stopped working completely after Bigg Boss and chose to work on her marriage but that wasn't the smartest option.
