Bollywood superstar Shar Rukh Khan said that the cameo by his youngest child AbRam in 'Happy New Year' has been fetching him many compliments. But the best compliment, he said, came from co-star Deepika Padukone. "She said she wants to do her next film with him (AbRam) as she find him adorable,” the 48-year-old actor said.
