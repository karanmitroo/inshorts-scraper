Akshay Kumar has compared media taking celebrities' pictures without consent to stalking. He said, "Newspaper photographer jab khada hota hai, does he seek permission before taking a [celebrity's] picture? Then you also treat it like baap ka maal and publish those photographs." Akshay's statement comes after he was criticised for depicting stalking in his upcoming film 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha'.
