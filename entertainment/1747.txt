Tiger Zinda Hai's director Ali Abbas Zafar has said that the film would probably not have been made if Katrina Kaif had not agreed to star in it. He added that she is as important as Salman Khan's character Tiger in the film. Ali further said, "It explores both of them as agents and that's why it's a true sequel."
