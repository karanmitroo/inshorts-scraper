According to reports, a relative of Karan Johar may sue Johar and his book's publisher for false claims in his biography 'An Unsuitable Boy'. Johar wrote that on his father's side, his relatives were halwais (sweet-makers) and only his father was 'educated'. The relative, however, claims that Johar's grandfather was a government employee and his uncle was in the IAS.
