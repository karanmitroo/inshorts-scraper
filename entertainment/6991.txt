Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Tuesday declared April 25 as 'La La Land Day'. "A day when you can celebrate your dreams, you can dance safely... take a date up to Griffith Park, fall in love, with somebody or just with your city," he said. Meanwhile, dancers abseiled down the facade of Los Angeles City Hall during the celebrations.
