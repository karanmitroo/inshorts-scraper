Actress Kristen Stewart has said that a person is not confused if he or she is bisexual. "It's not confusing at all. For me, it's quite the opposite... [T]here's no reason why I should shy away from that," she added. Kristen further said it is "cool" that people do not have to nail everything down about their sexuality anymore.
