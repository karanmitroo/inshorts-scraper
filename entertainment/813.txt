The Chittorgarh unit of Rajput organisation Karni Sena has claimed it will produce a film titled 'Leela Ki Leela' based on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's mother Leela Bhansali. The unit's district president said work on it will be started within a fortnight. "Bhansali has insulted our mother Padmavati, but we'll ensure he feels proud of the movie we'll make," he added.
