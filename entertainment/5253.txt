Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that he acts for himself and not to impress people while adding "Doing that would be corrupting my craft." He said, "I take it (acting) as a journey...I'm trying to discover myself through different characters." However, Nawazuddin admitted dancing in 'Munna Michael' was a scary experience for him because he is insecure about his dancing skills.
