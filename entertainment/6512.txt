Katrina Kaif has said that as a celebrity she doesn't feel the need to have an opinion on everything while adding, "Why can't I not have an opinion?" She added, "I'm not well informed about half the things that go on in the world. Until I really want to sit down and do my research, I'd rather not say anything."
