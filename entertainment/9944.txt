A memorial parade in New Orleans, USA, featured people dressed up as Princess Leia to commemorate the late actress Carrie Fisher, as she played the character in the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. "This is a public demonstration of our love for Princess Leia," said a fan while others praised Fisher for creating mental health awareness and for activism for women.
