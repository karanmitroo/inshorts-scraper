Television show host-comedian Kapil Sharma has said that he is better now, following his hospitalisation earlier this week. He had been hospitalised after he complained of uneasiness while shooting for an upcoming episode of The Kapil Sharma Show. A source revealed that Kapil had reportedly taken Sunil Grover quitting the show as more of a personal than a professional blow.
