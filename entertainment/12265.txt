Actress Soha Ali Khan, who was attacked on social media after she visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and a Ganpati pandal, said that going to a temple does not make her a "non-Muslim". "Nobody owns me. India being a secular nation, we have to respect all religions and each other’s choices,” added Soha.
