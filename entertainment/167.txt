Jaaved Jaaferi, while condoling Sridevi's demise, tweeted, "Sridevi was so much like #MichaelJackson. No childhood. Pressure to perform since [childhood days]." "Extremely...introverted but exploded while performing, like 'that' was their life and not the one outside," he added. Sridevi, who passed away on Saturday night, began her career as a child artiste in the South Indian film industry.
