Actress Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli, while slamming Filmfare magazine editor Jitesh Pillai, tweeted, "Dimwit...Don't give this trivia to me, go save your job." Rangoli tweeted this in response to Pillai denying Kangana's claims that she was called  to receive a Filmfare award in 2014, but since she couldn't attend the function the award was given to someone else.
