A kids clothing line is being launched under singer Chris Brown's three-year-old daughter Royalty Brown's name. She is also set to be the face of the new unisex fashion line 'Royalty Brown Clothing'. The three-year-old is said to have helped her mother Nia to design the new line, which will feature clothing, footwear and headgear.
