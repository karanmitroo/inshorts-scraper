A music video by a girl band has criticised Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, which suggests that women cannot travel, marry, drive, work or even get healthcare without the approval of a male relative. The girls, who appear in burkhas, are seen singing lyrics like "If only God would rid us of men" as they skate, play basketball and dance.
