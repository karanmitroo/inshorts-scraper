Actor Akshay Kumar, while speaking about stalking in a song of his upcoming film 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha', said, "Yes, you can say it's wrong, but I can't show all the good things only, right?" He added, "To show the good in a character, sometimes you have to show the bad too. The transformation is very important."
