Twenty-eight-year-old Edward Majerczyk has agreed to plead guilty to fooling over 300 people, including 30 celebrities, into compromising their email accounts. The case is the second to arise from the 2014 'Celebgate' hacking scandal, where email accounts of celebrities like  Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kaley Cuoco were hacked and their nude photos and videos were put online.
