Actor Amitabh Bachchan has been slammed on Twitter for posting a picture of all male artistes who worked on 'Pink' to celebrate the film completing one year. "A National Award winning film about women's dignity and rights but the celebration above has only men in the frame," tweeted a user. Another tweet read, "PINK girls missing in the picture."
