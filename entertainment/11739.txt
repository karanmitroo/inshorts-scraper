Television personality Khloe Kardashian has said that her elder sister Kim Kardashian is "not doing that well" following the incident in Paris, where she was robbed by armed men at gunpoint. "It was horrible, what happened to her. It's incredibly traumatic. Our family is super close and great and we'll get through it together," added Khloe.
