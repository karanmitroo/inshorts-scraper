London-based 'The Line' has developed an 8-bit browser-based game wherein Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio runs down the red carpet and skips through various obstacles to catch an Oscar award. In the game, DiCaprio has to pass through other Oscar nominees of the best actor award. Notably, DiCaprio has been nominated five times for the award but hasn't won yet.
