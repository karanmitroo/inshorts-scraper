Lokendra Kalvi, a member of Rajput organisation Karni Sena, has said the organisation will write to PM Narendra Modi seeking an all-India ban on the film 'Padmavati'. The group has also demanded the resignation of Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani and Censor Board Chief Prasoon Joshi. "Joshi has gone ahead and unilaterally advised modifications in the film," said Kalvi.
