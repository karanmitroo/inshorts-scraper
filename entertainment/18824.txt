Actor Aftab Shivdasani recently tied the knot with Nin Dusanj, a British-Indian girl, at a private ceremony. However, they plan to have an elaborate celebration at the year end. Dusanj worked in Hong Kong for six years as a consultant in the luxury brand industry before relocating to India in 2012. She met Aftab through common friends at an event.
