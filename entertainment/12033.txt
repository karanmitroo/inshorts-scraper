Pakistan-born actor Marc Anwar has apologised for his racist and offensive tweets about Indians over the Kashmir issue while terming his "rant" a "moment of madness". "[M]y frustration was vented at the governments of the two countries... their hypocrisy. My absolute sympathies lie with all those suffering in areas of conflict... especially those (in) Indian occupied Kashmir," added Marc.
