In a column, actress Sonam Kapoor has written that people might call her a 'bimbo' or 'nachne wali', but she's a terribly self-assured woman. "I wouldn't have the balls to do what I do, wear what I wear...if I didn't have self-worth," she wrote further. Sonam added that just because she's an actor, doesn’t mean she can’t have an opinion.
