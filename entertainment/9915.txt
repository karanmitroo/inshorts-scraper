The Hollywood Sign Trust, the non-profit organisation that oversees maintenance for the 'Hollywood' sign in Los Angeles, is looking to improve its security after a prankster turned the sign to 'Hollyweed'. "This is more than preventing pranks or trespassing at the sign. Our concern is the safety of the neighbourhood and the trespassers," said the Chairman of the trust.
