The customs department on Tuesday confiscated the crown of Srishti Rana, the Asia-Pacific beauty-pageant winner, at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport, as the customs duty for the diamond-studded crown wasn't paid. However, Rana was momentarily allowed to pose with the crown for the media waiting outside. Customs officials said 36% of the value of the diamonds would be charged as duty.
