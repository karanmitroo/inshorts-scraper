Actor Aamir Khan has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move has not affected him as he spends only using credit cards and cheques. "I believe it affected those people who have black money," he further said, adding that he doesn't have black money as he has been paying his taxes. Further, Aamir called for supporting Modi's demonetisation initiative.
