Actor Akshay Kumar has said that fitness is not about showing off six-pack abs built from using a bottle full of enhancers. "Fitness is about becoming the best version of you, no matter what level you may be at," added the actor. Akshay further said, "I'm not asking anyone to spend lakhs on gym memberships...Let's be honest, walking is free."
