Madhya Pradesh minister Bhupendra Singh has said he never opposed playing of songs from the film 'Padmaavat'. Adding that his comments were misconstrued, Singh said, "I was saying nobody should take law in their hands even if they've objections about any song." Singh asserted that he never meant to say people shouldn't play the songs as the movie was banned.
