A case has been filed against actor Prakash Raj by a lawyer in a Lucknow court after he questioned PM Narendra Modi's silence over journalist Gauri Lankesh's murder. Prakash had commented, "Do you (Modi) think I'll not be able to detect when you are acting." He later said as an Indian citizen, he has a right to question the PM.
