Singer Madonna, in an Instagram post, has slammed the biopic 'Blond Ambition' being made on her. "Nobody knows what I know and what I have seen. Only I can tell my story. Anyone else who tries is a charlatan and a fool," she wrote. Madonna further said looking for gratification without doing the work is a disease in the society.
