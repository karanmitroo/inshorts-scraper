Two leaders of Yuva Sena on Tuesday asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's commissioner to file a â‚¹500 crore defamation case against 93.5 Red FM and its host RJ Malishka. The controversy ensued after a viral song by the channel allegedly made fun of the BMC. They claimed that the channel had defamed the corporation for problems outside its jurisdiction.
