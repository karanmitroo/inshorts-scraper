While posting a picture of actress Sonam Kapoor on an American stock photo platform, the agency referred to her as Deepika Padukone. The photo showed Sonam arriving for the film 'The Meyerowitz Stories' at Cannes 2017. Earlier Deepika, who was mistaken for Priyanka Chopra by foreign media, had said that it was racist and ignorant of them.
