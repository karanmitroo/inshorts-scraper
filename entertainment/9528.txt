American band Slightly Stoopid has produced the first smokable records in the world, using hash. Two prototypes were created, at the cost of $14,000 (nearly â‚¹9.5 lakh), but one of them was reportedly smoked by the band and its staff while the second was considered unsatisfactory. Slightly Stoopid plans to produce a third prototype this year.
