Gal Gadot, who portrayed the superhero character 'Wonder Woman', has shown her support to Sri Lankan cosplayers Amaya Suriyapperuma and Seshani Cooray, who were bullied and body-shamed after their pictures surfaced online. "Looking amazing ladies," wrote Gal while sharing an article on them. "I'm a huge fan of Gal Gadot...My inner fangirl is never going to forget this!" said Amaya.
