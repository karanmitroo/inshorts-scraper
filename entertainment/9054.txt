Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that if she fails, she bundles up in a blanket in her room, eats a tub of ice-cream and gets over it. "I don't like to fail...(but) each success and failure has shaped my present, and I wouldnâ€™t change that for anything," she added. Priyanka further said she's always looking for new things to do.
