Actor Salman Khan has agreed to compensate distributors for the losses they suffered over Tubelight's performance at the box office. "When a distributor suffers a loss, the producer needs to show some responsibility and share the burden. We, too, have done the same thing," said Salman's father Salim Khan. Rajinikanth and Shah Rukh Khan have also compensated distributors previously.
