Lyricist Javed Akhtar has said there is no divide between an average Hindu and an average Muslim in their way of thinking and living. "[A]n average Muslim would never want to kill someone because he is from a different religion just like an average Hindu won't," he added. Javed further said division on religious grounds is created by communalist powers.
