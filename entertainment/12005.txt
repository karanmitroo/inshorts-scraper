Rishi Kapoor has tweeted that he is happy to accept birthday messages for his son Ranbir Kapoor, who turned 34 on Wednesday, as Ranbir is not on social media. "[H]appy to accept this time all your greetings, blessings, love and hate for Ranbir," tweeted Rishi. However, the picture of the grumpy cat meme he tweeted read, "I'm not Ranbir's mailbox."
