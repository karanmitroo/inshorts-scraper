Actor Varun Dhawan, while speaking about Rajkummar Rao, said that he is happy he bet on the right horse. "I have been proved right (that Rajkummar is a brilliant actor). Raj, I praised you before your film got chosen for the Oscars," he added. Notably, Rajkummar's recently released film 'Newton' has been selected as India's official entry to Oscars 2018.
