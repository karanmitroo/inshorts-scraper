As reported by a tabloid, Kushal Tandon and Gauhar Khan have resolved their differences and are back together. The two had broken up last month. When asked about it, Gauhar Khan said, "I didn't speak about it (the break up) earlier, I won't speak about it (the reconciliation) now. All I can say is that I am happy today."
