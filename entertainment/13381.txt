Star Trek actor William Shatner sold his kidney stone to online casino GoldenPalace for $25,000 in 2006. The casino initially offered $15,000, but Shatner insisted it was worth more, saying "If you subjected it to extreme heat, it might turn out to be a diamond". The proceeds from the sale were donated to housing charity ‘Habitat for Humanity’.
