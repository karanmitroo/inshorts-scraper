Stand-up comedian Tanmay Bhat said that he was scared to comment on the sexual harassment row involving Arunabh Kumar, founder and CEO of online entertainment startup 'The Viral Fever' (TVF). He added, "The topic is so sensitive...also, I don't trust the media to report exactly (what I said). So, controlling what we have to say, we wrote it on Twitter."
