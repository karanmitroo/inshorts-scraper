Meghan Markle's half-sister Samantha Grant has slammed her for wearing a $75,000 (â‚¹47 lakh) gown for her engagement with UK's Prince Harry, instead of financially helping their father. "If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad," said Samantha. "Meghan's education, her first job...he gave her so much of who she is," added Samantha.
