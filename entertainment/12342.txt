Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that he feels "responsible" for the 'downfall' of actor Ranbir Kapoor's career. "I think Ranbir is one of the finest actors and he was willing to experiment. We failed him collectively, a lot of us failed him,‚Äù said Kashyap, while referring to his film 'Bombay Velvet' and his brother Abhinav Kashyap's film 'Besharam'.
