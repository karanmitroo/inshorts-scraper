American actress Kim Kardashian’s Kimoji app has reportedly crashed Apple’s App Store. Kardashian tweeted, “We worked so hard on this app and we know there are some issues due to the massive downloads that the whole tech team is so working on!” Kimoji offers more than 200 Kim-inspired emojis, that users can add in their keyboards, for $1.99.
