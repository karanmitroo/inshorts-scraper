Actor Kamal Haasan, who has been vocal about his support for Jallikattu, took to Twitter and asked supporters of the traditional sport not to harass actress Trisha. "Let's not hurt her just because she differs from our opinion," he tweeted. Earlier, there were reports that Jallikattu supporters held up shooting of Trisha's film as she is endorsing PETA.
