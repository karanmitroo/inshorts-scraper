Aligarhâ€™s Youth Initiative for Peace and Harmony group has decided to boycott Bollywood star Salman Khan's forthcoming movie 'Jai Ho'. Condemning both Salman and Madhuri Dixit for participating in the 'Saifai Mahotsav', the group said it was a pity the actors went to the show when UP government was not doing enough for victims of the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar.
