Actor Abhishek Bachchan's picture recently appeared on an admit card for government recruitment, as an apparent prank. His picture appeared with a misspelt name on the official website of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) for candidates who took a multi-tasking (non-technical) staff examination. The Commission is looking into the case, said an official.
