Priyanka Chopra, while appearing on the American talk show 'The View', said that body-shaming happens to all women, especially those in the film industry where they are supposed to look and dress "a certain way". "[Y]ou get the pressure from everyone around you saying 'you used to fit into that dress last month and this month you don't'," added Priyanka.
