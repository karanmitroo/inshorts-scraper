A Mumbai court framed charges against Salman Khan for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the 11 year old hit-and-run case in which one person was killed and four others were injured. This sets stage for a fresh trial that could attract a jail term up to ten years. The actor, however, pleaded not guilty to all these charges.
