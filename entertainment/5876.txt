Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee will be conferred with Legion of Honour, France's highest civilian award. "As...one who has been inspired by French art and cinema, I feel it's a special honour," said Chatterjee. He has worked with late filmmaker Satyajit Ray, who has also been conferred with the award, in numerous films including 'Apur Sansar' and 'Ghare Baire'.
