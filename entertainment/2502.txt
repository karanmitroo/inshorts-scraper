Denying reports of the BJP seeking a delay in the release of 'Padmavati' ahead of the Gujarat elections, the spokesperson of the party Shaina NC said, "There's no truth to such talk." Earlier, it was reported that BJP had written to the Election Commission, the Censor Board and the Centre, seeking to stop the film's release temporarily.
