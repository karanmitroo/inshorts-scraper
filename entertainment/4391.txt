Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said that he does not think film reviews help an actor to grow or improve creativity. Sidharth added, "Only constructive criticism can help us to grow... therefore, I take any constructive assessment seriously when it comes from insiders of the (film) fraternity." He further said that film reviews are always inching towards positive or negative.
