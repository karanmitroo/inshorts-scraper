India's first film with sound 'Alam Ara' was released on March 14, 1931, marking the end of the silent era in the Indian film industry. It was shot in a studio in Mumbai at night, to avoid recording of external sounds. The film was reportedly advertised with the Hindi tagline '78 murde insaan zinda ho gaye. Unko bolte dekho?'
