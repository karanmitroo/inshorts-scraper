The Jimmy Shergill and Ashutosh Rana starrer 'Shorgul', which released on Friday, is "a toothless, clich√©d melodrama", wrote Indian Express. Hindustan Times called it "a disappointment". Meanwhile, NDTV called 'Shorgul' "a shrill, simplistic, by-the-rote drama that does not have the foggiest clue what to do with its... delicate subject matter". It was rated 1.5 (Indian Express) and 1/5 (HT, NDTV).
