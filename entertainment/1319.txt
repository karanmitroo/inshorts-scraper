While talking about filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Anurag Kashyap said that he creates opera like cinema which is pure magic. "Nobody shoots songs like him. At that scale, you need a lot of patience - I don't have it. Also, you can see Sanjay's money on-screen," he added. Kashyap further said that Bhansali is a pure artiste.
