Actress Salma Hayek has said that US President Donald Trump cannot build the wall between USA and Mexico without the Mexicans that are illegally in the US. Salma added, "That is what makes the economy so strong because they are paid less than half, with no benefit." She further said even if Trump becomes a dictator, his days are numbered.
