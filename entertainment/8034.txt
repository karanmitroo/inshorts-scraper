Actress Swara Bhaskar has said that a possible reason for women not reporting sexual harassment is due to the culture of shaming women in Indian society. She added that fear of not being believed, tedious bureaucratic process and fear of vengeance, particularly if people being challenged are more powerful, are other reasons for women not reporting sexual harassment.
