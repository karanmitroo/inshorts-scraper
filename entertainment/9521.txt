Actor Hrithik Roshan has revealed that his father Rakesh Roshan is hurt and upset that his film 'Kaabil' and Shah Rukh Khan's 'Raees' will release on the same day. "My father is concerned for others...he...expects others to be the same way," he added. Hrithik further said that if the 'Raees' team had planned it better, this clash wouldn't have happened.
