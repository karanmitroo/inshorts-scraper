As per media reports, Priyanka Chopra has demanded Rs.6 crore for a seven-minute performance at a New Year' Eve show in Chennai. The event organizers agreed to pay the huge sum as they believe that Priyanka's popularity among the youth would recover the cost via tickets. Notably, the actress has not performed for a December 31 show so far.
