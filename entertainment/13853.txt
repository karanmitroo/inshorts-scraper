Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, the Icelandic actor who portrays 'The Mountain' in Game of Thrones, has posted a photo celebrating Iceland's draw against Portugal on Wednesday. The actor had earlier threatened to crush Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo's head if he scored against Iceland in the Euro 2016 Group match, who, however, failed to register a goal in the 1-1 draw.
