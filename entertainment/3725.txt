Sunny Leone, while talking about getting trolled for adopting baby girl Nisha, said, "I haven't seen what people have written online...(I'm) completely consumed by the new person (Nisha) in...(my) life." Sunny added that she's not bothered by such trolls. She further said, "If I were concerned about what's happening online, I think maybe that's something that should have been questioned."
