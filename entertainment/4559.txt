Singer Sukhe, who sang the song 'Jaguar', jokingly said the owners of the car brand should have paid him for making the brand so popular through his song. "After the song was out, there were so many Jaguars to be seen [in]... places like Chandigarh!" he added. Sukhe further joked, "Jab next part aayega, I will definitely be approaching them."
