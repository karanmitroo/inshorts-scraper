Members of a group called the Arekatika Porata Samithi have filed a complaint with the Hyderabad police against Baahubali 2 director SS Rajamouli. The complaint was filed over a dialogue that allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Katika community. The group claims that the dialogue "Katika cheekati", is a 'caste slur' and was 'humiliating their community name'.
