Actor Dwayne Johnson choked up while sharing a video message for a 13-year-old terminally-ill fan from Hawaii, US. "I wish we could hang out and talk like your wish was... [Y]ou're... one of the most amazing kids... I've ever spoken to," said Dwayne. "You are stronger than I will ever be... You inspire every single person around you," he added.
