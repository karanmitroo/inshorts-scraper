Music composer-singer Bappi Lahiri has said that the songs these days are just like a one-day cricket match while the songs from the golden era were the test match. Bappi added, "The lyrics which we had before we don't have that anymore...We are not going on wordings nowadays." He further said that people can't remember lyrics of songs today.
