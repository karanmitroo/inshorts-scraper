Vindoo Dara Singh has lost out on some big films, including the Salman Khan-starrer 'Kick' and Sajid Khan's 'Humshakals', owing to his tryst with the betting world. "I had an important role in 'Kick' but Salman and Sajid felt that if I got into more legal trouble the film would suffer," Vindoo explained.
