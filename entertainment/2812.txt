Jacqueline Fernandez has said that she can't stop working with certain people because of link-up rumours with them. "It's important to continue working with them because you know yourself that they (rumours) are not true," added Jacqueline. She further said, "You can't do according to what people say about you...because that would be the wrong way to lead your life."
