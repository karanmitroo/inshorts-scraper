The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to grant a stay on the arrest of singer-composer Vishal Dadlani, for allegedly hurting sentiments of the Jain community with his tweets on monk Tarun Sagar. He has been asked to approach the High Court instead. Dadlani had earlier created a controversy by tweeting about Sagar, who addressed the Haryana Assembly in the nude.
