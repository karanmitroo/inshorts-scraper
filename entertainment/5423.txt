Over one lakh votes were received in an online poll, beating the challenge by Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani over the word 'intercourse' used in teaser of Jab Harry Met Sejal (JHMS). He said that he would clear the word if he received one lakh votes from the public. Pahlaj added he would consider votes from only married people.
