Hollywood actress Julia Roberts on Thursday walked the red carpet at the 69th Cannes Film Festival completely barefoot. The 48-year-old actress made her debut appearance at Cannes, wearing a black Armani prive gown. She was promoting her upcoming film 'Money Monster'. Last year, festival organizers had allegedly turned away some women from a film screening for not wearing "high heels".
