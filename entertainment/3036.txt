Actor Varun Sharma, who made his Bollywood acting debut with 'Fukrey', has said he decided to became an actor after watching Shah Rukh Khan dance to the song 'Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhen' from 'Baazigar'. Varun added, "I went up to my mother and told her that I wanted to become an actor. She told me, 'Beta, jo banna hai ban'."
