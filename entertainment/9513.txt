Universal Pictures has cancelled the premiere of 'A Dog's Purpose' amid controversy surrounding a video which shows a German Shepherd being forced to perform in artificial rapids on the film's set. The move follows animal rights group PETA calling for the film's boycott. PETA also called upon the director and producer to pledge never to use animals in films again.
