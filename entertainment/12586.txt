Actress Sonakshi Sinha has said that "there are many who have not made it" in Bollywood despiteâ€‹ being sons and daughters of stars. She added that being a star kid helps initially in establishing contact with people, for a first meeting or an audition. "After that, it depends on your own hard work and talent," said Sonakshi.
