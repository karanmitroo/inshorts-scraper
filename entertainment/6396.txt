Novelist Twinkle Khanna, while speaking about accusations of using a ghost writer for her novels, said that just because she's from Bollywood and her name is Twinkle doesn't mean she can't spell. "There's a perception that if you are in Hindi films you have no brains," added Twinkle. She further said that being well-read isn't a skill required in Bollywood.
