The Shia LeBeouf starrer 'Man Down', which released on March 31, has earned only £7 (₹567 approximately) in its opening weekend in UK. The film was only shown in one cinema hall before being given a Video on Demand release. Senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian wrote, "Poor Shia... That opening could be in the Guinness World Records or something."
