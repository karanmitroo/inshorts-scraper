Suniel Shetty has said that after doing 126 films, one can't say that he has not been doing that many films while adding, "I did an overdose of cinema." Suniel further said, "I needed to take a break...to focus on my children. Athiya and Ahan's careers are more important to me." Suniel will complete 25 years in Bollywood this year.
