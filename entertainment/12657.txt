Indian columnist and novelist Shobhaa De has said that she never responds "to other people's tweets - be it an Amitabh Bachchan or a nobody". Earlier, Shobhaa had been criticised for her tweet slamming Indian athletes at Rio Olympics. She added, "I don't get intimidated by anybody or anything. The recent controversy included. Twitter wars are a waste of time."
