Model-actress Sonal Sehgal, while speaking about the time she endorsed a fairness soap, said she failed millions of "beautiful dark skinned women across the country". "Without... realising I had become part of a mafia undermining the self-esteem of beautiful dusky Indian women," she wrote in a Facebook post. Sonal further wrote she feels responsible for letting racism continue in society.
