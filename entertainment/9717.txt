A distributor in Mumbai has claimed that he has received threat letters from Shiv Sena's Chhattisgarh wing over the release of Shah Rukh Khan's upcoming film 'Raees', which also stars Pakistani actress Mahira Khan. The letter asks distributors to oppose the film's release.  The distributor tagged Chattisgarh CM Raman Singh on Twitter, seeking his intervention into the matter.
