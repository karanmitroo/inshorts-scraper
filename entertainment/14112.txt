Actress Zareen Khan has said that she does not know the meaning of "item songs" and why the term 'item' is used, while adding that such songs should be called “promotional or special". "People tend to like these special songs added in films so I guess it’s great,” added Zareen, who featured in the song 'Khallas' from 'Veerappan'.
