Communist Party of India-Marxist leader MA Baby on Wednesday said Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali will be performing in Kerala in January at programmes organised by 'Swaralaya'. "We have... called upon the various political parties and social organisations to support the programmes", Baby said. Earlier, Shiv Sena's protests had led to the cancellation of Ali's concerts in Mumbai and Pune.
