Pakistan's Central Board of Film Censors' Chairperson Mobashir Hasan said that the upcoming Bollywood film 'M.S.Dhoni: The Untold Story' has not been banned in Pakistan and claimed that it was never submitted for certification. "The Indian media is portraying it wrongly... We haven't been instructed to ban or censor films in the context of the hostile situation," said another spokesperson.
