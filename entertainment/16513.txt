Actor Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira Rajput, who got married on July 7, made their first official public appearance on Friday by walking the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week 2015 to support their designer friend Masaba Gupta. The couple walked hand-in-hand, wearing colour co-ordinated outfits. They made an entry before the show. However, they quickly settled down.
