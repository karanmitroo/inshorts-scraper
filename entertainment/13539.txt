Actor Salman Khan has said that the rising prices of tickets will "destroy" the Hindi film industry due a reduction in "footfalls". "We have not been able to pull off a 300, 200 and even a 100 crore on a 250, 650 or 950 rupee ticket", added Salman. He furtherâ€‹ said that it is the film's ultimate collections that matter.
