Vivek Oberoi, at a recent press meet, made a reference to the 2003 press conference wherein he accused Salman Khan of threatening to kill him over 41 phone calls. "When I held a press conference last time, my a** was on fire...whoever hasn't understood this is a tubelight," said Vivek. He was reportedly dating Salman's rumoured ex-girlfriend Aishwarya Rai then.
