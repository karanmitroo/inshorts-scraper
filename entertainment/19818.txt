Imran launched a qawaali from Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobara on Friday at the famous Mohammed Ali Road. Earlier the song was going to be launched mid July but Imran requested to pre-pone the launch as on July 10, Ramzaan starts and hence it would not be apt to launch the song at that point in time.
