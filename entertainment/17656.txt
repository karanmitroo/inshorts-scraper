Reacting to the controversy surrounding AIB Roast, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali has called Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor 'idiots' saying, "Stars don't behave like this." Bhansali added, "Don’t be a 'chichora'...being a public figure, you should know how to conduct yourself." Earlier, Shah Rukh Khan also said, "When you're popular, people listen to you…so, you need to 'relook' at it."
