Director R Balki, while reacting to Sidharth Malhotra's remark opposing 'Aiyaary' and his directorial PadMan's release date clash, said, "I don't know what he is so irritated about." He further said, "We moved (the film) on humanitarian grounds, and not because we wanted to clash with Aiyaary once again." Notably, both 'Aiyaary' and 'PadMan' will release on February 9.
