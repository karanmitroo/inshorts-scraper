The release date for the Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Raees' has been postponed to January 26, 2017. It had originally been planned for an Eid release this year. "A film of such magnitude requires the appropriate showcasing," said the producers on the date shift. Notably, this will make Salman Khan starrer 'Sultan' a solo release on Eid this year.
