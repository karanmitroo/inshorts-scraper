Actress Kangana Ranaut, who had signed Sujoy Ghoshâ€™s next flick 'Durga Rani Singh', has reportedly walked out of the film because she wants to slow down. Now that Ranaut is no more in picture for the 'Durga Rani Singh' project, reports suggest that the Kahaani director is in talks with actress Kareena Kapoor.
