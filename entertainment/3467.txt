Sanjay Dutt has revealed that while shooting for the song 'Tamma Tamma Loge' with Madhuri Dixit for the 1990 film 'Thanedaar', he was very nervous because he dances like a crow. Sanjay added, "To perfect the steps, I rehearsed for 16 days straight." He further said that even after practising he was apprehensive to perform but he finally did it.
