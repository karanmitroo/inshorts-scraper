Canadian-American actress Pamela Anderson has revealed that as a kid she was molested by a female babysitter and raped by her friend’s 25-year-old brother when she was 12. “I had a hard time trusting humans”, she said speaking at the Cannes Film Festival during her animal rights foundation’s launch. Anderson added, she “couldn't bear to” tell her already ‘distraught’ mother.
