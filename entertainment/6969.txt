Cambodian actress Denny Kwan has been banned from making new films for a year after her "refusal to curb her sexy clothing style". She was ordered to be 're-educated' by the Culture and Fine Arts Ministry for violating a code of conduct. "[I]t's my right to dress how I want, but our culture, Cambodian people, cannot accept it," said Denny.
