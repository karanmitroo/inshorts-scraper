Novelist Twinkle Khanna took to social media to share a picture of an 'All About My Mom' activity sheet, in which her daughter Nitara asked her teacher to write that her mother is 60. Reacting to this, Twinkle wrote, "God help me," in a part of the caption with the picture. Four-year-old Nitara is Akshay and Twinkle's second child.
