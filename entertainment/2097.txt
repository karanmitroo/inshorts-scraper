Former singer Melissa Schuman has accused Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter of raping her when she was 18. She claims that in the name of 'casual hangout', Carter forced her to perform oral sex before raping her. "I told him that I was a virgin and I didn't want to have sex...(but) he was relentless," wrote Schuman in her blog.
