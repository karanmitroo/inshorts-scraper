Veteran singer Asha Bhosle (81) has been declared the greatest Bollywood playback artist of all time by the UK-based Eastern Eye newspaper. Asha, while thanking the newspaper, said,“I thought being called the greatest was the prerogative of boxer Muhammad Ali.” Bharat Ratna awardee Lata Mangeshkar stood second in the list of talented singers, followed by Mohd Rafi and Kishore Kumar.
