After a stunning performance in 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', actor Farhan Akhtar will be seen playing an Anti Terrorist Squad cop in his next film, 'Wazir'. This character required him to be lean and at the same time muscular. The actor went through months of training to get the right look. He was also on a strict diet.
