Actor Akshay Kumar has denied reports of quitting the biopic titled 'Mogul', based on the founder of the T-Series music label Gulshan Kumar, who was shot dead in 1997. Reports had suggested that Akshay quit the film over creative differences with director Subhash Kapoor. "Once the script is finalised, we will proceed with planning and scheduling the shoot," said Akshay.
