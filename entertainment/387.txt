Vidya Balan has revealed she lied to her sister about the ending of her 2012 film 'Kahaani'. "People who were approached for 'Kahaani' weren't told about the twist. Only director Sujoy Ghosh, me, the cinematographer, and the ADs knew about it. We kept it a secret," she added. Vidya further said 'Kahaani' is one of her best performances to date.
