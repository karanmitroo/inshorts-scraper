An injured kitten in New York has been renamed Hugh Jackman after it recovered quickly, similar to 'Wolverine', a superhero character played by Jackman. "He's incredibly resilient. You could call him a superhero cat," said a doctor at the animal care centre. The six-month-old kitten was found three weeks ago with burns over its body and four teeth missing.
