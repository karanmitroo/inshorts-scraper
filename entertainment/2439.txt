Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan donated free meals to 1,000 school children for a year on the occasion of her 44th birthday last week. She sponsored the meals under a mid-day meal scheme run by the Annamrita Foundation, set up by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). The scheme serves meals to 12 lakh children across seven states in India.
