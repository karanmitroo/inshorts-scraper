Actor Ajay Devgn, has said he agrees with filmmaker Rohit Shetty's statement that 'Golmaal Returns' was "crap", as compared to the other films in the 'Golmaal' series. "We got a little carried away in 'Golmaal 2'. There were some dialogues, which were not suited for the kind of the genre we were following. So, second was the weakest," Devgn added.
