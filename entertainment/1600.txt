Pakistani actress Mahira Khan has said she has become more cautious after the pictures of her smoking with Ranbir Kapoor in New York surfaced online. Talking about being judged for smoking and wearing a dress, she added, "You can have an 'I don't care attitude' which most of the time I feel like but yes, of course, it affects you."
