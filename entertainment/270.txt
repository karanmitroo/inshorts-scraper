Singer Papon, while addressing the controversy around him kissing an 11-year-old female contestant of a reality show, wrote on social media, "It is just a case of faulty camera angles...an accidental move and not a sexual assault as being reported." Papon added, "There is a little girl involved...Both of our families are being destroyed forever, by people jumping to conclusions."
