Responding to Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani's legal notice which claimed he was defamed at IIFA awards, the organisers have said it was a misunderstanding. "Pahlaj ji will get a better understanding...once he sees the show. We've always respected Pahlaj ji," they added. The notice said Pahlaj's picture was used inappropriately and he was called a 'watchman' during the show.
