As many as seven people were booked for allegedly "disrespecting the national anthem" at a Chennai cinema hall, police said on Monday. The offenders were allegedly taking selfies when the National Anthem was being played. "They started verbally abusing us...and began hitting us when we said it was our right to not stand for the anthem," an accused said.
