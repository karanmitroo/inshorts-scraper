Actor Akshay Kumar, while speaking about his films during his initial days in Bollywood, said he felt brain-dead doing action films. "I got pigeonholed into the action image. It was mind-numbing to come to the sets every day and begin punching and kicking," he added. Akshay further said things have changed now and he is not seeking a particular image.
