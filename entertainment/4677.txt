Filmmaker James Cameron is set to make a documentary titled 'Titanic: 20th Anniversary', twenty years after Titanic's release in 1997, to evaluate the film's accuracy. Cameron said, "When I wrote the film...I wanted every detail to be as accurate...now...with the latest research, science, and technology, I'm going to reassess." The documentary will air on National Geographic in December this year.
