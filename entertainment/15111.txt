American actor George Clooney's wife Amal, who is a lawyer by profession, has received death threats. The 38-year-old's security cover has reportedly been boosted and she has been provided with full-time bodyguards. Amal is currently representing jailed former president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, who was the first democratically-elected president of the country in 2008.
