A new advertisement for Apple Music features rapper Drake in the gym lip-syncing to singer Taylor Swift's song 'Bad Blood'. While Drake works out, he messes up and drops a heavy-weight exercising equipment on his ribs, where Apple calls its music service "distractingly good". Notably, Drake has broken several records with his songs exclusively launched on Apple Music.
