Reacting to the threats for banning the film 'Padmavati', the Bombay High Court stated that this was "a censorship of a different kind". The bench of judges added, "Such open threats are being televised publically. Nothing is being done about them... We can no longer take pride in the fact that we are the world's largest democracy."
