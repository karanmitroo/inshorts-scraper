Actor Sidharth Malhotra has shared a video of himself where he is seen copying Sunny Deol's dance step from the Yaara O Yaara song, which featured in the 1996 film Jeet. Sidharth captioned the video, "Move like Sunny Deol paahji in Betaab valley in #Kashmir." Notably, Betaab valley reportedly got its name as Sunny's debut film Betaab was shot there.
