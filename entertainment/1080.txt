TV actress Divyanka Tripathi's husband TV actor Vivek Dahiya and the crew of a horror show were attacked during a shoot by some drunk men with swords. The miscreants were later arrested. "It's making me wonder what kind of security measures are taken while... in outdoor locations...we had four security guards (but) they were the first to run," said Dahiya.
