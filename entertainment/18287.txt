Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan Monday saluted the way contemporary Indian films are breaking away from stereotypes and are portraying different shade of female characters. "Whereas a typical westernised women was considered a vamp a few decades ago, associated with vice and venom, today films show women in western designer clothes. This is part of India's globalisation," he said.
