While defending actress Kajol, who was trolled on social media for her "selfie" with Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan, Haasan tweeted, "Please spare Kajolji." Twitter users had pointed out that the photo Kajol shared didn't qualify as a selfie. Kamal added, "I (am) not a fan of selfies. Though I'm a fan of them both. Troll not a kind (gesture)."
