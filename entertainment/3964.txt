Ajay Devgn, whose upcoming film 'Sons Of Sardaar' is based on the Battle of Saragarhi, has said Salman Khan is not making a film on the same subject. "I am making the film for sure...(it) will be made on a very big scale," added Devgn. He further said that he will need at least two years to complete the film.
