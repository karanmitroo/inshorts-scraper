Rabiya Khan, the mother of late actress Jiah Khan, has moved the Supreme Court by filing for a Special Leave Petition challenging Bombay High Court's order against further investigation into her daughter's death case. She had previously challenged CBI's charge sheet terming Jiah's death as suicide and not homicide. Rabiya had accused actor Sooraj Pancholi of murdering Jiah.
