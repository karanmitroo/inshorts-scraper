Actress Alia Bhatt has said that Sidharth Malhotra is a better kisser than Arjun Kapoor. "I have kissed Arjun in only one film (2 States), but I have kissed Sid in two (Student Of The Year, Kapoor & Sons). So I have had more practice with him," said Alia. The actress made the comments on '#NoFilterNeha', Neha Dhupia's audio show.
