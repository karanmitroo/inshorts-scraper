Actor Rajkummar Rao, while speaking about sexual harassment, said, "It is very important to voice out your opinion if you are a victim because silence will only empower such predators." "You can put up a post on social media and people will support you," he added. Rao further said sexual harassment exists everywhere and not only in the film industry.
