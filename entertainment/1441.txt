While sharing an old picture with Shah Rukh Khan on Instagram where they can be seen at a gym, filmmaker Karan Johar wrote, "When SRK tried his level best to train me in 2009! #fitnessthrowback." Johar's fitness consultant Kunal Gir had earlier revealed that the filmmaker had lost 17 kilograms in 4 months post the birth of his twins.
