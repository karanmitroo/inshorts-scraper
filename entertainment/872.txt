Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that politicians putting films over economic and social issues is ridiculous. "Sometimes the main papers and politicians don't talk about them because they are focused on a film," he added. Recalling the time when he was slammed for casting a Pakistani actor, Johar further said, "Culture and patriotism are thrown at the artistes."
