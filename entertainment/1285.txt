Three hundred Hollywood celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep, have launched a campaign named 'Time's Up' to battle sexual harassment. It has reportedly already raised $13 million towards a legal defense fund to help survivors of sexual harassment. The initiative also requests women walking the Golden Globes red carpet to wear black as a way to speak against inequality.
