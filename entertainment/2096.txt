While talking about working in women-centric films, Irrfan Khan said that he doesn't mind if the film or his character is ruled by a woman. Irrfan added, "Had my character been any lesser than a male character in the film, I would have still thought about it." He further said one doesn't see a lot of female-oriented good scripts.
