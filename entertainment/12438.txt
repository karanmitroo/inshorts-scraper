Actor and filmmaker James Franco has said the prospect of having Donald Trump as the US President is "scary". However, Franco added that an actor's political opinion on a reality television star running for President is not significant. The 38-year-old actor made these comments at France's Deauville Film Festival, where he is presenting his film 'In Dubious Battle'.
