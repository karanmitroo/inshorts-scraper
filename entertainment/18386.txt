The Greek god of Bollywood, Hrithik Roshan said Friday that he was proud of his 'Bang Bang' success. "That is so cool. Opening higher than a franchise film like Krrish 3 and beating my own record is one way to realise my own growth and strength..I'm just glad I've been able to entertain my audience," he said.
