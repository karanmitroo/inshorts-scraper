Actor Ranveer Singh has said that he is sh*t scared as he is playing an anti-hero in his upcoming film 'Padmavati'. "For a mainstream leading man to make a choice like this at this stage is dicey. It's a despicable character," he added. Ranveer further said, "If [the audience] hates my character, the hate will be transferred to me."
