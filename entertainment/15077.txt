Actor Amitabh Bachchan has shared pictures of him walking the streets of Delhi without anyone noticing him. The 73-year-old star shared his experience in his official blog attributing a training mask, which covered half of his face, as a reason for him going around unrecognised. Bachchan was in Delhi to shoot for his upcoming film, 'Te3n'.
