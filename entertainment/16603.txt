Amitabh Bachchan, who played the role of Jai in 'Sholay', has said that he was more interested in playing the role of 'Gabbar'. "I actually wanted to play Gabbar, but casting Amjad was Salim-Javedâ€™s idea. When we started shooting, I got along very well with Amjad...", he said. Sholay, which was released in Aug 1975, will turn 40 on Saturday.
