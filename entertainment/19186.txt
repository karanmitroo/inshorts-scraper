Suraj Pancholi (22), son of actor Aditya Pancholi, has been charged by Mumbai Police with abetting Jiah Khan's suicide in a 500 page charge-sheet. Suraj, the last person Jiah spoke to before committing suicide last June, was jailed for some weeks after her death. Bombay HC had ordered further investigation into Jiah's death following her mother Rabiya Khan's petition.
