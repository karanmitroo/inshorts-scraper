Actress Sharmila Tagore has penned an open letter to Indian men as part of 'Let's talk about rape' initiative, wherein she wrote, "Violence and rape have nothing to do with sex... (but) about wanting to humiliate a woman and teach her... a lesson." She further wrote, "We are not... the second half or even the better half. We are equal."
