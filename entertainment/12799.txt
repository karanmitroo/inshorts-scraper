Choreographer-turned-filmmaker Farah Khan has said that she is 'flawsome' to show her support for the '#IAMFLAWSOME' campaign by MTV. The campaign aims at encouraging people to accept and celebrate their flaws. "Everyone has flaws. We are only human after all. But what’s important is, we don’t let our flaws stand in the way of what we can achieve," said Farah.
