South Indian filmmaker SS Rajamouli on Sunday revealed on Twitter that the third installment of the 'Bahubali' franchise is "on cards". "But the story thatâ€™s written for the two parts will not be dragged for the sake of it. This story will conclude with the second part itself", Rajamouli tweeted. Meanwhile, 'Bahubali 2' is scheduled for release in 2016.
