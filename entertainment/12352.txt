Actor and model Milind Soman has said that the society, not just in India but globally, is fuelling this myth that men are smarter than women. He spoke about how phone companies refused to sponsor the marathon 'Pinkathon' as they believe that "women don't buy phones themselves and don't understand technology". Soman added, "Women are told they are second-class citizens."
