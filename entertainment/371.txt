Talking about the domestic box office success of 'Padmaavat' which has earned ₹276.50 crore, actor Ranveer Singh has said that it is not new for his rumoured girlfriend Deepika Padukone to see her films notch such numbers. He added, "However, I'm very happy that Sanjay (Leela Bhansali) Sir and I are able to notch our first ₹200-crore film together."
