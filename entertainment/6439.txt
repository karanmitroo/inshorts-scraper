Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that he had refused to act when he was first approached for his biopic 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams' in 2012. "When Ravi (Bhagchandka, producer) met me...my first reply was, 'But I am not going to act'. I continue to be slightly uncomfortable...That's why I have got other guys to talk about me," said Sachin.
