Hollywood director James Toback, while denying allegations of sexual harassment against him, said anyone who had accused him of such behaviour was either "a lying cocks****r or c**t or both." "Anyone who says that, I just want to spit in his or her f***ing face," he added. Toback further said, "I find it offensive and insulting and disgusting."
