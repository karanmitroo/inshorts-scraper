American singer Patti Smith forgot the lyrics of Bob Dylan's song 'A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall', during a performance to mark his Nobel for literature at the awards ceremony in Stockholm on Saturday. "I apologise. I'm sorry, I'm so nervous,' Smith said, further asking if she could restart. The audience clapped in support as Smith performed the song's verse again.
