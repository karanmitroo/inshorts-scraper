Indian-origin actor Kal Penn has shared scripts he received during his early days as an actor in Hollywood, where he was offered roles to play snake charmers and fire-eaters or even a 'Gandhi lookalike'. For a character called 'Careem', Kal was asked if he could make his accent "more authentic". Twitter users slammed the roles as racist stereotypes of Indians.
