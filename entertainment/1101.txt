Vikram Bhatt directorial '1921', which released on Friday, "is a routine horror drama that offers nothing new," wrote Bollywood Hungama. Times Now wrote that the film "redefines vintage horror." Firstpost wrote, "Vikram Bhatt adds every horror trope to this ghastly film, but none of them work." It has been rated 1.5/5 (Firstpost) and 2/5 (Bollywood Hungama, Times Now).
