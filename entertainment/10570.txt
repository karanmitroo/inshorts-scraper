Actor Manoj Bajpayee has said that Hollywood outsources India's talent, especially when it comes to making good animation films, as the talent is not being used and respected in the country. "In India, we don't have that much patience when it comes to animation," said Bajpayee while adding that this is why Indian animation studios are mainly working for Hollywood.
