Filmmaker Leena Yadav, who directed Radhika Apte starrer 'Parched', will direct actor Rishi Kapoor in her next film 'Rajma Chawal'. "The idea behind the film is to illustrate how everything happens over the mobile phone today....(which) affects parent-children relationships," added Leena. Rishi Kapoor will play debutant actor Anirudh Tanwar's father in the film, which will also star Amyra Dastur.
