Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has said that the return of 'Sex and the City' remains a "possibility". "I don't think any of us have said no... I think that remains an open question and discussion that will continue until it's been resolved," said Parker. She added that she is unsure if it will return as "a series or the movie".
