Rapper Hard Kaur has said that simply rhyming words like 'hat' with 'cat' isn't rapping. She added, "It's also about how much courage you have to go all out." She further said that in India, it doesn't matter how talented you are, and added, "It's always about tera baap kaun hai (who is your father?), and who are you dating?"
