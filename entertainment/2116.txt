The Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the organisers of International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2017 to screen 'S Durga', overruling the decision of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to cancel its screening. S Durga's director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan had moved the Kerala High Court after the film was dropped without consulting the jury, which initially selected it.
