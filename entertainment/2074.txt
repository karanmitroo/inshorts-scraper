Comedian Kapil Sharma has said that he is not business-minded as a producer, which he was supposed to be while making 'Firangi'. "Focusing on...elaboration of beauty, we didn't realise...(that) the shooting schedule got extended than usual. Therefore, the budget also," added Kapil. He further said that he enjoys storytelling and creativity, but is not great with finance management.
