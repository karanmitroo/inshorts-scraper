Actress Charlize Theron on Monday named racism as one of the underlying causes of the HIV epidemic at the International Aids Conference in Durban. "HIV the virus doesn’t know the difference between black skin and white skin and when we look at how it’s so disproportionately affected people, we have to look at the racial issue," said Theron.
