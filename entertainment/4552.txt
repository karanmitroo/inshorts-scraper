Actress Swara Bhasker, while addressing pay disparity in Bollywood, has said that if as an actress, she works for as many days as an actor, then she should also expect an equal amount of pay. Swara added, "If you see in Hollywood, women are taking up this whole question of equality... so why can't Bollywood take its cue from them?"
