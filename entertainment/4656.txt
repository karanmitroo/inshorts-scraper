Varun Dhawan, when asked what advice he would like to give to Arjun Kapoor, said he should stop behaving like he has been in the industry for 100 years. He said this on Neha Dhupia's talk show. While imitating Arjun, he added, "Haan kaise ho, Haan Neha, aao aao...he talks like Lala from that scene of Mother India...Aao Birju aao".
