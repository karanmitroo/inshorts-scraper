Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie will direct a film titled 'Africa', based on Kenyan conservationist Richard Leakey's battles with ivory poachers. According to Jolie, the film is about "a man drawn into the violent conflict with elephant poachers, who emerged with a deeper understanding of man's footprint and a profound sense of responsibility for the world around him".
