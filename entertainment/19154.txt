Actress Parineeti Chopra was spotted in a see-through dress at a promotion event of her latest movie 'Hasee Toh Phasee'. The actress, who was accompanied by her co-star Sidharth Malhotra and director Karan Johar, not only revealed her slim figure but also exposed her undergarments. Last year, Bipasha Basu was seen in a transparent dress at Dabboo Ratnani's calendar launch.
