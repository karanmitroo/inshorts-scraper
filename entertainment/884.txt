The Supreme Court has rejected pleas by the governments of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh seeking a modification of its order which lifted the ban on 'Padmaavat' in four states. It added that the court's orders must be obeyed by the states. "Don't watch if you don't want to but there can't be a ban on the screening," the court added.
