Pakistani journalist Chand Nawab who shot to fame after the release of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' has sought a compensation for using a character in their film which was inspired from him. "It’s just a request, I’m not going to sue them... If they decide to give it, then good, otherwise it’s not a problem," Nawab said calling himself a 'poor journalist'.
