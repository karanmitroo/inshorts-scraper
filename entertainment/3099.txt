A woman, who has claimed to be singer Aditya Narayan's college batchmate, tweeted that he was suspended from college for a week for misbehaving with the security guards. "Old habits die hard," she added. A video which surfaced online recently showed Aditya abusing the staff of an airline while saying, "Teri chaddi nahi utari, mera naam Aditya Narayan nahi."
