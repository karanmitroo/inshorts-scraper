Zoya Akhtar directorial venture 'Dil Dhadakne Do', featuring Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh, Farhan Akhtar and Anushka Sharma, released this Friday. Dil Dhadakne Do is a treat for the eyes with rich performances and cinematography, but it is the pace of the story which distracts the audience, India Today says. It has been rated 2/5 (HT), 2.5/5 (NDTV) and 4/5 (TOI).
