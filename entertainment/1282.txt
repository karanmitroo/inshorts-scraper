Riteish Deshmukh has revealed that Genelia D'Souza, who's his wife now, didn't talk to him for two days during the shooting of 'Tujhe Meri Kasam' as his father was the CM of Maharashtra then. "The first thing Genelia asked me was - 'where's your security?' I replied  - 'I don't have any'," Riteish added. The film marked their Bollywood debut.
