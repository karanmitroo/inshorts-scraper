Actor Ranbir Kapoor, while reacting to the criticism that rumoured girlfriend Mahira Khan has received for smoking and wearing a dress, said both smoking and hate are injurious to health. "I've gotten to know Mahira in a personal capacity over the last few months. It is very unfair the way she is being judged...because she is a woman," he added.
