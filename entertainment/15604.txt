The romantic musical film 'Jugni' which released on Friday has a soul along with songs, wrote Indian Express. "Despite its freshness, the film fails to create an impact", said TOI. "Jugni is a simple, heartfelt tale filmed with skill", said NDTV. The film, starring newcomer Siddhanth Behl and Sugandha Garg, has been rated 2.5/5 (Indian Express, TOI) and 3/5 (NDTV).
