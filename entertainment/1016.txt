Sonam Kapoor has said she would love to star in the remake of Dev Anand's 1965 film 'Guide' as it is one of her favourite classics. She added, "Rosie from Guide is such a fantastic character. She's strong, feminine, lovely...all at the same time." Sonam further said Waheeda Rehman, who played Rosie's character, was excellent in the film.
