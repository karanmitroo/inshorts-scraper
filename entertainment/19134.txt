Owing to countless grabbing and groping by fans, the Justin Bieber waxwork figure at Madame Tussauds (New York) had to be withdrawn from display. The organizers said that photographs by thousands of fans took a toll on the dummy. General Manager, Bret Pidgeon, said they hoped to welcome a new ‘grown-up’ Justin back to the attraction in the near future.
