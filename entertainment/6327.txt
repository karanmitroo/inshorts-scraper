Director Kabir Khan, while talking about Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit's onscreen bond, has said, "Let's call it evolution; Madhuri has been replaced by Matin (the child actor in Tubelight) now!" He added that it was a coincidence that the slingshot scene with Madhuri Dixit in Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! was recreated with Matin in Tubelight.
