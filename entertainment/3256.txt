Salman Khan has jokingly said he doesn't want to do the reality show 'Bigg Boss' but the channel Colors doesn't get TRPs without him so they keep getting him back. Salman added, "I...like hosting Bigg Boss. I started with the fourth or fifth part...now I have come till eleventh. Let's see how many years we can drag this show."
