Television channel SAB TV has partnered with Twitter India to create mini-TV series 'Khidki' from content generated on the micro-blogging site. The channel will run an online campaign, '#TweetAFunnyStory', wherein users on Twitter will be invited to share their real life stories. These stories will later be shortlisted by the showâ€™s producers, and telecast as an episodic series on SAB.
