Dalit student groups vandalised the Censor Board's regional office in Hyderabad while demanding certification for release of Telugu film 'Sharanam Gachchami'. Earlier, the film's director Enumula Prem Raj said, "The film has dialogues referring to suicide of University of Hyderabad research scholar Rohith Vemula... Maybe that's why Censor Board officials refused to issue a certificate to my film."
