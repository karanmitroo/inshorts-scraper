Vidya Balan has said that after the 2012 film 'Kahaani', none of her films have worked at the box office. "It's not a sequel, so that takes half the pressure off. If we had come up with the film right after Kahaani, there would have been a lot more pressure," said Vidya talking about her upcoming film  'Kahaani 2' in an interview.
