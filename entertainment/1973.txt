'S Durga' director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan, in a Facebook post, wrote he's disappointed by the dirty game played by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry against his film. He added, "(Those in power) can even...ignore judiciary for their purpose." The film was not screened at International Film Festival of India despite Kerala High Court's order to the organisers to screen it.
