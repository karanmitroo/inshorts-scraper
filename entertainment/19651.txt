Bollywood songs and dance numbers featuring 'vulgar' content have been semi-banned from television channels. The Central Board of Film Certification said that scenes objectifying women or displaying them suggestively would have to be blurred or pixelated to be appropriate for TV viewing. The first-song to be pixelated is 'Tu Bhi Mood Mein', from Indra Kumar's first-of-its-kind adult comedy 'Grand Masti'.
