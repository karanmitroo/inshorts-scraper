Actress Ileana D'Cruz, on being asked if she is insecure about sharing screen space in multi-starrer films, said that she is not competing with anyone and doesn't like being jealous. "If I'm going to get overshadowed in a film, it's because of something that I haven't done, not because of what the other heroine has done," added Ileana.
