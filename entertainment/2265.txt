Sidharth Malhotra, while talking about his film 'Ittefaq' which is a remake of Rajesh Khanna's 1969 film of the same name, said he was apprehensive about being compared to the actor. "He...left an amazing legacy. I was wondering how...audience would react," added Sidharth. He further said his apprehensions went away when he realised his film is different from the original.
