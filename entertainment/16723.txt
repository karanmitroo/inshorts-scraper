The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) on Sunday lifted the ban on Shah Rukh Khan from entering Wankhede Stadium, which it imposed after his alleged misbehaviour at the ground. The decision to lift the ban was taken at the MCA's managing committee meet. The five-year ban on Khan was imposed in 2012 following his scuffle with security personnel at Wankhede.
