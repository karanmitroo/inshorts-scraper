A video segment from 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' features singer Britney Spears and television host Ellen DeGeneres entering a mall and 'making mischief'. It shows them running a stop sign before entering the mall, asking for 100% discounts, picking up whatever they wish and even sleeping on a bed put on display at a furniture store.
