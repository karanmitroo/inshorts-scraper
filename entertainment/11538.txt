The Soha Ali Khan and Vir Das starrer '31st October' is "unwatchable", wrote India Today. The film "has nothing – neither narrative nor engaging characters—on offer", wrote Indian Express while Hindustan Times called it "an important film, especially when many have gone scot-free in the anti-Sikh riots cases". It was rated 1/5 (India Today), 1.5/5 (Indian Express) and 2.5/5 (HT).
