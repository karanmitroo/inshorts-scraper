Shah Rukh Khan, while responding to a journalist's blog on three consecutive Muslim characters played by him, has asked people not to create a point of view. "I did not even know what my [character's] name was in... Ae Dil Hai Mushkil," he added. He further said an artist's work is to put across entertainment in the best way possible.
