Actor Prakash Raj has said that people have issues with a film being titled 'S Durga' but no problem with stores named Durga Wine and Bar. Earlier, the Censor Board ordered for the film's title to be changed from 'Sexy Durga'. Raj added, "I raise my voice not because I belong to any political party...(but) as an artist...I feel responsible."
