North Korea's former deputy ambassador to London, Thae Yong-ho, who defected to South Korea last year said that the country's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un really didn't like the comedy movie 'The Interview'. The 2014 movie showed the assassination of Kim in North Korea. Interestingly, North Korea allegedly hacked Sony Pictures as it did not want them to release the movie.
