Actress Priyanka Chopra has been slammed for her cover on travel magazine 'Cond√© Nast Traveller'. She can be seen wearing a T-shirt with a quote that suggests that she is not a refugee, immigrant or an outsider but a traveller. The quote has been deemed "insensitive" towards refugees and immigrants and Priyanka has been criticised for "showing off her privileges".
