The CBI has filed a chargesheet against actor Sooraj Pancholi for abetting the alleged suicide of actress Jiah Khan. Notably, the same charge was filed against Pancholi by the Mumbai police which ruled out the allegation of murder. The chargesheet also has the doctor's statement who said Jiah was impregnated by Sooraj and forced to abort multiple times.
