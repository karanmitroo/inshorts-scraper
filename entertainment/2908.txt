Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel, while defending Kangana in the row with Hrithik Roshan, said the joke is on those people who laugh at her. "These small minded people should know Kangana is not here to fight them, she has higher purpose and bigger cause," she added. Rangoli further said that since her childhood, Kangana has fought her battles alone.
