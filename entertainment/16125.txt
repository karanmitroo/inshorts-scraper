Actor Varun Dhawan, who will next be seen in Rohit Shetty's 'Dilwale', has said that he was nervous about doing action sequences in the film. "It's for the first time that I was doing action," Dhawan added. "I wanted to do it myself, but Rohit sir asked me to put pads. Overall, it has been a great experience," Varun said.
