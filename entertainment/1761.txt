Comedian Kapil Sharma, while speaking about the negative reviews for his film 'Firangi', said everyone is a film critic these days. "Maybe someone likes [watching] gandi films and he's wondering what sort of a film this is where the hero doesn't even hold hands with the heroine," he added. However, Kapil further said these things don't intimidate him.
