Actress Ratna Pathak Shah has said patriarchy is hard on men as well as on women which is why there's a need to get rid of it and find new ways of looking at society. She added, "Instances...force a woman to ask for permission. It's not easy to do what you want...when you are financially dependant on the other person."
