Shiv Sena MP Anandrao Adsul has compared Ravindra Gaikwad thrashing an Air India employee with an in-flight incident involving TV show host Kapil Sharma. "Even Kapil Sharma misbehaved on the flight after getting drunk, but no ban imposed on him," Adsul said. Notably, some airlines decided to ban Gaikwad from flying after he hit an Air India staffer with slippers.
