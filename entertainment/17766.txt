Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence has posed nude for the Hollywood issue of Vanity Fair magazine. In the pic, Lawrence can be seen lying nude on her front with a snake crawling over her body. Jennifer "has the perfect combination of strength, sexuality, humour and, above all, tomboy to pull this off", the magazine's fashion and style director Jessica Diehl said.
