Actor Hrithik Roshan, while tweeting on the occasion of Human Rights Day on Sunday, wrote that feminism is a fight for humanity and not a word one should be scared of. "It (Feminism) includes men by way of not demanding but commanding equality. (It's) about recognition of an (individual's) worth regardless of gender, based on merit," added the actor.
