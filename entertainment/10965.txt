A three-month exhibition on musician Taylor Swift has opened in the city of New York. The Taylor Swift Experience, which opened at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles in 2014, displays Swift's Grammy Awards, handwritten lyrics, baby clothes and costumes. "It's basically the story of Taylor Swift and the making of a modern superstar," said Grammy Museum curator Nwaka Onwusa.
