Actress-model Pamela Anderson, while responding to the criticism she received for allegedly blaming victims over the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment row, wrote, "I do NOT wish (to) apologise for what I said." She added, "This is not victim-blaming but looking at the issue from the angle of women being aware of certain problems and how to spot and fight them."
