The University of Glasgow is offering a new day-long open access course which explores deeper meanings from Star Wars. The course, called Star Wars and Philosophy: Destiny, Justice and the Metaphysics of the Force, will be offered on May 4, the Star Wars Day. It'll examine how people can be responsible for actions when destiny is governed by “the Force”.
