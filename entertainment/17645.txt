Director Matthew Vaughn's cheeky endeavour 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is "a spectacle of cartoon violence and irreverent humor", writes IBN Live. The film, starring Colin Firth, Taron Egerton and Samuel L. Jackson, is self-aware of the spy movie clich√©s it plays with, and not a full-on spoof. It's been rated 3.5/5 (IBN Live, DNA), 4/5 (TOI) and 2/5 (Indian Express).
