Akshay Kumar has said during his initial Bollywood days, he was made to feel like an outcast. "While doing a two-hero film, my three-four films didn't work, but his (the other hero) did. We [had] equal roles but he got a suite, I got a single room," he added. Akshay further revealed people's behaviour changed when his films performed well.
