Oscar-winning music composer AR Rahman has released a 19-minute music piece titled "The Flying Lotus" based on the Centre's demonetisation move and its impact on society. Rahman denied any political motive behind the release and said the song doesn't criticise the move and is open to interpretations. "'The Flying Lotus' is an impression of the rise of India," he added.
