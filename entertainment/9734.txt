Former Bigg Boss 10 contestant Swami Om has claimed that he slapped host Salman Khan when he visited the house for the New Year episode. He added there is no video recording of the incident as there are no cameras in the smoking zone. He has also threatened to sabotage the finale if he is not invited to the show.
