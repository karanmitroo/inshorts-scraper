Actor Aamir Khan Thursday said his role in PK was by far the toughest role of his 25-year long career. "I have not blinked in the movie. We had discussed a lot about shaping up my character but we felt every time that something is missing," said Aamir. The film also features Anushka Sharma and Sanjay Dutt in key roles.
