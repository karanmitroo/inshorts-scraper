Actress Sonam Kapoor, while talking about working with filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali again, said, "I don't think I am his kind of actor. That's what it is." "If he thought I suited something, I am sure he'll cast me again," she added. Sonam had made her Bollywood debut with Bhansali's 2007 directorial 'Saawariya'.
