Actor Aamir Khan, while responding to coach PR Sondhi's allegations that the character based on him has been portrayed in a negative light in 'Dangal', said that in every biopic, a little fiction is added. "[B]ut essence of their story is kept intact," added Aamir. Earlier, the Phogat sisters had admitted that the film was 99% true and 1% fiction.
