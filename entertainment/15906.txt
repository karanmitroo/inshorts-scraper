Telugu actor Ranganath, 66, was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his Hyderabad residence on Saturday evening. Though initial reports suggested he died after prolonged illness, rope marks found on his neck have reportedly led the police to suspect suicide. Ranganath worked as a ticket collector before making his acting debut in Budhimantudu (1969). He acted in over 200 films.
