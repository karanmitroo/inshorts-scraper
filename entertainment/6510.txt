Former Bigg Boss contestant Nora Fatehi, who starred in the video of Raftaar's new song Baby Marvake Manegi, said that the song's title is not abusive. Nora added, "Raftaar is a sensible musician and respects women, music and his fans! The title simply means 'baby will get you killed.'" She added that it is ridiculous that some people got offended.
