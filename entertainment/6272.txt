Actress Rebel Wilson has said that she was dropped from Kung Fu Panda 3 after "malicious" magazine articles were published about her in 2015. The actress, who was to play the role of Jack Black's panda love interest, said that she was fired as the film's team thought she had become "too divisive" for a family movie.
