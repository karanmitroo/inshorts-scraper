Actor Ranbir Kapoor revealed in a recent interview that he has a "drinking problem". "I have seen it in my family, I have seen it go the wrong way... When I shoot, when I work, I don’t drink. But when I’m not shooting [I could drink anything]," he said. He also added that draught beer is his favourite drink.
