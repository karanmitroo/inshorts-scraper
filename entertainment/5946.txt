Actor Ali Fazal has said that he will not sacrifice his career in Bollywood for international projects. "Now I have reached a stage in Bollywood where even if I'm not present physically, films are happening," said Fazal. He added that for him, the idea is to open up globally on a world stage rather than it being Hollywood or Bollywood.
