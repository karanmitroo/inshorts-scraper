'Mastizaade', which features  Sunny Leone, Riteish Deshmukh, Tusshar Kapoor and Vir Das, has been cleared with an 'A' certificate. The film was supposed to be released in May this year. However, its release got delayed after it was rejected by the Censor Board for being sexually explicit. The Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, however, passed the film with an 'A' certificate.
