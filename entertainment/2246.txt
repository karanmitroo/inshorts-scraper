Actor Kamal Haasan has said that he will be returning the â‚¹30-crore collected in donations for his political outfit, saying it would be illegal to keep the money without any infrastructure. Adding that this did not mean he won't accept money, he said, "We need to build a strong foundation so that the movement functions well even after me."
