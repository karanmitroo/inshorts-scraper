Singer Palash Sen, the vocalist of the band 'Euphoria', has said that independentâ€‹ music has been sidelined and fails to reach the audience as the film industry blocks slots on every music channel to play movie songs. "By limiting the audience to just film songs, the music companies are forcing audience to listen (to) baseless and meaningless stuff," said Palash.
