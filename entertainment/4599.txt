Kajol, while speaking about Shah Rukh Khan being paired with younger actresses, said it takes someone as special as him to be able to sell as king of romance. "I am not as technical an actor as him," she added. Kajol and SRK have worked together in several films including 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'.
