Salman Khan, while comparing his shooting schedule for Tubelight with a breakup, said, "Even when you breakup with somebody, you cry for maybe 15 minutes, then you are like 'next.'" Salman added he is normally 'what next' after a shot is done, but during Tubelight's shoot, tears just kept on coming out. He called Tubelight most tiring film he's done.
