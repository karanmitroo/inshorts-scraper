Pahlaj Nihalani has said he was bullied by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry into taking decisions during his tenure as the chief of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). Talking about the 'Padmavati' row, Nihalani added, "The Parliamentary committee has every right to question Bhansali or any other filmmaker. But only after the CBFC views and certifies the film."
