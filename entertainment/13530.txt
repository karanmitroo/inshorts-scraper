Actor Daniel Radcliffe has confessed that he used to be scared of actor Ralph Fiennes, who played 'Voldemort' in the 'Harry Potter' series, even in real life. â€œ[W]hen I was 15 doing scenes with Ralph for the first time. He was even scarier than Alan (Rickman) was at first.... Ralph genuinely scared me for a few years", Radcliffe said.
