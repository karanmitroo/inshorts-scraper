Rajput organisation Karni Sena has backed Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha in its protest against Kangana Ranaut's 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi'. "Agar Brahmin ka khoon bahega to Rajput kya chup rahega, jab Rajput ka khoon baha to Brahmin kabhi chup nahi raha," said Karni Sena's convenor Lokendra Singh Kalvi. Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha had earlier signed a petition with blood against 'Padmaavat'.
