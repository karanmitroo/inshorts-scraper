Jayan Cherian, the director of 'Ka Bodyscapes', a Malayalam film on homosexuality, has said that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and its chief Pahlaj Nihalani are being unreasonable and refusing certification for his film. Cherian's film was first refused certification in July 2016, following which he has already held four screenings for the CBFC and Nihalani.
