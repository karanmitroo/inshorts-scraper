Following the unveiling of Shah Rukh Khan's dwarf look from 'Zero', Twitter users compared it to 'Game of Thrones' character 'Tyrion Lannister'. "After #Padmavat verdict, SRK named his movie #ZERO so that Censor Board cannot add, subtract, multiply, divide anything," wrote another user. Another comment read, "Zero is...the number of good films he has done in last 5 years."
