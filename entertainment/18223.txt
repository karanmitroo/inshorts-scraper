The People magazine Tuesday named Australian actor and "Thor" avenger Chris Hemsworth as the world's sexiest man alive. The honour was announced on a US TV show hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, and the magazine itself. "I think you've bought me a couple of weeks of bragging rights around the house," the 31-year-old actor said to People magazine.
