Actress Emma Watson dropped off feminist books at various women's memorials on the occasion of International Women's Day. She left books at the memorials of 'female heroes', including Joan of Arc and Eleanor Roosevelt. "Today I'm a red-striking ninja book-fairy out to spread some wise women's words," she wrote while sharing a photo on social media.
