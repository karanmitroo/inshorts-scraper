Actor Akshay Kumar learnt Russian knife fighting ‘Tolpar’ along with Mumbai women police when the trainers were brought for them. This is a form of martial arts which depends more on the quickness and intelligence of the person. Akshay said, "...knife fighting requires intelligence…..women can actually have an edge over men and can save themselves and others with this skill."
