Actress Deepika Padukone, commenting on her accent in the upcoming Hollywood film 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage', has said that it's high time we accept an Indian accent. "And why not? For years, we've accepted the British and Australian accent," the 30-year-old actress added. However, she admitted that "accents matter", and "will happen on project-to-project basis".
