Filmmaker Hansal Mehta has said that connecting Kangana Ranaut's personal issues to a film and its publicity will be trivialising her issues and her courage. Hansal added, "She (Kangana) is only answering the tough questions being posed to her, and she is answering them without flinching." Hansal is the director of Kangana's upcoming film 'Simran'.
