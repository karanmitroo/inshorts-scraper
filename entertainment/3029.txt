Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli shared a screenshot of an email on Twitter, which she claims Hrithik Roshan sent the actress through his iPad. Rangoli also tweeted, "Hrithik gave his laptop for private forensic investigation which he paid for not his iPad... any guesses why?" Hrithik had claimed that Kangana was communicating with a fake ID that used his name.
