Actor Hrithik Roshan Friday registered a complaint with Mumbai Police, alleging that an unidentified person has created a fake email account, hroshan@email.com, and is interacting with his fans. “Hrithik fears his countless innocent and aspiring fans could fall prey to such scams, which can also be misused to exploit them financially. Female followers are most susceptible,” his lawyer said.
