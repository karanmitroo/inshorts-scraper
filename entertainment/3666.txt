Singer Lady Gaga sent free pizza to fans who gathered outside her hotel after she cancelled her Montreal concert, hours before it was supposed to start. She had to cancel it owing to sudden illness because of singing in the rain in an earlier concert. Some of the fans had lined up for nearly eight hours at the concert venue.
