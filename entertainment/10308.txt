Singer Remo Fernandes, who sang the original 'Hamma Hamma' song from the 1995 film 'Bombay', has called 'The Humma Song' from 'OK Jaanu' a "pale, insipid version of the original". Remo added, "Vocally, instrumentally and arrangements-wise, it seems to be a hurried, uninspired job." Sung by Jubin Nautiyal and Shashaa Tirupati, the new version also features rap by Badshah.
