Singer Kimberly Wyatt, who was a member of American girl group 'The Pussycat Dolls', has revealed that the girls were made to look like anorexic aliens by record label executives. "I was so conscious of my weight while in Pussycat Dolls. Record producers constantly watched us to make sure we weren't putting on weight," she added.
