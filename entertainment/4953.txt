The organisers of IIFA 2017 have explained that the makers of the film Dangal did not send in an entry for nominations at the award show. "We would love Dangal to be a part of [the nominations]," said Andre Timmins, the Director of Wizcraft International. He further said the organisers were sad that Dangal's makers didn't send in their entry.
