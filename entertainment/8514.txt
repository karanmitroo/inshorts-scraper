Actor Warren Beatty, while explaining the mistake in announcing 'La La Land' as the Best Picture at Oscars, said he was handed the envelope which had the name of the Best Actress in a Leading Role. "I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land," he added. The Barry Jenkins-directorial 'Moonlight' won Best Picture at Oscars 2017.
