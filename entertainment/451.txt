Hyderabad's Jamia Nizamia seminary has issued a fatwa against the song 'Manikya Malarayi Poovi' from the film 'Oru Adaar Love', featuring Malayalam actress Priya Prakash Varrier. The seminary expressed objection to the references to a love story between Prophet Mohammad and his wife Khadijah Bivi. It has asked the makers to remove the song from the film before its release.
