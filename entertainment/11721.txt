Reacting to Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, a user tweeted, "Bob Dylan's @NobelPrize will put to rest the old argument about whether song lyrics are poetry. They are. Always have been". "Legends of music are not restricted to notes/ lyrics. They are  carriers of faith&hope. Belief in the lyrical journey of life. #BobDylan", tweeted another user.
