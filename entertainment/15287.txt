Actor Salman Khan, who was named Best Actor at the Zee Cine Awards on Saturday, said that awards "don’t hold much importance" in his life. “I don’t want to be nominated. I have been here for 25 years and I think it is time to give the younger generation a chance... We have to encourage them", Salman said.
