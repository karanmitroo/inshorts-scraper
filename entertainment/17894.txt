After delivering two flops, 'Nautanki Saala' and 'Bewakoofiyaan', actor Ayushmann Khurrana said that he's become immune to rejections. "If you don't see rejections and if you don't see ups and downs in your career, there's no fun. I've seen lots of failures in the past, so this (failure of two films) is nothing. I'm happy as an actor," he said.
