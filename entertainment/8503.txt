'The Salesman', the Iranian film by director Asghar Farhadi, was named the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars 2017 on Monday. Farhadi, who didn't attend the ceremony, said, "My absence is out of respect for the people of my country." He described US President Trump's immigration ban as "inhumane". Notably, this is Farhadi's second film to win an Oscar.
