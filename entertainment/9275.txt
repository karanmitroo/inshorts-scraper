Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali has reportedly decided to cancel the shooting of 'Padmavati' in Jaipur and has vowed never to shoot there again. This decision comes a day after Bhansali was physically assaulted and the film sets were vandalised by protestors reportedly from a Rajput organisation. Bhansali is said to have decided to shoot 'Padmavati' in studio sets in Mumbai.
