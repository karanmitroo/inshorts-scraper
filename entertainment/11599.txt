Harshvardhan Kapoor, who made his debut with the recently released film 'Mirzya', has said that the film failed at the box-office as it was "not a film for everybody". "Every film has its own destiny. I feel Mirzya is a work of art," said Harshvardhan while adding that he feels the film "will find its place in course of time".
