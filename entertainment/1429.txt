While talking about his film 'Kedarnath' which will release on the same date as Shah Rukh Khan's film with Aanand L Rai, director Abhishek Kapoor said, "Why call them...clash? Why not see...co-existence of two films." He further said that two films releasing on the same Friday is not uncommon anymore. Notably, 'Kedarnath' will release on December 21, 2018.
