Two weeks after being wrongly crowned as the Miss Universe 2015, Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez has said that the moment was "humiliating". "It will be forever on the video that the Miss Universe was Colombia and I felt the same even though it lasted just three to four minutes. It was a very big injustice", she added.
