Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday, in a veiled referenceâ€‹ to actor Aamir Khan and his comments on intolerance in 2015, said that anyone who speaks against the nation must be "taught a lesson". "That was a very arrogant statement," said Parrikar while adding how the actor and the company he endorsed, which was Snapdeal, faced consequences over the remark.
