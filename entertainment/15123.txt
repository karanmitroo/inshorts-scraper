Australian rock band, 'AC/DC', has rescheduled their tour after lead singer Brian Johnson was advised by doctors to stop touring immediately or risk total hearing loss. The band said that the postponed shows were likely to feature a guest vocalist. Johnson was the vocalist for the album 'Back in Black', which became the second best-selling album of all time.
