Composer Amaal Malik called Sonakshi Sinha's brother Luv Sinha an uncouth idiot, after Luv indirectly accused him of stealing tunes. Amaal wrote in his Facebook post that he has nothing against actors singing for films. However, he and his brother Armaan Malik wanted a better artist to represent the country musically at Justin Bieber's India concert, instead of Sonakshi.
