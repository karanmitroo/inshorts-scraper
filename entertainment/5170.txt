Charlize Theron, while slamming Hollywood for not giving women an opportunity to work with higher budgets, said she is ashamed to be a part of it. "[The industry] has never allowed a woman to work with a budget higher [than Wonder Woman]. That's so caveman-like," she added. Theron further said she hopes the scenario changes with films like 'Wonder Woman'.
