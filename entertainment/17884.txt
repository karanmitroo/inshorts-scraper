New Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that it's time to control the nudity on television and internet. "Nudity is available online and on certain TV programs like live fashion shows. It should be in sync with the rules followed in films. There should be one policy for nudity (portrayal of sex in films)," he added.
