Veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily has said Madhur Bhandarkar's film on 1975-77 Emergency 'Indu Sarkar' will hurt Congressmen's sentiments and that's what PM Narendra Modi wants. "Ultimately, it will (hurt) him (Narendra Modi)... All these ruinous activities help in exit of BJP," he added. Moily further said there's no exit door for Congress but there's always one for BJP.
