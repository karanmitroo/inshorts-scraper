While talking about fringe groups protesting against 'Padmavati', Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that such people should have been locked up. He added, "It's a free country, with free business opportunity for all." Singh further said that the film would not be banned in the state as long as producers ensure that "history is projected in the correct perspective".
