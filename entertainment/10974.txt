Carrie Fisher has admitted that she had an affair with 'Star Wars' co-star Harrison Ford, in her forthcoming book 'The Princess Diarist'. "It was 'Han' and 'Leia' during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend," said Carrie. She was 19 when she signed the first film, while 33-year-old Harrison was married and a father of two.
