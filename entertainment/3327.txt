The Shraddha Kapoor starrer 'Haseena Parkar' which released on Friday, "is a...less internalised performance from Kapoor who...lacks a compelling presence," wrote India Today. NDTV wrote, "Nothing...can salvage this insipid biopic from the morass of mediocrity," while Times of India called the film "a silly costume drama." It was rated 1/5 (India Today), 1.5/5 (NDTV) and 2/5 (TOI).
