Film distributor JP Choksey has said that Salman Khan and his father Salim Khan's initiative to compensate distributors for Tubelight's losses is very noble. "[I]t will set a precedent to all other stars to follow," he added. Choksey further said though Salman's presence saved the film to an extent, it was his submissive characterisation that went completely against his image.
