'Sholay' in its original ending featured the character 'Thakur', played by Sanjeev Kumar, killing the film's villain 'Gabbar', portrayed by Amjad Khan. However, Sholay's director Ramesh Sippy had to change the ending as the Censor Board thought the scene was too 'violent'. The film, which starred Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan, released 42 years ago on August 15, 1975.
