Sussanne Khan, actor Hrithik Roshan's ex-wife, has denied the charges against her in an alleged â‚¹1.87 crore cheating case by a real estate firm calling it "motivated and preposterous". She added that she had initiated arbitration proceedings against the firm to recover her dues. "The said complaint... has been only filed to intimidate... and pressurize me," said Sussanne.
