Actress Malaika Arora has been appointed the ambassador of Indian fashion designer Satya Paul's Spring/ Summer 2017 sari collection. The collection, named 'Bohemian Rhapsody', celebrates the vibrant expressions of street art and the streets it is seen on. "A sari is one of the most elegant and feminine garments. I think it flatters the female form beautifully," said Malaika.
