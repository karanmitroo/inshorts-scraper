Rajkummar Rao has revealed he was never put in the brother zone by any woman whom he liked. "I have seen some of my friends who got into friend zone and brother zone...It's heartbreaking," added Rajkummar. He further said that when he meets a woman for the first time, he doesn't immediately think about making her a sister or lover.
