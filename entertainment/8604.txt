Actor Saif Ali Khan admitted that he contemplated changing the name of his son Taimur following the criticism by people. However, his wife Kareena Kapoor was against it. He further revealed that he drafted a letter but later cancelled the idea as it sounded "pathetic". "I don't want universal approval if it's going to require me to pretend," he said.
