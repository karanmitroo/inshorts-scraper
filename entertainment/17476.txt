Keeping mum for some days, former One Direction member Zayn Malik spoke about his departure for the first time, saying he left as he wanted to lead the normal life of a 22-year-old, out of the spotlight. "And I feel like I'm doing what's right - right by myself and right by the boys, so I feel good", he said.
