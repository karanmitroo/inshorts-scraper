Emraan Hashmi has said that award shows are great for TRPs, however their merit is questionable. "I did go to a couple of award ceremonies when I had just begun my career...When you are a newcomer, it's natural...you want to explore every avenue...this profession has to offer," added Emraan. He further said he believes that awards don't hold any value.
