Filmmaker Ketan Mehta has announced that he will be making an international animated film based on author Rudyard Kipling's novel 'Kim'. The film, which will be available​ in Hindi and English, will revolve around a child and his adventures. "It’s a 100-year-old story, so we will be making substantial changes to suit the sensibilities of the audience today,” added Mehta.
