Daisy Shah has said actresses who do item songs are categorised as item girls but for big stars like Kareena Kapoor and Katrina Kaif, item songs become guest appearances. "Sadly, that's the attitude of our Hindi film industry," she added. Daisy further said, "Let's put it this way: I don't intend to do item numbers, but [will do] guest appearances."
