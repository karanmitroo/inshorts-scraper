Singer Ariana Grande has been sued by songwriter Alex Greggs for her 2015 song 'One Last Time', which he claims is a copy of a 2012 single he wrote called 'Takes All Night'. Greggs' version was written for singer Skye Stevens. Greggs also named David Guetta, a co-writer for Ariana's track, and the music producers and label in the lawsuit.
