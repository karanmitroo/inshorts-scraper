Producer Harvey Weinstein has been sued by his former Indian-American assistant who has alleged she was subjected to sexual exploitation while working for him. She was "required to be involved in and aware of the preparations for, and clean up after, Harvey Weinstein's extremely prolific sexual encounters," the lawsuit states. It also adds that Weinstein subjected her to "unwelcome touching".
