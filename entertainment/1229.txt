Oscar-winning writer-filmmaker Paul Haggis has been accused of sexual abuse by four women. This includes two allegations of rape, one by the director's publicist who had accused him in December 2017 of "a shocking and egregious case of rape and sexual assault" that occurred in 2013. Paul's lawyer has denied any accusations while saying, "He didn't rape anybody."
