Actress Aditi Rao Hydari has slammed a Twitter user who called her "a brainwashed love jihadi victim" based on her surname. She tweeted, "It's not about religions or cultures... it's about small minded people who create hate...we can all choose not to be those people regardless of our names." The user was criticising Aditi for supporting the film 'Padmavati'.
