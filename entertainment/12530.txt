Singer Arijit Singh has said that he will sing for the Salman Khan starrer 'Tubelight' but whether the song will be retained in the film depends on Salman. "But I will definitely sing because nobody can stop me from singing a song," said Arijit. Earlier, Salman reportedly removed Arijit's version of the song 'Jag Ghoomeya' from his film 'Sultan'.
