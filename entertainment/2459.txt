Veteran actress Sharmila Tagore has said that many scripts are written for actors like Naseeruddin Shah, Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui but not for actresses like Madhuri Dixit or Tabu. Sharmila added, "I think that's because the audience also prefers the opinion makers to be male. But that's also changing, we see Ratna Pathak Shah in...more interesting roles (than) before."
