Taapsee Pannu, while talking about being rejected over "stupid things", said, "I was told, 'You are not...glamorous enough'...'You are not so and so's daughter'." She added she wouldn't let her sister Shagun go through this. Taapsee said, "It becomes easy for the younger sibling to feel like a part of the industry because the elder one has already...paved the way."
