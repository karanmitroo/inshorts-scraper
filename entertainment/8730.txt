Actress Kangana Ranaut, while speaking about Iranian filmmaker's movie 'Beyond The Clouds', said that she rejected the film for being offered a submissive role. She added, "It's a brother-sister story where the brother is the one doing all the fighting." Notably, the film will mark the Bollywood debut of Shahid Kapoor's half-brother Ishaan Khattar.
