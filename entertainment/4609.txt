Actor Anil Kapoor has said that Amitabh Bachchan, who took a five-year-long break after his 1992 film 'Khuda Gawah', had advised him never to commit the mistake of taking a break from films. Anil said, "I went back and immediately signed two new films. I have never taken a break in my 38-year-long career."
