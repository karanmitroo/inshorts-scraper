Akshay Kumar has decided to felicitate Shreya Naik, a 19-year-old Mumbai girl, who reportedly beat up a man who tried molesting her. Notably, Shreya had been trained in martial arts by a centre run by Akshay and Yuva Sena Chief Aditya Thackeray. "This is very important... it will give other girls the confidence to face such situations bravely", Akshay said.
