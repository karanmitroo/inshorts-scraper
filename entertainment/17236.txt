"Django Unchained'' actress Daniele Watts and her boyfriend who were accused of having sex inside a parked car, were Monday ordered to apologise to three Los Angeles police officers and perform 40 hours of community service. They were booked for lewd conduct and disturbing peace. Watts had accused LA police of racial profiling during their investigation, the City's attorney said.
