While co-presenting an award at 90th Academy Awards, Pakistan-origin actor Kumail Nanjiani said, "I am from Pakistan and Iowa, two places that nobody from Hollywood can find on the map." He added, "Actually, I have to complain...Kumail Nanjiani is my stage name. My actual given Pakistani name is Chris Pine." He said this over the ongoing immigration crisis in USA.
