Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was released from Pune's Yerwada jail on Sunday, two weeks after he was granted a monthlong parole. The 53-year-old had applied for parole citing ill-health of wife Manyata. Earlier, a major controversy had erupted over granting parole to Dutt for the second time in little over a month, forcing the Maharashtra government to order an inquiry.
