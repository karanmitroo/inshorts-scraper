Producer Sajid Nadiadwala has said that filmmaker Sajid Khan, who directed the first two films of the 'Housefull' franchise, choose to step out of 'Housefull 3'. "Sajid Khan didn’t want to because he was busy with ‘Himmatwala’ then," said Nadiadwala. 'Housefull 3' which stars Akshay Kumar and Jacqueline Fernandez, among others, has been directed by Sajid Samji and Farhad Samji.
