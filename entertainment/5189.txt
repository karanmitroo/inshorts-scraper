According to reports, Arjun Kapoor will replace Akshay Kumar in Namastey England, a sequel to the 2007 Vipul Shah directed film Namastey London. A source said, "Arjun was keen...but he wanted to make sure that Akshay had no problems about the franchise moving forward without him." Namastey England, like the first film, will reportedly be shot in Punjab and UK.
