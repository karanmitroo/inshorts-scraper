A paan shop owner in Varanasi has named a 'meetha paan' as 'Shah Rukh Khan Special Paan' after the Bollywood actor visited his shop. He did this because his customers wanted to know which 'paan' Shah Rukh Khan had during the visit. SRK visited the shop along with Anushka Sharma during promotions of their upcoming film 'Jab Harry Met Sejal'.
