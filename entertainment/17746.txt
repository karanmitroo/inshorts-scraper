Filmmaker Karan Johar, who is facing flak for being a part of the â€˜AIB Roast' has decided to respond with 'silence'. "Silence can mean several things...strength...weakness and indifference...to me it always signifies dignity...which is above everything else!", Karan tweeted. Johar is yet to directly comment on the controversy that followed the roast involving Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor.
