Television actor Shardul Pandit has said men also face body-shaming and revealed that he too has faced it. "[T]here is a certain perception in the industry that if there is a hero, he should be muscular and broad which is actually crap," he added. Shardul further said that most actors are cast based on their body and not their acting.
