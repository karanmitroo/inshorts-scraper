A 68,000 square feet poster of 'Amazon Obhijaan', said to be the largest for a Bengali film, was launched today at the Mohun Bagan football ground in Kolkata. If placed vertically, the poster would be taller than structures such as the Statue of Liberty and the Qutub Minar, said the producers. The Kamaleswar Mukherjee directorial will release on December 22.
