Singer-songwriter Kailash Kher recently said in an interview that he was told his voice will not work in the industry. He added that the same person said, "See, I said... this guy will become famous" after his first album came in 2006 and became a hit. "[I]f you are honest about your work, the public will like it," Kher said.
