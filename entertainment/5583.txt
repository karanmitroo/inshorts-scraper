Comedian Chandan Prabhakar has confirmed that he'll rejoin The Kapil Sharma Show after a three-month gap. Prabhakar hadn't shot for the show following Kapil's brawl on a flight with Sunil Grover in March. "It's okay if I reacted then...I can't stretch it for life. We're like family...two brothers fight but that doesn't mean they leave each other forever," said Prabhakar.
