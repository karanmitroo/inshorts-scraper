Game of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham paid a surprise visit on Tuesday to a 16-year-old Syrian refugee living in the German city of Stuttgart. Cunningham, who plays Davos Seaworth on the series, first met Hussam in Jordan in September. Hussam and his mother are presently staying in a hotel, while his father and brother are legally settled in Germany.
