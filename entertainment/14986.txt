On the day after the India-Pakistan World T20 cricket match, 'Abhishek Bachchan' was a top Indian Twitter trend on Monday. A Twitter user tweeted, "Big B paid for Aftab Shivdasani's ticket so that Abhishek Bachchan isn't the least known celebrity in the stadium". The Bollywood actor had then responded to the user in a series of tweets.
