Film editor-writer Apurva Asrani, known for his work in films like 'Aligarh' and 'Shahid', has penned a poem on the mob culture in India, where he wrote about "web-warriors" and "140 character zombies". His poem begins with the lines, "We are the mob and the mob is us. Left-wing, right-wing or in the centre, what difference does it make?"
