Actor Siddharth, in a tweet addressed to the BJP,  wrote, "Dear #BJP you have power. Empower #India. Stay out of people's private choices. Stop this #Hindu nation narrative. We are better than that." He added that the row about cattle markets is unnecessary as it only polarises people and the Centre should stay out of allowing or disallowing slaughter.
