Singer Sia, known for songs like 'Cheap Thrills' and 'Chandelier', was spotted without her wig at the Los Angeles airport on her way to Dubai. The 41-year-old singer usually makes public appearances wearing a half-black-half-blonde faux hair and never shows her face. Sia has introduced her distinctive look in her videos, where dancer Maddie Ziegler is seen in similar wigs.
