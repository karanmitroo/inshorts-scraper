Responding to Kangana Ranaut's statement that he's the "flagbearer of nepotism" and a "movie mafia" on his show 'Koffee With Karan', Karan Johar said that if Kangana finds the film industry so bad, she should leave it. He added, "I'm done with Kangana playing the victim card...who has a sad story...about how she's terrorised by the bad world of industry."
