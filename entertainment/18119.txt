'Maroon 5' lead vocalist Adam Levine has said he wants to have 17 babies with his model wife Behati Prinsloo. "Like 17. Is that reasonable? I love kids so much, though. I love seeing kids on the set, too," Levine said when asked how many kids he wants. However, he isn't planning to have kids anytime soon, he added.
