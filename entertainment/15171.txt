The Delhi government on Monday wrote to the wives of actors Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgn, Arbaaz Khan and Govinda, requesting them to urge the actors to not endorse pan masala products. The letters were sent out to their wives as the actors did not respond to the earlier requests by the health department, the AAP government said.
