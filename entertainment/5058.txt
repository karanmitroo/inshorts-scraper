Actress Kirti Kulhari, who stars in upcoming film 'Indu Sarkar', has said that the Censor Board needs to grow up and let the audiences grow. Significantly, Censor Board demanded 14 cuts in Indu Sarkar, a film set in the backdrop of 1975 Emergency. "If we do what they've asked for, then the whole essence of the film goes," added Kirti.
