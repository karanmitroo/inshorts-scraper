Actress Kriti Sanon has said that when she was struggling to enter films, somebody told her she was too good-looking and there have to be imperfections for looking real onscreen. She added, "I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me." Kriti made her Bollywood debut with 2014 film 'Heropanti'.
