Actress Avika Gor, while addressing dating rumours with her co-star Manish Raisinghan, said he is just a few years younger than her father, so there is no scope for any romantic involvement. "A few people even suggested that I tie him a rakhi to convince everyone," she added. Avika further said they cannot let these rumours affect their equation.
