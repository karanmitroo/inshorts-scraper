To make a scene depicting domestic violence authentic, actor Rajkummar Rao slapped Vidya Balan thrice, on the sets of 'Hamari Adhuti Kahani'. According to a source, nobody had expected Rao to actually hit Balan, not even the director Mohit Suri. "I actually jumped out of my seat, but then I realised...the actors had planned this in advance", he said.
