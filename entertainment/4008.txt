Rajkummar Rao, while talking about not being nominated at mainstream award shows, said, "I have no complaints." He added, "I'm very happy with the kind of work I'm doing. The kind of love and respect that I get from everyone...it's overwhelming." Notably, he was awarded the Best Actor (Special Mention) for 'Trapped' at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne 2017.
