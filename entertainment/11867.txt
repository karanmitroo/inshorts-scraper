Actor Tom Hanks has said that Irrfan Khan, his co-star in the upcoming film 'Inferno' beats him as the "coolest guy" in the room. "I always think I'm the coolest guy in the room, and everybody's hanging on to every word I say... And then Irrfan... walks into the room. And he's the coolest guy in the room," said Hanks.
