As per reports, the Bigg Boss 8 team wants to extend the show by a month. As a result, theyâ€™ll need a new host, since Salman Khan's contract expires then and he has a full schedule after that. Farah Khan may be roped in to host the extended portion of the season. However, there is no official confirmation as yet.
