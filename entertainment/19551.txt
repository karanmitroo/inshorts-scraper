On Wednesday, during the shoot of Aamir Khan's upcoming movie 'PK' in Chandni-Chowk, a unit director was arrested for hurting religious sentiments, police said Friday. However, no case has been registered against Aamir Khan. Locals objected to a scene where a man dressed as Lord Shiva was pulling a rickshaw in which two burqa-clad women were sitting.
