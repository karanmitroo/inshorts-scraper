Tristin Budzyn-Baker, a 17-year-old American boy, returned Chris Hemsworth's wallet, which he had lost recently at the Los Angeles airport. Tristin wrote a letter to Hemsworth's management, informing them about the wallet. He also requested for tickets to 'The Ellen Show', on which Hemsworth was due to appear. Tristin was later rewarded with $10,000 when he appeared on the show.
