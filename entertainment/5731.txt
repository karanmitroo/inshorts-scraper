Actress-singer Jada Pinkett Smith, wife of actor Will Smith, has tweeted that the reimagining of her relationship to Pac has been deeply hurtful in late rapper Tupac Shakur's biopic All Eyez On Me. In a series of tweets, Jada wrote that scenes shown, including ones where he argues with her backstage or Pac reading a poem to her, were false.
