Parineeti Chopra has said, "When I am dancing, no professional dancer has complained. When I crack a joke, I haven't heard any professional comedian complain...why this hue and cry about actors singing?" She added, "Who decides what I can do and can't do?" She said this in reference to recent spat between Sonakshi Sinha and Armaan Malik over actors singing.
