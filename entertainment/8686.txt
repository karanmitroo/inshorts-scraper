Singer Neha Kakkar has revealed that she was forcibly made to perform at a wedding despite being unwell, which led to her crying and breaking down on stage after performing for over an hour. "When you're a celebrity people don't take you as a human being, for them you're just a Puppet," wrote Neha in her Facebook post.
