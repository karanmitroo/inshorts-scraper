According to reports, Hrithik Roshan has been advised by his lawyers to refrain from commenting on Kangana Ranaut's recent statements. "It would put him in jeopardy if he reacts in any manner to what Kangana is doing," a source was quoted as saying. Kangana recently said Hrithik runs away on seeing her and demanded an apology from him.
