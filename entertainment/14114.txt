The Raj Thackeray-led 'Maharashtra Navnirman Sena' on Monday filed a complaint against Tanmay Bhat, a stand-up comedian associated with 'AIB', for his video on Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar. The party has also threatened Bhat saying that they will beat him "whenever they see him". "We will not let him do any shows," said MNS Chitrapat Sena president Ameya Khopkar.
