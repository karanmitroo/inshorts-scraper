Actress Tabu has said women have played much more than eye-candies in Bollywood. "Now the difference is that leading ladies are much more courageous to take on layered characters," she added. "Also, society is changing, we know that women should not have one-dimensional lives or personalities. So, in that way, it's also fashionable to have layered characters for women."
