Gaurav Arora, a former contestant on the reality television show 'Splitsvilla', who now identifies as 'Gauri', has said that he does not feel the need for a vagina to look feminine. "Right now I am on medications. When my doctors will feel that I am physically ready to undergo the (sex change) surgery, we will decide then," said Gauri.
