A petrol bomb was allegedly thrown by unidentified persons at a cinema hall screening the film 'Padmaavat' in Maharashtra's Kalyan on Saturday. While the bomb failed to explode and no injuries were reported, the police have launched a manhunt to arrest the accused. This comes amid protests by Rajput groups against the film for allegedly distorting history.
