Actress Vaani Kapoor has said that she is not the casual, hook-up type girl. "I'm single right now... the crazy heart-skips-wala-beat (love) is yet to happen," the 28-year-old actress added. On dating a fellow actor, she said "never say never", adding that she might be a "little wary" of it. Vaani was last seen in 'Befikre' opposite Ranveer Singh.
