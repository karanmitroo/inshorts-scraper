Actor Shreyas Talpade has apologised after posters of his upcoming film 'Wah Taj', releasing on September 23, caused a controversy. As part of the film's publicity, the makers distributed posters across the city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh stating that the Taj Mahal will be shut to tourists starting September 23. A notice has reportedly been sent to the filmmakers.
