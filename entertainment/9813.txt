Actor Shahid Kapoor has said that a mainstream star like him, having an arranged marriage is unique. "...my life (is) up for discussion, by default. It won't stop whether I like it or not," he said, adding that wife Mira is "pretty chilled" about criticism. This comes after Shahid was criticised for advocating arranged marriage in a chat show.
