Salman Khan came out in support of his good-friend and ex, Katrina Kaif over her leaked bikini-pictures with Ranbir Kapoor at Ibiza. Salman said it was  very shameless to print such personal-life pictures of a celebrity and wasn't even media's right. He commented on Katrina's letter to the media (after her holiday picture controversy) saying,"I feel it was intelligently written".
