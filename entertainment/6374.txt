Singer Katy Perry pranked visitors at the Whitney Museum in New York, seemingly appearing as a head on a plate. She transformed the cover art from her single 'Bon Appetit' into a sculpture, described as a "one-day-only installation" by artist Katheryn Hudson (Perry's birth name). Several museumgoers were shocked and excited when they saw her head on a fruit platter.
