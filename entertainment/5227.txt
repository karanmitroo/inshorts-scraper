Alia Bhatt, who has admitted to being a Kareena Kapoor fan, has said that Shahid Kapoor has told her she has no similarities with Kareena. Alia said she was often called 'baby Kareena' and added, "Maybe because of...few words we constantly say like 'lurking', 'biggish', people draw the parallel from there." Shahid, Kareena, and Alia worked together in Udta Punjab.
