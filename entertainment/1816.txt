Actor Govinda has revealed that initially he didn't watch the Anurag Basu-directed comedy drama 'Barfi!' because he doesn't watch a film if he doesn't like its title. Govinda added, "But later on, my wife (Sunita Ahuja) strongly recommended the film to me, arguing, 'The director's thinking (soch) isn't wrong'." Notably, 'Barfi!' was India's official entry to the Oscars 2013.
