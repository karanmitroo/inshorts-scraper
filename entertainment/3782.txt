Former Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has sent a legal notice to the makers of  'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz'. He has accused them of "uncalled for false comments, malevolent remarks and baseless allegations." The makers had earlier sent him a notice saying he had made false claims that they showed two different copies of the film to the CBFC and the Tribunal.
