Former Miss Universe Sushmita Sen Monday called pop queen Madonna her style icon. Sushmita was the showstopper for designer Namrata Joshipura at a fashion show in Kolkata, where she said, "I love Madonna. She is my icon as I feel her music is her style quotient." "People are stylish when they are successful in every walk of life," she added.
