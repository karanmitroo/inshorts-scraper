Actor Rajkummar Rao, while talking about his latest release 'Newton', revealed that it became very tough for him to continue shooting for the film as he lost his mother. However, he added, "I felt that my mother was constantly egging me on and saying 'Finish your job. Just do it'." The film has been selected as India's official Oscar entry.
