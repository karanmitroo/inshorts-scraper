A month after actor Shahid Kapoor confirmed that he was getting married this year, reports claim that the wedding will take place in either Istanbul or Greece. Reportedly, Shahid and his bride-to-be Delhi girl Mira Rajput had earlier decided a destination wedding at Bali Island (Indonesia). The marriage will take place in June instead of December, as reported earlier.
