Actor Rajkummar Rao has revealed that he has faced many rejections sometimes because of his complexion and sometimes because of not being muscular enough. "It's not easy as many people come every day to Mumbai to follow their passion. I gave hundreds of auditions. I have done many advertisements just to survive because Mumbai is an expensive city," he added.
