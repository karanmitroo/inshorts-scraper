Actors Charlie Sheen and Whoopi Goldberg will star in a movie about the 9/11 terror attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in the US. They will portray people stuck in an elevator during the attack. "We’re hoping to debut the movie at the Toronto Film Festival on 9/11, because the movie is about 9/11,” said Sheen.
