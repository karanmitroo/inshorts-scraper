While talking about struggles in her career, Priyanka Chopra revealed, "I have been thrown out of films because...a girlfriend was recommended...girlfriend of the hero or the director." "I couldn't do anything...because I didn't cater to the whims and fancies of powerful men," she said. Priyanka added, "My parents stood beside me and told me there's nothing to be afraid of."
