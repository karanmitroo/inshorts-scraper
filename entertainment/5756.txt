A ceremonial bat-signal was lit up at Los Angeles' City Hall to honour late actor Adam West, known for his portrayal of Batman in American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) 1960's television series. Some fans attended the event wearing Batman masks, capes, t-shirts and also sang the TV show's theme song. West died of leukaemia at the age of 88 last week.
