Actress Meryl Streep, while responding to Rose McGowan slamming her for working with rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein and not speaking up against him, said she wasn't deliberately silent. "I want to let her know I didn't know about Weinstein's crimes...I don't...approve of rape," she added. Following her statement, Rose McGowan apologised for her tweet in which she slammed Meryl.
