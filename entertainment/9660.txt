Bengaluru Police will sue Sunburn, organisers of DJ David Guetta's scheduled concert in the city, for allegedly showcasing the city and its police in a poor light. The concert, scheduled for January 12, was cancelled with organisers saying the police denied permission. However, Bengaluru Police Commissioner Praveen Sood said the police didn't have any prior knowledge about the concert.
