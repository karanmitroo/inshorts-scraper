Salman Khan's Being Human Foundation is likely to be blacklisted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body has issued a show-cause notice against the NGO for failing to set up dialysis units in Bandra after over a year of being allotted the project. BMC had earlier sent letters to the foundation for showing negligence over the project.
