'Khamoshiyan' that marks the debut of Sapna Pabbi and Gurmeet Choudhary has given a pathetic plot to the debutants, says NDTV. Produced by Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt, the film scares in parts and has a convincing climax, writes IBN. The movie, which also stars Ali Fazal, has been rated 2/5 (NDTV) and 1.5/5 (TOI, Indian Express).
