Filmmaker Karan Johar has apologised for the portrayal of Kajol's character 'Anjali' in 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai', his directorial debut in 1997. "It was really stupid," said Johar. He further said that Shabana Azmi, after watching the film, had questioned him on how 'Anjali' finds love only when she moves on from her tomboy image to a "sari-wearing, feminine woman".
