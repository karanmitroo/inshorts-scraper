The release of action film 'Daydi' has been stopped by Uzbekistan's film licensing body as actor Morgan Freeman, who featured in the film's posters, doesn't appear in the film. The production house has been accused of breaching consumersâ€™ rights by falsely promising the actor's appearance. Reportedly, the posters of 'Daydi' lifted Freeman's images from his 2015 film 'Last Knights'.
