Television personality-model Katie Price has said she'll never reveal the identity of the celebrity who raped her. "I'll never name him, I just don't want the drama. I don't even know if he knows that I've spoken about him, I doubt he does," she added. Katie had revealed in 2009 that she was sexually assaulted by a well-known person.
