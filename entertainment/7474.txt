The Maharashtra government on Friday passed a resolution congratulating actor Aamir Khan for not releasing his film Dangal in Pakistan without the Indian National Anthem. Pakistan's censor board had demanded scenes featuring the tricolour and Indian National Anthem be cut, as per reports. Aamir reportedly found the cuts surprising as Dangal did not portray extreme patriotism.
