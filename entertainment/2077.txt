Zareen Khan has questioned that if the makers of her recently released film 'Aksar 2' were clean and honest then why didn't they show the film to her. "They had repeatedly turned down my requests," she added. Zareen further said, "People like makers of 'Aksar 2' will scare away all the young girls who want to enter the film industry."
