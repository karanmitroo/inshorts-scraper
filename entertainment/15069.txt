Actor Aamir Khan has said that people who question and doubt him are already biased against him and no matter what he does, they will continue doing so. "Negative people are less but since they shout we hear them and feel there are too many (of them)," he added. Earlier, Aamir sparked a controversy with his alleged remarks on intolerance.
