A Wisconsin judge on Monday ordered the release of Brendan Dassey, one of the subjects in Netflix’s documentary series 'Making a Murderer'. Dassey, 27, has been in prison since 2007, after being found guilty of the murder of Teresa Halbach, a local photographer. The order was challenged by Wisconsin’s attorney general, who will file for a stay on the decision.
