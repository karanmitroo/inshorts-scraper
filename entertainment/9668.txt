Hollywood actor Vin Diesel has said that the Oscar awards have an elitist approach. 
"The term action hero came with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't think Oscars have caught up to that and they still maintain the prejudice," he added. Diesel further said that he doesn't make his films for accolades, but for his audience.
