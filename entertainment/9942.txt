As per reports, a track in Akshay Kumar's upcoming film 'Jolly LLB 2' titled 'He's a Jolly Good Fellow' has been inspired by a nursery rhyme. Akshay was reportedly playing with his 4-year-old daughter Nitara when she started humming the song. The song was shot in a day in Mumbai last month and also features actress Huma Qureshi.
