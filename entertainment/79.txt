The first-ever Academy Awards, which took place in 1929, lasted only 15 minutes. The ceremony honoured films released from August 1, 1927 till July 31, 1928. The award ceremony, which was attended by only 270 guests, was not broadcast on any platform. Interestingly, 'Oscar' was adopted as the official term for the trophy ten years after the inaugural ceremony.
