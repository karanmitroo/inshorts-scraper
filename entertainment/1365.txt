Grammy-award winning singer Lorde has cancelled a scheduled concert in Israel amid calls from activists for her to boycott Israel as a protest against its treatment of Palestinians. Calling Lorde's decision "regrettable", Israel's ambassador to New Zealand Itzhak Gerberg said that the boycott of his country represented "hostility and intolerance".
