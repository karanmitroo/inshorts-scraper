Actress Priyanka Chopra has revealed that she had issues as a teenager because she is dark-skinned. "[There was] pressure from society that a girl is prettier if she's lighter... [I]t's on us to make those pressures not seem important to girls," she added. Priyanka further said her skin colour has nothing to do with what she has achieved so far.
