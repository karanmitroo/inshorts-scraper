Mumbai Police have upgraded security given to singer Sonu Nigam and two BJP MLAs after receiving intelligence from Jammu and Kashmir Police about threat to their lives. The threats are reportedly by fundamentalist groups plotting the singer's assassination. Last year, Sonu had complained of 'forced religiousness' on being woken up by Azaan even though he is not a Muslim.
