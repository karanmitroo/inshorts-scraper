Wenjing Zhang, member of Aamir Khan's fan club in China has said that the 'Dhaakad' video made by them was a gift for the actor. "We chose the song Dhaakad, because Aamir has sung it, and he's really cool in the movie, too," added Zhang. She further said that the Chinese were moved by the family ties depicted in Dangal.
