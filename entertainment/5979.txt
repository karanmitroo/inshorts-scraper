Actress Mandira Bedi has said that she turns down offers for doing item numbers in films because it is not her thing. "I did one and ticked it off my bucket list," said Mandira. Her item number featured in the 2004 Tamil film 'Manmadhan'. She added she agreed to do it on the insistence of the film's lead actor Simbu.
