The Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India has said that films with Pakistani artistes won't be screened in single screen theatres in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa and Karnataka. "Taking national sentiments and security issues into account, we cannot allow the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil," the association said, adding that the decision will also be conveyed to other states.
