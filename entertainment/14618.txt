Actor Amitabh Bachchan, while remembering filmmaker Satyajit Ray on his 24th death anniversary on Saturday, mentioned that it was a "great privilege" working with him. Bachchan had lent his voice for the narration of Rayâ€™s 'Shatranj Ke Khiladi'. Ray was a Bharat Ratna awardee and his filmmaking was recognised internationally with an Academy Honorary Award in 1992.
