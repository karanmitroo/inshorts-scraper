Actress Sushmita Sen has tweeted 'Thank God' to express how thankful she is that when India won the Miss Universe title in 1994, the pageant was owned by Paramount Communications and not Donald Trump. Sushmita was reacting to US presidential nominee Donald Trump's comments about Miss Universe 1996 Alicia Machado. Trump had called Alicia 'Miss Piggy' when she gained weight.
