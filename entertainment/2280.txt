The makers of the Hollywood film 'Basmati Blues' have apologised for 'generalising Indian culture' in the film's trailer. "We deeply regret any offense caused by the Basmati Blues trailer...This movie is not about an American going abroad to solve India's problems," they said in a statement. This comes after the trailer was criticised on social media for stereotyping Indian culture.
