Filmmaker Karan Johar took to social media to share pictures of the nursery for his twins, designed by actor Shah Rukh Khan's wife Gauri Khan. The twins, Roohi and Yash, were born via surrogacy. They were brought home on Wednesday, after being kept in the hospital for over seven weeks due to health complications following their premature birth.
