Actress Shilpa Shetty has said that she gets "scared" and is "petrified" of her old films, "barring a few". "I have no idea why people showed me so much love. They have been forgiving and gracious," said Shilpa. The 41-year-old actress added, "I feel if I did a film today I would approach it differently... It all comes with maturity."
