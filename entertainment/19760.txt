Cricketer Manoj Tiwary tied the knot on Thursday with his girlfriend Sushmita Roy, whom he met about six years ago through a common friend, at Howrah. The 27-year-old has played 8 ODIs for India and has a high score of 104 not out against the West Indies. Manoj, who also plays for the KKR, is currently nursing his knee injury.
