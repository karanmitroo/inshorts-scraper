Filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma, while praising actor Amitabh Bachchan, wrote in a tweet that "great actors love acting" but Bachchan "lusts acting". "That's what's greater than great because anyone can fake love but no one can fake lust," Verma added. He further wrote, "Longest in career and hardest in intensity of performances ..That's what is @SrBachchan."
