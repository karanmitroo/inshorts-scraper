Actor Saif Ali Khan, on being asked if he would play his father and former Indian cricket team captain late Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi onscreen, said, "I don't think I am sexy enough." "He was a stylish person and played the game with his own style. He carried the right attitude. I don't think I can copy him," Saif added.
