Actor Kamal Haasan has issued an apology for supporting the Centre's demonetisation policy "in a hurry". Kamal said he was filled with doubt as the government did not have a strong response to the criticism that the policy received. "If the Prime Minister accepts his mistake without being adamant, one more salaam is waiting for him from me," he added.
