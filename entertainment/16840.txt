Celebrity hairstylist and 'Bigg Boss 6' contestant Sapna Bhavnani has revealed that she was gang-raped at the age of 24 in Chicago. "It took me 20 years to voice my incident, but for me a woman keeping it all within her because she has no other choice isn't a sign of weakness... it's a mark of strength," said the 44-year-old.
