Impressed by the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) performance in the Delhi elections, comedian Kapil Sharma said - "I would like to invite Mr. Arvind Kejriwal to my show (Comedy Nights With Kapil) someday." AAP made a spectacular debut in the Delhi assembly polls, and the fact proves that Indians are now open to change, believes Kapil.
