The song 'Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga' from the movie '1942: A Love Story' will be recreated for an upcoming film with the same title as that of the song. "We want to replicate [the] iconic status of [the original song]," said director Shelly Chopra Dhar. It will star Anil Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor, Rajkummar Rao and Juhi Chawla.
