After creating a strong foot-hold in India, actor Salman Khan's clothing brand Being Human is all set to go global. The brand will now be retailed through South Africa's online fashion shop Zando. Zando is available in Europe and Middle East as well as in India. Launched in 2007 as an NGO, Being Human became a clothing line in 2012.
