Hrithik Roshan, when asked to comment on his row with Kangana Ranaut, said, "I don't blame, complain or explain. That is the philosophy of my life." He added, "I am the person that I always was. Nothing can shake me." Hrithik and Kangana sent each other legal notices after he demanded an apology over her calling him her 'silly ex'.
