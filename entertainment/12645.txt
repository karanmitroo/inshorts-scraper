Actress Richa Chadha has slammed those who criticised her for her comments defending actor Fawad Khan. The actress had said that as a North Indian, she had more in common with Fawad when compared to people from South India or the North East. "Thanks for missing the point. I love Tamil... I can read and write the language," tweeted Richa.
