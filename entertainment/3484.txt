Priyanka Chopra, in a letter to Sikkim's Tourism Minister Ugen Gyatso, has apologised for her remark that the state is "troubled by insurgency" and for calling her production 'Pahuna' the first film to come out of the region. Priyanka added that when discussing Sikkim's issues with the refugee situation caused by insurgencies, she had meant insurgencies in the neighbouring countries.
