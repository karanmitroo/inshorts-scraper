Responding to Hrithik Roshan's statement that there is no proof of his alleged relationship with Kangana, her lawyer said Hrithik never let her take pictures or keep any kind of data which would suggest any kind of relationship. "[Kangana] was dating Hrithik, who was a married man at that time... Hrithik had to protect his image," the lawyer added.
