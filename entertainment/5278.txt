'Baahubali' director SS Rajamouli has said that not everything in his life is 'Baahubalian' size. He said this when asked if he plans to shift from his current two-room house. "I am not building any sprawling houses. But I am planning to build a small farmhouse two hours away from Hyderabad as an occasional weekend getaway," added Rajamouli.
