Actor Eddie Redmayne has revealed that the script of fantasy film 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them' was kept locked up in a safe. "I never ever have done a film (like this)," the actor said, adding that he was not allowed a paper script to write notes on. He further said that he'd "occasionally smuggle" his script home.
