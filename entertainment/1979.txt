Addressing the ongoing 'Padmavati' row, the Supreme Court has stated that people holding public offices shouldn't comment on films which have not been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) yet. "That'll prejudice the decision of the CBFC," added the bench. The apex court said this while rejecting a plea seeking a stay on Padmavati's release abroad.
