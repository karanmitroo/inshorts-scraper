Director Sai Kabir has confirmed that his upcoming adventure comedy 'Divine Lovers' will star Zareen Khan alongside Irrfan Khan. "She fit the bill perfectly as we wanted a girl with Pathani looks," said Kabir. The film was reportedly offered to Kangana Ranaut initially but could not work out owing to unavailability of dates. The film will begin production in September.
