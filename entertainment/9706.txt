The Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer 'Haraamkhor' "suffers from slightness and disjointedness...despite some strong moments," wrote The Indian Express. The Times of India wrote, "Haraamkhor shows a lot of promise but ends up being way too vague to be hard-hitting," while NDTV said, "Haraamkhor is worthy of applause for its fearlessness...." It has been rated 2/5 (IE), 2.5/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (TOI).
