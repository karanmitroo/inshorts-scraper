Ousted Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said he is planning to make a sequel to his 1993 action-comedy 'Aankhen' and added that Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor are number one on his wish list. "With each character playing a double role, we will see two Ranveers and two Arjuns, along with a chimpanzee," Pahlaj further said.
