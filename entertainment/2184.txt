'Kabali' music composer Santhosh Narayanan has accused an official at the Sydney airport of racial profiling. "I was randomly picked up for the eighth time in a row at the Sydney airport for a chemical substance test and a rude officer insulted my intelligence," he added. However, the airport Twitter handle responded by saying it was part of standard procedure.
