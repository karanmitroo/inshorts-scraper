Super 30 founder Anand Kumar shared pictures with Hrithik Roshan and filmmaker Vikas Bahl from his recent visit to the actor's Mumbai house. "The way he (Hrithik) invited me to his house and gave me the honour really showed that he is...a great artist...(and) a great human being," wrote Kumar. Hrithik will reportedly star in an upcoming biopic on Kumar.
