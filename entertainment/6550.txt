Shilpa Shetty, co-owner of Rajasthan Royals, has claimed that the team will be back in the Indian Premier League next year. However, Shilpa said she has no plans for the team or next year's IPL yet while adding, "I have cut away from the IPL." Notably, the team was banned for two years in 2015, following the Lodha Panel inquiry.
