Actress Alia Bhatt has said that though she loves her elder sister Shaheen, she cannot help her get over depression. "I am there to support her unconditionally. But she has her own process of dealing... which I can't be a part of," she added. Recently, Shaheen had written about battling depression since the age of thirteen on social media.
