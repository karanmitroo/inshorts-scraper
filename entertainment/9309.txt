Paresh Baruah, chief of the militant group United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), while warning theatre owners in Assam, said, "An Assamese film should not be taken off just to accommodate Shah Rukh Khan's Hindi film (Raees)". A local filmmaker had written to ULFA about the film 'Shakira Ahibo Bakultolor Bihuloi' being pulled down from screens despite a "good" crowd.
