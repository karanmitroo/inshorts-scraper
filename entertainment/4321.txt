The wax statue of late veteran actress Madhubala has been unveiled at the Madame Tussauds in New Delhi. The statue has been styled as the character 'Anarkali', portrayed by Madhubala in the 1960 film 'Mughal-E-Azam'. The museum, which is the first Madame Tussauds in India, is scheduled to open later this year.
