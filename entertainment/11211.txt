Actress Pooja Bedi's daughter Aalia, while slamming body-shamers has written in a blog that she is "more than her breasts". "If my cleavage is visible, it does not mean I am giving consent," she wrote. Aalia also added that being an "eighteen-year-old Indian girl does not take away the fact" that she is "allowed" to dress the way she pleases.
