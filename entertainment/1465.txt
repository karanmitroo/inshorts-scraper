A petition has been started online to demand the removal of actor Matt Damon's cameo appearance from the all-female starrer 'Ocean's 8'. It stated Damon's inclusion would trivialise the serious nature of the charges against sexual abusers like Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The petition further alleged that Damon "not only ignored but enabled his friend Harvey's inappropriate behavior".
