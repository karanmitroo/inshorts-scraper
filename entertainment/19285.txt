The marriage of actress Dia Mirza with her beau Sahil Sangha has been deferred for the second time, due to the poor health conditions of her father-in-law's younger brother, sources said. Last time, when they were to tie the knot in Nov 2013, it was rescheduled to a future date, as her mother ( Deepa Mirza) had a health issue.
