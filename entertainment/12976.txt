Lyricist Javed Akhtar has said that actor Naseeruddin Shah "does not like successful people". "I have never heard him praise any successful person. He criticises Dilip Kumar; he criticises Amitabh Bachchan," said Akhtar. Earlier, Shah had commented that yesteryear actor Rajesh Khanna was a "poor actor" who brought "mediocrity" to the Hindi film industry in the early 70s'.
