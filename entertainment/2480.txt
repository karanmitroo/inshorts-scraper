Deepika Padukone was trolled for an Instagram picture, where she is seen being kissed on the cheek by Ranbir Kapoor's cousin Aadar Jain. Some users called Deepika "drunk", "desperate" and "vulgar", while some users defended her. A user wrote, "Our country...needs to look ahead to better problems that can be handled rather than being judgemental...when it comes to celebrities."
