In response to the questions about his split with ex-girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, actor Sushant Singh Rajput said that he "cannot talk about her without her permission". "Discussing my relationship also concerns the other party. A relationship talks about two different individuals, and that's why I'm not ready to discuss the details with anyone," added Sushant.
