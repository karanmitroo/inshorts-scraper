Indian boxer Mary Kom has said that if there is a sequel to her biopic 'Mary Kom', she would want to play the titular character on her own. "I will not give it (the role) to anyone," said the 33-year-old Olympian boxer. Directed by Omung Kumar, the 2014 film had starred Priyanka Chopra in the titular role.
