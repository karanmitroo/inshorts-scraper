Veteran actor Nana Patekar has said that a film is the biggest superstar following a question on whether he felt that Rajinikanth is India's biggest superstar. He said that a film that is "not good enough... will not run" based on the star. "If your story is good... even if actors are new, the film will do well," added Nana.
