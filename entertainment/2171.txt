In a letter to Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani, Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje has requested her not to release 'Padmavati' until some necessary changes are made. Raje suggested that a committee should be formed to discuss the film's plot and suggest amendments to avoid hurting sentiments. She  added the Censor Board must think of consequences before certifying 'Padmavati'.
