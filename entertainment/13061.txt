Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has re-listed his estate in the South of France for â‚¬50 million (about $55.5 million), which is over double its previous asking price of $26 million. Depp listed the estate, a former village which includes a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed cave, for sale in June 2015 but removed it a few months later.
