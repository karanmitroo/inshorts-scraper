Hollywood actor Tom Cruise is believed to have been the original choice for Shah Rukh Khan's role in the 1995 film 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'. The movie's director, Aditya Chopra, reportedly wanted to cast Tom as he wanted the movie to be an Indo-American project. However, the story had to be reworked as Yash Chopra didn't approve the decision.
