Taapsee Pannu, while recalling how she was hit by a coconut in her midriff in Telugu director K Raghavendra Rao's film, said, "I don't know what is so sensuous about hitting a girl on her midriff." She added Rao made over 100 films and launched Sridevi and Jayasudha, who were also apparently hit by flowers and fruits on their midriffs.
