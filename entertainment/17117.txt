French director Jacques Audiard's "Dheepan" has won the Palme d'Or, the top honour of the Cannes Film Festival. "Dheepan" is a tale of three Sri-Lankans who pretend to be a family in order to flee their war-torn country. The runner-up prize, the Grand Prix, went to Hungarian director for 'Saul Fia'. Audiard also took the Grand Prix five-years ago for 'A Prophet'.
