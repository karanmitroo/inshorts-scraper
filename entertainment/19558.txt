A picture of Amitabh Bachchan in an aircraft went viral when his Silsila(1981) co-star Rekha was captured within the same frame. The picture was taken on a request of the pilot, mid-air. The two veteran actors were seen avoiding each other at Rakesh Roshan's birthday bash recently and they also refused Anees Bazmee's offer to star together in 'Welcome Back'.
