'Harry Potter' actor Daniel Radcliffe helped a tourist who was attacked by two men on bikes in London. The victim was walking when the men stole his bag and left him with an injury. "He was a really nice bloke, a lot of stars wouldn't have stopped to help," said a former policeman who tried to intervene during the robbery.
