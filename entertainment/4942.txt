Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge's matinee show at Mumbai's Maratha Mandir was cancelled for the first time in 22 years as the cinema hall held the screening of Shraddha Kapoor's film Haseena Parkar's trailer. This also marked the first time that the iconic theatre held a film's trailer screening. The makers chose the venue as Parkar lived close to Maratha Mandir.
