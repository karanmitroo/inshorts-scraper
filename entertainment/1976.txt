In a video that surfaced online, ex-Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav's sister-in-law Aparna can be seen dancing to the song 'Ghoomar' from 'Padmavati' at a family function. Rajput group Karni Sena said that being a Rajput herself, she's disrespecting the community's sentiments. Earlier, UP government announced Padmavati's release in the state won't be allowed until objectionable scenes are removed.
