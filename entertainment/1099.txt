At least 96 members of Rajput organisation Karni Sena were arrested while they were protesting outside the office of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) over the film 'Padmaavat'. They had gathered outside the office to protest against the Board's decision to allow the film's release. "We want the film to be banned in the whole country," said a member.
