Actor Salman​ Khan's brother Arbaaz Khan has said that Salman will apologise for comparing himself to a "raped woman" if he feels there is a need for it, as his "intention was not wrong". Arbaaz added, "It was a comparison... (like) saying... I worked like a donkey. Now, will the usage of the word ‘donkey’ make animal activists upset?"
