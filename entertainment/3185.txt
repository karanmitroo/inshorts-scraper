Lynda Carter, who first portrayed Wonder Woman in the 1970s TV series, slammed 'Avatar' director James Cameron for calling the superhero character an "objectified icon" and saying Gal Gadot's film is "a step backwards". Carter wrote, "You poor soul...you don't understand the character...Like all women- we're more than the sum of our parts." She added Gadot's film was "spot on".
