In a recent interview, American actor Will Smith indirectly targeted US presidential candidate Donald Trump. "If people keep saying all the crazy kind of stuff they have been saying... about walls and Muslims they are gonna force me into the political arena", Smith said. When asked what post he would run for, Smith said, "I gotta be the president".
