As per latest reports, Aamir Khan and Aishwarya Rai are set to star together in Karan Johar's upcoming film. Both of them have never been together except for one scene in Dharmesh Darshan's Mela. "Aishwarya has never worked with Dharma Productions. It would be a casting coup...Ash and Aamir working for Dharma Productions for the first time," a source said.
