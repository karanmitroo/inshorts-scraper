Anushka Sharma on social media praised Hollywood actress Meryl Streep's acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. Discussing an artiste's need to be non-judgemental, she wrote, "Curbing my need to be liberal is stomping on my right to be a better actor." She further wrote, "If people don't want to see another person's point of view... the artist fails to grow."
