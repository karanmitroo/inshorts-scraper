Producer Siddharth Roy Kapur has said making a biopic on a political figure has become radioactive nowadays. He added that filmmakers are self-censoring the subjects they pick for movies as they're concerned about the Censor Board. "In that process, we might be losing out on interesting stories that should be told, and I hope the environment changes," Siddharth further said.
