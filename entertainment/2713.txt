A New Zealand high court has ordered a political party to pay Eminem's publisher NZ$600,000 (â‚¹2.7 crore) in damages after finding its campaign song 'Eminem Esque' infringed the copyright of Eminem's 'Lose Yourself'. The National party, which claimed it purchased the song through an Australia-based supplier, used 'Eminem Esque' 186 times in its ad campaign before taking it off air.
