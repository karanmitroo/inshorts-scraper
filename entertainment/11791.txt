Actor Ajay Devgn has revealed that his wife Kajol and filmmaker Karan Johar, who were close friends, do not share the same "warm equation" as before. "It is a personal issue... not due to any professional thing," added Devgn. He added that it had nothing to do with the clash of his film 'Shivaay' with Johar's 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'.
