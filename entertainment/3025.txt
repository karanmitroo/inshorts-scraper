The Tamil Nadu government on Saturday issued orders to hike theatre ticket prices by 25%, with the maximum ticket price being ₹160 and the minimum price being ₹50. This comes after Tamil Film Producers Council and exhibitors decided to not release movies from October 6 to protest the implementation of 10% local body tax in addition to the existing GST.
