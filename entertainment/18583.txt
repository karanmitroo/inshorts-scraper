On the occasion of India's 68th Independence Day, actor Aamir Khan launched a special drive to make Jodhpur “a garbage free city”. Inspired by Khan’s TV show Satyamev Jayate, the drive will include door-to-door waste collection through battery-operated rickshaws and scientific disposal of the collected waste. Aamir also announced a donation of Rs. 11 lakh for the project.
