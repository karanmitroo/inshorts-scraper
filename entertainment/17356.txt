Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan has come up in support of the Maharashtra government's controversial decision to make the screening of Marathi films compulsory during evening prime time. "I think every regional cinema should not only be supported but also encouraged," he said. "With this new diktat of 12noon to 9pm I think it is a wonderful timing," SRK added.
