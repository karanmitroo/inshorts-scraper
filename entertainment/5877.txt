According to reports, actor Farhan Akhtar will be seen playing the role of a boxer in an upcoming film, which will be directed by Mohit Suri. The film will feature Farhan playing the dual role of son and father across two different eras. Though it'll be an original story, it will bear similarities to 1979 film 'The Champ', said Suri.
