Anthony Horowitz, the author of James Bond novel 'Trigger Mortis', has sparked a row after he referred to Idris Elba as "too street" and not "suave" enough to play the lead role in the spy movie. Horowitz later apologised for his remarks after people started criticising him on social media. "I admit it was a poor choice of word," he said.
