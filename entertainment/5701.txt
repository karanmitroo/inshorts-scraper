Actor Rajinikanth was on Sunday reminded about his promise of donating â‚¹1 crore for the interlinking of rivers by a farmers' association. The actor had made the promise in 2002 over Cauvery water-sharing dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Upon being reminded, Rajinikanth offered the money but the association requested him to donate it directly to the Centre.
