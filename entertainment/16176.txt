The I&B Ministry has suspended screening of documentary “Caste on the Menu Card”, reportedly inspired by Mumbai's beef-eating practices. It was to be screened at a festival but was the only one among 35 films to be refused Censor Board clearance exemption owing to the “current political situation”. The ministry added, “adequate information about the film” was not provided.
