Actress Anushka Sharma has said that she does not want to talk about her relationship with cricketer Virat Kohli as the media is interested only in "scoops". "How can meeting someone become such big news?... I was giving some of my best performances but in an interview, the headline would always be about my personal life," said Anushka.
