Hollywood action-comedy 'Hot Pursuit' that released worldwide this week is an engaging film and an enjoyable no-brainer with a feel-good effect, wrote IANS. The movie, featuring Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, is a typical Hollywood chick flick without a shred of good humour, said mid-day. The film has been rated 3/5 (IANS, The Guardian and IB Times) and 1/5 (mid-day).
