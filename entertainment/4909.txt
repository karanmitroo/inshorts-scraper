Actress Bhagyashree has revealed in a Humans of Bombay Facebook post that when she decided to get married after the 1989 film 'Maine Pyar Kiya' which marked her Bollywood debut, late filmmaker Yash Johar told her she's being foolish. She added, "I loved being foolish! Very often, people say 'giving up such a bright career' is backward, but I disagree."
