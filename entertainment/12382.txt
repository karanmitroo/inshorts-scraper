Singer Asha Bhosle, who turned 83 on Thursday said that if a biopic is made on her, actress Priyanka Chopra would be "perfect" to portrayâ€‹ her onscreen because "she is also a singer". She added that a biopic on music composer and her husband late RD Burman should also be made "so that people get to hear his music again".
