To counter the on-going 'Award Wapsi' phenomenon, actor Anupam Kher will lead a protest march to the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday. The actor, along with top Bollywood actors and even common people, will meet President Pranab Mukherjee. "It will be a campaign for truth," Kher said. Those returning their awards are "intolerant to the Narendra Modi government", he added.
