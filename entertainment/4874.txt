Nisheeth Jha, husband of 'Jagga Jasoos' actress Bidisha Bezbaruah who allegedly committed suicide earlier this week, has been sent to 14 days in judicial custody. This comes after his arrest on charges of abetment of suicide, after Bidisha's father accused him of having an extra-marital affair. The police said that Jha admitted to being in a relationship with another woman.
