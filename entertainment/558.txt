Talking about people being judgemental towards single women, Tabu said, "I think our society has a problem accepting that a woman can be single by choice." She added, "People do it out of concern. They will always be curious about single women, more so a celebrity." Tabu further said she used to get bothered by it earlier but not anymore.
