Filmmaker Kamaluddin Muhammed has said that one Vidya Balan can't take his dream away, after the actress quit his upcoming biopic on late poetess Kamala Das. "As you know, Kamala Das had converted to Islam. Iâ€‰think Vidya was scared to portray her," he added. Muhammed further said that maybe Vidya was under pressure because her recent films had failed.
