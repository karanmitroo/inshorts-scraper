Claiming the film to have a message against drug abuse and alcoholism, the producers of 'MSG: The Messenger' have sought an exemption from the 30% entertainment tax in Haryana. A committee would watch the film to judge if it qualifies for exemption. The film, having Dera Sacha Sauda chief Ram Rahim in the lead, was banned in Punjab.
