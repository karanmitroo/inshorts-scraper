Salman Khan was initially offered the role of Kabir Khan in the blockbuster film 'Chak De! India', which released 9 years ago, on August 10, 2007. It was later played by Shah Rukh Khan, after Salman turned it down saying "I wish they hadnâ€™t added India to the title. I felt our fans in Pakistan and Bangladesh might feel bad."
