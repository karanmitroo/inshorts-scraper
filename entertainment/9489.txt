'Dangal' actress Zaira Wasim slammed Sports Minister Vijay Goel, after he tweeted a painting's photograph showing one woman wearing hijab and another inside a cage. "This painting tells a story similar to @zairawasim," Goel captioned the photo. In response, Zaira tweeted that Goel shouldn't have connected her to "such a discourteous depiction" and women in hijab are "beautiful and free".
