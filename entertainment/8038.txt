'Baahubali 2' director SS Rajamouli said that the leak of the film's Tamil trailer on Thursday morning was due to a technical glitch on Facebook. He added that the video which was supposed to be in private mode went into public mode. However, he said that he was happy with the kind of response that the trailer received.
