Singer-composer AR Rahman paid a tribute to the late Carnatic vocalist MS Subbulakshmi at the UN General Assembly Hall by performing renditions of her music and compositions. Rahman became the second Indian after Subbulakshmi to perform at the event. This year marks her birth centenary and also the 50th anniversary of her performance at the UN.
