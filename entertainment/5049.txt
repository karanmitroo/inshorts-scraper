The trailer of 'The Argumentative Indian', an upcoming documentary on Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen has been released. This comes after the Censor Board stalled the film's release over the use of words 'cow', 'Gujarat', 'Hindutva view of India' and 'Hindu India', among others. The documentary has been directed by Suman Ghosh.
