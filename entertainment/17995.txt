Central Board of Film Certification member Satish Kalyankar claimed on Monday that he had objected to some of the scenes of 'PK' ahead of the film's release. However, the board's CEO paid no heed to his concerns, he said. Kalyankar, who is also a member of the film screening committee, added that the film certainly violates the already laid rules.
