'Driving with Selvi', a Canadian documentary features South India's first female taxi driver, Selvi. "The documentary aims to inspire women to break out of traditional roles," director Elisa Paloschi said. Married at 14 to an abusive husband who forced her into prostitution, the documentary chronicles Selvi's escape and her ten-year-long journey of finding her voice, defying patriarchal codes.
