Actor Upen Patel was evicted from the reality show 'Bigg Boss 8' in a surprise midweek elimination on Thursday. The '36 China Town' actor was nominated for this week's elimination with five other co-contestants. "I was completely surprised that I got eliminated. My elimination was little different as it came very late at night," he said.
