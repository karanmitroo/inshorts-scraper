The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished unauthorised cabins and cubicles built inside Anil Kapoor's Mumbai office. "One needs permission to construct partitions and full height cabins. We had given a prior intimation to his office to apply for permission but it was ignored," said a BMC officer. The officer added, "They could have easily paid a penalty and regularised it."
