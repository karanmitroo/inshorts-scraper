According to sources, producer Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar have finalised Katrina Kaif and Sidharth Malhotra for their upcoming high concept love story, that will be directed by first-time director Nitya Mehra. Notably, this is the same script that Aamir Khan had loved and was to do, but opted out as the financials did not work out.
