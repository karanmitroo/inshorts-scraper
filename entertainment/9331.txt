Punjabi actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh, who won a Filmfare Award for his Bollywood debut 'Udta Punjab', said that he is not hurt by actor Harshvardhan Kapoor's comment that debutant awards should be for people relatively new to films. "For me the love of my fans matter the most and that's the biggest award for me," added Diljit.
