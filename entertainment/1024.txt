The producers of Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directorial 'Padmaavat' moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging the ban on the film in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana. Chief Justice Dipak Misra will reportedly hear the petition on Thursday. Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan talked about banning it in the state but an official announcement regarding the same is yet to be made.
