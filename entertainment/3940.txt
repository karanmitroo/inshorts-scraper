Actress Kalki Koechlin has said that it is wrong to blame only ousted Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani for how the board functioned during his tenure. "I think it's a combination of people that make up the board... they were equally responsible for whatever happened when (Nihalani) was the chairperson," added Kalki.
