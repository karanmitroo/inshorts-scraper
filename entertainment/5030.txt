Bengali actor Prosenjit Chatterjee has said that the recently implemented Goods and Services Tax (GST) has affected not only the Bengali film industry but the entire film industry. He added, "We in the Bengali film industry cannot do anything alone against GST overnight. So I think we have to find a way out collectively."
