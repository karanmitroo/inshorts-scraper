Iranian director Majid Majidi has said that when he asked actress Deepika Padukone for a look test for his film 'Beyond The Clouds', it was not to doubt her professionalism. "She is an excellent actress. But how much she befits the role, that is in my vision," said Majidi. He added that because of unfavourable circumstances, Deepika couldn't be cast.
