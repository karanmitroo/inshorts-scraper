Kamal Haasan, while talking about Rajinikanth's comments on Tamil Nadu politics, said, "He didn't say anything wrong or new." He added people should realise politics is not a place to earn money. When asked if only a Tamilian should lead Tamil Nadu, he responded, "We have had leaders like Gandhi, Nehru and Bose. Were they Tamilians? Weren't they accepted?"
