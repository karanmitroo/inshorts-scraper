The body of a man was found hanging at the Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur, Rajasthan with a message inscribed on rocks next to the body which read, "We don't just hang effigies, Padmavati." Police are uncertain if this was a case of murder or suicide. This comes amid protests against the film 'Padmavati' by groups like Rajput organisation Karni Sena.
