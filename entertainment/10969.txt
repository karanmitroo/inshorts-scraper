Actress Kareena Kapoor has said that neither Deepika Padukone nor Katrina Kaif was a good girlfriend for her cousin Ranbir Kapoor. She made the statement on the audio talk show #NoFilterNeha, hosted by actress Neha Dhupia. Kareena, however, chose Deepika as the better actress while saying that "there is no comparison" between Deepika and Katrina as actresses.
