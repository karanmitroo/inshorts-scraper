'Pink' actor Vijay Varma has said after the film he only got offers to play a molester. "Everyone wanted me to do a role where I'd put a girl in the car and molest her," he added. Vijay further said, "It's pretty interesting that the trend could be so strong to see an actor only in a certain light."
