Actress Anushka Sharma has said she is happy that with Katrina Kaif and her, things are transparent and real. "Whether I get along with someone or don't, doesn't matter. I don't need to get along with everybody around me. It's just the vibe thing," she added. Katrina and Anushka will be seen together in Aanand L Rai's upcoming film.
