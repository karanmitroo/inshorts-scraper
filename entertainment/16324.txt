The American Broadcasting Company (ABC), while promoting its latest show 'Quantico' on its late night bulletin, aired pictures of former Miss World Yukta Mookhey instead of Priyanka Chopra. However, it immediately apologised for the error by tweeting, "Our sincerest apologies @priyankachopra".  Yukta was crowned Miss World in 1999 and was succeeded by Priyanka in 2000.
