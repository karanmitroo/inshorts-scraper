Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman has said, "If a woman decides...to have sex with a Hollywood producer to advance her career and actually does it and finds the whole thing offensive, that's not rape." "You made a conscious decision that you're willing to do something that is personally offensive in order to advance your career," he further said.
