Actress Rhea Chakraborty (21), who made her debut last year with 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti', has filed a police complaint accusing an unnamed man of groping her in her apartment complex's elevator on Tuesday. "I just got groped by a very well dressed man who casually walks into my building in broad daylight," the former VJ tweeted.
