The clothes used by actors are known to be locked in trunks, labelled with their movie names, after a shoot is over. These clothes may later be mix-matched and used by junior artists in other movies. On some occasions, actors are allowed to keep a certain outfit or 'iconic' outfits are auctioned to raise money for charity.
