Filmmaker Rakesh Sharma and actor Anupam Kher have been engaged in social media spat over the former's documentary, "The Final Solution". Sharma alleged that Kher lied in a recent television appearance about having cleared his film in 2004 as then censor board chief. While Kher reiterated his stand tweeting, "Let him produce d proof tat I did't pass his documentary."
