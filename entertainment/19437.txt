Rajasthan High Court has granted a stay on the conviction of Salman Khan in the 1998 poaching case. Khan had moved a petition that despite HC's permission to go abroad, some countries were not granting him visa since he was convicted. This order would help him get visa from countries that do not allow convicts to visit.
