The government on Friday set up a committee to revamp the Censor Board, with veteran filmmaker Shyam Benegal as its head. The committee has five other members, including director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, and is "expected to provide a holistic framework" for certification of films. The committee has been given two months time to submit its recommendations to the government.
