YouTube personality Navpreet Banga, who is said to bear an "uncanny" resemblance to actress Priyanka Chopra, has said that she does not want to be known as Priyanka's lookalike. "I feel that it's discrediting so much that I do," added Navpreet. She further said that she rejected 'Big Boss 11' because she was approached only for her resemblance to Priyanka.
