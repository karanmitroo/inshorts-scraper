Akshay Kumar has said he doesn't want anybody to say he's only an action or a comedy hero. He added, "I want people to think...ye koi bhi role kar leta hai." Akshay further said that in the first fourteen years of his career, he was typecast as an action hero and it was difficult to come out of that image.
