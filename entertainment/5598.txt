A picture of Govinda from the sets of the upcoming Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif starrer 'Jagga Jasoos' has surfaced online. Reports suggest that Govinda shot for a cameo in the film, but later walked out of it citing irreconcilable differences with director Anurag Basu. Govinda was reportedly cast as a detective who helps Ranbir Kapoor's character find his father.
