Tiger Shroff, who was criticised for referring to his co-stars as "padding", said that he made the remark very casually, while adding, "It's so funny how using one wrong word can screw up your career." Tiger further said that he is not a sexist or racist person. He added, "I don't get under people's skin or pick up unnecessary fights."
