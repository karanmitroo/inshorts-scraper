Actress Swara Bhaskar has said that the Hindi film heroine has lost the burden of being an angelic character. She added that the definition of a heroine as only virtuous and sexually-unthreatening, and the vamp as sexually promiscuous and expressive, has changed. "The fact that [heroines] can be grey, complicated and confused...is a very positive development," added Swara.
