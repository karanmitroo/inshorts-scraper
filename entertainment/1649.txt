Egyptian singer Shyma has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting debauchery in a music video in which she was seen eating an apple and a banana before a classroom of young men. The singer was arrested last month after the video sparked criticism and had denied the accusations, saying the director included the scenes without her consent.
