Actor Jackie Shroff has said his son Tiger is like a horse, as he focuses a lot on his work. "If he gets into any kind of work... he doesn't look anywhere as he only looks ahead and I feel people should lead their life like that only," he added. He further said Tiger's mentality is different from his own.
