Actor and comedian Bill Cosby while referring to the movement against sexual harassment '#MeToo', said, "Please don't put me on #MeToo." In 2017, a sexual assault case against Cosby ended in a mistrial. The trial was based on accusations by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who was allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted by Cosby in 2004.
