Indian Film and Television Producer Council (IFTPC) is considering a two-year ban to refrain Pakistani artistes from working in Bollywood. Producer Vashu Bhagnani said that he could not undo using Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's song in his film 'Welcome To New York'. He added, "I assure all of you that my next ventures won't feature any Pakistani artistes."
