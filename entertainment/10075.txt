Actor Ryan Gosling has said that he spent around three months learning to play the piano for his role as an LA-based jazz musician 'Sebastian' in the film 'La La Land'. "The piano was something that I always wished I had time to learn... It was really one of the most fulfilling pre-production periods I've ever had," said Gosling.
