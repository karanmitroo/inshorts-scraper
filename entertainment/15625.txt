Pakistani authorities have filed an FIR against the new owners of Bollywood actor-director Raj Kapoorâ€™s haveli in Peshawar after they demolished the first floor to construct a plaza. The haveli was constructed by Prithviraj Kapoor in 1920, which the family vacated during the India-Pakistan partition. It is a Pakistani national heritage site and can not be modified without government approval.
