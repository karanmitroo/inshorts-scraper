A day after Oscars 2014 host Ellen DeGeneres's selfie shot, Shah Rukh Khan joined his Bollywood colleagues Mandira Bedi, Kunal Kohli, Tarun Mansukhani and Punit Malhotra to create his own 'selfie' moment. Bedi posted the selfie on Twitter which has received over 750 retweets. The selfie was clicked during a bash thrown by watch brand Tag Heuer endorsed by SRK.
