Actor-comedian Sunil Grover has tweeted that for him, money can't be the only reason to do something, or not to do something. "My intentions are to act and to entertain with dignity," he added. His comments come at a time when he is said to have left The Kapil Sharma Show along with Asghar Ali, Chandan Prabhakar and Sugandha Mishra.
