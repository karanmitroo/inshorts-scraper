Parineeti Chopra, while speaking about reports that actresses don't get along together on film sets, said spreading such rumours at the cost of actors isn't fair. She also gave examples of her films 'Ladies vs Ricky Bahl' and 'Shuddh Desi Romance' in which she worked with other actresses. "We work day and night to be professional and loving," she added.
