Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the actor and director of the 'MSG' film series, has claimed that Hollywood filmmaker James Cameron's 2009 film 'Avatar' is inspired from the 'Hanuman Chalisa', a text of the Hindu religion. Ram Rahim further claimed that Cameron first studied the religious text, researched on it and then made the Oscar-winning film.
