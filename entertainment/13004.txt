Marilyn Monroe agreed to pose nude for only $50 in 1949, because she "was a week behind on rent...and needed the money". The photos, featuring a nude Monroe against a red velvet background, appeared in the Golden Dreams calendar and later featured in Playboy's first issue. The actress died 54 years ago on August 5, 1962.
