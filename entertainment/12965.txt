The Rio opening ceremony on Friday is set to feature a transgender model for the first time. Model Lea T, who was born biologically male before having sex reassignment surgery, will be a part of the proceedings at Rioâ€™s Maracana Stadium, but her role is kept a secret. The ceremony will also include supermodel Gisele Bundchen.
