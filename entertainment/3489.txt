The body of Pravish Chanam, a 22-year-old youth from Manipur who had been missing after attending 'The Chainsmokers' concert in Noida, was found cremated. The local police cremated the body after failing to recognise it for 72 hours. Three officers were suspended for laxity as the body was cremated without informing Pravish's family despite a missing report being filed.
