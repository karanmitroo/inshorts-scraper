Music composer Anu Malik has said that as there are seven notes in music, no one is original in the world. He called 'Ek Garam Chai ki Pyali Ho' an iconic song of his even though the song is said to be copied from Queens' 'We Will Rock You'. Anu added that even RD Burman was influenced by many songs.
