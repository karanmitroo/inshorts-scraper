'Tevar', which is a remake of the 2003 hit Telugu film 'Okkadu', released Friday and features Arjun Kapoor, Sonakshi Sinha and Manoj Bajpayee in lead roles. The movie directed by Amit Sharma is outdated, lacks the punch and has too much gratuitous violence, writes NDTV. The movie has been rated 1/5 (India Today), 1.5/5 (Indian Express, HT) and 2/5 (NDTV).
