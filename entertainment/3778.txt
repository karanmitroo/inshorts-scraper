Members of women's organisations including the AP Mahila Samakhya and the AP Mahila Congress have demanded a ban on Vijay Deverakonda starrer film 'Arjun Reddy', which they allege encourages dating culture during college life. The activists have also slammed the film for showing drug use. They further asked the film's producer if he would watch it with his family members.
