The doctor, who had collected Salman Khan's blood samples over 10 hours after the 2002 hit-and-run case, Thursday told the Mumbai sessions court that the actor smelt of alcohol, but wasn't under its influence. "I took the patient history but he denied he had consumed alcohol. After that I did my examination for blood test," the doctor added.
