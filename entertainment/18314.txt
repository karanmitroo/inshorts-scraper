Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan and wife Suzzane Khan were Saturday granted divorce by a family court in Mumbai. Both arrived in separate vehicles. However, there was no sign of bitterness. Filing for a mutual consent divorce about 6 months ago, Hrithik and Suzzane had decided to end their 13-yr-old marriage on a good note.
