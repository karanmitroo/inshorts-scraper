Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan, who produced the Sonakshi Sinha and Sidharth Malhotra starrer 'Ittefaq', have been served a strict compliance notice by Delhi Health Department for promoting smoking in the film. "One of the promotional posters show Akshaye Khanna lighting a cigarette, which encourages younger generation and promotes tobacco," said an official from the department.
