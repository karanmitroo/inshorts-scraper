Filmmaker Vikas Bahl has said that his next venture will be a biopic on mathematician Anand Kumar, who is credited with starting an educational initiative to prepare thirty meritorious but financially-challenged students for the IIT examination. "We will shoot the film extensively in Bihar, so that we can capture the right essence of the story," said Bahl.
