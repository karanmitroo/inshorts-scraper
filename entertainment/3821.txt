Filmmaker Karan Johar has shared a picture of his twins Roohi and Yash on Instagram which he captioned, "My world 2.0." Karan had announced in March that he became a father to twins via surrogacy. While Yash is named after Karan's late father filmmaker Yash Johar, Roohi is said to be a rearrangement of his mother's name, Hiroo.
