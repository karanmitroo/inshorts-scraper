Hollywood director Christopher Nolan has slammed video streaming service Netflix for not releasing its movies in cinemas. "Netflix has a bizarre aversion to supporting theatrical films... [T]hey're not even getting in the game, and I think they're missing a huge opportunity," he added. Nolan further said Netflix is being used as a kind of way to shut down cinemas.
