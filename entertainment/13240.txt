Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch's father has said that his son Waseem, who strangled Qandeel in a case of honour killing, should be "shot on sight". "He suffocated my little one... We were drugged, asleep upstairs. She must have called out to us," said Baloch's father Anwar Azeem. He added that Qandeel was his "best friend" but Waseem had been "crazed".
