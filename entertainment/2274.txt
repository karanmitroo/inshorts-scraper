Speaking about the row on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati', actor Farhan Akhtar said, "I genuinely believe that we should stop treating our audiences as children." "We should allow them to grow, allow them to be exposed to different kind of ideas, cultures, to counter thinking," he added. Farhan further said he is totally against anything being banned.
