Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt will reprise their roles in the sequel to their 1991 film 'Sadak'. Two more actors, who are yet to be cast, will also be part of the film. "This film like 'Aashiqui 2' [will make] you believe in love at a time when it's so easy to walk away from a relationship," said Pooja.
