Singer Selena Gomez has announced that she is taking "some time off" from her career to deal with panic attacks and depression, which can be side effects of lupus, an autoimmune disease she suffers from. "I want to be proactive and focus on maintaining my health and happiness," said Selena while announcing her decision, midway through her 'Revival World Tour'.
