Minister of State for Human Resource Development Mahendra Nath Pandey has launched a 3.35-minute video of the National Anthem in sign language. The video features Amitabh Bachchan along with physically challenged children performing the anthem in sign language. Pandey said PM Narendra Modi had suggested the term 'divyang' (divine body) be used instead of 'viklang' for persons with disabilities.
