American rapper B.o.B has started a crowdfunding campaign "Show BoB The Curve" which aims to raise $1 million to "launch satellites into space" to find if the Earth is flat. With an initial $1,000 from B.o.B, the campaign has raised over $2,500 so far. Last year, B.o.B got into a Twitter fight with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson over the matter.
