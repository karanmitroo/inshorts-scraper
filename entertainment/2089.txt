Yesteryear actress Simi Garewal is in talks with Jaipur's Maharani Padmini Devi, who is her friend, over Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmavati'. "She said there was basically one problematic point in the trailer and that was the Ghoomar. There is actually no other problem," said Simi. She added, "Once the Maharani approves, the protests will automatically die down."
