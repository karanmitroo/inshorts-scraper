'Wonder Woman' director Patty Jenkins has slammed 'Avatar' director James Cameron for referring to the character 'Wonder Woman' as "an objectified icon". Cameron had said the film is "male Hollywood doing the same old thing". Replying to this, Jenkins wrote, "I believe women can and should be everything...like male lead characters...There is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman."
