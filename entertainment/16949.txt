The Bombay High Court on Tuesday adjourned Bollywood choreographer Geeta Kapoor's petition, which sought quashing of the case registered against her for rash and negligent driving and injuring a person, for two weeks. Geeta's advocate informed the court that she had reached a financial settlement with the victim, but the latter was not satisfied with the amount paid.
