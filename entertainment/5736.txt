Fifty Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Johnson has said that she would be mad to be a part of any future films in the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' franchise. Sam also revealed that she would have fights with the book's author EL James over every scene. "Two different creative visions...It was like wading uphill through sticky tar," added Sam.
