Guests at a club in Delhi have reportedly demanded a refund of their money after actor-turned-disc jockey Bobby Deol kept playing tracks from his 1997 film 'Gupt' on loop. Bobby was invited to perform at the club last month and all tickets were sold out in advance. Reportedly, Bobby had left the venue by the time the commotion started.
