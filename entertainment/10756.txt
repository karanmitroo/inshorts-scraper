Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday personally handed a new Russian passport to Hollywood actor Steven Seagal, and said he hoped the gesture showed "normalisation" of strained relations with the US. Putin added that citizenship talks with Seagel had been going on for a while and they agreed it must be an "absolutely depoliticised act".
