Akshay Kumar has suggested having a mixed cricket team similar to mixed doubles in tennis. "[W]hy can't there be a men and women cricket match against another country? If this kind of a set-up happens, it'll be the biggest set-up ever," he added. Akshay further said the idea struck him when he was watching a Wimbledon match on his phone.
