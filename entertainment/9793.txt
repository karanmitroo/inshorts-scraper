Actor Arbaaz Khan has said he is very amicable with estranged wife Malaika Arora after their split. "I have a child who is growing up, so there's a lot of parenting responsibilities...it can only happen if the atmosphere between us is very conducive and normal," he added. Arbaaz and Malaika, who have a 14-year-old son, filed for divorce last year.
