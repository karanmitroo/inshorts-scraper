Maharashtrian community in Pune is set to protest on Saturday against the upcoming Bollywood film 'Bajirao Mastani'. They are demanding removal of two songs - 'Pinga' and 'Malhari' - from the film. Mumbai-based professor Prakash Khandge alleged that 'Malhari' insults Bajirao and his bravery, while 'Pinga' is choreographed "wrong" and has revealing costumes which insults Bajirao's wife Kashibai.
