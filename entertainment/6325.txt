American journalist David Leavitt has been slammed for his tweet following the blast at singer Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester. He wrote that he almost died the last time he listened to the singer. He later apologised while tweeting, "Sorry 4 offending. Didn't realize the magnitude of the tragedy. I always make stupid jokes about whatever's trending."
