Swara Bhaskar's Anaarkali of Aarah "brings forth a world (of marginalised sections) that's out of focus and needs our attention," wrote Hindustan Times. "The film could've done with much more passion and flair," wrote NDTV while Mid-Day said, "This is feisty Swara...it's hard to come across a performance so gut-wrenchingly real." It was rated 3.5/5 (Mid-Day), 3/5 (HT), 2/5 (NDTV).
