Actor Sushant Singh Rajput took a dig at former India captain Sourav Ganguly, after MS Dhoni's match-winning knock for Rising Pune Supergiant against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Saturday. Ganguly had earlier raised doubts about Dhoni's T20-playing ability, at which Sushant tweeted after the match, "Wonder where are the Experts now". Sushant had earlier also defended Dhoni on Twitter.
