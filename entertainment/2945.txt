Malayalam film 'Sexy Durga', which was denied exemption to be screened at the Jio MAMI festival due to its title, has been cleared by Censor Board with 21 audio cuts and will now release as 'S Durga'. "Now when I see the name, I feel really crazy because it is a representation of typical mindset," said director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan.
