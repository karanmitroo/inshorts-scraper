Natalie Portman revealed that co-star Ashton Kutcher was paid three times more than her for the 2011 film 'No Strings Attached'. "I wasn't as pissed as I should have been... but the disparity is crazy," she added. Natalie further said, "[I]n most professions, women make 80 cents to the dollar. In Hollywood, we are making 30 cents to the dollar".
