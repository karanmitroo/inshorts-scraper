Katrina Kaif has said that she knew Ranbir Kapoor's film Rocket Singh would be a flop and had told him that it is quite boring. Ranbir added, "After Rocket Singh, I thought I made a Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. but then we all know that the film didnâ€™t work." He also said that as an actor, one cannot predict box-office success.
