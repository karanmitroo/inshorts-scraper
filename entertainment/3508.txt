American Network HBO's President of Programming, Casey Bloys has said that the network will shoot multiple endings for 'Game of Thrones' Season 8 "so that nobody really knows what happens". Bloys added, "When you're shooting something, people know. So they're going to shoot multiple versions so that there's no real definitive answer until the end."
