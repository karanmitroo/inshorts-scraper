Filmmaker Sajid Khan has said for twenty years, he made a career out of making fun of people's films, their songs and their acting prowess. "I wish I was more cunning, then I wouldn't have said half the things I had said to the media," added Sajid. He further said he's a changed person now and has become more approachable.
