The Blackbuck poaching case started in 1998 when Salman Khan, along with Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, and Sonali Bendre allegedly hunted down two blackbucks in Rajasthan. The local Bishnoi community filed a complaint, and Salman was taken into custody for five days. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment in 2006, but was acquitted by the Rajasthan High Court on Monday.
