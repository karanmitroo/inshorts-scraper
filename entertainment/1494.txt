Right-wing group Hindu Jagran Manch has written to the Censor Board while protesting outside its regional office against the Bengali film 'Rong Beronger Kori' for naming the protagonists after Ram and Sita. The film reportedly features a tribal couple named Ram and Sita, who are shown getting divorced. The group called it a deliberate ploy to hurt Hindu sentiments.
