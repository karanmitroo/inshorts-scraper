Actor-producer Anushka Sharma is, in a new “throwback” video, seen loudly singing British singer Adele’s hit song “Rolling in the Deep”. She is not really out of tune in the 30-second video but her notes and pitch become unsteady. The accompanying tweet reads “Found gold! Unabashed bad singing with no fear OR concern for the health of peeps around #ThrowBack”.
