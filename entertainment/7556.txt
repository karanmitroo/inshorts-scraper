Actress-singer Doris Day found out on her 93rd birthday that she is actually two years older, after journalists obtained a copy of her birth certificate. Doris was born in 1922, meaning she turned 95-years-old on April 3. "I have always said that age is just a number...but it's great to finally know how old I really am!" said Day.
