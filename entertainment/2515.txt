Former Bigg Boss contestant Swami Om has claimed Dhinchak Pooja's song 'Selfie Maine Le Li Aaj' was written and composed by him. "Dhinchak Pooja [knew] that I'm a big 'tantrik'. She wanted to be famous," he added. Swami Om further said when she approached him, he was in the mood to take a selfie and hence recommended the lyrics.
