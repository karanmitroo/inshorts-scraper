The Malayalam actress who was abducted and assaulted, while responding to being victim-shamed by Kerala MLA PC George, wrote, "What do people like PC George think? I should have committed suicide?" She wrote this in an open letter shared on Facebook. Earlier, the MLA had said, "If she was attacked how can she act in movies the very next day."
