Actress Kangana Ranaut, while giving an acceptance speech at the GQ Men of The Year Awards 2016, said that her hotness was "underrated". "I go to the gym! Nobody talks about my abs. Not that I have any, but I have a fairly flat stomach...," joked Kangana. The actress was named 'Woman of the Year' at the awards ceremony.
