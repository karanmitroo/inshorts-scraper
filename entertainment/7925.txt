Actor Manoj Bajpayee has said that he doesn't attend Bollywood parties because people pretend to be someone else. He added, "And in parties you're not gaining anything, you are just a part of the crowd which I don't want." Manoj further said that he would rather be in a small get-together where he gets to interact with everybody.
