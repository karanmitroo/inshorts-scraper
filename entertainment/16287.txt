Playboy Inc CEO Scott Flanders has revealed that Playboy magazine will stop publishing fully nude photographs from March 2016. The company's founder Hugh Hefner has agreed on the proposal as part of a redesigning effort which is aimed at setting the magazine apart from pornographic material easily available on the internet. The pictures featured will reportedly be more "PG-13."
