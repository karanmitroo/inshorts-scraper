Priyanka Chopra, while talking about producer Harvey Weinstein who has been accused of sexual harassment by over 30 women, said, "There is not just 'a Harvey Weinstein' in Hollywood, there are many. It happens everywhere." Priyanka added, "It's not just about sexuality...It's about power. It's an isolating feeling. The easiest thing to take away from a woman is her work."
