Actor Jim Carrey's lawyer Marty Singer has claimed that the charge against the actor of infecting his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White with three sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is "bogus". The allegations were made by White's estranged husband Mark Burton, who added that the incident triggered White's suicide as the actor dumped her after that. Carrey's lawyer termed the claims as 'defamatory'.
