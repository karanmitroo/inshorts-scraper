Television actor Hiten Tejwani has been evicted from the reality show Bigg Boss 11 as his co-contestants chose another contestant Priyank Sharma over him, during the elimination round this week. "This kind of eviction is a first...We (Priyank and me) had the same number of votes. However, Bigg Boss asked the housemates (contestants) to save one of us," said Hiten.
