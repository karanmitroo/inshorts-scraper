Kamal Haasan, while reacting to National Commission for Women's demand for an apology over naming the actress in the abduction case, said he'll not bend in front of anyone. "Apologise say women, while I love and fight for them," he tweeted. "If you still want me to apologise I will. No one is above law except your gods," he added.
