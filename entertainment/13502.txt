Sylvester Stallone, who turned 70 on Wednesday, claims that he sold his bullmastiff dog Butkus for $50 in early 1970s to make ends meet. The struggling actor was trying to sell his script for ‘Rocky’ and didn't have money for food. Once the film series was finalised, Stallone bought his dog back for $3,000, who starred in two 'Rocky' films.
