Actress Priyanka Chopra on Tuesday slammed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s call to ban Muslim immigrants from the US. "I just think you can’t put a ban on anyone. Generalising a type of people is really primitive," said Priyanka. Sharing her views at the TIME 100 gala, she added, “You can’t put a face on it (terrorism) any more”.
