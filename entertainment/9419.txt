Singer Madonna, in an Instagram post, wrote that her remark on 'blowing up the White House', which she made during her speech at the Women's March, was said metaphorically. "I don't promote violence...people should understand my speech in entirety," she wrote. Her post's concluding lines read, "Acting out of anger doesn't solve anything...only way to change things...is...with love."
