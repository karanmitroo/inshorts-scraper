Actor Jackky Bhagnani, who has co-produced the upcoming short film 'Carbon', revealed that actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Prachi Desai did not charge any money for it. "They were very generous... Both Prachi and Nawazuddin worked for free," he added. The film is set in 2067, where oxygen has become a commodity and the only component available for free is carbon.
