An interview of Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci admitting to filming a rape scene in the 1972 film 'Last Tango in Paris' without the consent of the actress Maria Schneider, has emerged online. Maria was 19 during the filming. "I didn't tell her what was going on... I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress," said Bernardo.
