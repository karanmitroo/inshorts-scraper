Actress Huma Qureshi turned showstopper for designer Rina Dhaka's show at the India Couture Week 2017. "I think she (Rina) understands the Indian body so well," said Huma. Young girls from the NGO 'Smile Foundation' also walked the ramp alongside models as the designer was supporting the NGO's '#HonorTheSmile' campaign, which champions the cause of girl child empowerment.
