Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has said that nobody in her life has ever stood by her the way her six children have. "They really help me so much. We're really such a unit. They're the best friends I've ever had," she added. Referring to her split from Brad Pitt, Angelina further said, "It's very, very difficult, a very painful situation."
