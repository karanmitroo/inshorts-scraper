Ousted CBFC Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that he believes filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has been singing songs after his exit as Censor Board chief. "He has been openly campaigning against my tenure...there is no hidden agenda in his malice. It's all out in the open," added Nihalani. He further said that he is glad to bring happiness in Anurag's life.
