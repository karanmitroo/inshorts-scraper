An American who has been eating a picture of actor Jason Segel every day for nearly two months has revealed that he almost died while eating Segel's picture. Noah Maloney said, "I almost died last week from doing it... Jason Segel would have killed me." However, Maloney said he would continue his stunt until Segel ate a picture of him.
