Actor Aamir Khan avoided a query on the screening of Pakistani films being banned at the 18th Mumbai International Film Festival (MAMI). When asked about his opinion on the objection to screening of Pakistani films at MAMI and the 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' row, Aamir said, "MAMI se poocho", before walking off. Last year, Aamir's comments on intolerance sparked controversy.
