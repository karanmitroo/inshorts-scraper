Actor Sanjay Dutt has apologised over his bodyguards assaulting local media persons in Agra. Dutt was reportedly present when the attack took place. Earlier this week, the shooting of Sanjay's film 'Bhoomi' had to be stopped as crowds, which had gathered to get a glimpse of the actor, went out of control.
