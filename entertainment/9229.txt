After filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali was manhandled, a Hindu Sena member Sahab Singh issued a death threat to entire Bollywood, warning them of dire consequences if they dare to come out in support of Bhansali. "If theyâ€™ll shoot Padmavati in Mumbai then we will vandalise the set there too. It's a Hindu nation," said Singh.
