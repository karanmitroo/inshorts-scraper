Rajput organisation Karni Sena's member Mahipal Singh Makrana has said the group wants names of the characters in 'Padmavati' to be changed, following Censor Board's suggestion that the film's title should be changed to 'Padmavat'. "I appeal to PM Modi to take cognisance, otherwise the Central Government and the state government will be responsible for the dire consequences," he added.
