A Los Angeles-based writer Anna Graham Hunter claimed that Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Dustin Hoffman sexually harassed her when she was 17. She was interning with Hoffman's 'Death of a Salesman' TV film during the incident. "One morning, I went to his dressing room to take his breakfast order...(and) he said, 'I'll have a hard-boiled egg...and a soft-boiled clitoris'," alleged Hunter.
