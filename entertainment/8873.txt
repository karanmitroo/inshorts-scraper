The Grammy Awards are named after the gramophone, which was a device used for recording and replaying sound. The award is also modelled to look like the musical apparatus. The first annual Grammy Awards took place on May 4, 1959 simultaneously in Los Angeles and New York. The 59th annual Grammy Awards function was held on Monday.
