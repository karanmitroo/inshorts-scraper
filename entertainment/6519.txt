Baahubali 2 has been given an NC16 certification in Singapore, which means the film is not suitable for viewership under the age of 16, as the movie was deemed too violent. In reference to this, Indian Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani, stated, "The war scenes, especially of soldiers being beheaded, were taken to be excessively gruesome by their censor board."
