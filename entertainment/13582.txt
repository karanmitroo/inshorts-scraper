Actor Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) on Thursday said that he could not pass any judgement on actor Salman Khan's recent statement where he compared himself to a "raped woman". He added, "I don’t think I am anyone to be making a comment. I am so inappropriate myself.” SRK further said that he has also said "some really wrong things".
