The Mumbai Police has stated that they will provide adequate protection to cinema theatres as and when required, after a delegation of producers, including the makers of 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' (ADHM) sought police protection. The local police stations will be asked to deploy personnel at multi-screen cinema halls. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has threatened multiplex owners against screening ADHM.
