Taapsee Pannu, while responding to a troll on Twitter who slammed her for her outfit, tweeted, "Get well soon." The user commented that it was because of pictures like the one of her in a strapless outfit that men got attracted to women and harassed them. Arjun Kapoor lauded Taapsee for her response to another user who criticised her picture.
