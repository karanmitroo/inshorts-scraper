Filmmaker Aditya Chopra has said that he told Shah Rukh Khan that he'd have to become "every woman's fantasy to realise his superstar dream". "When we cast him for Darr, to be honest, neither dad (Yash Chopra) nor I really liked him," said Aditya. However, watching SRK's first shot, Aditya said he knew that the actor would become a superstar.
