Actor Emma Watson revealed that she went to a 'princess boot camp' for three months before filming the Beauty And The Beast. She said this during The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. "It was fun. I got to ride a horse, I got to learn to waltz and then I had singing lessons and then rehearsals," she added.
