Actress Taapsee Pannu, who was bashed for her remark on Telugu filmmaker K Raghavendra Rao, has said her comment was purely on the basis of facts and she wasn't making fun of anyone but herself. Taapsee added, "If people are just going to sit there...so they can start throwing sh*t around at other people, you can never stop them."
