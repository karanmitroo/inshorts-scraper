Anushka Sharma's debut production venture 'NH 10', termed as a 'violent' film for depicting honour killing, has sailed through the Pakistan censor board with a universal (U) certificate. The film was given an 'adults only' (A) certificate by the Indian censor board. However, just like the Indian censors, the cuss words have been removed by the Pakistani censors.
