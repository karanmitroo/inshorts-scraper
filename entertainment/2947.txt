The Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) students on Wednesday termed Anupam Kher's appointment as the institute's chairperson "another joke". They added this move by the government was "crazy" considering massive protests which were triggered in 2015 during Gajendra Chauhan's appointment. A student said, "How can Kher head FTII when he is already running a private acting school?"
