Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that becoming a parent to his children Roohi and Yash is his biggest blockbuster at 44 while adding that his twins are the superstars of his universe. "The day I carried Roohi and Yash home was like that. Life changing... It was a full on K3G (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham) moment! Very dramatic," said Johar.
