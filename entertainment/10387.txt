Actor Ranveer Singh has admitted that there was a phase when he was only in no-strings-attached relationships. "I'd cut off any string that I'd see. But yeah, you change and evolve as a person. You crave something more substantial. Now I can't even think of such relationships," he added. Ranveer further said that he wants to become a family man.
