The Supreme Court has postponed the hearing of Maharashtra government's petition against the acquittal of Salman Khan, in the hit-and-run-case, to February 12. Khan had filed a caveat, requesting the Supreme Court, that he should be heard before any hearing on the state government's petition. Notably, Congress leader Kapil Sibal appeared as the legal representative for the 50-year-old actor.
