Actor Alok Nath, who has become an online rage as the epitome of sanskaar, will turn into a 'sanskaari' rapper this Valentine's Day. The actor will be seen advising animated characters on how to have a sanskaari V-Day. "The concept of Valentine's Day has been there for ages. The video has been shot in a comic manner," Nath said.
