The Delhi High Court on Monday acquitted 'Peepli [Live]' co-director Mahmood Farooqui of rape charges giving him benefit of doubt. Earlier, Farooqui had appealed against his seven-year jail term for allegedly raping a woman, who was a researcher from the US. Refuting the woman's allegations, his lawyer had claimed that the two were in a "relationship" since January 2015.
