The much-awaited Hollywood action film 'Fast and Furious 7' which hit the screens Thursday, has been tagged as a 'critic-proof blockbuster' by HT. The James Wan directorial has death-defying stunts, muscle cars, family-first ethos and great one-liners, it added. The movie, also starring late actor Paul Walker, was rated 4/5 (HT), 4.5/5 (TOI) and 3/5 (Sydney Morning Herald).
