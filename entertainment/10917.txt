Actor Shah Rukh Khan referred to Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump, who is 24 years younger than Trump, when asked about being paired opposite Alia Bhatt in the film 'Dear Zindagi'. "I think we have this taboo about age. Look at Donald Trump's wife! If the story overcomes that gap without harping on it much, that's a win," said SRK.
