Television actress Farnaz Shetty suffered burns on her hands on the sets of the show 'Waaris' while shooting for a sequence. Her skin reportedly peeled off and she had to go to the hospital. "I'm recovering and the wounds are healing, but I have to be very careful as they can't rub against my clothes or any object," she added.
