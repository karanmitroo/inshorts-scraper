Shah Rukh Khan has said it takes only a year now for a young actor to gain stardom whereas it took him ten years. "I think the longevity of stardom will be less in future, unlike our time, because of the simple logic of faster reach to the audience," added SRK. He further said, "The concept of superstardom will change."
