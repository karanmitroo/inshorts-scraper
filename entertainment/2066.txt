Amitabh Bachchan took to Twitter to share an old picture of himself and late actor Rajesh Khanna and wrote, "That instrument in my hand is the first video camera in the film industry." "It had just come out and it belonged to Rajesh Khanna personally," he added. The picture is from the sets of the 1973 film 'Namak Haraam'.
