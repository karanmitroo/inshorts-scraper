Rekha-starrer 'Super Nani', which released on Friday, has not been received quite well by critics. IBN Live describes it as having a "cheap TV-soap aesthetic". The film, directed by Indra Kumar, shows the transformation of a committed housewife who is trampled upon by her family. It has been rated 1.5/5 (IBN, NDTV), 1/5 (Indian Express, HT) and 2/5 (TOI).
