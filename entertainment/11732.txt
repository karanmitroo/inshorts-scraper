Actor Shah Rukh Khan shared a picture with co-star Anushka Sharma from the sets of their upcoming film. "'First Look' of Imtiaz Ali's film, allegedly called The Ring. Not a horror film nor a love story... it's a Ninja epic!," tweeted Khan. He later added, "The last tweet about the film is a joke... It's just cold in Budapest!"
