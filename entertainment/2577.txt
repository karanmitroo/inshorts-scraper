Actress Kriti Kharbanda, while slamming Hina Khan for her remark that the South Indian film industry prefers only 'bulging women' said, "What [does she] mean? Do thappad khayegi udhar hi." "If someone asked her to put on weight, they probably needed it for the character," she added. Kriti further said, "It's rather unfortunate that an actor is talking like that."
