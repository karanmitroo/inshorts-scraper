Chuck Russell, the director of the 1994 film The Mask, which starred Jim Carrey, has revealed that the film was originally conceived by the producers as a horror film and not a comedy. "It's a great example of really fighting for your vision in a film. We changed it from a horror film into a comedy," said Chuck.
