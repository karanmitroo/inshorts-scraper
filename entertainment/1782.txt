While speaking on the occasion of her 73rd birthday on Friday, actress Sharmila Tagore said, "Cakes and parties are for [my grandchildren] Taimur and Inaaya. I'm just happy to be healthy, alive and active." "I don't allow myself to think about my age. Fortunately, there's plenty to be done. My days are fuller than I can cope with," she added.
