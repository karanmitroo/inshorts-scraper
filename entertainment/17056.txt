As per reports, Sunny Leone starrer 'Mastizaade' has been rejected by the Censor Board of India for its bold sexual content. The film, also featuring Tusshar Kapoor and Vir Das, was originally scheduled to release in May 2015. However, the members of the Censor Board found it so explicit that they refused to pass it with even an 'A' certificate.
