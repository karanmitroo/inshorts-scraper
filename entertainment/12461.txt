Australian writer and social commentator Richard Neville, best known for co-founding the counterculture magazine Oz, died on Sunday in Australia. Through the magazine, Neville countered Australia's conservatism in the 1960s, with issues covering abortion, censorship and homosexuality. The activist was twice sentenced for obscenity but was acquitted on appeal after public outcry.
