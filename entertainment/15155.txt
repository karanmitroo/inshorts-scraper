Tony Dyson (68), the man who designed the Star Wars droid R2-D2, has died reportedly owing to natural causes. He was hired to build remote-controlled R2-D2 units for George Lucas' Star Wars films in the 1970s. Earlier, Dyson said, "The love for R2 is universal; no other Star Wars character has been loved over the years the way R2-D2 has."
