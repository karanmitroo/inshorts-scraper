Actress Adah Sharma took to Twitter to slam a male fan who asked her for a kiss during a media interaction. The fan reportedly told her that since she has done kissing scenes in her films, it would not be a "big deal" for her to kiss him. "I want to choose whose cheeks...I plant my lips on!" Adah tweeted.
