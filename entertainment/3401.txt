According to reports, the Censor Board has asked for the removal of a scene in Judwaa 2 which shows Varun Dhawan dressed as Lord Krishna and playing the saxophone instead of a flute. The Board reportedly thought it would harm religious sentiments of people. "It was all in fun. [It's] a song-and-dance sequence," a source close to the film said.
