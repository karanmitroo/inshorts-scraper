Comedian Kapil Sharma, who is all set to make his film debut with Yash Raj Films' "Bank-Chor", has decided to revert his popular TV show "Comedy Nights with Kapil" to its "one episode per week" format due to time constraint. "For the sake of the film, I've no choice but to cut down my television show by half," Kapil said.
