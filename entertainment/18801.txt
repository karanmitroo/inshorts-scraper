A security guard named Sachin Kadam, was Tuesday declared 'hostile' after he backtracked from the statement given to the police earlier that he had seen actor Salman Khan at the spot of the accident in Sept-2002. Kadam told the court that he had neither seen Salman alight from the car, nor run away from the accident spot.
