Suraj Pancholi (22), arrested in connection with the suicide of actress Jiah Khan, was granted bail on a surety of Rs 50,000 by The Bombay high court on Monday. The court said the letter written by Jiah could not be taken as a suicide note as it is not addressed to anyone. Suraj has to appear before the Juhu police every alternate day.
