The Maharashtra government on Friday filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the acquittal of actor Salman Khan in the 2002 hit-and-run case. The petition seeks to restore the trial court's order which sentenced Khan to a five-year jail term. The Bombay High Court had acquitted the actor in December, quashing the trial court's verdict.
