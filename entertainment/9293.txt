Pakistani police have claimed parents of murdered social media celebrity, Qandeel Baloch, were bribed to change their testimony to protect one of their two sons facing trial in her suspected 'honour killing'. Baloch's parents denied the accusation and said they wrongly implicated their elder son out of anger. Baloch was killed allegedly by her brother over her raunchy photos online.
