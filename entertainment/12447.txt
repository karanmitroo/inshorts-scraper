Comedian Sunil Gover, known for his role as 'Gutthi', tweeted a picture of a hand-written note by a fan, which thanks him for helping her get through her son's death. "The last six months have been the most difficult time. I lost my only son to cancer. During those difficult times, you have actually made us laugh," read the note.
