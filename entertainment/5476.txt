Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that Shah Rukh should not be talking about sex onscreen if he is not 18 and ineligible to vote as he claims. Nihalani's comments were in reference to how he stated that if one lakh votes came in favour of 'intercourse' being discussed in Jab Harry Met Sejal, the word wouldn't be censored.
