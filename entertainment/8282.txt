Anaarkali of Aarah's producer Sandiip Kapur has said that Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has asked them to remove names of late actor Amrish Puri and Amitabh Bachchan from the film. He said they were asked to remove the names over fears of hurting sentiments. "There are 11 cuts mentioned by Censor Board, including one bold scene," added Sandiip.
