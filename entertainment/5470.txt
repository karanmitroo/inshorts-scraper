Irrfan Khan has dismissed recent reports of him walking out of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Gustakhiyan. He has clarified that he was approached for the film almost two years back but since then there has been no conversation on dates. Irrfan added, "So how does the question of me not having time... (for) the film even come from?"
