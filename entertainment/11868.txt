Filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, while commenting on 'factual inaccuracies' pointed out in 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', said that it was a movie on the "hatred of partition" more than a biopic. "[The film was on the] hatred that Milkha Singh had to live with. I was trying to heal those wounds more than trying to make a biopic," added Mehra.
