Stand-up comedian Kiku Sharda, who was recently arrested and later released for mimicking Dera Sacha Sauda Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, on Monday said that the incident had shocked him. “I felt very alone when this happened... It was not that I was scared,” he said. "There is no question of me intending to hurt anyone, ever,” Kiku added.
