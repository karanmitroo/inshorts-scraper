Sonakshi Sinha, while talking about nepotism, said, "If a doctor's child wants to become a doctor, nobody has an issue with it...but if an actor's child wants to become an actor, everyone has a problem." She added that if one is born in a film family, one might get a first meeting or film but beyond that only talent matters.
