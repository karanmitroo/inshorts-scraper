Filmmaker Vishal Bharadwaj, while speaking on his profession, said that filmmaking is a "pain" and he curses himself for choosing it. "[Y]ou need 300 people to get your image and then you are handling these childish actors... Sometimes they come up with such stupid... demands that you can't actually show what you are feeling about them," he added.
