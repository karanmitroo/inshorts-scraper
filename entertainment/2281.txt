Maharashtra Member of Legislative Council Jayant Patil, who heckled actor Shah Rukh Khan for blocking access to his yacht at the Alibaug Jetty, said Bollywood stars need to be disciplined. Khan had parked his yacht at the jetty for more than 30 minutes, thereby blocking the only way for public and private boats to enter Mumbai, according to Patil.
