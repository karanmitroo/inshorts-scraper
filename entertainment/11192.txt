Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that success is like the video game Candy Crush, where one never plays the "same level again" but only keeps "looking ahead". "If you start thinking you're successful, you'll never aim for success, because you've already achieved it. I like winning. Once I've done something, though, I don't even think about it," added Priyanka.
