Filmmaker Vashu Bhagnani in collaboration with Eros International has announced the remake of popular 1990s films including 'Hero No. 1', 'Coolie No. 1' and 'Biwi No.1'. The collaboration is owing to Eros International buying 50% stake in Bhagnani's production house. "[I]t is crucial to partner with a behemoth like Eros to continue making meaningful and profitable cinema," said Bhagnani.
