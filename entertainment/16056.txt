Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan on Friday visited a construction site in Delhi and gave away the jacket he wore in the 1981 film 'Silsila' to a worker. The 73-year-old actor was taking part in an old clothes donation drive, which was organised by NGO Clothes Box Foundation to help poor fight winters.
