Doordarshan will soon launch a Sanskrit news programme on weekends - a long-standing demand from some sections of its viewers. The half hour news broadcast is expected to go on air by June-end or July-beginning and will have news, reportage and discussions in Sanskrit. DD News already has a five-minute Sanskrit news bulletin 'Varta' which is telecast at 6.55am everyday.
