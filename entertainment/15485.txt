The trailer of Manoj Bajpayee's movie, 'Aligarh', where he plays a gay professor, has received an ‘Adult’ certificate from the Central Board for Film Certification, as the theme explores homosexuality. Aligarh’s writer Apurva Asrani called it a homophobic move. The film's makers are contesting the certification which would result in the trailer being shown on television only after 10 pm.
