Britney Spears' and Iggy Azalea collab "Pretty Girls" was leaked early Saturday morning. The song, which was scheduled to be performed live at Billboard Music Awards on May 17, has already made it to few radio stations. "we would really appreciate everyone holding out until Monday to share links if possible (i know its hard, I'm excited too!)", Azalea tweeted.
