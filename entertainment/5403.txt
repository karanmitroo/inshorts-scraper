Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor has said, "I don't interfere in Ranbir's career. I'm his dad not his secretary." He said this while speaking about being an influence on son Ranbir Kapoor's film career. In his biography which released this year, Rishi wrote that he doesn't like any of Ranbir's films as he analyses them as an actor, not a father.
