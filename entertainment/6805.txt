Kamal Haasan has said that he was labelled an anti-Muslim after the release of Vishwaroopam in 2013. He stated Muslim organisations had objected to certain portions of the film, and it was banned in Tamil Nadu. "The pattern of illogical protests remain the same. I am against any kind of terrorism, whatever its colour: green, saffron or khaki," he added.
