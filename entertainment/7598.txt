Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Saturday said he is a big fan of Tamil movies while adding that he was waiting for the sequel of Rajinikanth-starrer Kabali to be shot in Malaysia. Razak, who is on a visit to India, had also met Rajinikanth earlier. Kabali, released in 2016, had a plot set in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur.
