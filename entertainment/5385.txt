Hollywood filmmaker Quentin Tarantino got engaged to Israeli singer Daniella Pick in Los Angeles, USA on Friday. The 54-year-old director first met 33-year-old Daniella when he was in Israel to promote his film 'Inglourious Basterds' in 2009. It will be the first marriage for Tarantino, who is a two time Oscar recipient of Best Original Screenplay.
