Actress Konkona Sensharma has asked if actresses are becoming redundant after having children. She added, "I feel women-centric stories catch people's fancies only before the actresses have children. Once they become mothers, are their stories uninteresting?" Konkona further said that none of the current leading ladies in Bollywood have children.
