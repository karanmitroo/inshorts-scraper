Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar on Monday asked the Maharashtra government to build mobile toilets every 500 metres or at least one kilometre across the state. Toilets must be supported with an app to locate the nearest toilet, the actor added. Women in rural areas face a lot of difficulties due to lack of toilets in rural areas, Kumar said.
