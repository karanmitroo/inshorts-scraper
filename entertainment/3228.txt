Filmmaker Anurag Basu has reacted to Rishi Kapoor's comment that he and Anurag Kashyap are good to work on a certain budget but when given huge budget films they go "berserk" like "bandar ke haath mein khilona". Basu said, "I'm happy with the statement that today people know Anurag Basu and Anurag Kashyap are two different people. I'm not hurt."
