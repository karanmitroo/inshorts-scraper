Actress Taapsee Pannu has said she won't choose a cricketer or a rich businessman as her life partner. "I'm not dating any cricketer, actor, or director...or any big Indian businessman. Whenever my wedding happens, there will not be any hoopla about it," she added. Taapsee further said she likes the fact that people are so oblivious to her personal life.
