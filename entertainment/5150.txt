Tiger Shroff has said that he wants to make a mark as a larger than life hero, like the on-screen image of Salman Khan. Talking about his approach to acting, Tiger added, "I am little different. I want to practice and prepare to set my skill...I think only through practice you can reach perfection...I can do a lot of re-takes."
