Tabu, while speaking on being single, said, "I don't see what the big deal is." "For me, it's not a [yardstick for] assessing somebody. I don't assess someone according to their marital status or whether they have children or not," she added. The 47-year-old actress further said she has never been bothered by people's speculation on her relationship status.
