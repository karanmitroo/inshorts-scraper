The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) will have to reissue the film certificate to 'Jolly LLB 2' following the Bombay High Court's order to delete four scenes in the film. One of these scenes shows a shoe being hurled. The film's producers will reportedly approach the Supreme Court again as the film is due for release on February 10.
