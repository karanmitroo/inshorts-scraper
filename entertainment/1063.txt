Salman Khan has said he hopes that the film industry gets "many more bigger successes" this year while adding, "It is important that we see more hits, more blockbusters." Talking about the success of 'Tiger Zinda Hai' (TZH), Salman added, "Records are never ever-lasting. Records are meant to be broken and it's good for new records to happen more frequently."
