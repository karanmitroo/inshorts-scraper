Actor Ajay Devgn has said that he has "always supported" the release of Karan Johar's upcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and was the "first one to do that in spite of the controversies." "Sometimes [controversies] have been created by the people. I have never attacked someone. I've been misinterpreted at times," added Devgn.
