The 88th Academy Awards, to be held on February 28, will feature revamped Oscar statuettes, which will look like the original 1929 statue given out for the first time at the third-ever Oscars. The new statuette, to be created by Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry, will be hand-cast in bronze before receiving its 24-karat gold finish.
