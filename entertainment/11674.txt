A new character named Penguin has been introduced to mark the 90th anniversary of the first Winnie-the-Pooh book. Penguin, based on a picture of Winnie-the-Pooh's original author AA Milne and his son playing with a penguin, is featured in 'Winter: In which Penguin arrives in the Forest'. Four new Winnie-the-Pooh adventures have been published to mark the occasion.
