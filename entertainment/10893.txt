Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has appealed to filmmakers to postpone the release of  'Dear Zindagi', 'Kahaani 2', 'Befikre' and 'Dangal' owing to demonetisation. He said, "In single screen theatres, where attendance is most dependent on cash sales, the daily gross collections have reduced drastically." Nihalani asked the filmmakers to wait for the currency situation to return to stability.
