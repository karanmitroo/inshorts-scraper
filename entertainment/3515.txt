Aditya Pancholi has said Kangana Ranaut is also a product of nepotism as he got her into Bollywood. Aditya added, "She has no right to speak about nepotism...If I was not there, who would have sent her to Mahesh Bhatt?" Kangana made her debut in the 2006 film 'Gangster', which Mahesh Bhatt had produced.
