Actor Kal Penn has raised over $600,000 (â‚¹4 crore) for Syrian refugees after facing a racist troll online. The troll commented that Kal "does not belong in America" on his post, which slammed Donald Trump's immigration ban. "To the dude who said I don't belong in America, I started a fundraising page for Syrian refugees in your name," wrote Kal.
