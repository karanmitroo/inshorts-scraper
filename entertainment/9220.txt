Actress Sonam Kapoor on Monday launched the trailer of 'Sisak', which is India's first silent LGBTQ love story. While sharing the trailer, Sonam tweeted, "Immensely Proud & Excited!" The film's writer and director said, "It's criminal to be a homosexual (person) in this country (India). That's why I wanted to make a film where people don't talk to each other."
