Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, while reacting to release of Shah Rukh Khan's 'Raees' on January 25, the same day as Hrithik Roshan's 'Kaabil', said, "Whatever dates we are taking, they (Raees) are following us." He added, "I belong to an old school of filmmaking... I would never release my film on a day when another filmmaker has already announced their film."
