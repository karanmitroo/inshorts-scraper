Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar reportedly moved India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to tears when she sang her song "Ae mere watan ke logon" in New Delhi in 1963. The song was composed in honour of Indian soldiers who lost their lives in the 1962 war with China. Mangeshkar, the Bharat Ratna awardee turned 87 on Wednesday.
