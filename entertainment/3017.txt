Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has revealed he had a rule that nobody can fall in love on the sets of his film. "I made that rule while starting the shoot of 'Dev D' and I broke my own rule," he added. Anurag married actress Kalki Koechlin, who starred in 'Dev D', but they later separated and got divorced in 2015.
