Vidya Balan has said that she's confused about the definition of a feminist because it has become so random. "Being a feminist is being someone who knows that she has equal rights, opportunities, and therefore, a right to live her life on her own terms," added Balan. Earlier, she said the only person whose empowerment she's concerned with is herself.
