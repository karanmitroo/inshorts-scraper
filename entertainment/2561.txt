Tyrese Gibson has said he won't appear in 'Fast and Furious 9' if Dwayne Johnson reprises his role. "You mess with family and my daughters survival I mess with yours...Close your eyes dude you're a clown," he added. Tyrese's response follows Johnson's decision to pursue a spin-off movie with Jason Statham, which has delayed the production of the ninth instalment.
