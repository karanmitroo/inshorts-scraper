Several Twitter users, including Hollywood celebrities, called for a boycott of Twitter for a day on Friday after it partially suspended actress Rose McGowan's account for "violating terms and policies". Her account was suspended after several tweets about producer Harvey Weinstein's misconduct. Twitter later clarified one of her tweets included a phone number, which violated its privacy policy.
