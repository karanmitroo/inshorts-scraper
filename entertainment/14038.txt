Actor Jimmy Sheirgill has said that his upcoming film 'Shorgul' is not a biopic. "If it was (a biopic), we would have taken permission... It is a socio-political film, with a love story,‚Äù said Jimmy. Notably, a petition was filed seeking a stay on the film alleging that Shorgul's characters have been inspired from politicians including UP CM Akhilesh Yadav.
