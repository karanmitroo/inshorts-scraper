Harry Potter author JK Rowling and British TV personality Piers Morgan have engaged in a Twitter feud over President Donald Trump's immigration ban. It started when Morgan defended the ban during an appearance on an American talk show for which Rowling called him a "celebrity toady" who is "fact-free" and "amoral". Morgan accused Rowling of being "superior, dismissive and arrogant".
