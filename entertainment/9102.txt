Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that simply working with him in a film doesn't make anyone an actor. "Girls who have started with me, either they had done a film in another language...in case of Anushka Sharma she did modelling," he added.
Talking about his 'Raees' co-star Mahira Khan, Shah Rukh said she's a well-established actress in Pakistan.
