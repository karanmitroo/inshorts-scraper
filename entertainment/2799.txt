Self-styled critic Kamaal R Khan said Twitter suspended his account just because actor Aamir Khan wants it to be suspended. This comes after he gave a negative review on Aamir's film 'Secret Superstar'.  "It means Aamir is the real owner of Twitter, not Jack Dorsey," he added. KRK further said he'll go to court against Twitter for suspending his account.
