Actor Sunny Deol has said that people know very well how bad he is at selling himself. Sunny added, "The entire dynamics and economics of filmmaking has failed. I see a lot of corporatisation, but very little genuine passion in the films today." He further said, "To me, cinema is my passion. I inherited this passion from my father (Dharmendra)."
