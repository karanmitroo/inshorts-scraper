Actress Radhika Apte has said that India is very ashamed of sexuality, physicality or the human body. "Anything to do with human body or sexuality is a problem here," she added. Radhika, who will be seen in the Akshay Kumar starrer film 'Padman', further said that a natural process like menstruation should be spoken about.
