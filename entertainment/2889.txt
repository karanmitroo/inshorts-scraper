Actress Emma Thompson, while speaking about rape allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein said, "I don't think you can describe him as a sex addict...He's an actual predator." "He's dangerous and what he has done and what he's doing is criminal," she added. Emma further said, "We need to start talking about...the crisis in masculinity...which is this sort of behaviour."
