The Mumbai Police on Friday gate crashed into actor Salman Khan's party and forced him to end it as there was too much noise. The actor, along with his family and friends, was reportedly celebrating his sister Arpita's birthday in his Bandra apartment. Police, however, refused to comment on the issue.
