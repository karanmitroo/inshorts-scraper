The entry to Kumbhalgarh fort in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan has been blocked owing to a protest by hundreds of locals led by the Rajput community against the film 'Padmavati'. The fort of Kumbhalgarh is the birthplace of legendary king Maharana Pratap and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Earlier, a similar protest was led by Karni Sena at Chittorgarh Fort.
