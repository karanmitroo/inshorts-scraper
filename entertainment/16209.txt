Pakistani singer Adnan Sami may get Indian citizenship after Pakistan denied renewing his passport in August, resulting in its expiration. According to reports, Sami will be granted the citizenship under Section 6 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955. The law allows citizenship to applicants through a certificate of naturalisation for their contribution in fields like art, science or philosophy.
