Kailash Kher, while speaking about Zayn Malik's cover of his song 'Teri Deewani', said the British singer should join his digital academy to learn the "proper nuances" to perform the song. "I didn't even know who he was until someone sent me the video," he added. Kailash further said, "I feel honoured when your writing and compositions inspire millions globally."
