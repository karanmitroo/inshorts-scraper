Actor Akshaye Khanna has said that he can't do a biopic on his late father Vinod Khanna as he doesn't look anywhere close to him. "To portray any real life character, you have to look like that person," he added. Akshaye further said that an actor must think "10 times" before portraying a real-life character.
