Ritesh Sidhwani, who is co-producing the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Gold', said the film is not a biopic on hockey player Balbir Singh. "(It's) set in real events...about how (India) was when it got its freedom and what happened with (hockey)," added Sidhwani. Singh was a part of the team that won independent India's first gold medal at the 1948 Olympics.
