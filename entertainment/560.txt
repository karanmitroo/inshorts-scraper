Ranveer Singh has said he regrets his earlier comment on the talk show 'Koffee with Karan' that he could do 'Kaminey' better than Shahid Kapoor. While clarifying his statement, Ranveer added, "In my first year, I was very arrogant. That was not something I should have said." Earlier, Shahid said he would have played Ranveer's 'Padmaavat' character Alauddin Khilji differently.
