The broadcast redressal authority Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC) has issued a notice to Zee's Zindagi channel over its controversial Hindi serial -  'Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam'. This comes after viewers complained that the serial promoted Pakistan's narrative of the Partition. The serial stars Pakistani actors Fawad Khan and Sanam Baloch.
