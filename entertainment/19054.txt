The Hindu right wing organisation, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS), has sought ban on the movie `Total Siyapa` for its "anti-national" content. The HJS has objected to certain dialogues in the film, which it feels are "anti-national and in glorification of Pakistan". The movie, released on Mar-7, is a story of a Pakistani manâ€™s love affair with an Indian girl.
