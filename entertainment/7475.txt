British singer-songwriter Harry Styles, known for being a member of the boy band 'One Direction', on Friday released his first single 'Sign of the Times'. "It's a bit weird. I feel like I've been hibernating for so long... and now it's time to give birth," said Harry while admitting it's the song he's "most proud of writing".
