Guddu Dhanoa’s ‘Bichhoo-2’, sequel to his first film ‘Bichhoo,’ will again have Bobby Deol as the lead. “We are still scripting and finalising the dates of our actors, so I can’t say when the film will start rolling. We are also busy finalising the leading lady for the film,” Dhanoa said. ‘Bichhoo’ starred Rani Mukherjee as the female lead.
