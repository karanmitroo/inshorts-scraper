Anil Kapoor reportedly scolded his daughter Sonam Kapoor during the Stardust Awards while saying, "Apne baap se seekho (Learn from your father)". Anil said this after he found Sonam talking with someone rather than responding to him when he called the whole cast of the film 'Neerja' to come on stage. Anil was presenting the award for Best Filmmaker.
