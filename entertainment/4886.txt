Following the alleged suicide of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, posts from his wife Talinda Bennington's verified Twitter account, which was reportedly hacked, claimed she had been cheating on her husband with his bandmate Mike Shinoda. One of the tweets read, "He didn't kill himself, he was already (dead)...I have proof". The series of tweets have now been deleted.
