A petition has been filed against Navjot Singh Sidhu for his alleged obscene jokes on 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. The complainant, who is a lawyer, claimed his "conscience was offended while viewing the show along with wife and daughters". Earlier, the lawyer challenged Sidhu's appearance on the show, claiming that a public servant can't be allowed to do private business.
