Actor Ranveer Singh has said that he is not from the 'Tinder generation', while referring to the dating app. "We have assistant directors who are 18-19 years old. They show me their Tinder profiles and tell me who's saying what, which is kind of a shocker for me," added Ranveer. His film 'Befikre' represents how today's generation views romantic relationships.
