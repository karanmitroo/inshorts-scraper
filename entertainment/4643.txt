'Indu Sarkar', which is based on 1975 Emergency, is "confused between criticising the sarkar and championing it", wrote Hindustan Times. NDTV said, "It's high on dramatic flourish, low on impact." Meanwhile, Times of India wrote, "Indu Sarkar is at its best when it focuses on its protagonist's emotional struggles...leaving politics behind." It was rated 3/5 (TOI), 2/5 (HT), 1.5/5 (NDTV).
