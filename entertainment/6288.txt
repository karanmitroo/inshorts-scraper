Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap is set to make his acting debut in Kollywood (Tamil film industry) with the film Imaikka Nodigal. "Rudra is not your typical baddie. He doesn't just smoke, drink, order his men around and indulge in item numbers. He is menacing, scary, smart and cunning," said Kashyap about his role. Earlier, Kashyap has acted in films like Akira.
