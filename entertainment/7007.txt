The Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) has asked the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to grant an adult (A) certification for the film Lipstick Under My Burkha. The tribunal also asked the makers to reduce the duration of sex scenes. Earlier, CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani refused to certify the film, while calling it "lady-oriented" and a "fantasy above life".
