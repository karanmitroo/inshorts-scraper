Rajinikanth's film 'Kaala' was among many others whose shoot had to be stopped on Tuesday, due to a strike called by the Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI). The organisation stated that the strike had to be called as the Tamil Film Producers Council said that they would not work with the FEFSI and use workers from other states.
