A friend of late child actor Corey Haim has alleged that Charlie Sheen raped Haim on the sets of the 1986 film 'Lucas', when Sheen was 19 and Haim was 13. "Haim told me they smoked pot and had sex...He said after it happened Sheen became very cold and rejected him," said the friend. However, Sheen has denied the allegations.
