Rapper Baba Sehgal, whose songs include 'Aloo Ka Paratha', has said that Yo Yo Honey Singh and Badshah are not real rappers. Sehgal said that their music cannot be classified as rap "because rap is not always about girls or parties". He added, "What they are making caters to film music. They arenâ€™t writing songs that they are... inspired by."
