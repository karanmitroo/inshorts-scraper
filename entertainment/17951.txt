'My Happiness', the first song Elvis Presley ever recorded, was Thursday sold for $300,000 at an auction at Graceland, the museum and tourist attraction that was Presley's former home. The bid was placed by an unidentified online buyer. Other items in the auction included scarves worn by Presley at concerts, prescription sunglasses made for Presley, and his first driver's license.
