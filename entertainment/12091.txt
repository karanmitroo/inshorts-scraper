Comedian Raju Srivastava has cancelled his comedy show in Pakistan following the Uri attack. Srivastava in a video on Twitter said, "The soldiers who have died, I have seen their families suffering. Pakistan always betrays us while we always send (a) message of friendship." He added that he could not go to Pakistan to entertain "those who murdered" Indian soldiers.
