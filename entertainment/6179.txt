Pakistani actress Ushna Shah in a Facebook post talks about people's hypocrisy during the holy month of Ramadan. She wrote that once Ramadan is over, such people "go back to lying, spreading malicious gossip, being cruel, selling yourselves to get ahead, screwing people". Ushna added she was targeting hypocrites, and not people who truly believe in the spirit of Islam.
