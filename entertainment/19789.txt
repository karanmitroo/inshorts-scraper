The music release of upcoming film Bajatey Raho, scheduled on Saturday in a suburban mall in Mumbai, was postponed as a mark of respect for veteran actor Pran, who passed away on Friday. Film's full cast and crew mourned Pran sahab's death. The film, directed by Shashant Shah, features actors Tusshar Kapoor, Vinay Pathak and Dolly Ahluwalia in lead roles.
