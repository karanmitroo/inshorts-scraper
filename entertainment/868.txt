Despite the Supreme Court clearing an all India release of 'Padmaavat', Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel said most theatre owners in the state had voluntarily decided to not screen it. "Government is trying its best to maintain law and order in the state," Patel added. Notably, PVR Cinemas has announced the film won't be screened at its theatres in Ahmedabad.
