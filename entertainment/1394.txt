A 6-member panel, which includes former royals and historians, has been set up to review Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmavati'. "The content will now have to be scrutinised for authenticity," said a source. The release of the film was earlier deferred by the makers voluntarily after the Censor Board did not certify the film citing incomplete documents.
