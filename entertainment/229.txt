Reacting to the sudden demise of his 1989 film 'Chandni' co-star Sridevi, Rishi Kapoor tweeted, "Henceforth no more Moonlit nights! Chandni gone forever. Alas!" He also tweeted, "How has Sridevi all of a sudden become the "body"? All television channels reporting "the body will be brought to Mumbai in the night!" The two also appeared together in films including 'Nagina'.
