Actor Jackie Shroff, while responding to filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma's tweet on Women's Day regarding actress Sunny Leone, said that Varma is a big boy and the tweet reflects his thinking. He added, "He knows what he's talking about...But I will not say such a thing about a lady." Varma had apologised after being called sexist for his tweet.
