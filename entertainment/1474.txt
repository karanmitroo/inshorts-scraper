Several protesters vandalised the posters of Salman Khan starrer 'Tiger Zinda Hai' at a cinema hall in Jaipur over an alleged casteist remark that he made on television. The actor had reportedly said he looks like a 'bhangi' while describing his dancing skills. A complaint has been filed against Salman by the Valmiki Samaj Action Committee over his remark.
