Sanjay Dutt (54), out on a month-long parole since December 21, filed for a 30-day extension of his parole after hospital reports confirmed that his wife Manyata had tuberculosis. Manyata (37) had been admitted to a hospital on Tuesday after complaints of breathlessness, and is under observation after undergoing operation. Pune's divisional commissioner will decide on the extension plea.
