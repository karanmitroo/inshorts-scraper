Producer Ramesh Taurani has said that Salman Khan's character in the upcoming film 'Race 3' is "completely grey". Taurani added, "It's an extremely slick, stylish and exciting one-something he has not done before." He further said that the 'Race' franchise has always had grey characters, like that of Saif Ali Khan, and they are just continuing with that.
