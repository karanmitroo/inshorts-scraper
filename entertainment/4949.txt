The casting director of Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, Sanjay Chouhan, has said he never made the remark that fair actors cannot be cast with Nawazuddin Siddiqui. "All I said was the film needed actors as good as Nawazuddin. You need actors who could match his stature," he added. Sanjay further said he would never want to hurt Nawazuddin by giving such statements.
