Slamming actress Swara Bhasker over her opposing 'Padmaavat', actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi tweeted, "What standards are these?" She said that she found it funny that Swara, who played an erotic dancer or prostitute onscreen, feels like a vagina after watching a story of a pious queen. Swara had earlier penned an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali.
