Actor-comedian Aziz Ansari has become the first Indian-American to host the American television comedy show 'Saturday Night Live' (SNL). For his SNL debut, Aziz did a monologue on the newly-appointed US President Donald Trump. "Donald Trump is basically the Chris Brown of politics. And "Make America Great Again" is his 'These h*es ain't loyal,'" said the comedian in the monologue.
