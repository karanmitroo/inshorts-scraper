Becoming a part of PM Narendra Modi's 'Swachh Bharat' campaign, actor Kamal Hassan Friday picked up the broom on occasion of his 60th birthday. He was seen cleaning garbage at the Madambakkam lake outside Chennai. "This is nation building," he said. "I'm colourless politically and I have no religion. I thank the Prime Minister for accepting us as we are."
