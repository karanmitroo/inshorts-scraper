According to reports, comedian Kapil Sharma's fee has been reduced by 50%, following his show's low TRPs. Low ratings were reported after cast members including Sunil Grover and Ali Asgar didn't shoot for the show after Kapil's brawl with Sunil. In April, Kapil was told to solve issues among its cast by the channel to help improve the show's TRPs.
