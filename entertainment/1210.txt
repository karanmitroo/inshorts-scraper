Karan Johar, on being asked if Kangana Ranaut will be invited as a guest on the reality show 'India's Next Superstars', said, "Humaara dil bada hai, ghar khula hai." He added that whoever gets invited on the show, he'll welcome that person with love and respect. Johar and Kangana had a fallout after she called him the 'flagbearer of nepotism'.
