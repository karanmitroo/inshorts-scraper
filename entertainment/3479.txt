Kangana Ranaut has said having sex is fun for a man but for a woman, it's almost criminal. "Men brag about their Casanova sons, but when it comes to daughters, she can't be wearing a bikini," she added. Kangana further said, "[It's okay if] bikini-clad women are hovering around the son, but the daughter has to comply with feudal ideas."
