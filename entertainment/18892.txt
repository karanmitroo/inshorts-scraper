Actor Saqib Saleem, who made his Bollywood debut in 2011 with 'Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge', says he is jealous of emerging star Ranbir Kapoor and his filmography. "On one hand, he does a 'Barfi!' and on the other 'Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani'. He is the perfect combination of a star and actor," the 25-year-old actor said.
