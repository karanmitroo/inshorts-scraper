A day after 70-year-old actor Kabir Bedi married Parveen Dusanj, Pooja Bedi, his daughter from the first marriage, compared his fourth wife with a wicked witch from a fairy tale. However, she later wished her father a happy married life and retracted the tweet which said, "Every fairy tale has a wicked witch or an evil step-mother! Mine just arrived!".
