Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that Shah Rukh Khan does not bring his stardom to the sets of 'Raees' but is simply "an actor". "I've never seen a co-actor like Shah Rukh in my life... The way he responds to you and your performance, it takes your performance to some another level," added Nawazuddin. 'Raees' will release on January 25.
