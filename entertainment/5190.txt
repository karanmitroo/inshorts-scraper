Actor Dileep's restaurant in Kozhikode was vandalised by a mob after the actor's arrest in connection with the abduction and assault case of a Malayalam actress. Protests against the actor started across Kerala with the protesters burning Dileep's effigy and raising slogans against him. Dileep has currently been remanded to 14-day judicial custody by a local court in Kerala.
