Padma Bhushan award-winning music composer Ilaiyaraaja has asked the karaoke app Smule to remove all his songs citing copyright issues. Ilaiyaraaja's copyrights consultant E Pradeep Kumar said, "Smule is a chargeable site. They are minting money like anything." He added, "We are against people who are using the songs commercially without permission."
