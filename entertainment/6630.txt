Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma explained some of his 'controversial' tweets in a video, including a tweet stating Sridevi's fame depends on her 'thundering thighs'. He explained that it's a media given title and for a sustained 'glamour symbol', there has to be a sex symbol image apart from acting talent. He further explained tweets on Tiger Shroff and Vidyut Jammwal.
