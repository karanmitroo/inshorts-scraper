Hollywood director Fede Alvarez, known for directing the 2013 film 'Evil Dead' said that his reaction after watching a Bollywood film was, "For God's sake, kiss!" "[It] (was) fascinating that through three whole hours of just love... in the end they donâ€™t even kiss," he said. Alvarez added that he still loves Bollywood films as they are "powerful and interesting."
