The director of 'Baahubali 2' SS Rajamouli, while reacting to his film not being chosen as India's official entry to Oscars 2018, said he's not disappointed. He added, "When I make a film, I never think about awards...If awards come...I'm happy. If they don't, I don't mind." He further said his aim is to take stories to a wider audience.
