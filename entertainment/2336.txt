Talking about addressing sexual harassment in Bollywood, actress Kangana Ranaut has said that victim shaming is very common in the Indian society and it's done brutally and openly. She added, "I've read some stories (about harassment) shared by few prominent people, but most people find it hard to open up about such experiences."
