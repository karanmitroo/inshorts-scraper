Former Indian hockey player Sandeep Singh has said he didn't want the film 'Soorma', which is based on his life, to be offered to a big star like Shah Rukh Khan or Akshay Kumar. "They wouldn't have been convincing as Sandeep Singh," he added. Talking about Diljit Dosanjh, who'll portray him, Sandeep further said, "He's a real Singh, a Sardar."
