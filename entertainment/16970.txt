Varun Dhawan recently said that he was most comfortable with his 'ABCD 2' co-star Shraddha Kapoor as they have been friends since childhood. He further said that he thinks Shraddha will be on top of the league of Bollywood actresses in the next five years. "For Shraddha, sky is the limit and she drives me to doing better," Varun added.
