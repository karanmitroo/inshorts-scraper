Sunny Deol tweeted a picture with his son Karan to mark the first day of shoot for his debut film Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas. "My father (Dharmendra) launched me and now I am launching my son," said Sunny, who is directing and co-producing the film. The title was reportedly inspired by the song from Dharmendra's 1973 film Black Mail.
