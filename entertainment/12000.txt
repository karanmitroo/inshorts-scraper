Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar refused to accept her first Filmfare award in 1958 because the statuette was designed in the shape of a woman who had no clothes on. The organisers finally wrapped the award with a handkerchief and presented it to the singer. Lata Mangeshkar was born 87 years ago on September 28, 1929.
