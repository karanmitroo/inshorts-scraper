Actress Kriti Sanon said that she does not think it will be difficult to gel with Farhan Akhtar, her co-star in the upcoming film 'Lucknow Central'. "He seems to be a nice person... When you work with different actors, you react differently. I am excited about it (working with Farhan)," said Sanon. She plays an NGO worker in the film.
