Indian-origin American actor Aziz Ansari has said that he wants more actors and writers of colour for the second season of his TV show 'Master of None'. "Itâ€™s kind of a responsibility we have once we kind of get to a certain place to look out for people," said Ansari. The American comedy series stars Ansari in the lead role.
