Amir Khan will start ‘Sayamev Jayate 2’ from the very spot where Dashrath Manjhi single-handedly started breaking a mountain to carve a road through that. Manjhi from Gehlaur in Gaya (Bihar) dedicated 22 years (1960 to 1982) of his life to this endeavour. Khan says, "I think Dashrath Manjhi’s story is inspirational… It makes us believe that nothing is impossible."
