After US President Donald Trump took a jibe at the ratings of Arnold Schwarzenegger's reality show 'New Celebrity Apprentice', the actor asked, "Hey Donald...Why don't we switch jobs?" In a Twitter video, he also said, "You take over TV...and I'll take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again".
