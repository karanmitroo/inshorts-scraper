Detroit-based 'Third Man Records', an independent record label founded by American musician Jack White in 2001, played the first ever vinyl record in space. The label launched Icarus Craft, a custom "space-proof" turntable attached to a high-altitude balloon, to a peak altitude of 94,413 feet in 1:21:20 hours, where it played Carl Saganâ€™s "A Glorious Dawn".
