Actor Akshay Kumar will be seen promoting menstrual hygiene in his wife Twinkle Khanna's debut venture as a producer. His role is reportedly inspired from the character 'The Sanitary Man' from Twinkle's latest book titled 'The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad'.  'The Sanitary Man' is a character who made a low-cost sanitary pads machine even after being ridiculed by his family.
