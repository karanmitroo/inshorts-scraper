Los Angeles will light a ceremonial bat-signal on Thursday in honour of late actor Adam West, known for his portrayal of Batman in American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) 1960's television series. The signal will be projected via spotlight onto the tower of Los Angeles City Hall. West died of leukaemia at the age of 88 last week.
