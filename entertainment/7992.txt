'Friends' actor Matthew Perry has revealed that he once beat up Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when they were both in school. Perry said he had recently been reminded of the incident by a friend who had also participated in the attack. "I think he was excelling in a sport that we weren't, so it was pure jealousy," Perry added.
