Ayushmann Khurrana has said he's proud to be the 'everyman hero' and face of the common man. Ayushmann added, "(I'm) the guy who blurts out truths about bodily functions, that we...otherwise (don't) want to speak about." He further said all this started with his first film 'Vicky Donor' in which he played a sperm donor. Ayushmann turned 33 on Thursday.
