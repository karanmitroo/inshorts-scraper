Actress Sonam Kapoor on Thursday walked the ramp for fashion entrepreneur Pernia Qureshi for her new fashion collection, inspired by yesteryear actress Vyjayanthimala's 1966 film 'Amrapali'. Sonam was seen in a glittery gold outfit at the show. "Sonam is a chameleon and can carry off just any style under the sun," said Pernia.
