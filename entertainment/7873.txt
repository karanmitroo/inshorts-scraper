Actress Taapsee Pannu, while opening up about her Bollywood journey, said that actors refused to work with her because she is not an "A list actress". "I've been asked to reduce my pay, I've been thrown out of films because the producer was having financial issues," she revealed. Taapsee added the failure of films was blamed on her "bad luck".
