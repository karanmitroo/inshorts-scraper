Actor Amitabh Bachchan, in a recent blog post, wrote that he doesn't have the money or fame that people assume, adding they weren't considerations which define achievement. He further wrote, "Each human may have a concept...of what they consider...achievement...(which) cannot be normalised. Don't normalise it for me." About retiring, he wrote, "The profession shall retire me, or my body will."
