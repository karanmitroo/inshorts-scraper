An FIR has been lodged against actress Rakhi Sawant in Rajasthan for wearing a dress, which had pictures of PM Narendra Modi all over it. She has been charged with "allegedly indulging in obscenity and defaming the PM". Rakhi had worn the dress in August for a pre-Independence Day event said to be organised for Indians in the US.
