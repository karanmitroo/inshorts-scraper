At least 200 Rajput women in Rajasthan's Chittorgarh marched with swords for a ‘Swabhimaan’ (self-respect) rally, demanding that the film 'Padmaavat' be banned or they be given permission to end their lives. The women gave government officials memorandums addressed to the President, Prime Minister, Rajasthan Governor, and Chief Minister, demanding a country-wide ban on the film.
