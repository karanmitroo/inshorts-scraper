A Delhi-based advocate has filed a complaint against Nawazuddin Siddiqui with the National Commission for Women (NCW) for adultery and "outraging the modesty" of his 'Miss Lovely' co-star Niharika Singh. Gulati said Nawazuddin was married during his affair with Niharika but hid it from her. This comes after Nawazuddin revealed details about their affair in his biography without Niharika's consent.
