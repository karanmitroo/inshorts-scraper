Child actor Zaira Wasim, who starred in 'Dangal', said it wasn't that she was dying to work with Aamir Khan because she never wanted to be an actress. However, she added, "Even before 'Dangal' I was very close to him... now he has become family." Zaira further said, "I'm still the kind of a person who doesn't watch films."
