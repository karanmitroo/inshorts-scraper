American television host Jimmy Kimmel has offered his show to US President Donald Trump if he quits his "boring" White House job. Kimmel's tweet came after Trump tweeted, "Late Night host[s] are dealing with the Democrats for their very 'unfunny' & repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?" Earlier this year, Kimmel mocked Trump's "covfefe" tweet.
