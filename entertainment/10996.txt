The first American songwriter to be awarded the Nobel prize in Literature, Bob Dylan, has told the Nobel committee that he will not attend the ceremony in Sweden to receive the award. The 75-year-old informed the committee that "he wishes he could receive the prize personally, but other commitments make it unfortunately impossible" to attend the December 8 event.
