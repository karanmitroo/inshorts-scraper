At the launch of Dhoom 3's title-song, superstar Aamir Khan, who is very close to fellow actor Salman Khan, said that he wanted to see Salman and Katrina Kaif "together". Asked about Salman's marriage, Aamir sang a hindi song that made Katrina shy. Aamir even asked Katrina, "Have you ever asked Salman?" Katrina blushed and was at loss of words.
