'The Argumentative Indian', the upcoming documentary on Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen will be released on YouTube, after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) denied it certificate. However, the YouTube release date of the documentary has not been announced yet. CBFC demanded the removal of "offensive words" like 'cow', 'Gujarat', among others from the documentary before certifying it.
