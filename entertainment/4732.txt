Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has said he is sad that nobody from the film fraternity came to support him in the 'Indu Sarkar' row. Madhur added, "I, as a filmmaker, always stood with the film fraternity...whether it was regarding 'Udta Punjab' or 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' or any other film." He further said that he's angry to see "such selective activism".
