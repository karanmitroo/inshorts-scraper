Actor Jared Leto has said his character 'Joker' in Suicide Squad was partly inspired by rock star David Bowie, who passed away in January. "I think David Bowieâ€™s probably an inspiration for, like, almost anything you could do creatively," said Leto. Meanwhile, Leto is hoping that the Joker gets a standalone film to explore the "twisted but lovely" character more.
