Priyanka Chopra has said that the term 'Bollywood' has been reduced to a zumba class around the world. "I'm so glad that 'La La Land' has done so well because people will now know that musicals aren't just random breakout into song and dance," she added. Priyanka said this in her recent appearance on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert'.
