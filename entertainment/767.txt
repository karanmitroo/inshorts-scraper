On choosing to do the film 'Judwaa 2' after her film 'Pink', actress Taapsee Pannu said, "I didn't want to be labelled as part of a mahila morcha...(wanted) to have the option of singing and dancing." She further said, "This industry is quick to stereotype. People had started talking about how I was primarily being part of women-centric movies."
