Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, while defending his decision of not scrapping Ranveer Singh's butt-shot from 'Befikre', said that there is nothing wrong with the scene. "We shortened Ranveer's butt shot quite a lot. Right now it's just a glimpse...He is alone with his girlfriend in a room. They are doing what couples do when they are alone," he added.
