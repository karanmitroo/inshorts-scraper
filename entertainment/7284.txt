The Censor Board has asked the makers of Sonakshi Sinha starrer film 'Noor' to edit out 'Dutt' from the name of journalist Barkha Dutt. "Referring to real-life characters without their consent is not allowed," said a member of the CBFC. The makers were given the option of either getting the journalist's permission or to censor the direct reference to her.
