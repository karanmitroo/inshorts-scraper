Sunny Deol has said he still cannot see eye to eye with his father Dharmendra. He added, "His fear will always remain. Even now, if I'm doing anything wrong, the thought of dad getting its knowledge scares me out." He further said that his father was never strict but since his childhood they have had few conversations with each other.
