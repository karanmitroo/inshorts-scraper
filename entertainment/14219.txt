Starting on Monday, tickets for the film 'X-Men: Apocalypse' in the US can be purchased on 'Snapchat' add. This makes Twentieth Century Fox the first advertiser on the app to purchase a ticketing ad unit. Snapchat users can swipe up on a '3V' ad, a vertical video which can be viewed by choice to purchase tickets, without leaving the app.
