Censor Board has demanded the removal of phrase 'Mann Ki Baat' from a dialogue in film 'Sameer', as it is also the title of PM Narendra Modi's radio show. The Board hasn't objected to an expletive in the same dialogue. "The board, despite granting us an A certificate, asked for certain scenes to be chopped mercilessly," said the film's director.
