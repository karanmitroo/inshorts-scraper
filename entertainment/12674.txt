Actress Zareen Khan has said that only big stars are praised for the bold scenes they do. "But if somebody with not so much a big or established name is doing it, it is called trash, people are trolling it," added Zareen. She recently featured opposite Ali Fazal in the music video of 'Pyaar Manga Hai', which contained racy scenes.
