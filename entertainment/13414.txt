Actress Kareena Kapoor has said that she wants to work in a film with her sister Karisma Kapoor. "Right now there are no plans because I don’t know if she is even thinking of working on the big screen as her kids are really small," said Kareena. Karisma's last film as the lead actress was the 2012 thriller 'Dangerous Ishhq'.
