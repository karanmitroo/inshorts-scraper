A lawsuit has reportedly been filed by band 'Collage' against musicians Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson, for allegedly copying the Grammy-award winning song 'Uptown Funk'. According to 'Collage', the "rhythm, harmony, melody and structure" of 'Uptown Funk' was "ripped" off their 1983 single 'Young Girls'. In the lawsuit, the band has demanded a cut of the profits.
