Choreographer Saroj Khan, who choreographed the original 'Tamma Tamma' song in 1990,   has said she is not sure if Alia Bhatt will be able to match up to Madhuri Dixit. "I know [Varun] will be able to do it well," she added. Saroj further said she was probably not called to choreograph it as the makers thought she is old.
