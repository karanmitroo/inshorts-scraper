Musician AR Rahman has said that he never knew that he was born for music and it was his mother who made the choice as she predicted he would become a music composer. Talking about his Academy Award wins, Rahman added, "It took 81 years for an Asian to win an Oscar in sound. For me, it took fourteen years."
