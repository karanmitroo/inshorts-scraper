Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj has said his films have never worked at the box office. "Not even 'Omkara'... 'Haider' just recovered money," the National-Award winning director said. However, he added that it doesn't "bother" him as he has "chosen to make such kind of films." "I don't expect a big 'dhamaka'. If it ever happens, I will probably introspect," he said.
