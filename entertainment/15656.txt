Filmmaker Shyam Benegal on Friday said the censor board consisting of a "few people" can't take over the "moral and social responsibility" of society and say what's "right or wrong". Benegal added, "When you show your film... you are opening them to a certain moral state of society. When I say moral, it may be moral or immoral for you".
