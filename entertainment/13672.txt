Filmmaker Shirish Kunder has been accused of copying his recent short film 'Kriti' from a Nepali short film 'BOB'. The film's maker Aneel Neupane alleged that Kunder "stole the plot" of 'BOB'. Kunder responded by tweeting "To those comparing #Kriti with some short film released on May 12, 2016: #Kriti was shot in February, 2016. Hope this settles the matter."
