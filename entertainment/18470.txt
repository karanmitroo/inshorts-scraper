After Deepika Padukone reacted to a post by a daily regarding her cleavage, the news organisation tweeted "It's a compliment! You look so great that we want to make sure everyone knew! :)". Deepika's tweets against the post on Sunday afternoon saying "Yes! I am a woman. I have breasts and a cleavage! You got a problem!!??" had stirred support.
