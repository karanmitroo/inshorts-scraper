Abhay Deol has criticised the recent raid in which Mumbai police dragged out 40 consenting adults out of hotel rooms and charged them with 'public indecency'. Deol wrote on Facebook that sex is nothing to be ashamed of. "Even I am baffled by our societyâ€™s obsession with sex. I enjoy it, I crave it, I pursue it", he wrote.
