Akshay Kumar posted a video message, where he asked Indians to first worry about the welfare of the jawans and their families and argue later whether Pakistani artistes should be allowed in India. "They are... guarding us and that is why we are alive today. If they are not there to guard us, Hindustan will not be left," added Akshay.
