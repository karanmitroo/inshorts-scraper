According to reports, filmmakers are upset over the changes introduced by new Censor Board chief Prashoon Joshi. Joshi has reportedly asked officials to refrain from sharing any informal information about suggested cuts to filmmakers. "Earlier, we were at least told about the problematic scenes...Now, we'll be in the dark till the certificate is issued," a producer was quoted as saying.
