Actor Salman Khan reportedly sought permission from the Bombay High Court on Wednesday to travel to Dubai for a show later this month. The actor is out on bail after being convicted in a hit-and-run case of "culpable homicide" and sentenced to five years in jail by the sessions court. Khan cannot leave the country without court's permission.
