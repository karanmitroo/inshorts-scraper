Actor Shatrughan Sinha has said that in the film industry, nepotism happened earlier, happens now and will continue to happen in the future. He added that nepotism is not bad because if star kids have the required talent, then nobody has the right to stop them. "It doesn't mean that we're promoting them over talent outside the industry," added Shatrughan.
