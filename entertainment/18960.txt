The family of Bharat Ratna Bismillah Khan has refused to be a part of the political battleground in the election season. "The BJP guys called us, and we thought it's about some programme. But when we learnt that it's about proposing Mr Modi's name, we turned down their request. We are just musicians," Bismillah Khan's son Zamin Hussain said Sunday.
