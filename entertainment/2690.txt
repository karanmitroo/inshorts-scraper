Former Gujarat CM Shankersinh Vaghela has demanded a pre-release screening of 'Padmavati' for Hindu and Kshatriya community leaders to check whether facts have been distorted in the film. He has also warned of violent protests if the makers failed to do so. "I apologise to the cinema owners in advance if people take law into their hands," said Vaghela.
