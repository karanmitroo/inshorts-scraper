Actor Ranveer Singh has said that his role as the Khilji dynasty ruler Alauddin Khilji in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming directorial venture 'Padmavati', is comparable to late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the 'Joker'. "I fear if I go in, I may not come back," said Ranveer. The actor added that he may need some therapy and time to recover.
