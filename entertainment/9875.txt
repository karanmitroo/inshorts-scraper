A comedy show titled 'Real Housewives of ISIS' by BBC has been slammed for trivialising the plight of victims of the terror group.  "It is worrying that humour should be associated with the actions of ISIS," a viewer wrote on Facebook. The show revolves around four women, who have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State and become 'jihadi brides'.
