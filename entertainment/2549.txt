Actor Shah Rukh Khan, who made his debut in Bollywood in 1992, marked his 52nd birthday on Thursday. SRK, who is noted for his witty quotes, once quipped, "I am like a Rolls Royce, I can run without an engine, purely on reputation." He also said, "I don't wear my success like a tuxedo. I wear it like a T-shirt."
