Member of the new Censor Board Ashoke Pandit Tuesday sparked a controversy by tweeting about Karan Johar's appearance at the AIB Knockout. â€œKaran Johar could have easily shown his position while performing sex to his mom at home instead of making it public. #AIB Porn Show", Pandit tweeted. Several Twitter users immediately responded by slamming Pandit for his offensive tweet.
