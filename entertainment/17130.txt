NGO 'Citizens for Better India' filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court on Tuesday calling for a ban on the song "Lalla Lalla Lori" from the upcoming Bollywood movie, "Welcome 2 Karachi". The plea stated that the song promoted liquor consumption and maligned a nursery rhyme, and called for its removal from the film and TV channel advertisements.
