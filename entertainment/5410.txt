Filmmakers in Tamil Nadu, including R Kannan and Vijay, have opposed the proposed state-wide shut down of theatres from July 3 following the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). "I have borrowed money and produced Ivan Thanthiran. How am I going to repay if theatres are closed? This is like killing a newborn," said Kannan.
