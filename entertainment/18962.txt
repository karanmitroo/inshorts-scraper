Actress Priyanka Chopra said it was ‘unfortunate’ that she couldn't make it to the polling booth as she was busy with her prior work commitments. “Wish I could have been in India to exercise my most basic right...to vote as a citizen,” she tweeted Thursday when Mumbai went to poll. She is currently in US for an awards function.
