Actor Amitabh Bachchan shared a picture of himself with his wife actress Jaya Bachchan on Twitter, which was prior to their marriage when they were shooting together for the 1973 film Zanjeer. Amitabh, who is seen being fed by Jaya, wrote alongside the picture, "The wifely instincts leap up... the way to a man's heart is via his stomach."
