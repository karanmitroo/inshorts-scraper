As per reports, actress Chitrangda Singh has quit the upcoming film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' over a row with the film's director Kushan Nandy during the shoot of an intimate scene with Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Nandy reportedly said, "[Y]ou ought to get literally on top of Nawaz", which offended Chitrangada. Reports added that actress Swara Bhaskar is now being considered for the role.
