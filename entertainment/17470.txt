Director Karan Johar, who has signed Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai for his upcoming project titled 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', has said that he can't wait to direct both the actresses. Karan said he is more excited because he has previously not worked with any of them. The film, also featuring Ranbir Kapoor, is scheduled to release in June 2016.
