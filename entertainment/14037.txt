Answering a question about Tanmay Bhat's video mocking her, veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar has said that nothing affects her. "I’ve faced so many hurdles in life. I learnt from a young age that work is the only thing that matters,” said Mangeshkar. “We must not give undue importance to those who thrive on maligning people", she added, addressing her fans.
