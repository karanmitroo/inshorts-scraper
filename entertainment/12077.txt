Norwegian Airlines has launched a new ad campaign by writing "Brad is single" for its London to Los Angeles £169 (about ₹14,600) one-way flight. The airline further said, "Actor. LA. Newly Single. Seeks likeminded partner with GSOH (Good Sense of Humour)." The ad campaign draws upon Hollywood actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's recent split.
