Explaining her future political plans, Rakhi Sawant said on Sunday, "I'm impressed by the way BJP has created history... Vasundhara Raje too needs to be credited for this. Winning all the 25 seats for her party is no child's play... Since I'm here (Jaipur), I would like to meet her once as I want to join the BJP."
