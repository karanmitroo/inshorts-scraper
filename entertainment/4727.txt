Govinda has thanked Rishi Kapoor for showing concern for him after his role in 'Jagga Jasoos' was removed. He added, "Good blood never speaks wrong", and further said he expected a little professionalism from the director Anurag Basu. "If you don't want Govinda to work in your film, why did you ask him in the first place?" Rishi had said.
