The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished the illegal terrace gym at actor Arjun Kapoor's residence in Juhu, Mumbai at around 6 pm on Monday. Earlier, the actor was sent a notice for constructing a 30-by-16 square feet brick room without permission from the authorities. The actor, however, refused to comment on the issue.
