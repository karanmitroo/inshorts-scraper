Alia Bhatt has said that she decided to become an actor at the age of 4. "A four-year-old has no clue about success. I set my heart on it and I'm still the same four-year old inside," she added. "I will never be attached to this image of mine, I will rather be forever passionate and grateful," Alia further said.
