While talking about delay in his film Aiyaary's release due to changes demanded by the Ministry of Defence, filmmaker Neeraj Pandey said, "Only one body should have any say in the film's release, and that's CBFC." "Everyone is too sensitive these days and add to that the power of social media, which allows anyone to have a say," he added.
