Despite Priyanka Chopra’s legal notice forbidding the biopic ‘67 Days’, based on her former secretary Prakash Jaju, the film’s producer Aseem Merchant is determined to go right ahead with it. Jaju said: "I`ve sold the rights of my biopic to Limelight, a company that`s represented by Aseem Merchant and filmmaker Vikram Razdan. They say they`re going ahead with the project."
