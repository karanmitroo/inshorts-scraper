Singer-composer Vishal Dadlani, took to Twitter to express his displeasure over the execution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move. "If it's true that 200000 ATMs will have to be recalibrated before they can dispense the new currency, this demonetisation "plan" is a JOKE!" he tweeted. He had earlier said that it was a "great move" by the government.
