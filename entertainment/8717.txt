Two rescue workers from the Syrian civil defence group White Helmets have obtained US visas to attend the Oscar ceremony, where their documentary "White Helmets" is nominated for an award. The group had last year won the Right Livelihood Award, also referred to as the 'Alternative Nobel'. Volunteers of White Helmets group act as first responders in the war-torn country.
