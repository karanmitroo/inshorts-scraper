Choreographer and filmmaker Farah Khan has said that Bollywood's strength and forte is its song-and-dance sequence in films. "If that goes away... Hollywood will come and take over (in India)," added Farah. Giving an example to support her statement, Farah further said how 'The Jungle Book' performed better than most Hindi releases at the box office this year.
