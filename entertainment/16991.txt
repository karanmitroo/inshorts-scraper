Madame Tussauds London is all set to come up with a selfie-taking wax statue of Kim Kardashian. "Kim's figure will be holding a functioning mobile phone so guests can really step right into her selfie," said Edward Fuller, General Manager of Madame Tussauds. Kim had written a book, 'Selfish', on how to properly capture yourself in a selfie.
