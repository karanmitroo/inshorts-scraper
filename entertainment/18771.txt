After her miserable electoral debut in LS elections, Bollywood starlet Rakhi Sawant(35) joined Ramdas Athawale-led RPI and said she would not hesitate to contest the upcoming assembly polls against MNS chief Raj Thackeray. Sawant had polled barely 1,995 votes in her maiden tryst with electoral politics, contesting from Mumbai North-West as a candidate of 'Rashtriya Aam Party' founded by her.
