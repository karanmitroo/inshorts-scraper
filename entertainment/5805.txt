Filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, who built over 800 toilets in slums in the last four years, has obtained permission from Mumbai's BMC to build twenty toilets in Ghatkopar. Rakeysh has been shooting his upcoming film Mere Pyare Prime Minister in Ghatkopar. "We don't just build toilets and walk away but we also make sure the locals maintain them," said Rakeysh.
