Actor Naseeruddin Shah has apologised for calling yesteryear actor Rajesh Khanna a "poor" and "limited" actor. "I apologise to those who were personally offended, my intention was not to attack him (Rajesh Khanna)," said Shah. Earlier, Khanna's daughter Twinkle Khanna had slammed Shah's remarks and tweeted, "Sir if you canâ€™t respect the living, respect the dead."
