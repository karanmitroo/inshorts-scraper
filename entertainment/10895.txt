American rapper Kanye West cut short his latest concert to deliver a 15-minute speech on politics and said, "People feel like they lost because Facebook and Google lied to you". West was referring to the fake news on the platforms, which reportedly impacted the US elections. He even took Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's name while addressing the concern.
