Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, while speaking about sexual harassment allegations against his friend producer Harvey Weinstein, said, "I knew enough to do more than I did." Tarantino added, "There was more to it than just the normal rumours...It wasn't secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things." He further said that he had dismissed these incidents as "mild misbehaviour".
