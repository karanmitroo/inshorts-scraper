The Central Board of Film Certification has decided to give a U/A certificate to the film 'Padmavati' provided some modifications are made in the film. The film's title is also likely to be changed to 'Padmavat'. The makers have been reportedly asked to make relevant modifications in the song 'Ghoomar' and add disclaimer over not glorifying the practice of Sati.
