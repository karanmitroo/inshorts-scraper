Actor Sanjay Mishra, while speaking about comedian Shyam Rangeela being asked to avoid mimicking PM Narendra Modi said, "We shouldn't be told what to do." "You mimic a person who has influenced you. Nobody (in India) would mimic a person from Nigeria," he added. Mishra further said, "Whether something is wrong or not... shouldn't be decided by a certain section."
