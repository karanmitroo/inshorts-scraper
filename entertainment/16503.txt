The annual four-day theatre festival, Hriday Manch, has begun at Delhi’s Shri Ram Centre on Thursday. Organised by the Sparsh Natya Rang, the festival this year is focusing on folk elements “to attract those who are not avid followers of theatre”. The festival’s major attraction is a Hindi adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll's House".
