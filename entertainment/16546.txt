Filmmaker Vishal Bharadwaj, whose upcoming film 'Talvar' based on the infamous Aarushi Talwar murder case is in the making, has said that he didn't take any permission from the Talwars for making the film. "We have not given any judgement in the film and we have left it to the sensibility of the viewers," Bharadwaj added.
