Tiger Shroff slammed a fan who jumped from a 13-foot-high wall trying to overcome his fear of heights, while thanking the actor for "inspiring" him. Responding to the fan's video, Tiger wrote, "That's...stupid of u to try something like that, never risk ur life." He further wrote, "When action heroes (perform) something alike on screens, they do it...under...supervision of professionals."
