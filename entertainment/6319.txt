Kerala-based group Hindu Aikya Vedi has threatened to stall the release of a film tentatively titled Mahabharatham, which is being made on an estimated budget of â‚¹1000 crore, unless its title is changed. The group president said it cannot be named after the epic as it is not based on Vyasa's Mahabharata, but is an adaptation of MT Vasudevan's Randamoozham.
