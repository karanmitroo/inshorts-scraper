Filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker has requested people to only form their opinions about the Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde starrer 'Mohenjo Daro' after watching the film and not judge it based on its trailer. He added, "We have our own image or response to a trailer... There are certain elements that shock you but you have to be patient."
