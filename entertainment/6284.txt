Doosri Suhagraat, a short film on a tradition followed in some regions in India, where men hold remarriages without divorcing their first wife, was released on YouTube. The makers said, "While India is split into two parts over the Muslim community practicing triple talaq...this is an attempt to throw light on other such customs that still exist in our society."
