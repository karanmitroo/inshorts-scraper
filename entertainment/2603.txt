Actor and BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Monday said that Tamil actor Vijay's film 'Mersal' raised a legitimate issue over the Goods and Services Tax (GST), healthcare, and Digital India programme. "As entertainers and actors with powerful voices we have a certain duty towards the public to make them aware of socio-political issues," Sinha added.
