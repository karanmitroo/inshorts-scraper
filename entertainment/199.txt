Filmmaker Satish Kaushik has said that he always used to address late actress Sridevi as "ma'am" while adding, "She had that persona, you couldn't call her just Sridevi." He added, "She was like family... and our relations never changed even after her marriage (to Boney Kapoor)." She acted in Kaushik's directorial debut 'Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja' in 1993.
