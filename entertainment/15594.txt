Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutiérrez, who recently appeared as a guest on 'The Steve Harvey Show', told Harvey that he needs to "learn how to read cards". Harvey, who was the host at the 2015 Miss Universe beauty pageant, had wrongly announced Gutiérrez as winner, before correcting himself. Apologising for the incident, he said, "I am beyond sorry for what happened".
