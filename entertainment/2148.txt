While talking about Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmavati' which is pending review and certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Chairman Prasoon Joshi said that putting all the pressure on the Board is unfair. Joshi also said the Censor Board is trying to resolve the controversy over the film through dialogue and not arguments.
