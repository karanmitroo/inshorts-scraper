The Central Board of Film Certification was issued a legal notice by Peter Mukherjea's advocates to stop the release of the movie, 'Dark Chocolate', alleged to be based on the Sheena Bora murder case. The legal team cites that the film's release can create "immense prejudice" to their client. Meanwhile, director Agnidev Chatterjee defended the film saying it's completely fictional.
