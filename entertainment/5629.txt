Mumbai's civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has demolished a part of actor Arshad Warsi's bungalow in Versova, Mumbai citing an alleged illegal construction of an additional floor. Earlier, a demolition notice was stuck on his bungalow, which gave the actor 24 hours to remove the illegal construction of the second floor.
