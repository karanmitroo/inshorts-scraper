The Home Ministry has asked Mumbai Police to speed up its report on alleged brawl involving Saif Ali Khan in a restaurant. "Mumbai Police has been reminded to expedite the matter...," the ministry said. The report was sought after an RTI activist demanded that Khan be stripped off the Padma Shri as there are several "criminal cases against him".
