The Hindi film industry is known as 'Bollywood' as its name has been derived from Mumbai, then called Bombay, and USA's film industry 'Hollywood'. While Hollywood is a geographical location for several American film studios, there is no physical existence of Bollywood. The term 'Bollywood' became popular in the 1970s, when India overtook America as the world's largest film producer.
