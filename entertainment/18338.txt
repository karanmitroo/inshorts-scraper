Archie Comics confirmed Thursday that it is all set to make its debut on small screen after Fox gained the rights for its TV adaptation titled "Riverdale". The series is written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and produced by Greg Berlanti. Calling it a "historic moment", Archie Comics co-CEO Jon Goldwater said they were happy to partner with Fox.
