Karan Johar has said he'd like to apologise to Alia Bhatt for making her feel conscious about her weight, as he had asked her to lose weight for her debut film 'Student of The Year'. "She's in the gym every day...even if she puts on an extra kilo, she goes crazy. I think I'm to blame for it," he added.
