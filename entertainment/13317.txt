Late pop icon Michael Jackson's personal physician Dr Conrad Murray has claimed that Jackson wanted to marry actress Emma Watson when she was 11 years old. The singer reportedly kept a cut-out of Watson as he became infatuated with her after watching the 'Harry Potter' film series. Murray has written about these issues in his tell-all book about Jackson.
