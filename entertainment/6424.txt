Hindi Medium, starring Irrfan Khan and Pakistani actress Saba Qamar, has been declared tax-free in Maharashtra. "The film addresses a social issue and it is a family entertainer. So it needs to reach a wider audience. I hope the film gets tax exemption in other states as well," said Irrfan. The film has already been made tax-free in Gujarat.
