Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that there was no pressure on the Board from the government to remove words like 'cow', 'Gujarat' from the documentary based on Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. He said that the words were offensive and added, "Referring so insensitively to our politics and religion, could result in a serious breach in....harmony of the country."
