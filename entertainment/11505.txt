Actor Aamir Khan has revealed that as a child, he used to go for shooting secretly by pretending that he was going for a hockey match, as his parents did not want him to be an actor. "There is no certainty or security [in the film industry]... [My family] wanted [me] to go into a more stable profession," added Aamir.
