Actress Priyanka Chopra was among the attendees at the Marc Jacobs show at New York Fashion Week. She wore a white pussy-bow shirt by the designer and paired it with a blue faux fur coat. Priyanka was seen sporting bronze-inspired make-up, which was done by make-up artist Sir John, who also did Beyonc√©'s make-up for her Grammy performance this year.
