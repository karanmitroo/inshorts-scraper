Actress-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt revealed that her 2003 production 'Jism' earned more money at the box-office as compared to films 'Zakhm', 'Tamanna', 'Dushman' and 'Sur' combined. She said, "I'm not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival." Pooja added she's a commercial filmmaker and wants people to watch her films.
