Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr accidentally exposed her breasts, caused by a wardrobe malfunction, at her husband Orlando Bloom's movie premiere. According to the media reports, it happened when she lifted her hands to adjust her hair, causing the lace overlay of her dress to lift as well. Kerr, however, seemed unaware of the incident and carried on smiling and laughing.
