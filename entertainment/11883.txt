Actor Om Puri has apologised for allegedly making 'insulting' comments about Indian soldiers, following a police case that was filed against him. "I am very embarrassed at what I said and I deserve punishment, not forgiveness," said Puri. Commenting on the martyrdom of a BSF jawan, he had earlier said that nobody had "forced" soldiers to join the army.
