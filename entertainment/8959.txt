The Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif starrer film 'Jagga Jasoos' will feature 29 songs, as confirmed by the film's music composer Pritam. "Ranbir stutters throughout the film, the only time he doesn't, is when he sings. Every time he expresses an emotion strongly, it's through songs," Pritam added. He further said that the film's narrative flows forward through the songs.
