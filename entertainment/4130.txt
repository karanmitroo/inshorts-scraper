Actors Mark Ruffalo and Olivia Wilde protested outside the Trump Tower on Tuesday night after US President Donald Trump blamed the Charlottesville violence on both anti-racism protesters and white nationalists. Mentioning the name of the woman killed during the protests, Ruffalo chanted, "Heather Heyer!" Filmmaker Michael Moore also took the audience of his Broadway show to the protest.
