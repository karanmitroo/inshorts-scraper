The 90-second teaser of Ragini MMS 2, which emphasises on Sunny Leone's sex appeal and Ragini MMS brand's horror-quotient, has been released. The makers (Balaji) have ensured that the teaser follows the template of horror, sex, horror and then followed by sex in absolute proportion, hence being unpretentious in its core messaging. The movie is set to release in Jan-2014
