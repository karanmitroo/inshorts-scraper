Singer Sona Mohapatra has tweeted about a new Bollywood version of her toothpaste brand jingle 'Paas Aao' being created, which will star actors Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon. "Nothing makes me sadder that our song made iconic on its own independent strength will now have the Bolly tropes," tweeted Sona. The new version will be sung by Armaan Malik.
