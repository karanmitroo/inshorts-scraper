Actress Bhumi Pednekar, while speaking about the problem of open defecation, said it's hypocritical that women in India have to lift their sarees in public to relieve themselves but they dare not take off their ghoonghat. In 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha', Bhumi has portrayed the character 'Jaya', who leaves her husband after discovering that he doesn't have a toilet.
