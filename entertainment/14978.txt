Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt, who walked free from the jail in February this year, has moved the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act or TADA court to get his passport back. While the CBI which investigated the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case said it has no objection to Sanjay's plea, the court has scheduled the application for order on Tuesday.
