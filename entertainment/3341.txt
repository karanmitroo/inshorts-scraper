Actress Tinaa Dattaa, known for starring in the television show 'Uttaran', has said she is happy being a bahu on television. Tina, who had recently posted pictures of herself in swimwear, added, "These photos were for fun. Perhaps, this tactic might help in Bollywood, but in daily soaps and the television world, such bold photos don't really help your career."
