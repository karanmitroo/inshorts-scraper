Vidya Balan has said Indian culture wants people to be sexual only in the institution of marriage and for reproduction. "But the whole feeling... joy of intimacy, pleasure and fun is missing," added Vidya. She further said the hypocrisy related to sex needs to go away and children need to know that sex is a feeling and not a taboo.
