Karan Johar has turned down Vikas Behel's offer to act as a Sindhi businessman in his film, 'Shandaar'. Karan, who is making his acting debut in his next 'Bombay Velvet', feels that he should be approached for acting only after people like him in the film. Reportedly, director Sajid Khan had also refused to play the part before him.
