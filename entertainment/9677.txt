Nawazuddin Siddiqui charged a token amount of â‚¹1 for his film 'Haraamkhor', which released on Friday. "He loved the script and insisted to work pro bono (without charge) on the film, understanding the limitations of the budget," revealed the film's producer. 'Haraamkhor' is about the relationship between a teacher and his teenage student, played by Nawazuddin and Shweta Tripathi respectively.
