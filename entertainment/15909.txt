'Bajirao Mastani' which hit the screens on Friday, ends up being a costume drama with too little story, said Indian Express. The film is slow and lengthy but can be a good one-time watch, wrote HT. Ranveer Singh has delivered his career-best performance, said India Today. It has been rated 1.5/5 (Indian Express), 2.5 (HT) and 3.5/5 (India Today, Mid-Day).
