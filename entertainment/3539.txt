Actor-filmmaker Farhan Akhtar has said that he wanted Hrithik Roshan to play 'Sameer', Abhishek Bachchan for the role of 'Siddharth' and Akshaye Khanna for 'Akash' in his directorial debut 'Dil Chahta Hai'. However, Farhan added films are generally made with a cast that's not on one's wish list. Saif Ali Khan, Aamir Khan and Akshaye played the film's lead roles.
