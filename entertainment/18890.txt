Musician-actor Himesh Reshammiya, who is gearing up for the release of his musical-thriller 'The Xpose', says he will always be indebted to mentor Salman Khan for his continuous love and support. Remarkably, it was Salman who gave Himesh his first big break in Bollywood and he composed music for his movie 'Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya'.
