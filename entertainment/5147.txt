Indo-Canadian YouTube personality Lilly Singh, also known as Superwoman, took to Instagram to share a picture of herself from her visit to a school in Madhya Pradesh. "Although we are from different places and experience different challenges, this picture symbolises something very universal: humanity," read a part of Lilly's caption. She visited the school as part of a UNICEF programme.
