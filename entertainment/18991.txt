Hollywood actress Kate Winslet says her nude portrait in James Cameron directed 1997 blockbuster - Titanic - still haunts her and she refuses to autograph a copy of it. "I donâ€™t sign that one. It feels very uncomfortable. Why would you do that?" the 38-year-old actress said. The portrait is said to have been drawn by Cameron himself.
