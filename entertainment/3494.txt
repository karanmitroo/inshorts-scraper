Actress Tisca Chopra has said except Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan, there is no real star from India in Hollywood. "Apart from them, I don't think anyone else is doing anything significant," she added. However, Tisca further said, "We are such a huge country and if one or two people are working in international projects, it doesn't make a difference."
