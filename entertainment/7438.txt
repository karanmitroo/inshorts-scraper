The Taapsee Pannu starrer 'Naam Shabana' has been banned in Pakistan a day after its release. According to sources, authorities felt that the film's theme of terrorism could reflect badly on Pakistan, which is why the film was withdrawn from theatres. Earlier this year, Pakistan had lifted the ban on screening Indian films.
