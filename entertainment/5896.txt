Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma was slammed on social media after sharing an inappropriate picture of tennis player Sania Mirza. Varma used the picture to promote his short film 'Meri Beti Sunny Leone Banna Chaahti Hai', talking about a girl whose father refused to let her play tennis beyond a certain age because she would have to wear skirts.
