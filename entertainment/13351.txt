Expressing shock over Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch's murder, Rakhi Sawant questioned if Qandeel was killed because of "exposing" or because she used to "love" several Indians like Virat Kohli and herself. Claiming that she suspected conspiracy by Qandeel's family before the murder, Sawant advised Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to learn to "save daughters" like PM Narendra Modi.
