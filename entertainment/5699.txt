Pakistani actor Ali Zafar was slammed for sharing a video in support of the Pakistani cricket team, before the India-Pakistan Champions trophy final on Sunday. Users called Zafar a hypocrite, while one comment read, "You're promoting your country but hope you continue doing that and never use India to get work." Ali has worked in Indian films, including 'Dear Zindagi'.
