Karan Johar has slammed filmmakers and singers who criticised his film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and the row over an alleged insulting dialogue on late singer Mohammed Rafi. "Filmmakers making irresponsible remarks... singers revelling in self-importance... Uff," tweeted Johar. Earlier, singer Sonu Nigam commented on the row while filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra said he wasn't interested in watching ADHM.
