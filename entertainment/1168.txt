Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt, who is known for his bold films often in the horror genre, said, "Selling sex in Bollywood is dead." He further said that 'horrex', a genre of movies with elements of horror and sex, doesn't exist anymore as sex is out of horrex. "Data providers have killed sex market because porn is more accessible now," added Bhatt.
