Actress Nigaar Khan, who entered the Bigg Boss house last week, was evicted from the house on Sunday. Nigaar Khan is relieved upon her eviction from 'Bigg Boss 8' as she felt the reality show was nothing less than a nightmare for her. Nigaar's sister Gauhar Khan was declared the winner of the previous season of Bigg Boss.
