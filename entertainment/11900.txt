Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has said that people do not have time to talk to each other because they are busy "using phones". She questioned as to how many people would leave their phones to pick a tissue lying on the floor and put it in the bin. Aishwarya was speaking at the second edition of the 'Safaigiri Awards'.
