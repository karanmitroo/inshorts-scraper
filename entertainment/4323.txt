DJ David Mueller, who is accused of groping singer Taylor Swift at an event four years ago, has denied the accusations while saying that the allegations cost him his career, passion and income. Testifying in the trial, Mueller added, "I want to clear my name." Swift had claimed Mueller put his hand under her skirt and grabbed her bare buttocks.
