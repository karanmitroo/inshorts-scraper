Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that Apurva Asrani, the writer of her upcoming film 'Simran', posted allegations against her on Facebook deliberately at the time when her film 'Rangoon' had flopped at the box office. "I thought (this) was in bad taste...and extremely deliberate," added Kangana. Earlier, Apurva had accused Kangana of lying about co-writing the script for 'Simran'.
