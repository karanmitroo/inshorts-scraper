Scarlett Johansson opened a new gourmet popcorn restaurant in Paris on Saturday, along with her husband Romain Dauriac. Johansson also served some of the dishes at the 'soft opening' of the Yummy Pop restaurant, which will be followed by a grand opening later this year. The dishes included truffle parmesan and sage popcorn, her favourite, and strawberries and cream popcorn.
