Playboy magazine on Monday announced its decision to bring back nudity with its March/April issue, ending a one-year-old nudity ban. Playboy CCO Cooper Hefner said, "Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem. Today we're taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are." Notably, Playboy had banned nudity due to the easy availability of online porn.
