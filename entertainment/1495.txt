Actress-turned-author Twinkle Khanna, who has produced Akshay Kumar starrer 'PadMan', said he was not the first choice for the film. "[Director] R Balki convinced me that Akshay should do this part," she added. When asked which actor she had originally considered for the role, Twinkle jokingly asked, "Are you trying to create trouble in my marriage now?"
