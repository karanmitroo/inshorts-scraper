Reiterating that 'Padmaavat' has been banned in Madhya Pradesh, state Home Minister Bhupendra Singh has said people should not play its songs. He said this while answering a question on Karni Sena workers vandalising a school in the state's Jaora area over a dance performance to the 'Ghoomar' song. The movie has been banned in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana.
