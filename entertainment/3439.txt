Actor Salman Khan took to Twitter to share a video which he captioned, "This reminds me of 1996 Michael Jackson (MJ) concert where I carried Arpita on my shoulders for the entire show." In the video, a child can be seen sitting on the shoulders of a parent or older sibling to watch Salman's performance at his concert in London.
