Indo-Canadian YouTube star Lilly Singh, also known as Superwoman, said, "If you watch something and it makes you laugh, great. If it doesn't, that comedy isn't wrong. It's just not suitable for you." Calling comedy "very subjective", Lilly added, "The best thing you can do is promote what you love, (and not) bash what you hate."
