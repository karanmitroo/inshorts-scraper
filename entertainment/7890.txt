Actress Twinkle Khanna has said that the upcoming film 'Pad Man', which is her first production venture, will bring awareness about menstruation, which has so far been a "cloaked and shamed" topic. "It's a wonderful project. I am very happy to be a part of the film," added Twinkle. The film stars her husband Akshay Kumar and actress Radhika Apte.
