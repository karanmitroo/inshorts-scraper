Actor-model Milind Soman has shared a video of his mother Usha Soman, who is in her seventies, doing planks in a sari. Milind wrote, "1min 20sec plank for Mother's day! Not her personal best but good all the same." Usha, who reportedly started trekking at 60, has already participated in three Oxfam walkathons and one Pinkathon, a marathon for women.
