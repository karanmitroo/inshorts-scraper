Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj has said it's never easy to adapt a book into a film as one is never satisfied with the script. "But... whenever you get stuck you always have something to fall back on," said Bhardwaj, who has garnered critical acclaim for adaptations like 'Maqbool', 'Omkara' and 'Haider'. Bhardwaj is currently working on the period romance drama 'Rangoon'.
