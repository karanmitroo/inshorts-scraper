After Leonardo DiCaprio, Hollywood actor Christian Bale has reportedly opted out of the Steve Job biopic as he felt that the role was not right for him. Scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin had earlier confirmed that Bale would be playing Jobs in director Danny Boyle's untitled project. It is not yet clear whether Bale's withdrawal will affect the rest of the casting.
