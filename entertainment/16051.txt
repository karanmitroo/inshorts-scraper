Censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani claimed in an interview that the current board is more liberal than the previous ones. When asked how cutting kissing scenes in the latest James Bond movie is logical, Nihalani said, "This means you want to do sex in your house with your door open. And show to people the way you are doing sex".
