Actress Huma Qureshi has said that it is wrong to compare her with Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone as both of them are very senior actors. She added, "I'm proud of what they've done for themselves and for the country," referring to their careers in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Huma will make her debut in Hollywood with the film 'Viceroy's House'.
