Singer Mel B has won a court order that bans her estranged husband Stephen Belafonte from distributing sex tapes and other explicit material in a potential "revenge porn" attack. Belafonte had reportedly threatened to release material on numerous occasions. The singer filed for divorce last month after accusing him of domestic violence and sexual exploitation.
