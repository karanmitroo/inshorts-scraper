Bigg Boss 11 contestant Arshi Khan's publicist Flynn Remedios has said that co-contestant Priyank Sharma could be arrested while he is still on the show. Earlier, Priyank had asked another contestant Haryanvi singer-dancer Sapna Chaudhary to use the words 'Goa' and 'Pune' to provoke Arshi. However, the places named were related to an ongoing legal case involving Arshi.
