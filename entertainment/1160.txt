Actor Hrithik Roshan's ex-wife Sussanne Khan took to Instagram to wish him on the occasion of his 44th birthday on Wednesday and wrote, "Forever and always you stay the sunshine in my life." "Smile that smile brightest and you always will spread that light...limitless," she added. Hrithik and Sussanne got divorced in 2014 after nearly 14 years of marriage.
