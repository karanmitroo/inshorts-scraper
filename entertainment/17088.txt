The Haridwar Food and Drug Administration on Friday served a notice to Madhuri Dixit for endorsing Maggi, questioning her on the claims made in the advertisement. The notice seeks a report from the actress within 15 days regarding the nutritional value of the noodle. Maggi recently came under the scanner for containing MSG and lead more than the permissible limit.
