Ekta Kapoor, who's the distributor of 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', said that the film's success is a win for cinema. She added, "Films just have their own way to reach the audience if they are good." Ekta further said that she would've hated herself as a female professional, had she not released the film as a distributor.
