Actor Anupam Kher, while sharing a picture of a critic's review from 1975 for the film 'Sholay', tweeted that actor Amitabh Bachchan was simply referred to as "Dharam's (Dharmendra's) friend" and the film was deemed "average". Kher further pointed out that Amjad Khan, who portrayed the villain 'Gabbar Singh' in 'Sholay', was banished and mauled completely by the critic.
