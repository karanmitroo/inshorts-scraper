Actor Ryan Reynolds has written a tribute to Connor McGrath, a 13-year-old Canadian fan, who died earlier this week after fighting cancer for three years. Reynolds had been visiting Connor through the Make-a-Wish Foundation. "We met because he loved Deadpool," Reynolds wrote. Connor was the first person to watch 'Deadpool' after Reynolds surprised him with the film's rough cut.
