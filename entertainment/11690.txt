Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that she hopes actresses Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor achieve the same levels of global popularity that she has reached. "I hope that happens to them because it's unbelievable when it happens in another country... Today is not about domestic, it's all about entertainment. It's global. So now everyone wants that," added Priyanka.
