Aditi Rao Hydari, who has a cameo in the upcoming Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed 'Padmavati', said the filmmaker presents women very well in his films. "In 'Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela', Richa Chadha had a brief role, but she made an impact. I'm sure I'll leave some impact," added Aditi. She further said everyone who works with Bhansali benefits from the association.
