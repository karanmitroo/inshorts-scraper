Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone took to Instagram to wish Arnold Schwarzenegger a day before his birthday. "As long as you live and beyond, you're always going to be the 'Big Man' who set the bar so high that it will never be surpassed, an action hero legend!" he wrote. The two actors were last seen together in 'Expendables 3'.
