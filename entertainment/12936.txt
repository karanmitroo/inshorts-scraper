Paul Feig, the director of the 'Ghostbusters' reboot, has said that he will not attempt to reboot any other classic film. "This one was just too tempting because I knew we could do something with it that was exciting," said Feig. The reboot of 'Ghostbusters', unlike the original film which had an all-male cast, starred actresses as 'ghostbusters'.
