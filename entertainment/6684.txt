Shekhar Kapur is set to direct Little Dragon, an authorised biopic of the legendary artist-actor Bruce Lee. The late actor had the Chinese screen name Li Xiaolong where Xiaolong means little dragon. "The film will be a contemporary take on Bruce Lee...It is important that audiences today can relate their own lives to the journey of Bruce Lee," said Kapur.
