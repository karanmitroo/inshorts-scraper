Game2: Winter, a reality game show in Russia where murder and rape will be allowed, will start airing on the internet in July. The show will reportedly be broadcast live from a remote Siberian island where 30 participants, armed with knives, will have to survive for nine months. However, participants will be liable to the Russian law for criminal offences.
