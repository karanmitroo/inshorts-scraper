Actress Aditi Rao Hydari turned showstopper for designer Gaurav Gupta at India Couture Week. She walked the runway in an ivory gown from his collection 'Moondust', paired with minimal makeup and no accessories. "This collection is... inspired by nature, forest, a fantasy space, almost like a parallel world which is happening on the moon in a fairytale way," said Gaurav.
