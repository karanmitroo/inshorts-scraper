Actress Katrina Kaif revealed that while she was shooting for the song 'Chikni Chameli', her feet began to bleed as she was dancing barefoot on stones and gravel. She further revealed that co-star Sanjay Dutt, who has known her since she was 18 years old, felt very shy and could not look her in the eye during the song's shooting.
