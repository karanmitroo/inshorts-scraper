National Award winning actor Kamal Haasan on Tuesday called the returning of awards a "futile exercise". "Nothing will happen by returning awards. There are sensible politicians in every party", Haasan, who has also won the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan awards said. Further, the 60-year-old actor said, "I will not return my National Award and insult the government".
