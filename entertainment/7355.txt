British DJ Paul Oakenfold on Tuesday performed a concert at the base camp (5,380 metres) of the world's highest peak Mount Everest. The gig is part of a series aimed to introduce people to electronic dance music and raise awareness about effects of global warming. Oakenfold has claimed that he had no trekking experience before he set out for Everest.
