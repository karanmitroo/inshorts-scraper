Writer Sameer Gautam Singh has claimed that Apurva Asrani, who slammed Kangana Ranaut for lying about co-writing the script for the film Simran, hijacked his writing credit in the film Shahid. Sameer further revealed that Shahid's director Hansal Mehta gave into Apurva's demand as he refused to continue working as the film's editor unless he was given a Screenplay credit.
