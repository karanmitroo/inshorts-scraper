CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said he'll clear the word 'intercourse' without any cuts in 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', if he gets one lakh votes from public. "I want to see...that Indian families want 12-year-olds...to understand meaning of intercourse," added Nihalani. One of the film's trailer features Anushka Sharma saying 'intercourse' while discussing an indemnity bond with Shah Rukh Khan.
