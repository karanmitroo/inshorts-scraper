In a behind-the-scenes video of the upcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', actress Anushka Sharma revealed that she had to wear a lehenga weighing 17 kilograms in addition to heavy jewellery in the song 'Channa Mereya'. "I looked like a beautiful bride but certainly didn't feel like one. The clothes were heavy, everyone felt sorry for me," added Anushka.
