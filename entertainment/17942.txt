After receiving accolades with his last single, Mitti Di Khushboo, actor Ayushmann Khurrana is working on forming a rock band this year. "It will be a soft rock/­alternative band. We will mostly be covering famous Bollywood songs, besides creating ­originals," the 30-year old said. He added all this will happen after release of his two films this year.
