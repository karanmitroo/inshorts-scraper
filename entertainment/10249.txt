The distributors of the Aamir Khan starrer 'Dangal' have confirmed that the film won't release in Pakistan. Earlier, reports suggested that 'Dangal' will release in Pakistani theatres. Notably, cinema halls in Pakistan started screening Indian movies on December 19, after a hiatus of over two months as film exhibitors and theatre owners had suspended such screenings due to Indo-Pakistan tensions.
