Pakistani singer Adnan Sami has been granted Indian citizenship on humanitarian grounds, the Ministry of Home Affairs said on Thursday. Sami, whose citizenship will be effective from January 1, had appealed to the Foreigners' Division of the Home Ministry in May, requesting his stay in India. The 42-year-old singer had first arrived in India in 2001, with a visitor's visa.
