A Mumbai court has stayed the release of short film 'Hum Kuchh Kah Naa Sakey' featuring late TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee, which was scheduled to release on Saturday. This was based on a police complaint filed by Pratyusha's boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh, who claimed the film has shown him in bad light. Rahul has been accused of abetting Pratyusha's suicide.
