Actress Priyanka Chopra, when asked why Hindi cinema's male superstars have not made a transition to Hollywood, said, "Male superstars perhaps don't try. You need strength for that." Priyanka recently beat Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Aniston in terms of popularity in an IMDb poll. She added, "I think Indian talent deserves to be on the top 10 of the list."
