Comedian Chandan Prabhakar has said that despite being unwell, Kapil Sharma is trying to make people laugh by continuing to shoot for his show. He added, "If he faints on the set, it's not his fault. Sadly that also becomes news." Kapil has been hospitalised twice in the past two months after complaining of uneasiness and high blood pressure.
