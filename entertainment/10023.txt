A photo gallery shows the testing of a manned walking robot in a South Korean company. "Our robot is the world's first manned bipedal robot and is built to work in extreme hazardous areas where humans cannot go," the company's chairman said. The robot is similar to the military robots which featured in 2009 science fiction film 'Avatar'.
