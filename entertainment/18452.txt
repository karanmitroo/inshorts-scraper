Ranveer Singh completed the 'Bang Bang' challenge given to him by Hrithik Roshan, and also paid a tribute to the actor. He danced to 'Main Aisa Kyon Hoon', in the 'Krrish' costume', while doing the steps of 'Ek pal ka jeena', in the middle of the street (which was Hrithik's dare). He posted the video on Twitter, on Thursday.
