Ousted Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the former Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore made him look like a 'sanskaari villain'. Pahlaj further said that though Rajyavardhan approved of his way of working yet, he would project a completely different image when he met actors and filmmakers.
