Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan was on Thursday trolled on Twitter for tweeting about the white-and-gold or blue-and-black dress, almost 3-months after it originally sparked a debate on social media. "Dear Hrithik Roshan, You'd also be pleased to know that the Britishers have finally left. India is a free country now," read one such tweet.
