The Bombay High Court on Thursday stayed the October 10 world television premier of Salman Khan-starrer 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' over alleged plagiarism. In a suit filed against the film, a man named Mahim Joshi had claimed that he had written the story before registering it with the Film Writers Association. The next hearing of the case will be on October 20.
