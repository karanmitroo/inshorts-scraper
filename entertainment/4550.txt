Actor Tom Hiddleston will star in a play on William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', which will be directed by Kenneth Branagh. The production aims to raise money for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the drama school attended by Hiddleston. Tickets will be available through a lottery and winners will be able to collect them only on the day of the performance.
