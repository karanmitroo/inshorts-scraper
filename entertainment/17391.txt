Filmmaker Arbaaz Khan feels that a biopic on brother superstar Salman Khan will have nothing new to portray. "...personally I would not want to do a biopic on somebody who is existing," Arbaaz said when asked if he would make a Salman Khan biopic. Further, he said, "Biopics are made on the personalities about whom much is not known."
