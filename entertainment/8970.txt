Govinda has said that filmmaker Karan Johar is a more jealous and dangerous person as compared to David Dhawan. "It's a well-planned...move by Karan that he's releasing his film (Badrinath Ki Dulhania) a week after mine (Aa Gaya Hero)," he added. Govinda further said that Karan shows he's very humble but doesn't seem like an innocent person to him.
