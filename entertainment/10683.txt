Aamir Khan has said that his father was like Hitler, while comparing him to the German dictator Adolf Hitler, who is known for his strictness. "We were really scared of him. As a kid, I was rebellious," said Aamir. His response was prompted by children who, during the launch of Dangal's song 'Haanikarak Bapu', said that their mothers were stricter.
