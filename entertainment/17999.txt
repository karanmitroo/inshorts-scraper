Sony Corporation might face a copyright lawsuit for using an unlicensed song in the film "The Interview", which released amid much political drama last month. Popular K-pop singer Yoon Mi-rae's track “Pay Day” appears in the film, but her record label, Feel Ghood Music, says Sony never paid for the rights and a lawsuit was therefore imminent.
