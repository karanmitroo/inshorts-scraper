Actor Dilip Kumar was on Saturday admitted to a hospital in Mumbai for treatment of pneumonia. â€œHe is suffering from cough and cold. We have put him on antibiotic treatment. He is not in ICU," Dr Jalil Parkar of Lilavati Hospital said. The 91-year-old actor was hospitalized in September last year after suffering a silent heart attack.
