A picture of singer Selena Gomez at the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, which she posted on Instagram recently, has sparked outrage.  The mosque is very particular about the dress code, and while Selena was covered in the traditional burqa, a "revealing" pose showed a bit of her ankle. Her ''provocative'' pose drew criticism as well.
