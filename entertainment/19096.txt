The Delhi High Court has restrained the release of Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla starrer Gulaab Gang, which was meant to release this Friday (March 7). The court ruling came after activist Sampat Pal (the real-life Gulabi Gang leader) approached the court seeking a stay on the release, saying the filmmakers did not ask her permission before making the movie.
