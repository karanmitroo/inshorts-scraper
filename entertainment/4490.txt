Actor Emraan Hashmi has said that if his uncle Mahesh Bhatt, who is a producer and director in Bollywood, had not been there, he would not have been an actor. "Yes, nepotism exists in our industry, and I got a break because of it," added Emraan. His debut film 'Footpath' was produced by Mahesh Bhatt.
