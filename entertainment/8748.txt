American daily The New York Times (NYT) has called filmmaker Karan Johar "The Man Who Let India Out of the Closet". The article said that though Johar has not said he's gay, his life and work are "a portrait in courage". It further states, "He has done more than anybody to introduce the idea of homosexuality into the Indian home."
