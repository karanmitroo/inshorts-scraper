Actress Hema Malini has revealed that she entered politics on the insistence of late actor Vinod Khanna. She said, "One day Vinod called to say, 'I am fighting elections from Gurdaspur. I want you to campaign for me. I refused outright...but he insisted." Khanna, who passed away on Thursday, was the sitting Member of Parliament from Gurdaspur for BJP.
