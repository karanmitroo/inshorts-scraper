Brazilian model Izabelle Leite - who was first 'spotted' with cricketer Virat Kohli, sparking rumours of a romance - was spotted Wednesday with Sidharth Malhotra at a Bandra restaurant. Apparently, Izabelle tried hard to hide her face from the photographers gathered there. Although there are rumours that Siddharth and Izabelle have been dating for three months now, she remains non-committal.
