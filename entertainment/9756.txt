Irish rock band U2 has decided to delay the release of its 14th studio album 'Songs of Experience' because of the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. Band's guitarist David Evans said that the band needed some "breathing space" to consider what it wanted to say to the world following Trump's election win.
