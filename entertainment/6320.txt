Former Pakistani singer Adnan Sami, now an Indian citizen, tweeted, "Dear Pak Trolls, U keep asking if I miss Beef. I don't miss Beef. I have Freedom. It's a freedom thing-U wouldn't understand! Truly, Moo!" Further, when a Pakistani fan accused him of hurting her ego, Sami replied, "Look deep within yourself...Has nothing to do with ego but instead, reality."
