Taapsee Pannu has said it took her three years to convince people in Bollywood that she can be glamorous enough to be part of 'Judwaa 2'. "In the south, I started off as a glamorous girl...it's...funny that the two industries are...different," added Taapsee. She further said her role in 'Judwaa 2' is different from Karisma Kapoor's or Rambha's in 'Judwaa'.
