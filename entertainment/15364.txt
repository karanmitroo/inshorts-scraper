Actress Meryl Streep, heading her first film jury at the Berlin International Film Festival, on Thursday said that all humans are originally from Africa. Streep's response was prompted by queries on the all-white jury panel and her familiarity with world cinema especially African and Middle Eastern films. She said her commitment was to equality and inclusion "of all genders, races".
