Shiv Sena has reportedly forced the organisers, Anjaneya Sathe Group, to cancel Pakistani singer Atif Aslam's music event which was scheduled to be held in Pune on April 25. The political party maintained its stand saying that there was no place in Maharashtra for the Pakistani artists as long as the neighbouring country continues to violate ceasefire along the LoC.
