The Producers Guild of America has banned producer Harvey Weinstein for life from the trade organisation. "Sexual harassment can no longer be tolerated in our industry or within the ranks of Producers Guild membership," read the organisation's statement. This comes after over 40 women, including actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and rape.
