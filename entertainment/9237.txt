Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said it is sad if one has to fear the Prime Minister. "PM is the head of the state or country, who you can question... argue with... but never fear him, because you chose him and he represents your well-being," he wrote. Kashyap further wrote that respect cannot be demanded but it has to be earned.
