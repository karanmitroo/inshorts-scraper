Filmmaker Amole Gupte has said whenever he works with children, he ensures they are comfortable and never forces them to give shots. "When I was the chairperson of the Children's Film Society, I...obtained a time limit on...number of hours children work on television and in cinema," added Amole. He further said he shoots according to the "natural clock" of children.
