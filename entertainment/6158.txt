Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya has said he's dividing India between nationals and anti-nationals. Abhijeet, whose Twitter accounts were suspended, added, "At least I'm doing one good thing by uniting...nationalists. The anti-nationals aren't liking it and...forming a group against us." He had previously said, Twitter was a platform "for anti-nationals, anti-Indian Army, anti-Modi, and anti-Hindu."
