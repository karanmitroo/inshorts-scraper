Yesteryear actor Randhir Kapoor, while talking about what the Kapoors discuss about at family parties, jokingly said, "Booze, women, sex, dirty jokes... what else?" He added, "We don't sulk and cry on each other's shoulders. We don't do any bitching or back-biting about other people in the fraternity... We're so busy among ourselves - too busy to bother about others."
