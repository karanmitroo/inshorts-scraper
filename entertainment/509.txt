A writer named Ripu Daman Jaiswal has claimed that Akshay Kumar starrer 'Pad Man' has been plagiarised from a script he wrote earlier. He has also filed an FIR against the film's makers over the row. "I can't tell you how hard it is to see the film I have written with so much passion...going away from me," he tweeted.
