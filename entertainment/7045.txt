Actress Sonakshi Sinha and singer Armaan Malik engaged in a Twitter spat over Bollywood actors turning into singers. The Twitter spat began after Armaan Malik agreed with singer Kailash Kher for slamming Sonakshi's selection to perform at Justin Bieber's upcoming concert. "Imagine how crushed they [singers] feel when they see non-singers getting the chance," read one of Armaan's tweet.
