Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, 'Birdman' is "an intense, tantalising and tragic dramedy", writes NDTV. Starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, the film shows the internal torment of fading superhero Riggan Thomson, and is intellectually challenging. It has been received well with the critics, with NDTV and TOI giving 4/5, IBNLive and Economic Times 4.5/5 and Mid-Day 5/5.
