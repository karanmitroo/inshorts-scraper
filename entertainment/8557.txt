Reacting to 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' being denied certification by censor board, director Kabir Khan said, "Oh god, not again! It is becoming a bit of a joke." He added that it seems every two months, the CBFC has made it a habit to do something completely stupid like this. The film has already been showcased at Tokyo Film Festival.
