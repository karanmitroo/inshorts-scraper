Actor Irrfan Khan, while talking about casting couch, revealed, "It has been hinted to me and sometimes I have been told clearly that if I compromise I'll get the job." "It has come from both males and females," he added. Irrfan further said, "It becomes slightly weird when people you know and respect a lot, give you such offers."
