In a recent interview, superstar Salman Khan said that he will get married once he is 'matured'. "Once I grow up, once I am more correct, when I become mature then I will commit," the 49-yr-old actor said. Further, he said he would love to have kids once he figures out 'a way to have them without a wife'.
