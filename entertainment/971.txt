The Supreme Court today rejected a plea filed by a lawyer seeking cancellation of the U/A certificate granted by the Censor Board to 'Padmaavat'. "Maintaining law and order is not our job. That is the job of the state", it said while rejecting the submission that the film's screening may cause serious threats to life, property, law and order.
