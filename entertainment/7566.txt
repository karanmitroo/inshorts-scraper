Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan has said no one has the right to comment on how she conducts herself after delivery or what sort of a mother she is. "It's whimsical to generalise that all women go through depression after childbirth," she added. Kareena further said she will not scream from rooftops about experiencing motherhood or how much she loves Taimur.
