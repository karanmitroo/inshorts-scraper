Actor Rishi Kapoor has said that he should've entered the film industry in the early 1990s and not the early 1970s. He explained that this is because romantic films didn't perform well at the box-office when he joined films. "Chandni (1989) was a game changer...when the time for my pack up arrived, situations changed in Bollywood film industry," added Rishi.
