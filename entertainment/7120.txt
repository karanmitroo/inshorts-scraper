At a recent event, comedian Sunil Grover said that Kapil Sharma is a great comedian who makes entire India laugh. This comes after Kapil shouted at Sunil on a flight in March and reportedly threw a shoe at him. While Kapil apologised on Twitter, Sunil has stopped shooting for 'The Kapil Sharma Show' following the incident.
