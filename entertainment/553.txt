Speaking about the changes in Indian cinema, lyricist Javed Akhtar said, "I am very unhappy with the present music scenario in Bollywood...the music is so loud...every song is treated like a clap song." He added, "The music being produced is not very sympathetic to lyrics anymore." He further said at times, one just doesn't understand what the person is singing.
