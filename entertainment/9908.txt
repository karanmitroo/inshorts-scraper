Actor-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan has said that he couldn't shift the release date of his upcoming film 'Kaabil' as he is superstitious. The film will release on January 25, the same day when the Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Raees' will hit theatres. "I am neither angry nor hurt with Shah Rukh Khan, Ritesh Sidhwani or Farhan Akhtar (Raees' producers)," added Rakesh.
