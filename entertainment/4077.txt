Singer Taylor Swift has removed all posts from her accounts on Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Facebook, and her official website has gone blank. This has led fans to speculate that she'll announce a new album, as her website was blank in a similar way before the announcement of her 2014 album '1989'. Reports also suggest her accounts may've been hacked.
