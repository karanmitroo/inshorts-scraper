Actor Rajkummar Rao joked about Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani's surname at the International Film Festival of India. Talking about Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, Rao said it's a coincidence that both Majid and Smriti are 'Irani'. "You...poked fun at a minister and it only shows as a government how tolerant we are," said Smriti Irani in response.
