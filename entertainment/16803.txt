Video-streaming service provider, Hulu, is mulling over adding an advertisement-free option to its service for a monthly subscription of $12-$14. A codename “NOAH” for “No Ads Hulu” may be launched as early as this fall. The company owners reportedly still believe in the ad-supported version of the service, and aim to use it to make advertising more relevant to viewers.
