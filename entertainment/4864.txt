Nawazuddin Siddiqui revealed he has faced prejudice all his life because of his dark complexion and humble background. He added that discrimination begins at home when the mother asks the son to marry a fair wife so that kids aren't dark in complexion. Nawazuddin further said he hasn't been rejected in films for his complexion, but added, "Hero ka matlab...gora-chitta."
