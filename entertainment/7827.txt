Varun Dhawan, while reacting to the controversy around the molestation scene in 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania', likened it to the 'balatkar' speech scene in '3 Idiots'. He said people should have been offended by the scene in '3 Idiots' as well. "It was supposed to be a funny scene and meant to portray how Badri's male ego is shattered," he added.
