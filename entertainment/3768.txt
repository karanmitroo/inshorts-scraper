Actor R Madhavan has said that he opted out of Aishwarya Rai starrer 'Fanney Khan' due to date issues. "I loved the script and was really keen to be part of an interesting ensemble like 'Fanney Khan', unfortunately I couldn't commit to the project," said Madhavan. Rajkummar Rao will now star opposite Aishwarya in the film.
