The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has said that it will not take any action against comedian Stephen Colbert who made a sexual joke about US President Donald Trump on his late-night comedy show earlier this month. "The only thing (Trump's) mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's (Russian President) c**k holster," Colbert had said in his joke.
