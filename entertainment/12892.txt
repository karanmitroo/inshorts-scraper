Ex-Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has warned of suing the makers of two movies on the Battle of Saragarhi over any historical inaccuracies depicted in the movies. Ajay Devgn's movie 'Sons of Sardar: The Battle of Saragarhi' and Randeep Hooda's 'Battle of Saragarhi', based on the heroic stand of 21 Sikh soldiers against 10,000 Afghans, are currently under production.
