Patrick Wachsberger, co-chairman of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group which produced the 'Twilight' film series starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart said that there was a "possibility" of more films in the franchise. "Not a certainty, but it's a possibility. It's about Stephenie (Twilight saga book author). If she wants to tell a story... we're here for her," he added.
