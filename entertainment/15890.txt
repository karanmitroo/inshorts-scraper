A movie theatre in Pune city on Friday cancelled all shows of 'Bajirao Mastani' for the day after BJP workers staged a protest. The protestors claimed that the film, based on the story of a Maratha Peshwa Bajirao, was an attempt to distort history. Notably, Bombay High Court has refused to stop the release of the film.
