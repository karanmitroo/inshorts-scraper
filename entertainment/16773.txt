Bollywood actor Salman Khan said on Saturday that he wanted his recently released film Bajrangi Bhaijaan to be made tax-free, 'if the money from the film will not be used for the betterment of the society.' He has also urged PM Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to watch the film for a social cause.
