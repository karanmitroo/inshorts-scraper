Impressed by recently released movie 'Hunterrr', actress Kalki Koechlin said that she also wants to do an adult comedy film. "It's an interesting concept. I would definitely do if it has an original script", she replied when asked if she's interested. She will be next seen in 'Margarita with a Straw' where she plays a girl affected by cerebral palsy.
