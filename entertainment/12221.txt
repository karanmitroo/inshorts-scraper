The script of Radhika Apte's 'Parched' will be archived at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The library is a research collection devoted to the history and development of the motion picture as an art form and an industry. "One more reason to be proud of Parched," tweeted Ajay Devgn, the film's producer.
