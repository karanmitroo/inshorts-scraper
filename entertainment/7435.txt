Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma on Twitter took a dig at filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and his company Phantom Films. "A QUEEN is created by a various PHANTOMous number of people but a COMPANY is created by just one single KING," read one of Varma's tweets. This comes after Vikas Bahl, a co-founder of the company, was accused of sexual harassment recently.
