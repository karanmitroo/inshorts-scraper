After being trolled for receiving 'Nothing to Hide Award' at Star Screens Awards, actress Kriti Sanon has said, "Nowadays, there are different awards being handed out, including one called a 'Youth Icon'. So, I don't see why this is surprising." She further said, "As long as I am not asking someone to give me an award, it is fine."
