Kabir Khan, referring to Salman Khan's statement on wars, stated, "Salman just said war is a waste of resources, human life and time for any country. What's wrong with that?" Kabir added that anybody who says going to war is great is stupid. In an earlier interview, Salman said people who order wars should be asked to go fight themselves.
