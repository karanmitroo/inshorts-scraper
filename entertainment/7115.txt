Animated film 'Smurfs: The Lost Village' which released on Friday, "will leave you feeling blue", wrote Hindustan Times. "[The film's a] roller-coaster journey full of action and danger (in fun form)...," said Mid-Day. "This one, with its insipid and lazy storytelling, fails to build up on Smurf nostalgia," wrote TOI. It was rated 3/5 (Mid-Day, TOI) and 1.5/5 (HT).
