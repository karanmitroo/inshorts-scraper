Hollywood actress Kate Winslet, while talking about co-star Idris Elba's nervousness while filming a sex scene for 'The Mountain Between Us' said, "I was like 'Get on with it'." "Let's face it - I'm 42, I've been doing scenes like that since I was 20. Idris has not done very much nudity, which I didn't realise," she added.
