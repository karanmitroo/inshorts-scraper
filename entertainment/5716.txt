The trial of American comedian-actor Bill Cosby, who was accused of sexual assault, has ended in a mistrial as the jury failed to reach a verdict even after 53 hours of deliberations. Former basketball player Andrea Constand accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 2004. Prosecutors stated that they would seek to retry Cosby on the same charges.
