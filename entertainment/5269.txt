Singer Kailash Kher released the video for his song Bhole Chale on his 44th birthday on Friday. "I deliberately waited for a year to shoot the video. There were a few things that I wanted to use in the visual medium to make it look perfect," said Kailash. Notably, he released the song's audio to mark his birthday last year.
