Actor Aamir Khan met 14-year-old Nihal who is suffering from progeria, following the youngster's wish to meet the actor. Nihal, in a recent Facebook post on the Humans of Bombay page, expressed that he found the 'Taare Zameen Par' star inspirational and wanted to meet him. Progeria is a rare genetic condition where aging begins at an early age.
