Harper Lee’s second novel “Go Set a Watchman” went on sale in the US on Tuesday to a mixed response and “widespread disillusion” over “heroic” lawyer Atticus Finch's depiction as a racist. The book portrays Finch as opposing racial desegregation, in contrast to Lee's 1960 classic “To Kill a Mockingbird” where he defends a black man wrongly accused of rape.
