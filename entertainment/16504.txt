Filmmaker Karan Johar, who was one of the judges on the celebrity dance reality show 'Jhalak Dikhla Jaa Reloaded', has quit the show mid-season. Reportedly, he took the decision as he had to begin the shooting of his upcoming film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The channel is currently looking for Karan's replacement.
