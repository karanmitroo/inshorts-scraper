Deepika Padukone has slammed the ban on Pakistani actress Mahira Khan starrer 'Verna', which deals with the subject of rape. "It's sad that a small section of people don't understand the power of cinema and what it can do to the world," she said. Deepika's film 'Padmavati' has also been facing opposition from different groups including Rajput organisation Karni Sena.
