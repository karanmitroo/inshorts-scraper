After stirring up controversies with the 1st poster, the 2nd poster of the Aamir-starrer 'PK' was released on Wednesday. In much contrast to the previous poster, he is now seen in a traditional Rajasthani outfit, with a trumpet bearing the name 'Bhairosingh Band.' The posters are to confuse the audience, says Aamir, though each one relates to the story perfectly.
