Actor Akshay Kumar is set to auction a bicycle he used in the film 'Pad Man' for charity. The proceeds from the auction will be used for supporting women empowerment through 'Laadli', a girl child campaign by the NGO Population First. 'Pad Man' is based on the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, the inventor of a low-cost sanitary pad-making machine.
