Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has said the only tweet he regrets is the one when he picked on actor Tiger Shroff for no reason. RGV, who quit the social media platform, further said, "Trollers and controversies never bothered me... I had better reasons to quit." He added he was only living in the Twitter world and wanted to change that.
