Actor Amitabh Bachchan has confessed that he still gets "sleepless nights" and "anxiety" before "each shot that needs to be taken''. "Every film is a test, an examination for me... That is the way I would like it to be. Nothing comes easy in life. Certainly not a hard-hittingâ€‹ film," added Bachchan.
