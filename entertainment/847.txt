US-based scientist Brian Brown has discovered a new fly species in the Brazilian Amazon, which he named 'Megapropodiphora arnoldi' due to its enlarged forelegs. "As soon as I saw those bulging legs, I knew I had to name this one after Arnold," said Brown. Brown also claimed his discovery as the world's smallest fly having 0.395 mm of body length.
