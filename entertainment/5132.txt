Kamal Haasan has said that he does not think the regional version of reality show Bigg Boss, which he is hosting, is tarnishing Tamil culture. A nationalistic Hindu party had filed a police complaint that the show needs to be banned. "These people perhaps have not watched similar shows. Bigg Boss is as necessary as cricket in India," added Haasan.
