Kareena Kapoor, while talking about nepotism in the film industry, said if there is a star kid like Alia Bhatt then there is also Kangana Ranaut, who is not from the industry. Kareena added, "In the industry, it's your hard work and talent that will take you far. That's exactly the reason Kangana Ranaut is considered such a great actress."
