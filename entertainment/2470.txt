Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria has said that appropriate action will be taken against those who create law-and-order disturbances in the state during the release of 'Padmavati'. He added, "Rani Padmavati is an icon of the country and if there is anything insulting (about her) in the film, it should be corrected."
