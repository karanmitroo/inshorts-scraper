Singer Adnan Sami has shown support for actor Fardeen Khan, who has been facing body-shaming on social media after pictures showing his weight gain emerged online. Adnan tweeted, "Pls (please) stop judging ppl (people) by their physiques. It's akin to racism!" He added that a person's soul is a measure of him or her and not the "weighing scales".
