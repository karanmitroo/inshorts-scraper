Actress Alia Bhatt has said that the film Udta Punjab was not made with the purpose of winning a National Film Award. "When the film released, it got that appreciation and recognition from the people. It's not that National awards are not prestigious, but it doesn't take away the fact (from) whatever the film has achieved," added Alia.
