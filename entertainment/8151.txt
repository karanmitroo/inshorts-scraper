Actor Varun Dhawan has said the stardom that the Khans or Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn enjoy is hard to achieve now. "I feel it is partly because of the social media. The mystery is not there anymore. There is a lot of exposure," he added. Varun further said that actors also have to compete with Hollywood stars these days.
