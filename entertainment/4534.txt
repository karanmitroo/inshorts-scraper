Malaika Arora slammed an Instagram user who trolled her for "divorcing a rich man" and "having fun with the alimony". "Her life now is all about wearing short clothes, going to gym or salon, enjoying vacation[s]," the user commented. Malaika responded, "You certainly got to get your damn facts right before spewing sh*t on me...when you know nothing about me."
