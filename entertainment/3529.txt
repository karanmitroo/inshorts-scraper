Apoorva Lakhia, director of the upcoming Shraddha Kapoor starrer 'Haseena Parkar', has said that his experience with the Censor Board was quick and pleasant and the makers were in and out in a few hours. The Prasoon Joshi-led Board has passed the film with U/A certificate and two minor cuts. "I happily went with these cuts...(they) made sense," said Lakhia.
