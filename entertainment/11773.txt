A new shirtless wax statue of singer Justin Bieber has been unveiled at the Madame Tussauds museum in London. The 'wet-look' wax statue has been inspired by the rain shower finale of his 'Purpose' tour concert in Seattle, United States. The unveiling of the statue featured a performance by four female performers to his single 'Sorry' from the album 'Purpose'.
