The Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz', which released on Friday, is "borderline ridiculous... lacks a cohesive script," wrote Hindustan Times. The film is "by far the weakest film that... (Nawazuddin) has ever done," wrote NDTV, while Times of India wrote, "The screenplay could have definitely been tighter." The film was rated 2.5/5 (HT), 1.5/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (TOI).
