Actor Hrithik Roshan, who recently met superstar Shah Rukh Khan at the Mumbai airport, didn't know how to introduce Khan to his kids. “Dilemma! Didn’t know how to introduce @iamsrk to my boys! Too cool for uncle, full name, 1st name- not respectful. Man of love- too long! Need help. Ideas?", Hrithik posted on Twitter.
