Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey has been fired from Ridley Scott's film 'All the Money in the World', one month before its release amid sexual harassment allegations against him. All of his scenes will be reshot and he will be replaced by Christopher Plummer, who will commence shooting immediately. "If anyone can pull it off it's Scott," a source said.
