Reacting to a pirated version of 'Aiyaary' being played in a Maharashtra state bus on the Mumbai to Pune route, the film's co-producer Jayantilal Gada said that the makers were planning to take legal action. He added, "How can a government-run division make such a mistake? If the government will give way to piracy, then who will stop it?"
