The world’s first retail store dedicated to the American TV show “Simpsons” is set to open in Beijing this March. The store will sell about 200 licensed Simpsons products including T-shirts, hats and cell phone covers. The show, which has been running since 1989, started airing in China only in 2014. Its second store will open in Shanghai around June.
