A high-school student from US posted a video on Twitter, asking Emma Stone to be his prom date with a 'La La Land' parody video. He filmed the video in the style of the opening song from the film, which features a dance number on a traffic-filled Los Angeles highway. The student said he re-wrote the lyrics to the song.
