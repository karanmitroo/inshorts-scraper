Only two days before the release, the name of Ranveer-Deepika starrer film Ram-Leela has been changed to Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. The move came after Delhi High Court on Wednesday passed a stay order on the film following a petition filed against the film accusing it of hurting religious sentiments. Earlier also, the name was changed (from Ramleela to Ram-Leela).
