A letter addressed to the Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu has been written by 160 filmmakers, artists and academics to protest the ministry denying permission for the screening of three documentaries at a film festival. The three documentaries revolve around the suicide of research scholar Rohith Vemula, artists in Kashmir and the student protests at JNU.
