Film-maker Mahesh Bhatt whose recent production 'Mr. X' flopped at the box office, has taken the blame of its failure on himself. "BLAME ME... Mr X bombed at the box office because of my content!!," he tweeted. His statement was in contrast to the reports claiming a fallout between his production house and Fox Star Studios, which marketed the movie.
