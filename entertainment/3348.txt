Sanjay Dutt has said that at his age he can't be dancing around trees and around a college campus in films. "My thought process changed as I saw my beard getting white while I was in jail... I want to play roles of my age," he added. Sanjay played Aditi Rao Hydari's father in his recently released comeback film 'Bhoomi'.
