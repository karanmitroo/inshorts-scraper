Actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote a post on his blog titled 'Death...the inevitable end', following the demise of daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai's father Krishnaraj Rai on Saturday. "That call you wait anxiously knowing that it will come, and come it does to end all other calls...glimpses of reactions in the mind, of the lost one...," read a part of Bachchan's post.
