Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Thursday said that former Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh is a friend and he has the right to say what he wants. Earlier, Singh reportedly said, "He (Amitabh) actually warned me not to accept Jaya Bachchan in my political field considering her inconsistent nature and habits. But I did not adhere to his noble advice."
