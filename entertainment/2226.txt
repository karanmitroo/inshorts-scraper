Actress Neha Dhupia has said that it's very disturbing when people call her "sexy" as she hates that word. "People used to call me a 'sex symbol'...I don't think at any point I had a 'sex symbol' quality," added Neha. She further said, "I don't suffer from low esteem but I'm a realist and I know who I am."
