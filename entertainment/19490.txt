Ranbir Kapoor will play a superhero in the yet-untitled film, with director-friend Ayan Mukherjee. He clarified that "It is not like Krrish 3, it is something very different, it is going to be a fantasy film. It is going to be a trilogy which Ayan has just started writing. We share a great personal and professional relation".
