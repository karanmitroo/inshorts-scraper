Following the recent rape of a woman by a renowned company Uber's cab driver in the national capital, actor Akshay Kumar said that 'every rapist should be castrated'. "Rapists are never one-time offenders, and I feel that no amount of time in jail will make them want to stop committing these crimes," said Akshay, the father of a 2-yr-old daughter.
