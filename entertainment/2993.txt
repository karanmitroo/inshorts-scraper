Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli took to Twitter to slam Farhan Akhtar for his "misleading and false letter" on the ongoing Hrithik-Kangana row. Farhan, in his letter, questioned why the woman had not submitted her personal communication devices while the man had shared all necessary information. Rangoli further tweeted, "Why should (Kangana) bother about private investigations paid by Hrithik?"
