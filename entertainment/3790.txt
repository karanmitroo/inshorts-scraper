Amitabh Bachchan will play Vijay Barse, founder of the NGO Slum Soccer, in 'Sairat' filmmaker Nagaraj Manjule's next film. "I wrote it (the upcoming film) with only Bachchan Saab in mind. I've been his fan from childhood," said Manjule. Notably, Slum Soccer enables underprivileged children to develop a better lifestyle by participating in football matches.
