Advocating equal rights for men and women, actress Kalki Koechlin has said that if the society that people are living in was matriarchal, she would have been a "meninist fighting for equal rights for men". "Being a feminist means asking for equality. But people take it in other way(s) at times" said Kalki while speaking about how feminism is misunderstood.
