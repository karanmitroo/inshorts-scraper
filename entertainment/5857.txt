Reacting to actress Raveena Tandon's tweet on if she will be called a Hindutva icon, Sanghi, bhakt or communal on wearing a saree, a user tweeted, "Actually the sari is a symbol for all Indians, it's beautiful. Keep your narrow minded politics out of it." Another user wrote, "Indira Gandhi wore saree alwayz.. Noone termed her communal or bhakt."
