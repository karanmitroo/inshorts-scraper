Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma apologised on Twitter, after being slammed for his tweet on the occasion of International Women's Day which read, "I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives." He wrote, "Was just expressing my feelings but I apologise to all who were offended due to my unintended insensitive tweets."
