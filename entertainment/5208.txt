Responding to 'Jagga Jasoos' being given a U/A certificate, Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani said, "Let the film release. The world will see why we think it is necessary for children to be accompanied by an adult." The CBFC hasn't recommended any cuts in the film. Starring Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif, 'Jagga Jasoos' will release on July 14.
