Filmmaker and CBFC member Ashoke Pandit has revealed that when Pahlaj Nihalani was the Chairman, he used to abuse filmmakers and treat them like gundas. "Everybody was very uncomfortable with his behaviour and his one-man show... Filmmakers were asked to get out of his office," he added. Ashoke further said Prasoon Joshi is a "great choice" as the new Chairman.
