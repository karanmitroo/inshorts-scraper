Actress Vidya Balan has said that if her film fails at the box-office, she never questions herself but instead she talks about it, cries, gets over it and moves on. Vidya added, "It's heartbreaking when a film doesn't work after you have put in so much in it... But I feel that all actors go through hits and flops."
