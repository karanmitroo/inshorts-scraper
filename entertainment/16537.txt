Actress Preity Zinta, who recently completed 17 years in Bollywood, has revealed that she was scared of Salman Khan before she worked with him. "I don't know why but I was", Zinta tweeted. "I used to love to see Salman squirm and get embarrassed hearing my dialogues in 'Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.' He actually is kinda shy", she added.
