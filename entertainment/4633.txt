Actress Shamita Shetty has said that she doesn't mind getting married even at the age of 40 or 50. "I'm not going to sit and stress over it or plan things out," added the 38-year-old actress. "I donâ€™t believe in falling in love today, getting married and if it doesn't work, you go your own way," Shamita further said.
