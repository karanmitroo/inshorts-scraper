Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan on Wednesday said, "Fortunately or unfortunately, having worked in this space for 25-year, I've become larger than life... And yes it is difficult to get out of it at times." He added, "I'm happy being SRK... Hope I'm able to do something in this film (Fan) which is different and people like it as well."
