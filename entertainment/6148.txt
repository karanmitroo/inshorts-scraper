Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya has claimed that people like Karan Johar, Khans and Bhatts are the reason for his new Twitter account being suspended. He added, "Twitter is obliged to [such] people who brought Pakistani artistes in India." In 2016, Abhijeet called Indian filmmakers and actors anti-national for working with Pakistani artistes and tweeted, "They r bigger enemies then #TerrorStatePak."
