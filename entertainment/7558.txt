Singer Adele and her husband Simon Konecki have bought a mansion worth â‚¹32 crore in England. "Adele doesn't want to live with fellow celebrities... She has deliberately chosen the least showbiz place she can think of so she can live a normal, unflashy existence," a source was quoted as saying. Adele and Simon have a four-year-old son named Angelo.
