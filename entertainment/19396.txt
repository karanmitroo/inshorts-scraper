London based filmmaker, Clipp Runyards on Friday went to Dasna Jail to meet Rajesh and Nupur Talwar to offer them a royalty of Rs.5 crore for a book and movie on Aarushi. However, he was unable to meet them as jail rules permit only three people to meet inmates in 15-days and Nupur's relatives had visited them on Thursday.
