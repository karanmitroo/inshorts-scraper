Actor Mohnish Bahl, while talking about his absence from television shows, said, "I feel the creative and script content is pathetic and this is my personal point of view." "Shows start off on a good note but three-four months down the line they completely lose it," he added. Mohnish is known for starring in shows like 'Saans' and 'Sanjivani'.
