Actor-filmmaker Kamal Haasan has said that the Tamil film industry will speak with "one voice" amid the ongoing indefinite shut down of cinema theatres in the state. The strike was against the state government's decision to levy 30% entertainment tax in addition to the newly implemented GST. However, filmmakers opposed the strike as the revenue of their films will suffer.
