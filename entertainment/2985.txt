According to reports, actor Hrithik Roshan's ex-wife Sussanne Khan convinced him to speak out on the ongoing row with Kangana Ranaut. "When Hrithik had an affair with ('Kites' co-star)  Barbara Mori, he told his wife about it. Now when she's his ex-wife, why would he hide any affair?" a source was quoted as saying.
