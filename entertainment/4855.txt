Actress Sonam Kapoor turned showstopper for designers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla's new Bridal Couture collection. She walked the ramp in an ivory coloured embroidered lehenga and a Victorian era inspired blouse featuring a ruffled collar and sheer sleeves. A lattice dupatta and jewellery, including earrings, necklace, bangles and 'kaleera', completed Sonam's look.
