The Supreme Court on Friday directed actor Rajpal Yadav to serve out the remaining six days of the jail term if he fails to immediately return the money he owed to a Delhi-based businessman. "You have got rid of murder (by serving only six days). We were thinking of sending you to jail for six months," said the SC bench.
