Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani, who's directing the biopic on actor Sanjay Dutt, has said that the film is not about guns, drugs and the underworld. "It's a feel-good film about a father-son relationship," he added. Notably, Ranbir Kapoor will be seen portraying Sanjay Dutt while Anushka Sharma will reportedly play a journalist in the biopic.
