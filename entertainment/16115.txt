Censor board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani's music video ‘Mera desh hai mahaan’ is being played during the interval of Salman Khan's Prem Ratan Dhan Payo across the country. Nihalani has dedicated the "deshbhakti song" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The ad comes stitched with the film, and no one was directly in touch with us for this”, PVR Limited's CEO said.
