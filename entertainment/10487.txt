Actress Sofia Vergara is being sued by her two frozen embryos in a lawsuit, as part of a three-year battle by her ex-fiance to see them brought to life. The embryos, created during her engagement to businessman Nick Loeb, have been named Emma and Isabella and listed as plaintiffs. Notably, Vergara married actor Joe Manganiello after her split with Loeb.
