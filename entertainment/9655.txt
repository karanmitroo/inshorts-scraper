DJ Caruso, director of Deepika Padukone's Hollywood debut film 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage', said he surely wants to cast Ranveer Singh and Deepika together in a film. "I wouldn't have to worry about the chemistry too," he added. Speaking about Ranveer's visit to USA, he said, "Ranveer...came in at the right time when Deepika was away from home."
