American comedian and actress Amy Schumer bought a mattress worth $2,000 (â‚¹1 lakh) for a retail worker for letting her use the bathroom at the store while she was jogging. The clerk said she had seen Amy in films but did not recognise her until she saw her name on the credit card. "It was amazing. Unbelievable," added the employee.
