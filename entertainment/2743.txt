Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, while talking about his film 'Omerta', has said that there'll be a problem with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). Hansal added, "I hope they understand the film's context. We haven't done anything to sensationalise." 'Omerta' revolves around British terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh who kidnapped and murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002.
