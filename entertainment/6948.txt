Reality television star Kim Kardashian broke down and cried on the American talk show The Ellen Show when the host Ellen DeGeneres asked her about the Paris robbery. "I know it sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me. I don't want to start crying... I feel like I'm such a different person," said Kim.
