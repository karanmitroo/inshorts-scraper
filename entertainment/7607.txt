'The Conjuring' film franchise has been sued by author Gerald Brittle in a lawsuit of â‚¹5,800 crore. Brittle said the franchise infringes on his 1980 book 'The Demonologist', which tells the stories of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. He claimed that in a 1978 agreement, the couple agreed to a no "competing work" provision that is still in effect.
