The teaser of late TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee's last short film 'Hum Kuchh Keh Naa Sakey' has been released. It was shot one-and-a-half months before Pratyusha committed suicide. "Though a work of fiction, it'll seem... similar to what Pratyusha must have gone through," said Pratyusha's friend Kamya Panjabi. It is scheduled to release on April 1, Pratyusha's first death anniversary.
