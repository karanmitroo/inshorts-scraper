Actress Kriti Sanon has shared a video on Women's Day where she gives out the message, 'Happy whatever because it's the same s**t every year'. Kriti holds various placards which read, 'girl power', 'gender equality', 'women's rights'. She adds that despite all these words, the streets are still unsafe for women and other people still decide what women wear.
