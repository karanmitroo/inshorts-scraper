Rajinikanth's elder daughter Aishwarya Dhanush, at the launch of her book, said that some of her father's films are a bit over-the-top. "I'm one of his (Rajinikanth's) biggest critics," she added. Speaking on husband Dhanush's relationship with Rajinikanth, she said, "Dhanush made it big on his own, not because he is someone's son-in-law, which is something my father deeply admires."
