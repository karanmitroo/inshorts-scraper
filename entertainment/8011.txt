The Centre said that the Censor Board denied certification to 77 films, including sex comedy Great Grand Masti and psychological thriller Raman Raghav 2.0 in 2015-16. Significantly, 47 films were denied certificates in 2014-15. "There was a lot of corruption until 2013...many B, C-grade films would get passed despite great violence and explicit scenes," said Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani.
