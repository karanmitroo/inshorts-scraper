The Anne Hathaway starrer 'Colossal' is "likely (to) rank in quite a few best film lists at the end of the year," wrote Hindustan Times. Mid-Day called it a "quasi-realistic tale" while Times of India wrote that it's "an oddball indie film that mysteriously unravels itself at its own pace". Colossal was rated 4/5 (HT) and 3/5 (Mid-Day, TOI).
