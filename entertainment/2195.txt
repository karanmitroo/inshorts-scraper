CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday said the protests against the film Padmavati before even watching it are a "sign of intolerance" in India. "The protesters are demanding that the film should be banned. Who are they to decide what's history and what's not," Yechury added. Yechury also compared the protestors to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini's private armies.
