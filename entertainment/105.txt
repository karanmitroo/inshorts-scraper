Manoj Bajpayee said that even after doing cult films like Satya, Shool and Kaun, film offers were drying out for the actor as filmmakers did not know what to do with him. While adding that he was only offered a villain's role, he said, "Since they were finding it difficult to work with me...(it became) difficult to be part of...Mumbai."
