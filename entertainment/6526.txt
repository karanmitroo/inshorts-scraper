Music composer Pritam has quit the Sushant Singh Rajput-Kriti Sanon starrer film 'Raabta', after he was asked to recreate a song by the film's producers, which is against his policy. In a Facebook note, Pritam wrote that he has requested the producers to remove his name from the credits. Raabta's producer Bhushan Kumar said that the decision was amicable.
