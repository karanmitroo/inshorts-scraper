Abhay Deol, in a series of posts on Facebook, took a dig at several actors including Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor, who have endorsed fairness creams in their career. Calling such advertisement campaigns demeaning, false and racist, Abhay further wrote, "You have to stop buying into the idea that a particular shade is better than others".
