Pakistani ghazal maestro Ghulam Ali is scheduled to perform at the Sankatmochan Temple in Varanasi next month, for the third year in a row. Ali had performed at the temple in 2016 despite protests by the Shiv Sena. The performance is likely to be part of the opening ceremony of the 'Sankatmochan Sangeet Samaroh' scheduled between April 15 and 20.
