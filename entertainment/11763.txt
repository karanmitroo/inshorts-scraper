Actor Amitabh Bachchan's daughter Shweta Nanda has written an open letter where she has asked the media to give her daughter Navya Nanda her "private life back". "She is not a public figure. Yes, she is related to some very famous people, but that is something completely out of her control," wrote Shweta.
