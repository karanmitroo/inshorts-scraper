Irrfan Khan's film 'Doob: No Bed Of Roses', which was earlier banned by the Bangladesh Censor Board will now be issued a censor certificate. The film was banned as it was said to be based on late Bangladeshi writer and filmmaker Humayun Ahmed. The writer had divorced his wife of 27 years and married an actress 33 years his junior.
