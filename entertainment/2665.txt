Responding to Anu Malik's statement that he should have been given due credits for the recreated version of 'Neendh Churayi Meri' in 'Golmaal Again', his nephew Amaal Mallik said Anu had copied it from another song. "Nevertheless...kindness has been shown in the Youtube credits," he added. "The accusation...that I'm trying to make his song mine is baseless," Amaal further said.
