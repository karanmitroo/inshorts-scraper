Comedian Adam Sandler has topped Forbes' list of Hollywood's most overpaid actors for a second consecutive year. "We estimate that for every $1 Sandler was paid, he returned an average of $3.20," said Forbes, the lowest return on investment of any actor whose record it examined. Johnny Depp comes in second, returning an average of $4.10 for each dollar paid.
