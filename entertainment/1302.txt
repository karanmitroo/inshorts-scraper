While talking about filmmaker Karan Johar's twins Yash and Roohi, Sonakshi Sinha said that Johar calls her Yash's first girlfriend because his son feels shy around her and nobody else. She added, "I met them a couple of times...They are the cutest little pumpkins ever. They are so sweet." Johar became a father to twins via surrogacy in February 2017.
