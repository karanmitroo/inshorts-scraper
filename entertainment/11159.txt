Sunny Pawar, the 8-year-old Indian child artist who has starred in the Hollywood film 'Lion' alongside Nicole Kidman and Dev Patel, has been denied a visa to the US. Sunny was to attend the film's premiere in New York. "We believe it must be the effect of immigration paranoia," stated an official statement from the film's distributor The Weinstein Company.
