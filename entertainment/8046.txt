Actor Shahid Kapoor, while reacting to the burning down of the sets of his upcoming film 'Padmavati', said, "It is unfortunate that something like this has happened for the second time." He added that he is not aware of who is responsible for the vandalism. Earlier in Jaipur, director Sanjay Leela Bhansali was manhandled by protesters during the film's shooting.
