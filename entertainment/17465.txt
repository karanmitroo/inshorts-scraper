Katrina kaif has become the seventh Indian Bollywood actor to be honoured with a wax statue at Madame Tussauds museum in London. Katrina's name was selected for the honour after she won a hotly contested poll last year via Madame Tussauds website. A team of 20 sculptors and artists created the statue over a period of four months.
