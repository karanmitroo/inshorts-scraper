 'Bakrapur', first Hindi film by National award winning filmmaker Janaki Vishwanathan features a goat named Shah Rukh as the lead protagonist. She brushed off any reference to the Bollywood superstar when asked if it is an attempt to poke fun at SRK stating that the goat was integral to the story so they needed a name for it..something catchy.
