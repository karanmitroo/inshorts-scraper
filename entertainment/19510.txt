Pakistani singer-composer Adnan Sami has been granted a three months visa extension by the ministry of home affairs, starting from October-6, the last date of validity of his previous visa. Adnan made an application for his visa extension to the ministry after he received a notice from Mumbai Police, which required an explanation for overstaying after his visa expired.
