Actor Irrfan Khan has said one doesn't really need to know acting to become a star. "In our cinema, sometimes acting is not required. That's the reality... That's why [stars] think the way they do," he added. Irrfan further said, "If you have cinema where acting becomes crucial, then everybody would go and learn acting."
