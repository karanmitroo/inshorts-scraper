A day after Priyanka Chopra's ex-manager Prakash Jaju claimed that the actress attempted suicide thrice in the past, Priyanka's mother has dismissed his claims. "[T]hat lying bastard spent time in jail...his old mother and father fell at Pc's feet begging forgiveness", Madhu Chopra tweeted. Jaju had, a few years ago, filed a criminal suit against Priyanka, after she fired him.
