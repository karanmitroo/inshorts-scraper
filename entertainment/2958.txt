Rajput organisation Karni Sena has threatened PVR multiplexes to not release Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film 'Padmavati'. In a letter to the manager of PVR Cinemas, the organisation further threatened that if the film is released, the theatre owners would be responsible for any kind of losses thereafter. Karni Sena had earlier also slapped Bhansali and vandalised the film's sets.
