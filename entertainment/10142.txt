Rapper Raftaar has created a special rap for the Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence starrer Hollywood film 'Passengers', which will play before the film's screening in Indian theatres. "Chris Pratt is a proper bro and Jennifer Lawrence 'aapki bhabhi hai,'" said Raftaar while adding that it's like icing on the cake that his first Hollywood collaboration stars both of them.
