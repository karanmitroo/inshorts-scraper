BJP MP Chintamani Malviya, while slamming Sanjay Leela Bhansali for his upcoming film 'Padmavati', wrote, "People like him only understand the language of shoes." He added, "How come filmmakers whose women family members change their husbands every day can understand 'Jauhar'?" "Mental deformity of Mr Bhansali would not be tolerated in the name of freedom of expression," Malviya further said.
