Sajid Khan's upcoming film 'Humshakals', currently being shot, is reportedly garnering a lot of media attention because of Sajid's fondness for Esha Gupta, the film's actor. The two spend a lot of time together which has apparently irked Bipasha Basu, the film's second leading lady. Sajid's ex Jacqueline Fernandez, initially chosen for Esha's part, was dropped after the two broke-up.
