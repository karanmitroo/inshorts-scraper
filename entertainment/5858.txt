Information and Broadcasting Ministry has denied permission for the screening of three documentaries at an upcoming Kerala film festival. The three films include 
a documentary based on PhD scholar Rohith Vemula who committed suicide, a film on Kashmir and another on the JNU agitation. Reacting to the decision, the film festival's director said there's an "undeclared cultural Emergency" in India.
