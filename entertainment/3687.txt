Manisha Koirala has said that before cancer, her lifestyle wasn't that great and she didn't value her life that much. "It's only when I was struggling for life, that's when I realised...I was struggling. So much money being spent, so much anguish, pain, and fear," added Manisha. She further said that's why she tells people that life is a gift.
