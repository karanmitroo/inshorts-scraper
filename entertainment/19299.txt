Emraan Hashmi will be seen playing the character of Mohammad Azharuddin in his bio-pic, with 'Jannat'-filmmaker Kunal Deshmukh reportedly as the director. Azhar, one of India's most successful captains, was banned for life in 2001 which was later lifted. The 50-year-old cricketer-turned-politician, who divorced his wife Naureen to marry actress Sangeeta Bijlani, also remained in news for his personal life.
