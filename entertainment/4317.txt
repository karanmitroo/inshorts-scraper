Filmmaker Rohit Shetty, who had announced a remake of the 1989 film 'Ram Lakhan' with Karan Johar, has said the remake has been shelved because no two young actors want to work together. "They (young actors) just want to promote each other's films," added Rohit. He further said that he has no idea why they are insecure of each other.
