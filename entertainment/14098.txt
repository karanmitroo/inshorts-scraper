Actor Irrfan Khan has said that it hurts him when "a film actor or a cricketer is a youth icon" as "they are not heroes". Stating the need for redefining heroism, he added, "Heroes are people who... change people’s lives. Film stars and cricketers shouldn’t be aspirational in such a big way for the healthy growth of the society".
