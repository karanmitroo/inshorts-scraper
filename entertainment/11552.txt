Actor Abhay Deol, while questioning the ban on 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', has said that if the Indian government is banning "anything to do with Pakistan", then trade with the neighbouring country should also be banned. "When you do half a job, no one is going to take you seriously. I don't take the government seriously," added Abhay.
