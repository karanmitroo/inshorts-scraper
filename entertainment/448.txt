Kriti Sanon has said she's someone who can't understand the logic of arranged marriages. "To be married to someone, it'd mean I'm at least committing to live my whole life with that person, so I need to be madly in love with him," she added. Talking about her relationships, Kriti further said she has never cheated or been cheated on.
