The Bombay High Court has ruled in favour of Jimmy Sheirgill starrer 'Veerey Ki Wedding' over Sonam Kapoor starrer 'Veere Di Wedding'. "[The judge] didn't find any misuse or deceit... given that the story and cast were different," said director Ashu Trikha. Earlier, Anil Kapoor had moved the court to stop the makers of Jimmy's film from using the title.
