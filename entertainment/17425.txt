Actor Imran Khan, who has been married to Avantika Malik for over fours years now, has admitted that they fight a lot. "Avantika makes me angrier than any other human being," he said. "But that’s how relationships are meant to be. They’re never perfect but you still stay put if they nourish you in some way...," Imran added.
