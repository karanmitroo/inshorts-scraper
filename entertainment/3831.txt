Amitabh Bachchan was trolled for his tweet during the Mumbai rains in which he wrote, "Don't try to fight nature...don't put blame." A Twitter user, while referring to Amitabh comparing Mumbai rains to USA's Hurricane Harvey, wrote, "This is not nature...this is a man made problem." Another tweet read, "Look at state of our roads...the drainage system along roads! Pathetic."
