Actress Sonam Kapoor on Friday walked the red carpet in a Ralph & Russo saree inspired gown at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Her white gown with cutouts and embroidered train was matched with minimal make-up and center-parted hair left loose. Notably, the Sonam starrer 'Neerja' will be screened in the 'Marche du Film' event at the fest.
