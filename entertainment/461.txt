A farmer in Andhra Pradesh's Bandakindi Palle village has put up a poster of actress Sunny Leone 'to ward off evil eye' from his field. The farmer said he thought of this idea as his crops had been attracting "unnecessary attention" of villagers and passersby. "The trick has worked. Nobody is looking at my crop now," he added.
