'Nanak Shah Fakir', a film based on the life and beliefs of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, released Friday. It is a biopic made on an epic scale with its heart in its right place, says TOI. However, the length of the film (2hr 25min) is way too tiring, it added. It has been rated 3/5 (TOI, Mumbai Mirror).
