A video shows Hollywood actor Chris Pratt reacting to Bappi Lahiri's song 'Jhoom Jhoom Jhoom Baba' featured in a promotional video for the film 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2'. "Whoa...wow...I wonder if it's too late to put that music in, instead of the music we have played. Whoa, people are gonna flip out!" said Chris while watching the video.
