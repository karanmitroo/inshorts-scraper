Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma was Sunday seen cheering Indian captain Virat Kohli when he hit his half-century in the match against Sri Lanka, in Hyderabad. Kohli took off his helmet, kissed it and blew a kiss to Anushka, who gave him a standing ovation. With the half-century, he also became the quickest batsman to score 6,000 runs in ODIs.
