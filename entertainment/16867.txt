The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has cleared the release of Salman Khan’s “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” with a U/A certification and five cuts which neutralised abusive language and removed a reference to Lord Ram. The CBFC, on orders of the Home Ministry, had roped in two Muslim members in the examining committee, fearing that the film might trigger communal tensions.
