Actress Deepika Padukone cried at the 61st Filmfare Awards event while reading her father Prakash Padukone's letter after receiving the Best Actress award for 'Piku'. "The things that really matter in life are relationships, honesty, respect for parents and elders. Material success is important, but, not fundamental to happiness and peace of mind," Deepika's father had written in the letter.
