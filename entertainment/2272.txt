Aamir Khan consumed a bottle of vodka to shoot for the song 'Tere Ishq Mein Nachenge' in the 1996 film 'Raja Hindustani'. "I told my director...I don't know what it's like to be drunk...Let me actually consume alcohol, so that the physicality is taken care of," he had said in an interview. Notably, 'Raja Hindustani' completed 21 years on Wednesday.
