Filmmaker Praveen Vyas has sent a legal notice to the makers of 'Toilet- Ek Prem Katha', accusing them of copying his 2016 documentary Manini. "Since they've...refused to monetarily compensate us for the origin of idea and script, we will now be fighting this in court," said Vyas. Toilet Ek Prem Katha is a take on PM Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
