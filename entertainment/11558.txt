Director Shyam Benegal has revealed that when he came to Mumbai, his cousin and filmmaker-actor Guru Dutt advised him to start off on his own rather than work with him. "You will just be a 'gofor'. In films, a 'gofor' is a 'go for this go for that' person... (meaning) you won't do anything except run errands," Dutt had said.
