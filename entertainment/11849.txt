Actress Radhika Apte said that jokes on colour or body shaming should not be made. "Do you crack a joke on fair skin (people)? No right? So don't do it (joke on dark skin people). There has to be a limit," added Radhika. Earlier, Apte's co-star in 'Parched' Tannishtha Chatterjee was mocked for her skin tone on 'Comedy Nights Bachao'.
