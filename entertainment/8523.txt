A group of Muslim leaders in Bhopal on Saturday passed a resolution advocating the boycott of the movie 'Lipstick Under My Burkha'. The All India Muslim Tehwar Committee urged the Centre to ban the movie for hurting the community's religious feelings. "If somebody peeps into the burkha worn by our sisters and daughters, we won't remain silent," it said.
