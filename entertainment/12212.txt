Actor Amitabh Bachchan while speaking on gender equality has questioned why a man is never asked about his virginity. "[W]hen you ask a woman whether she is a virgin or not it is taken as... a wrong doing. And when you ask... a man, it adds an exclamation mark like he has done something to be proud of," added Bachchan.
