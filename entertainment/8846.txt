British luxury fashion house Burberry confused British actor and rapper Riz Ahmed for Dev Patel in one of their recent posts on Twitter. Burberry's Twitter handle shared a picture of Riz Ahmed and captioned him as Dev Patel. "Burberry can't quite process the concept of more than one brown man at the #BAFTAs," wrote a person on Twitter.
