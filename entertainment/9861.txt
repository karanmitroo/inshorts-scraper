Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that Om Puri's death is the biggest loss for the film industry. He revealed that he was going to work with Puri in the upcoming film 'Manto', where Puri was to play the role of a judge. "Despite playing all his roles in a dignified manner, he was humble and down to earth," he added.
