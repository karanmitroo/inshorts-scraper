Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan feels he doesn't deserve an award nomination for his role in 'Happy New Year'. "I haven't acted well enough. I don't think I should be nominated... there are seven others or rather seventy other people who are better than me", SRK said when asked about his name being amiss from the Filmfare Awards list.
