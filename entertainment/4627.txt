RSS-backed Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM) has come up with a rap song targeting Goa CM Manohar Parrikar for his "failed promises and political treachery". The song titled 'Mannu Aamka Tuzyawar Bharosa Nai Hai' features GSM workers questioning 'Mannu' (Manohar Parrikar) for backing casino industry. Song also entails verses like "Mannu we do not trust you...You are a destroyer of Goa."
