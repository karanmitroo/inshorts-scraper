Actress Emma Watson hid copies of books by Maya Angelou on the New York subway on Wednesday, as part of an initiative for her feminist book club 'Our Shared Self'. She tweeted, "I am going to fight even harder for all the things I believe in." She earlier hid copies of Angelou's books on the London underground.
