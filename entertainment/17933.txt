Actor Sanjay Dutt returned to Pune's Yerwada Central Prison Saturday, after the jail authorities rejected his application for extending his furlough. "Since 22 years I am abiding by the law, I have been ordered to surrender and I am going for it... ," Dutt said. The 55-year-old had sought an extension of two more weeks in his 14-day long furlough.
