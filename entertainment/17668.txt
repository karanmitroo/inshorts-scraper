Czech Film and Television Academy has admitted they failed to identify a hoaxer at the annual Czech Lion ceremony posing as actor Jim Carrey. The hoaxer, accompanied by a bodyguard and interpreter managed to fool officials into allowing him on the stage at the Cesky Lev (Czech Lion) awards in Prague, where he was showered in confetti.
