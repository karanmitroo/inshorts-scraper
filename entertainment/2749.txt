Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, while questioning why Rahul Gandhi supported the Tamil film 'Mersal' and not his film 'Indu Sarkar', said, "It's a kind of duplicity that's going on." Bhandarkar added, "When...'Indu Sarkar' was getting released, the Congress demanded ban on the film." This comes after BJP leaders said scenes from 'Mersal' criticising GST and Digital India must be removed.
