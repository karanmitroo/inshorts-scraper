Celebrity hairstylist Sapna Bhavnani has called actor Salman Khan a "monkey" and a "male chauvinist pig", while explaining why her upcoming memoir will have no mention of him. "This man really misuses people and I don't have to give him importance," she said. Notably, Bhavnani was a participant in the sixth season of the Salman Khan-hosted reality show 'Bigg Boss'.
