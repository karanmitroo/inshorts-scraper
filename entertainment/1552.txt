Actress Emilia Clarke, known for playing the character Daenerys Targaryen in the HBO series 'Game of Thrones', has said that there's a very strict social media ban on the sets of the series this year. "(It is) because people need to stop spoiling it (the show) for everyone. It's really frustrating," added Emilia.
