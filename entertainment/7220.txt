Singer Sonu Nigam on Monday took to Twitter to tweet that he is not a Muslim but still he is woken up by the Azaan in the morning. Calling the Azaan a "forced religiousness", Nigam further tweeted, "Mohammed did not have electricity when he made Islam...Why do I have to have this cacophony after Edison?"
