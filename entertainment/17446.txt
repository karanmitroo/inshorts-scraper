Actor Aditya Roy Kapur, who started his Bollywood career as a second lead, has said, "I doubt I'll play a second lead again." Before shooting to fame as the main lead with 'Aashiqui 2', Aditya had done three consecutive movies - London Dreams, Action Replayy, and Guzaarish - as a second lead. "Aashiqui 2... changed things for me," he said.
