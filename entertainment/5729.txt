Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has said that it is important to tell today's generation about Emergency, a 21-month long period from 1975 to 1977, declared by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He added that there has been a lot of political awareness due to social media. Bhandarkar's film 'Indu Sarkar', based on the Emergency, will release on July 28.
