Tiger Shroff, who will be working with Hrithik Roshan in an upcoming film, said, "I'll have to work twice as hard just to stand in the same frame as him. He's on another level altogether!" "I feel blessed to be working with my idol," Tiger added. The film will also star Vaani Kapoor, who will be paired opposite Hrithik.
