Denying reports of undergoing cosmetic surgery, Swara Bhasker said, "I did everything from working out in the gym to the Keto diet...to fat freezing...(but) have never undergone any kind of invasive treatment, nor any surgery." She said fat freezing is a non-invasive method of spot fat reduction, while adding, "If people want to have cosmetic surgery, it's their personal choice."
