The first screening of Pixar's "Inside Out" took place at Colosseum Theatre in Las Vegas (US) on Wednesday. There wasn't a dry eye in the theatre at the end of the film, writes Economic Times. The film, which will release on June-19, portrays an 11-year-old girl's mind with emotions personified in characters as she moves from Minnesota to SanFrancisco.
