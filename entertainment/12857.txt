Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has accused the Censor Board and its policiesâ€‹ of censorship "for stalling his career for seven years". He revealed that his film 'Paanch' was initially denied clearance but passed later, which left his producer bankrupt. "We were actually progressing but in the last two years we have gone back... the censorship is far worse," said Kashyap.
