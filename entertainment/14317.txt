Actor Irrfan Khan has said that Kangana Ranaut has gone "so out of reach" that he will work with her only if he wishes to be a heroine. His remarks were in response to the actress reportedly refusing to play the female lead in 'Divine Lovers' opposite Irrfan Khan. Kangana is apparently interested only in films which offer solo leads.
