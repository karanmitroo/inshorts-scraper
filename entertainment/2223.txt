The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a petition seeking to block the release of the documentary 'An Insignificant Man', which is based on CM Arvind Kejriwal. The court also remarked that filmmakers should be allowed to enjoy freedom of speech and expression. The petition was filed by Nachiketa Walhekar who had thrown ink on CM Kejriwal in 2013.
