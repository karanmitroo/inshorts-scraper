Actor Kamal Haasan has said that filmmaking has deliberately been made difficult in Tamil Nadu. He added that it is only the Tamil Nadu government that is charging an additional 30% tax over and above the GST. Haasan cited the example of states like Kerala, which is not levying more taxes in addition to GST to support its film industry.
