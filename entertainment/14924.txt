English rock band, 'The Rolling Stones', on Friday performed a free concert in Havana, Cuba, which was touted as the biggest rock concert in the country with around half a million attendees. The concert followed US President Barack Obama's first trip to Cuba by a US president in nearly 90 years. Cuba's communist government had earlier banned the rock band.
