Debutant director Akshay Akkineni's horror flick Pizza 3D, remake of a 2012 Tamil super-hit, features Akshay Oberoi, Parvathy Omanakuttan and Dipannita Sharma. It has been rated 1 (IBNLive), 2 (Financial Express, DNA, Koimoi), 2.5 (Hindustan Times) and 3.5 (NDTV). While IBNLive has criticized it, saying "This 'pizza' is stale," HT says: "It's scary but lacks the element of surprise."
