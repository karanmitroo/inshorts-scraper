Actor Jared Leto, known for portraying the character the Joker in the film Suicide Squad, has claimed that his house in Hollywood Hills, an out-of-use Air Force base, is haunted. Leto added, "God knows what they did here, but it talks. We've already had ghost sightings reported by my housekeeper. A handyman quit the project as he had an encounter."
