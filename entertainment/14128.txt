Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma's 'Veerappan', which released on Friday, "feels like a 2-hour-30-minute long, badly-rehearsed children's play", wrote India Today. "The film has pace, but the classic RGV isnâ€™t back yet," wrote Hindustan Times while the Times of India wrote, "Veerappan has the bark, but lacks bite". It has been rated 1.5/5 (India Today), 2/5 (Hindustan Times) and 3/5 (TOI).
