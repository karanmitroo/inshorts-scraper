Salman Khan's manager has denied reports that the shoot of Salman's film 'Race 3' was disrupted after armed men entered the film's sets. "This is absolutely untrue... No one has entered any set and the shoot is on as usual," said the manager. The actor had earlier received death threats from a gangster in Jodhpur.
