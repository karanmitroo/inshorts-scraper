English rock band, 'The Rolling Stones', on Tuesday announced that it will perform a free outdoor concert in Havana on March 25. Likely to be the biggest rock concert in Cuba ever, the show will be the first open-air concert in the country by a British rock band. Cuba's communist government had earlier banned the band as an "ideological deviation".
