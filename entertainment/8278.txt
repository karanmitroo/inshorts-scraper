Three women have claimed that Rishi Kapoor sent them abusive direct messages on Twitter. They received the messages after responding to Kapoor's tweet asking what he and filmmaker Karan Johar have in common. A screenshot of a message sent by Kapoor to one of the women reads, "F***ing b**ch lick, a**wipe s**ew you. Oops not with that f***ing face."
