According to reports, Priyanka Chopra will be paid around â‚¹4-5 crore for a 5-minute performance at an award show. "Since she is so much in demand, the organisers did not negotiate on the price her team quoted, despite it coming to almost a crore per minute," said a source. Priyanka's performance will reportedly be the highlight of the award show.
