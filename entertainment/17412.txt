Actress Kangana Ranaut Friday said that the Deepika Padukone-starrer 'My Choice' video on women empowerment must be appreciated for its efforts. However, Kangana feels that sexism cannot bring about empowerment. "Women empowerment does not mean you create complex among men. Then it will take 20 more years to empower men. It's all about evolving as a... human being", she said.
