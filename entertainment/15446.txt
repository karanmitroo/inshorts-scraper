Local police detained 34 Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) supporters on Friday who tried to disrupt the shooting of Shah Rukh Khan's upcoming movie 'Raees' in Mandvi, Gujarat. The protest against SRK was allegedly owing to him "indulging in making statements on issues like intolerance", as per the protesters. This was the third protest that the film's crew faced in Mandvi.
