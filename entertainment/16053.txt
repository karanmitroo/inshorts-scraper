Digital music services confirmed on Thursday that Adele's latest album '25' will not be available for streaming on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. However, Apple said that the album will be available for sale on its online store iTunes. Earlier, Taylor Swift had pulled her music from Spotify in 2014 following disputes over payment of royalties.
