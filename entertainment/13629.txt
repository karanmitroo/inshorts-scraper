Actor Hrithik Roshan has said that everyone will know the truth soon about the controversy involving him and actress Kangana Ranaut. Earlier, the two served legal notices to each other. While Hrithik in his legal notice demanded an apology from Kangana for defaming him with her "silly ex" remark, the actress accused him of intimidation in a counter legal notice.
