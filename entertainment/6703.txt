Model Chrissy Teigen dressed up as Spider-Man and kissed her husband singer John Legend while hanging upside down. "Yes, I do my own stunts," tweeted Chrissy while sharing the clip. Her act was a recreation of the scene from the 2002 film Spider-Man where Tobey Maguire who plays the superhero kisses his love interest Mary Jane, portrayed by Kirsten Dunst.
