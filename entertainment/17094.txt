Actor Ranbir Kapoor has admitted that the failure of his latest film 'Bombay Velvet' has made him insecure. "I'm feeling a sense of friction where I really don't know what's happening with my career. I know what's happening with my work but I don't know what's going to happen with my career," he said.
