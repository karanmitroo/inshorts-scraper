Actress Vidya Balan, while talking about her best memory of the festival Holi, said, "Having bhang without knowing it was bhang and then laughing all day. This was I think when I was 16." She added, "By saying bura naa maano holi hai, people have always grabbed the opportunity to drench you in colours."
