Actor Dhanush has said that the 'Hottest Vegetarian' award given by animal rights organisation PETA is an insult. "A few years ago, PETA honoured me for being a vegetarian. I now consider it a grave insult," he wrote in a post. Dhanush further said that neither he nor any of his family members were part of PETA.
