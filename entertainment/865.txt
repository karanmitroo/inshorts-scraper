After a special screening of 'Padmaavat' for Karni Sena, mediator Suresh Chavhanke has said, "Alauddin Khilji has been portrayed in the manner he should have been portrayed" and called it a victory for Rajputs. He claimed that the protests saved Rani Padmavati from suffering intimate scenes with Khilji though the film's makers repeatedly clarified that such a scene never existed.
