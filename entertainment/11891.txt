Actor Farhan Akhtar has penned an open letter to his 16-year-old daughter Shakya about rape as part of Hindustan Times's initiative called 'Let's talk about rape'. "We live in an unsafe, largely unequal world... I know your young mind grapples with how we treat our women," wrote Farhan. He added, "The right to your body is yours and yours alone."
