Planning to make a film which endorses Indian traditions and values, Central Board of Film Certification Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani has registered the film title 'Sanskari.' Nihalani said, "I chose that title because... it is important for our characters (in the film) to be sanskari." Calling 'sanskar' the need of the hour, he claimed that people "have forgotten their values."
