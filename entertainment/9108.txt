Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has questioned if the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certificate holds any validity. "Despite #JollyLLB2 getting CBFC certificate, it is being screened to Bombay High Court," tweeted Mahesh. 'Jolly LLB 2' faced a lawsuit by a lawyer who alleged the film attempted to portray the country's legal profession and the judicial system in a poor light.
