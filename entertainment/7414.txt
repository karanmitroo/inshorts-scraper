Actress Scarlett Johansson has called US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump 'cowardly' for saying that as a White House employee the biggest change she would make would be behind closed doors. "How old-fashioned, this idea that behind a great man is a great woman. What about being in front of that person or next to them?" Johansson added.
