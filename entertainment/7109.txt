Composer Bappi Lahiri said that he's the only composer who has survived so long and took Bollywood music to Hollywood. Bappi was speaking about his 1984 song 'Jhoom Jhoom Baba' featuring in a video for Hollywood film 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2'. Bappi added he's probably the first Indian composer to have five consecutive songs in five Hollywood films.
