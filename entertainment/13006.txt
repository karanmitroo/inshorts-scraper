Director Anurag Kashyap will conduct a masterclass on censorship at the upcoming Indian Film Festival of Melbourne to be held from August 11-21. "I can... talk about how censorship is so pointless in the day and age of the internet," said Anurag. Many of Anurag's films including 'Gulaal', 'Black Friday' and 'Udta Punjab' have faced censorship from the Censor Board.
