Fans have petitioned Warner Bros. to show the superhero character Wonder Woman as bisexual in the upcoming sequel to the 2017 film 'Wonder Woman'. The petitioner Gianna Collier-Pitts wrote, "(This) would make her the first openly LGBTQ superhero...from either DC or Marvel's cinematic universes." Comic book writer Greg Rucka had earlier told a fan website the superhero was "obviously" bisexual.
