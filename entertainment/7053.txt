A picture shows filmmaker David Dhawan with his son Varun Dhawan, where the latter appears as his twin characters from the upcoming film 'Judwaa 2'. Sharing the picture, Varun tweeted, "Till today I didn't know there were two of us, but now I know who did all those things people thought I did." Notably, today marks Varun's 30th birthday.
