Congress MLA Krishna Hegde launched a protest against actor Aamir Khan's controversial poster (where he is seen nude with a strategically placed boombox) by covering him up with shorts and a t-shirt. "Aamir should withdraw the poster as it offends sensibilities," said Hegde. But Aamir has refused to buy his arguments, saying it depicts the story and isn't for publicity.
