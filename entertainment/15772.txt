Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali is scheduled to perform in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, Kerala on January 15 and 17. Kerala CM Oommen Chandy is expected to attend the public reception in honour of Ali. Earlier, protests by Shiv Sena activists forced the cancellation of his performances in Mumbai and Pune.
