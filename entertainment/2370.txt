Comedian Kapil Sharma, on being asked about his marriage plans, said, "I don't think I'm ready for marriage right now." "Show kar liya, film bhi kar liya, ab shaadi karne ke liye bolenge toh zyada mushkil ho jayega," he jokingly added. Kapil further said, "I need to be more settled before getting married... Sometimes I doubt if I'm responsible enough."
