After Tamil movie director Radhakrishnan Parthiban suggested that Upma must be declared the national dish of India, a user tweeted, "Upma can be South Indian national dish but the North Indian national dish will always be Rajma". Another tweet read, "Actually Kohli wanted Rajma Chawal as the national dish but Kumble was (stuck) on Upma...rest you know."
