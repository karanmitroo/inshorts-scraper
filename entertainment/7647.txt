The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to retain the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) but will be banning the use of mobile phones for PwC accountants backstage at Oscars. A third accountant will also be stationed backstage. The steps are part of the Academy's procedure to avoid instances like the Best Picture award mix-up at Oscars 2017.
