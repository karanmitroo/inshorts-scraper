Actress Richa Chadha has said she doesn't have the 'aukat' (stature) to be anyone's godmother in Bollywood but she will do whatever she can to help newcomers. Richa added, "When I started in the industry, people had helped me; so why not extend that favour to others. I know how it feels when people call you an outsider. It's disturbing."
