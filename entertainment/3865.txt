A road in Australia named after Game of Thrones' Lannister family is being changed after residents said they did not want their street named after an incestuous couple. Lannaster Road, which was spelled differently to avoid any direct association, has been named Precinct Road after residents' objections. Notably, Cersei and Jamie Lannister are twins and lovers in the show.
