Actor Sidharth Malhotra has said that his friendship with actor Varun Dhawan has not changed. "I guess thatâ€™s an understanding we both have. Whatever our social interactions, it is very different from what happens at the box-office," said Sidharth. Notably, both the actors made their acting debut in Bollywood in the 2012 film 'Student Of The Year'.
