Naseeruddin Shah has said that the kind of films an actor does, reflect his or her political beliefs and social expression. "If I agree with the vision of the director...only then will I do the film," added Shah. He further said, "An actor's role is to follow and execute the vision of the writer and...director who has created the character."
