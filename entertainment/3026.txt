Farhan Akhtar, in a Facebook post on the ongoing Kangana-Hrithik row, wrote that as great as all of it may be for TRP, it's in terrible taste. Farhan added, "The effect her words will have on the person, his family...children (is not being considered)." He further wrote people should avoid belittling the man until the matter is concluded by authorities.
