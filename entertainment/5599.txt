Actor Boman Irani has said he agreed to do the film on Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi as many Indians don't know about him. "I think awareness is very important; we have such heroes in our country," added Boman. Satyarthi left his job as a lecturer in 1980 to start Bachpan Bachao Andolan and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.
