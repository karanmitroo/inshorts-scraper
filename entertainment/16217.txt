Salman Khan's blockbuster Bajrangi Bhaijaan will soon be available in sign language based on a request by Geeta, who suffers from a speech and hearing disability. Geeta's story of an Indian national stranded in Pakistan made headlines as her story was similar to the movie. The movie is being dubbed so that hearing impaired fans can also enjoy the film.
