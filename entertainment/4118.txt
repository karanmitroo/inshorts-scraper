Kim Kardashian has revealed that her half-sister model Kendall Jenner was "crying at home" over the criticism she received for her Pepsi advertisement. Kim added, "But in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it." Kim further said she also urged Kendall to speak out or allow the emotional scenes to feature in the family's reality show.
