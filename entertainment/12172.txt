Patidar reservation stir leader Hardik Patel has said that filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali "should give assurance of not damaging Rani Padmavatiâ€™s image" in his upcoming film 'Padmavati' or face protests against the film. "No director has the right to damage history for entertainment," said Patel. He also threatened to stop the film's release in Rajasthan.
