Kangana Ranaut, while talking about the injury she suffered while shooting for 'Manikarnika', said giving her blood to play Rani Laxmibai was worth it. "When the metal sword hit my head, I felt it. I saw blood streaming down my face," she added. Kangana further said, "You cannot be a warrior without adopting the body language and the demeanour."
