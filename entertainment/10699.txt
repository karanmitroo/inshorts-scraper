The National Anthem should be compulsorily played at all cinema halls across the nation before movie screenings, the Supreme Court ordered on Wednesday. It should be accompanied by the National flag onscreen and any abridged version of the Anthem would not be permitted. Everyone present in the halls must rise and pay respect to the National Anthem, the court added.
