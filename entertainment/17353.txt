Punjab and Chandigarh have banned the screening of the controversial film 'Nanak Shah Fakir'. The ban was ordered following the MHA advisory that the release could trigger a law and order situation in the city. Sikhs allege that the film, based on Guru Nanak's life, violates Sikh doctrine as it depicts Guru Nanak in human form.
