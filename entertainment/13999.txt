Author JK Rowling has called the people who are criticising the casting of Noma Dumezweni, a black actor, as Hermione in the play 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' a “bunch of racists”. "Noma was chosen because she was the best actress for the job... Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm," added Rowling.
