Actor Hrithik Roshan on Wednesday tweeted he was at Istanbul’s Ataturk Aiport, just hours before the suicide terror attack which reportedly killed 36 people. The 42-year-old actor had missed his connecting flight at Istanbul but managed to fly out on an economy flight instead​ of waiting for the next day. He further tweeted, "V (we) must stand united against terrorism."
