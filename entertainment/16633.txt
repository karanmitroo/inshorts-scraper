American television star Kim Kardashian on Tuesday posted a naked picture of herself in order to 'prove' to the world that she was really pregnant. There has been a buzz for some time that Kardashian was faking her pregnancy and had opted for surrogacy instead. However, she clarified, "I would document the process if I got a surrogate."
