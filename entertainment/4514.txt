The release of the Shraddha Kapoor starrer 'Haseena Parkar', which was scheduled for August 18, has been postponed. Director Apoorva Lakhia said, "We collectively decided to postpone the film so that it can get enough screens and a worthy run at the box-office." Earlier, the film's release was shifted to August 18 to reportedly avoid a clash with 'Jagga Jasoos'.
