'Peepli Live' co-director Mahmood Farooqui was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for rape by a special fast-track court on Thursday. He was held guilty of raping a research scholar from the United States in Delhi last year. The 30-year old research scholar had accused him of raping her when she visited his home over an invitation for dinner.
