Filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia has said he has no complaints with the guidelines of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) but has an issue with their favouritism. Dhulia added, "They...give preference to big producers, big names of the business, which is wrong." He also said that as a filmmaker he would never ask for U/A certificate for an adult film.
