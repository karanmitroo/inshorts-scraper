Actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has confirmed that he will star in 'The Janson Directive', an onscreen adaptation of Robert Ludlum's novel by the same name. "The Janson Directive is classic Robert Ludlum. Sharp, edgy and layered storyline. The character is complex, conflicted... and lethal," said Dwayne. Notably, Universal Pictures is planning a series of movies based on Ludlum's works.
