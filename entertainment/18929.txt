Breaching the buildingâ€™s security, a young woman landed at Emraan Hashmi's Bandra apartment at 3 am on Sunday morning and started banging the door much to the shock of the other residents. She was screaming at the top of her voice that she wanted to have a chat. Unfortunately for the fan, the actor was away in Cape Town.
