Refuting rumours of a fight with Anushka Sharma, fashion designer Manish Malhotra said, "She is a friend...will always be a friend." He added, "Was around for her first film...(also) just did Ae Dil Hai Mushkil." This comes after Anushka chose to wear outfits designed by Sabyasachi Mukherjee instead of Manish Malhotra for her wedding functions.
