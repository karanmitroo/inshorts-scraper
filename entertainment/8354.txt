Colombian singers Shakira and Carlos Vives have been accused in a Spanish court for copying the song 'La Bicicleta' from a Cuban singer. The singer has alleged that the duo have copied parts from his 1997 song 'Yo te quiero tanto' (I love you so much). Notably, 'La Bicicleta' has won two Latin Grammys for Best Song and Best Record.
