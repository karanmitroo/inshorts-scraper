Jon Stewart, anchor of Comedy Central’s satirical news show “The Daily Show,” is leaving the program after a 17 year old run. Comedy Central had recently lost another host Stephen Colbert and potential Stewart-replacement Jon Oliver to HBO. Stewart, two times host of the Grammys and Oscar, had previously taken a leave to write and direct a film “Rosewater.”
