The Supreme Court upheld Delhi High Court's verdict to acquit Peepli [Live] co-director Mahmood Farooqui in the 2015 alleged rape case. While rejecting a plea filed against Farooqui, SC called the HC's decision an "extremely well-decided case". The plea was by an American woman who claimed Farooqui had oral sex with her without her consent and had been mistakenly acquitted.
