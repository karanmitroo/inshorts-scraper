The Bombay High Court today said it hasn't found any violation by the state in allowing the early release of Sanjay Dutt from jail in the 1993 bomb blasts case. The court also rejected a PIL challenging the remission of Dutt's sentence. The judges observed the state government had succeeded in backing its claims of impartiality in the case.
