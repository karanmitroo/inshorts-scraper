A legal notice was served to actor Hrithik Roshan for allegedly hurting religious sentiments over a tweet where the actor has been accused of making “unwarranted” comments against the Pope. The notice was filed by Abraham Mathai, the State Minorities Commission's former vice chairman via advocate Rizwan Siddique. Notably, Siddique is also Kangana Ranaut's advocate in her case against Hrithik.
