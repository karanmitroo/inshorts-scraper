During a meeting with Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, actor Aamir Khan has announced that his NGO, the Paani Foundation, would hold 'Satyamev Jayate Water Cup' activities in 75 state tehsils. This comes after the state government was criticised for claiming that a village became drought-free because of its scheme. The opposition and villagers credited the NGO for the village's self-sufficiency.
