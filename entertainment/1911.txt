Actor Salman Khan has jokingly said that director Sanjay Leela Bhansali offended him while adding, "I gave him two hit films, and then he took Shah Rukh Khan in the next one." While Salman had starred in Bhansali's films 'Khamoshi: The Musical' and 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam', Shah Rukh was cast in Bhansali's next film 'Devdas'.
