India's first full-length feature film 'Raja Harishchandra' was released 104 years ago on May 3, 1913. It was produced and directed by Dadasaheb Phalke. Interestingly, a male actor played the female lead in the movie, as acting was not considered a profession for women. Actor Anna Salunke thus played the role of Harishchandra's wife, Queen Taramati.
