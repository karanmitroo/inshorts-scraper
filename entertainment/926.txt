Members of Rajput group Karni Sena have distributed a memorandum in all theatres of Gurugram asking them not to screen 'Padmaavat'. When asked what they would do if 'Padmaavat' is screened, they replied, "Wait and watch." Earlier, the Supreme Court had stayed a ban on the film in four states and cleared it for an all India release.
