After author Shobhaa De tweeted an image of an overweight man in uniform and took a jibe at Mumbai Police on Tuesday, the city police corrected her. "Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today!" Shobhaa tweeted. "We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally misplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you," police tweeted.
