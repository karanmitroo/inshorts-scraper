Singer Adele dedicated her Grammy win for the 'Album Of The Year' to Beyoncé and when she accidentally broke the award statuette into two, she offered the other half to Beyoncé. "I can't possibly accept this award," said Adele while praising Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' album. Adele added, "What the f**k does she have to do to win Album of the Year?"
