The trailer of upcoming film 'Raag Desh' will be launched in the Parliament. "It's the first time Parliament has allowed a trailer launch and that's a big honour," said film's director Tigmanshu Dhulia. The film is based on 1945-1946 Red Fort trials, wherein Indian National Army officers were charged by the British government for their involvement in World War II.
