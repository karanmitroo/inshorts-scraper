Actress Swara Bhasker has written an open letter to Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, saying that she felt "reduced to a vagina" after watching his film 'Padmaavat'. She wrote, "Women have the right to live, despite being raped...despite the death of their husbands, male 'protectors', 'owners', 'controllers of their sexuality'...Women have the right to live. Period."
