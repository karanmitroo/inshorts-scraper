The Censor Board has reportedly removed a love-making sequence between two male characters in the Hollywood film 'Moonlight'. The Barry Jenkins-directorial film is about a black gay boy discovering his sexuality. "This is doing disservice to the film. [It] gets an 'A' certificate. And still the adult content is removed," a source close to the film was quoted as saying.
