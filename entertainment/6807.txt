Rock band Eagles has filed a lawsuit accusing the owners of a Mexico hotel for using the name 'Hotel California', the band's Grammy award-winning song, without permission. The complaint stated that the owners "actively encourage" guests to believe the hotel is associated with the band. It added that people believe the hotel served as inspiration for song, which is false.
