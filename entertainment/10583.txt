American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel will host the 89th Oscar Awards ceremony in February 2017. "Yes, I'm hosting the Oscars. This is not a prank. And if it is, my revenge on @TheAcademy will be terrible & sweet," Kimmel tweeted. Kimmel, who previously hosted 2016 Emmy Awards, will be hosting the Academy Awards for the first time.
