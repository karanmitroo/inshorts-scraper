Shah Rukh Khan's wife Gauri Khan said, "I've always had my identity, even if you [media] didn't see it." She said this after the inauguration of Arth, her first design project for a restaurant. "Earlier, the kids needed more attention...now, with them having grown up, there's more time, so I'm enjoying the more structured focus on work," added Gauri.
