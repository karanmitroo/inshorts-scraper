Actress Sunny Leone, known for her porn films in the US, recently refused to go topless for a scene in her upcoming horror flick. "Though she was allowed to shoot wearing a top, it was later removed using computer graphics. Her breasts were then digitally superimposed from one of her earlier films," a source said.
