Producer of 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' Kiran Shroff, while talking about sexist comments she faced, has said that a Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) member asked her how she could make a film like this being a woman. A male member added, "But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing." Kiran said that such thoughts were regressive.
