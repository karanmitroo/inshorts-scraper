Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan has said that if Pakistan has opened its arms to his film 'Kaabil', India should also move forward. The Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam starrer film was released in parts of Pakistan on Thursday, after the ban on screening Bollywood films was lifted. 'Kaabil' is reportedly the first film to release in Pakistan after the ban ended.
