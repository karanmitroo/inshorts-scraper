Actor Andrew Garfield has said his comment about being a gay man without the physical act was taken out of context. He had made the remark while talking about his gay role in the play 'Angels in America'. Andrew explained his statement meant that he was fully prepared and committed to the role by immersing himself in modern LGBTQ culture.
