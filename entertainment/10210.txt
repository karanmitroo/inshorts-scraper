Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that though the Oscar Awards are inspirational, they should not be taken as a benchmark for Bollywood. "It's ok to take a cue from there, (and) create a benchmark for ourselves," the 51-year-old actor added. Shah Rukh said this at the launch of 'Indian Academy Awards' in Mumbai recently.
