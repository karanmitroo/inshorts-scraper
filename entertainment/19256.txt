Britain's Channel 4 has said it will air the first-ever live television show from space, tracking the International Space Station though a complete orbit around the Earth. The show, which will be broadcast on National Geographic Channel in 170 other countries, is to be hosted by Dermot O'Leary, the long-time face of British TV show "The X Factor".
