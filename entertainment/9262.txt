Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that he will keep playing a 25-year-old in films shamelessly. He added, "Growing a beard does not make me older. It makes me sexier." He further said that the looks he sports is only for the roles he plays in films. Mahira Khan, the female lead in 'Raees', is 19 years younger than SRK.
