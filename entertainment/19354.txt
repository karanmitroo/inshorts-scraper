Bombay High Court has issued notices to Shahrukh Khan and his wife Gauri in sex determination case, based on a petition filed by a social activist Varsha Deshpande. Varsha's petition challenged the magistrate's decision that rejected her application seeking verification of documents related to surrogacy process of the couple's third child. She has alleged Khans of conducting sex determination test.
