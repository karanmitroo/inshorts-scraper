Actress Manisha Koirala is set to make a comeback with Promita Sengupta's directorial debut 'Maulali'. "[T]hough it's her first film, I'm confident she'll deliver. At this age I don't want to take chances with a wrong film," said Manisha. She also added that she wants to adopt a child as she feels "lonely" here since her family lives in Nepal.
