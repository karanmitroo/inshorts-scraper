Actress Kalki Koechlin has said that it's better to be her ex-husband Anurag Kashyap's neighbour than to be his wife. He revealed that Kalki said this when they were partying. Speaking on the show #NoFilterNeha, Anurag added, "May be I am that absent person in a relationship which I have realised after a lot of failed attempts to find stability."
