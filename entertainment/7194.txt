Singer Sonu Nigam tweeted that he stands by his statement that loudspeakers shouldn't be allowed in mosques and temples. On Monday, Sonu had tweeted about "forced religiousness" in India after being woken up by 'azaan' from a mosque. "Mohammed didn't have electricity when he made Islam...Why do I have to have this cacophony after Edison?" read one of Sonu's tweets.
