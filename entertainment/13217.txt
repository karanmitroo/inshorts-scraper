British Actor Maurice Micklewhite has adopted his showbiz name Michael Caine as his legal name, following the rise in airport security checks. “An airport security guard would say, ‘Hi, Michael Caine,’ and suddenly I’d give him a passport with a different name on it,” Caine said. “I could stand there for an hour. So I changed my name,” he added.
