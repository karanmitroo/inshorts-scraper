Rajkummar Rao starrer 'Newton', India's official entry to Oscars 2018, has failed to make it to the Best Foreign Language Film category's new shortlist for the 90th Academy Awards. While 92 films had originally been considered, the list has now been reduced to only nine films. 'Newton' revolves around a government clerk on election duty in a Naxal-controlled town.
