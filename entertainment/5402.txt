Filmmaker Onir has revealed that many A-list actors refused to play a gay character  in his 2005 film 'My Brother... Nikhil'. The film was based on the life of Dominic D'Souza, who was kept isolated for 64 days after contracting HIV. Onir added, "Bollywood still portrays the LGBT community in the same stereotypical way, and that's disgusting. It's so regressive."
