A Fender Stratocaster guitar signed by 19 famous rockstars is the world's most expensive guitar. Auctioned for $2.7 million in 2005 to raise funds for charity, the instrument was signed by the likes of Eric Clapton, Sting and Bryan Adams. Born 107 years ago on August 10, 1909, the company's founder Leo Fender introduced the Stratocaster in 1954.
