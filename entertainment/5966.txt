Actor Salman Khan has said that racing tracks should be used to race as racing on main roads puts the life of others in danger. "I think cycles are okay but motorcycles are really dangerous for them (youth) and for other people around," added Salman. He further revealed that one of his friends passed away in a racing accident.
