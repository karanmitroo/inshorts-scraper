Actor Priyanka Chopra has said that films with female protagonists should not be typecast as “women-centric”. When asked about "women-centric" films doing well at the box office, Chopra pointed out that the expression stereotyped female actors in their roles, since films with male leads were not termed as “male-oriented”. She will star as a cop in Prakash Jha’s “Gangaajal 2”.
