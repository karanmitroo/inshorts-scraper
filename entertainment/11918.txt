Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that she cannot understand why actor Hrithik Roshan's father Rakesh Roshan is coming to his rescue in the controversy, which surrounds him and the actress. "Why can't men stand up for themselves. He (Hrithik) is a 43-year-old man," added Kangana. Earlier, Rakesh had commented that Hrithik's "truth" on the issue would "shock" everyone.
