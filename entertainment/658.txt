Actress Sushmita Sen turned showstopper for the label 'Kotwara' at the ongoing Lakm√© Fashion Week in Mumbai. She was seen in an embellished lehenga, which was part of the fashion label's spring summer collection 'Samanzar'. The actress walked the ramp as the song 'In Aankhon Ki Masti' from the 1981 film 'Umrao Jaan' played in the background.
