Actor Amitabh Bachchan, while questioning the use of the word 'Mardaani', said that there is a need to have a new word to depict female valour. "Even the word 'Mardaani' is derived from the word 'mard' (men). The word which is a description of male valour and strength. Why can't we have an independent word for female valour?" added Bachchan.
