Film Roman, that used to animate 'The Simpsons', and AdMagic, the board game firm behind 'Cards Against Humanity' are among the three companies who have applied to trademark 'Fake News'. All three trademark applications were filed after US President Trump accused CNN of being "fake news". Film Roman is reportedly planning an 'adult comedy' show with the same name.
