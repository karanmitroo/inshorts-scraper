Television show host-philanthropist Oprah Winfrey has called out sexual predators while saying, "Women have not been heard if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up." In her speech at Golden Globe Awards, Oprah further said that she looks forward to a day when nobody has to say "me too" ever again.
