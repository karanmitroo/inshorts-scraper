Actor Adil Hussain, who got a special mention at the 64th National Awards for his films 'Mukti Bhawan' and 'Maj Rati Keteki', joked that it's dangerous getting an award like this. He added, "(This is) because it pushes me to feel ki abhi aur bhi achcha karna padega!" Adil is known for films like 'English Vinglish' and 'Lootera', among others.
