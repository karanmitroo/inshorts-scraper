Rapper Badshah, in order to clarify a recent media report which misquoted him by writing that he does not find Eminem's music special, tweeted he never said Eminem is not the greatest. "[W]hat i meant to say was that I don't relate to Eminem," tweeted Badshah while sharing his tweet from 2013 which said, "Eminem is the god of rap."
