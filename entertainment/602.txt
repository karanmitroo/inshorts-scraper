The Sidharth Malhotra and Manoj Bajpayee starrer 'Aiyaary' has been postponed to February 16. "The overseas delivery of the film looks difficult, considering we won't have the censor certificate in time. That will, in turn, affect the India release," said Aiyaary's co-producer Jayantilal Gada. It was earlier scheduled to release on February 9, the same release date as 'Pad Man'.
