Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow has claimed that rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein lied about having sex with her in order to lure other women. "He's not the first person to lie about sleeping with someone, but he used the lie as an assault weapon," she said. Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment by over 40 women.
