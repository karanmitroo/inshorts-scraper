Actress Anjali Anand, who currently weighs 108 kg, has refused to put on more weight for her role of a plus size girl in the upcoming TV show 'Dhhai Kilo Prem'. Anjali, who will be making her acting debut with the show, was asked by makers to gain more weight. "[A]ny more change might get difficult to reverse," said Anjali.
