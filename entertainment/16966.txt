Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has found herself in legal trouble for playing the role of Sarabjit Singh's sister, Dalbir Kaur, in a biopic. While filmmaker Omung Kumar had taken the permission of Dalbir for making the film, Sarabjit's another sister Baljinder has sent them a legal notice. Reportedly, Baljinder feels the biopic might not show her brother in a good light.
