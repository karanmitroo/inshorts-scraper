Actor Shah Rukh Khan on Friday tweeted that his upcoming film 'Fan' makes him "arrogant". “Whatever anyone might say... The honest truth is that whenever I see FAN the film, I become arrogant. Thanks Maneesh and team for finding me again,” he wrote. The film, also featuring Illeana D'Cruz and Ali Fazal, is scheduled to release on April 15, 2016.
