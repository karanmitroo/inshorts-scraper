Hollywood singer Britney Spears Friday shared on Twitter a picture of her injured leg, encased in a brace. "This boot was made for walkin," she posted along with the picture. Spears had Wednesday tumbled on the stage while performing in Las Vegas, injuring her ankle. Following the injury, her doctor advised her not to perform on Friday and Saturday.
