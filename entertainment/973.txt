Lokendra Singh Kalvi, the convenor of Rajput organisation Karni Sena, has said that the public should impose curfew in cinema halls that screen 'Padmaavat'. Kalvi also appealed to social outfits across India to not let the film be screened in any theatre. The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a stay order on ban imposed on 'Padmaavat' by four states.
