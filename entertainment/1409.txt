Fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee has apologised for wrongly taking credit for styling Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli at his wedding reception in Mumbai. "We had made a very similar piece and in the confusion of the great Indian wedding, the credits got swapped," read Sabyasachi's post. Virat's outfit was designed by Raghavendra Rathore.
