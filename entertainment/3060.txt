Wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne Johnson has revealed that his character Maui from the animated Disney film 'Moana' was partly inspired by his late grandfather Fanene Leifi Pita Maivia, known as the wrestler Peter Maivia. Dwayne revealed this when a Twitter user pointed out similarities between the two. Maivia had many tribal tattoos on his body, indicative of his Samoan High Chief status.
