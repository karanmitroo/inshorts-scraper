The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has said that it will continue to oppose Indian films featuring Pakistani actors. Ameya Khopkar, who heads MNS' cinema wing, said that even though Pakistan has resumed screening Indian films, the party's stand will remain unchanged, until Pakistan stops attacks on Indian lands. Notably, Pakistani actress Mahira Khan stars in Shah Rukh Khan's film 'Raees'.
