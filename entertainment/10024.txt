DJ Joel Thomas Zimmerman, called deadmau5 professionally, has filed a petition to protect his cat Meowingtons' brand. He is petitioning the US Patent And Trademark Office after discovering that Meowingtons is already the trademark of a store owner selling cat-themed merchandise. Zimmerman's cat has verified Twitter and Instagram accounts and has featured on deadmau5 album art and merchandise.
