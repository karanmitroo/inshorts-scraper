Claiming that Pakistan doesn't value its artistes, singer Adnan Sami has said that, "I'll get trolled for what I've said, but, that is the reality. It is unfortunate." "Pakistan never valued Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan saab until English songwriter Peter Gabriel started collaborating with him," he added. He pointed out that this happens with a lot of artistes there.
