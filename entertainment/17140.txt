Priyanka Chaddha, an event management firm owner, attempted suicide Sunday in Ahmedabad ahead of Mika Singh's concert, alleging that the singer had cheated her of Rs 27 lakh. In her complaint, filed after she gained consciousness from an overdose of sleeping pills, Chaddha claimed that although Mika had taken the money from her, he did the show with another firm.
