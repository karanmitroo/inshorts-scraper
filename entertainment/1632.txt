Hollywood actor George Clooney's friend Rande Gerber has revealed that in 2013 Clooney gifted 14 of his friends $1 million each to thank them for helping him when he moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. Gerber added that Clooney had also paid the taxes on the gift so that his friends could keep the entire amount.
