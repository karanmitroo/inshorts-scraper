Recent media reports have claimed that there are differences between Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone and her contemporary Sonam Kapoor. However, Sonam Kapoor denied such reports. Talking about Deepika, Sonam said, "I respect her, she’s always gracious”. “Seriously, there’s nothing wrong between us, it’s the media which lacks news. Any kind of negativity makes for good copy,” she added.
