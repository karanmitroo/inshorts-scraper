Amitabh Bachchan has said one must give attention, value and respect to documenting the history of Indian cinema. "How wonderful it will be if I could have known...what K Asif was thinking when he was making 'Mughal-E-Azam' or how did Dilip Kumar approach his role in 'Devdas'," added Amitabh. He further said that these moments are lost and forgotten now.
