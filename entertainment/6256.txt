Censor Board has asked makers of 'An Insignificant Man', a documentary on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, to get no-objection certificates from PM Narendra Modi, Kejriwal and Sheila Dixit for the film's release. The NOC is required as footage of the leaders can't be featured in the film without consent. The Board also wants references to BJP and Congress muted.
