The Film & Television Producers Guild of India Ltd has condemned the attack on filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali and urged the Indian government and the state government of Rajasthan to take action against the "miscreants". "The film industry has become the softest target for any fringe group looking for media attention," said President Siddharth Roy Kapur.
