Rishi Kapoor has said that filmmakers Anurag Basu and Anurag Kashyap are good to work on a certain budget but when given huge budget films they go "berserk" like "bandar ke haath mein khilona". Rishi added, "I couldn't understand head or tail of (Kashyap's) Bombay Velvet...(Basu) made this Gajja Jasoos...Jagga Jasoos whatever...which he made a total mess of."
