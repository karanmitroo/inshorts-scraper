Actress Sangeeta Bijlani has backed out of ‘Shab’, touted as her Bollywood comeback after a hiatus of two decades. Apparently, she was uncomfortable with the kissing, love-making and other intimate scenes. “As a filmmaker, I didn't want to compromise with the story and I was okay with letting her go,” said director Onir.
