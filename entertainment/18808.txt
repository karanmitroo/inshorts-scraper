Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday inaugurated a road in Mumbai, named after the father of actor Priyanka Chopra. The Lt Col Ashok Chopra Marg in Andheri leads to the apartment building in which the Bollywood star lives. Her father, who was a doctor with the army, died of cancer exactly a year ago, at the age of 64.
