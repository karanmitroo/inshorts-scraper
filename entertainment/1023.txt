Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey has been accused of racism as a security company's head recalled how during a shoot for 'House of Cards' in 2012, the actor allegedly said, "I don't want n***ers watching my trailer." Spacey's comment was directed at a group of African-American guards. A former security supervisor claimed Spacey refused to shake his hand or acknowledge him.
