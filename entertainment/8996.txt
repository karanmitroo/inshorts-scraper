Shahid Kapoor has said that he is gaining muscle, but not fat, for his role as Raja Ratan Singh in the upcoming film 'Padmavati', directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. "Since I am playing a Rajput warrior in the film, keeping the time period and look in mind, Sanjay sir suggested to gain muscle to portray such (a) personality," said Shahid.
