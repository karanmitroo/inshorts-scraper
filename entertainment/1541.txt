Rani Mukerji has said that guests did not click pictures of her daughter Adira at her birthday party as they feared Aditya Chopra, who is known for refusing to take pictures with people. "It is single handedly my husband's decision. In this, he has no interest in taking my advice...he's like NO, I don't want her pictures," added Rani.
