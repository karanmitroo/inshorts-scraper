Katrina Kaif, who is dating Ranbir Kapoor, recently said that she finds it difficult to work with the latter. "[I]t is easier to act in front of strangers. When someone knows you really well and you are acting in front of them, you feel a bit forced", Katrina, who will soon be seen opposite Ranbir in 'Jagga Jasoos', said.
