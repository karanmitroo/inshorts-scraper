Late singer Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson has said that she is certain that her father was murdered. Paris said, "He would drop hints about people being out to get him... And at some point he was like, 'They're gonna kill me one day.'" Michael died of propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his Los Angeles residence on June 25, 2009.
