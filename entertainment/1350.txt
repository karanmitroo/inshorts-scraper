Rajinikanth has confirmed the new release date of his upcoming film '2.0' as April 14, 2018. "You won't find another movie like 2.0. There'll be even more expensive films but content-wise 2.0 is very fresh and unique," he added. Rajinikanth further said the film's release got postponed due to work on the graphics and AR Rahman re-recording the film's songs.
