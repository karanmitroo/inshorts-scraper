Amid protests by Hindu outfits to ban Aamir Khan's 'PK', the Censor Board has refused to remove alleged objectionable scenes from the film. “We have already given certificate to PK and we can’t remove anything now because it’s already out for public viewing," said Leela Samson, chairperson of Censor Board of Film Certification.
