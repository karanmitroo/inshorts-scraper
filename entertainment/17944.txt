Aamir Khan has sent a legal notice to some Pakistan websites for carrying his 'fake' interview on religion with reference to his film 'PK'. According to Anand Desai, managing partner of DSK Legal, Aamir was wrongly attributed for the interview. "He has never given such an interview... The impersonation is a very serious infringement of our client's rights," said Desai.
