Akshay Kumar shared a video where his sister Alka Bhatia has said the biggest gift she received from him was the lesson 'apna dhyan khudh rakh' (take care of your own safety). She added she realised the lesson's importance when her daughter went abroad for higher studies. The video ends with the message, 'Do not protect your sister, empower her.'
