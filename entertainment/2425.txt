Anushka Sharma has said after she comes back from a party, she feels intellectually and emotionally drained. "At parties, the music is so loud. You can't...have conversations with people. And I don't like small talk because...it has no value," added Anushka. She further said that she doesn't have too many friends in the industry as she's an emotionally independent person.
