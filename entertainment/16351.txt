Actress Priyanka Chopra, who will be seen in the American TV series 'Quantico', in a recent interview said she was sceptical about signing the show as "it’s a long commitment". "I had to balance television and Hindi films. The script was incredible and I just couldn’t say no", Priyanka said. The show will premiere in India on October 3.
