Hollywood actor Mark Rylance has revealed that filmmaker Christopher Nolan doesn't like to have water bottles or chairs on a film's set. He added, "They're distractions - the noise of [the bottles], they're like toys almost, playing around with toys. [The lack of chairs, meanwhile] keeps you on your toes." Mark worked with Nolan in the recently released film 'Dunkirk'.
