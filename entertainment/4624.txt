Actress Shilpa Shetty turned showstopper for designer Monisha Jaising at the India Couture Week. She wore a red brocade outfit featuring golden zari work from Monisha's 'Opera' collection. "[T]he inspiration for my collection was triggered by the...memory of the Opera house flowing with people in their finery... [Shilpa's] dress has a very Indian look with an international feel," said Monisha.
