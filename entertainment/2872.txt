Ajay Devgn has said he doesn't believe in films that have vulgar or double meaning jokes and use actresses only as props while men do the comedy. Ajay added, "Comedy isn't male dominated space...In our film (Golmaal Again), there are four-five male heroes but...actresses also have equally good roles." He said there are very few family entertainers being made today.
