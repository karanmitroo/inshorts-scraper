Television actress Jennifer Winget said that if Bollywood actors romance actresses half their age, why can't actresses romance actors younger to them. Citing Hollywood  actress Meryl Streep's example, she said, "I don't see her dealing with age as a barrier." Jennifer further said that the industry has come a long way as actresses are no longer known primarily for looks.
