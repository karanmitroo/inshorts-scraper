Censor board’s Revising Committee has passed Anurag Kashyap’s upcoming film ‘Bombay Velvet’ with a U/A certificate, with three cuts. Reportedly, Kashyap has been asked to “snip out two cuss words and a  kissing scene between Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor. Earlier, the censor board had refused a U/A certificate to the film due to abusive language and excessive violence.
