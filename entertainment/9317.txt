Actress Huma Qureshi has said that fashion designers these days make clothes for young boys, not women. The actress added, "They are so petite, who wears these clothes?... It is a very wrong idea of what you are saying is beautiful. Whose standard of beauty are we actually following?" She said that a person's uniqueness and individuality should be celebrated.
