Akshay Kumar has said that if people can give donations in temples, gurudwaras, churches and mosques for blessings, people must also give 10% of that donation to build toilets for the poor. Addressing the issue of open defecation in India, Akshay added, "It's shocking that 54% people in our country do not have toilets in their homes."
