A group of people in Pakistan's Peshawar held a candlelight vigil to honour veteran actor Shashi Kapoor who passed away on Monday. The meet was held outside Shashi's ancestral home which was built by his late grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Kapoor. Notably, Shashi had been honoured with Padma Bhushan in 2011 and the 2014 Dadasaheb Phalke Award.
