Actor Salman Khan, who is accused of using an unlicensed weapon to poach two blackbucks in 1998, Wednesday appeared before the Jodhpur court to record his statement. Pleading innocent, Salman said he is being framed in the case. Salman is required to present his defence on May 4, for which he will not have to be present before the court.
