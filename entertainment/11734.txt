Actor Ranveer Singh has revealed that he will be seen butt-naked in his upcoming film 'Befikre' on the condition that the Censor Board passes it. "I am actually naked in the film!... Hopefully, if it gets passed, you will see me butt-naked in 'Befikre'. And I'm... really looking forward to it, to watching that with the live audience," added Ranveer.
