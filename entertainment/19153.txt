Model Meghna Patel, last seen in 'Kahaani Chandrakanta Ki', has made headlines by posing nude with just a poster that reads 'Vote for Modi'. Reportedly, the BJP members have dismissed the photoshoot as a publicity stunt by the starlet. Earlier, Mallika Sherawat had come in the limelight for crooning 'happy birthday' to Modi.
