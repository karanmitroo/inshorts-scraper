Ryan Gosling has said he was giggling after La La Land's wrong announcement at Oscars 2017 out of relief, and he had earlier thought that it was a medical situation. "I was watching people...have this panicked reaction in the crowd...guys were coming on with headsets. Then I heard, 'Oh Moonlight won', I was so relieved I started laughing," said Gosling.
