Rajput group Karni Sena activists in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow on Thursday presented roses to people and requested them to not watch the movie 'Padmaavat'. Outside a cinema hall, the activists also offered to reimburse the amount spent on tickets to people who have already purchased them. This comes amid violent protests across the country over the film's release.
