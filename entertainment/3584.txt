Aditya Pancholi's wife Zarina Wahab, while referring to Kangana Ranaut's recent statement that Zarina did not help her when she was in a physically abusive relationship with Pancholi, questioned what nonsense she is talking about. Zarina added, "If she's dating my husband how can she come to me?" "People who talk like this should have some brains," she further said.
