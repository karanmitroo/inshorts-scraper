Filmmaker Sudhir Mishra is planning to make a sequel of his directorial 'Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi', which released in 2005. The original film starred Kay Kay Menon, Chitrangda Singh and Shiney Ahuja in lead roles. "I'd like to make the film with the same actors, but we will take a call on that later," said Sudhir.
