Rajkummar Rao today took to Twitter to share his look in his upcoming film 'Newton'. Directed by Amit Masurkar, the film is a black comedy. "[I]t’s the journey of a common man who aspires to be someone in life and heads to a jungle infested with Naxals. It’s a really funny story", Rajkummar said earlier while talking about the film.
