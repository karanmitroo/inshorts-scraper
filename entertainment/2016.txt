Actress Ishita Dutta has said she hasn't faced casting couch as she didn't appear desperate. "It is unfortunate that in every industry, there are people who take advantage of needy people," she added. Ishita further said, "I'd like to tell all the budding actors not to be vulnerable... Self-respect and dignity are more important for a woman than success."
