Actress Sunny Leone, who celebrated her 36th birthday on Saturday, has said, "Daniel makes me feel special every day. I don't need a birthday for that." She added, "He's always thinking of me and getting me special gifts, small or big." She further said that she likes quiet dinners and seeing family, and is not the 'birthday celebrating type'.
