In a recent blog post, actor Amitabh Bachchan described his experience of shooting with Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio for the 2013 film 'The Great Gatsby'. DiCaprio was caring and considerate throughout the making of the film and a most humble and down to earth co-star, wrote Bachchan. He shared a picture with DiCaprio from the film's Cannes premiere.
