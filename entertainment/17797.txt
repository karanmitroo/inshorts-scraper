After Uttar Pradesh, the Madhya Pradesh government has also decided to give tax-free status to Ayushmann Khurrana’s ‘Hawaizaada‘. Directed by Vibhu Puri, the film also features Pallavi Sharda and Mithun Chakraborty. The film has been inspired by the life of Shivkar Talpade, an Indian scholar who is supposed to have constructed and flown an unmanned airplane in 1895.
