Singer Daler Mehndi has said that music is losing its purity as "musicians add a portion of rap, some cuss words, weird lyrics and a western touch saying this is what sells." Daler said, "We need to keep a check on our lyrics and... not put unnecessary... beats." He added that Youtube likes do not make someone "a good singer".
