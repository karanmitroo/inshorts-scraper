The Bombay High Court has upheld the order of a magistrate's court rejecting the plea seeking documents regarding the sex determination test allegedly undergone by actor Shahrukh Khan's wife Gauri prior to the birth of the couple's third child. It was alleged that Gauri underwent sex determination test before the birth of their son AbRam through a surrogate mother.
