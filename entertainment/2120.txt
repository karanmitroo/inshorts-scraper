The release date of 'Fukrey Returns' has been changed to December 8 after the release date of 'Padmavati' was postponed by its producers. "It was always meant to be December 8. Even our teaser said 8th. But we moved up as Padmavati was shifted to December 1," said Ritesh Sidhwani, producer of 'Fukrey Returns'.
