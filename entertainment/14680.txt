Shah Rukh Khan has said that there will be no sequel to his latest film 'Fan'. The 50-year-old actor added that he will be collaborating with the film's director Maneesh Sharma for another film "which is not similar to ‘Fan’ at all". "It’s a very different story and we will start working on it by next year," said Khan.
