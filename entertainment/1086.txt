Talking about Johnny Depp being cast in 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald', actor Daniel Radcliffe said, "It's a very hard thing for me." He added, "A guy...was reprimanded for weed on the (original Harry Potter) film...so what Johnny has been accused of is obviously much greater than that." Depp was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife Amber Heard.
