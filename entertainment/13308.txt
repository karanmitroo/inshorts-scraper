Disneyland, the only theme park designed and built under Walt Disney's supervision, was built in just one year. However, the $17 million park in California, built on a 160-acre land, took two decades of planning and was opened for the public on July 17, 1955. It was described as “the stuff children’s dreams are made on”, by the LIFE magazine.
