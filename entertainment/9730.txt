Actor Shah Rukh Khan has confessed that his films cannot make as much money as a Salman Khan-film. "I can't compete with Salman Khan at the box-office. None of us can. That is the reality," he added. Shah Rukh had earlier shifted the release of 'Raees', which was scheduled to release on the same date as Salman's 'Sultan'.
