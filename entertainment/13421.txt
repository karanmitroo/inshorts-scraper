Actor Salman Khan's father Salim Khan has criticised a television debate for referring to Salman as someone "old enough to be a grandfather". "I request them to watch #Sultan in a theatre," tweeted Salim. He further expressed his surprise at how a man, who himself was old enough to be a grandfather, could make such a statement.
