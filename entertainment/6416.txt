Director of the Kangana Ranaut starrer Simran Hansal Mehta has, in a veiled reference to the film's writer Apurva Asrani, said, "In your desperation to seek attention and gain sympathy do not try to harm my film." Earlier, Apurva asked Hansal to "show some spine" when he alleged the film's lead actress Kangana Ranaut of lying about co-writing the script.
