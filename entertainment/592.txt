Kangana Ranaut starrer 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' is facing opposition from the group Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha on the grounds that it "distorts history". Suresh Mishra, the organisation's president, alleged that it depicts an affair between Rani Lakshmibai and a British man. "The film is based on a foreigner's book and tries to dampen the queen's reputation," said Mishra.
