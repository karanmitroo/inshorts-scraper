Salman Khan's bodyguard Shera, who was part of singer Justin Bieber's security team while he was in India, said that Bieber is just like any other boy. Shera added, "He wants to be left alone. He wants to do his own thing. In short, he just wants to live his life." Bieber performed his maiden concert in India this week.
