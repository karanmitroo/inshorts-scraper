Saif Ali Khan, speaking on daughter Sara's decision to act in films after graduating from Columbia University, said, "Why would she want that for herself? Look at where she studied." He further said that he's not looking down on acting, but it's not the most stable profession. "This is not the life, any parent would want for children," added Saif.
