Filmmaker Karan Johar has said he's jealous of Sanjay Leela Bhansali as he's one of the most visually amazing filmmakers and is on top of his game. "The way he paints a visual, it is amazing and no one else can do it. He's brilliant and I aspire to be there. It motivates me to see his work," he added.
