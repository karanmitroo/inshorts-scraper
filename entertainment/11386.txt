Hindu right-wing organisations staged protests against the screening of Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in theatres in Gwalior and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh and in some parts of Chhattisgarh as well. In Jabalpur, the protesters reportedly forced the people out of a theatre and compelled the theatre owner to stop the show.
