Late actor Inder Kumar's wife Pallavi has said that she is filing a petition to clear his name from the rape charges levied against him by a model in 2014. "My husband is no more and I want to do this for my daughter," added Pallavi. She alleged that four years of humiliation was the cause of Inder's heart attack.
