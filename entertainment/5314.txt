Actress Sridevi has revealed that she has changed clothes behind bushes, trees and even a bus as earlier there were no vanity vans on film sets. She added, "I used to avoid drinking water on the sets of the film, as there were no clean washrooms." Sridevi further said that she would often fall sick while shooting for rain sequences.
