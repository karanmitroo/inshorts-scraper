Actress Katrina Kaif on Monday said that Salman Khan being involved in a controversy is not a new thing. Katrina's statement was prompted by a question on Salman's appointment as India's Goodwill ambassador for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Earlier, Indian sportsmen including Yogeshwar Dutt and Milkha Singh said that a sportsperson, not an actor, should have been made the ambassador.
