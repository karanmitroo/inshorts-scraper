A video showing actor Shah Rukh Khan allegedly in a scuffle with a fan during his shoot in Turkey has emerged online. The actor looks angry even as his bodyguards are shown pushing away someone in the crowd. In the past, SRK was banned by the Mumbai Cricket Association from the Wankhede stadium for misbehaving with security personnel.
