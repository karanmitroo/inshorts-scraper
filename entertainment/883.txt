Karni Sena has denied any type of involvement in vandalising a mall and shops in Gujarat's Ahmedabad to protest against the release of the film 'Padmaavat'. Around 16 people have been arrested in connection with the incident, which took place shortly after Karni Sena organised a candle march. Several vehicles in the area were set on fire by the mob.
