Director Vishal Bhardwaj will switch to his "first passion” of music direction for the Ajay Devgan and Tabu starrer “Drishyam". Bhardwaj along with Gulzar wanted to create an item number for the emotional thriller but was “disappointed” when director Nishikant Kamat asked for a song similar to ‘Ae Zindagi Gale Laga Le’. “Drishyam” will be released on July 31.
