Director Raja Banerjee’s biopic on Asian Games gold medalist track-athlete Pinki Pramanik, “She”, has hit the screens. The film is reportedly "a blend of fact and fiction", where the protagonist is named Rinki. Pramanik was accused of raping her live-in partner in 2012, who alleged the former was a man. She was acquitted by the Calcutta High Court last year.
