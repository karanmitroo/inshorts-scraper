Pakistani actress Mawra Hocane recently created a stir in her country after she posted a series of tweets in favour of the Bollywood film 'Phantom', which has been banned in Pakistan. Questioning the ban, Hocane said that the film was against terrorism and a terrorist can't belong to any country. Many Pakistanis have started #BanMawra campaign on Twitter since then.
