Actor Rajkummar Rao on social media shared a picture of himself after a haircut for the upcoming web series on freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
He can be seen sporting a half bald look in the photographs. Filmmaker Hansal Mehta clarified on Twitter that it's a test picture and not Rao's first look as Bose from the series.
