Actor Salman Khan will pay tribute to his onscreen mother late actress Reema Lagoo during a performance at IIFA Awards 2017, as per IIFA officials. "Reemaji had played my mother in some films, starting with 'Maine Pyar Kiya'. Off-screen, she was like a friend... She was a lovely human being. It feels like I've lost my onscreen mother," said Salman.
