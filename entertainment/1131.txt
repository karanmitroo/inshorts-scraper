Sunny Deol's 'Mohalla Assi' has been cleared by the Censor Board with an A certificate after 2 years, following a court order directing the film to be released without any cuts. A stay order against the film's release was issued in 2015 over its trailer, which showed the actors mouthing expletives. The film's release date is yet to be announced.
