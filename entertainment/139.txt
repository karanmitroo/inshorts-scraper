American singer and actress Barbra Streisand claims she successfully made two clones of her pet dog after it died last year. The two-time Oscar winner claimed that cells were taken from mouth and stomach of her 14-year-old dog. "I'm waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have her brown eyes and her seriousness", she said.
