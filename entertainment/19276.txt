Apparently depressed over not getting films for nearly one year, young Telugu actor Uday Kiran allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself Sunday. The 33-year-old married actor, who acted in 19 films including three Tamil movies, ended life in his flat in Andhra Pradesh around midnight while he was alone. However, police said that no suicide note was found.
