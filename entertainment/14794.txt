American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift will be honoured with the first Taylor Swift Award at the 64th annual BMI Pop Awards on May 10. This is the second time BMI is giving an eponymous award after 1990, when it bestowed the Michael Jackson Award upon Michael Jackson. The event will also honour songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil.
