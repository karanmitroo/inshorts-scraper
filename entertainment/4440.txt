A Jaipur court has rejected a plea seeking a stay on the release of Akshay Kumar starrer 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha'. The court found no merit in the application after hearing arguments for three successive days. Earlier, Jaipur-based filmmaker Pratik Sharma had claimed in a copyright infringement case that the makers had lifted the subject from his film 'Gutrun Gutargun'.
