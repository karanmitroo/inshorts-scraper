During the Emmys 2017, the announcer while calling Priyanka Chopra to present an award, pronounced Chopra as Chopa, missing out the 'R' from Priyanka's surname. Reacting to this, a Twitter user wrote, "Hey Emmys is Priyanka Chopra's name REALLY that hard to pronounce? CHO-PRA !! Not 'Choppa'," while another user wrote, "Who is Priyanka Chopa, I don't know her."
