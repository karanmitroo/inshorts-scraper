Ad-filmmaker Lloyd Baptista, who is working on a remake of the Kamal Haasan and Sridevi-starrer 1983 film 'Sadma', has said that a Hollywood version of the film will be shot next year. "For the Hollywood version we will have an Indian actress and a Hollywood actor. It's one of the actresses who is working abroad", Baptista said.
