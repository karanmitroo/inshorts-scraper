Pop star Katy Perry has been appointed as UNICEF's newest Goodwill Ambassador, joining a list of icons like Amitabh Bachchan and David Beckham. In her new role, Perry would focus on children and adolescents, including those living in severe poverty. Earlier this year, Perry had visited Madagascar, one of world's poorest countries, as part of a UNICEF mission.
