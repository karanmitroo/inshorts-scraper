Actress Rakhi Sawant said that as a child, she used condoms in place of water balloons while playing Holi. "[W]e would fill condoms with coloured water and use them instead. I did not know what condoms were back then, so I played with them a lot," she added. This year, she celebrated Holi in white attire and a neon wig.
