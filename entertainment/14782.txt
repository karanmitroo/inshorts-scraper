The daughter of late Hollywood actor Paul Walker has been granted a $10.1 million settlement reportedly from the estate of Roger Rodas, who was driving when the Porsche Carrera GT crashed. The court, which delivered the ruling in November 2014, reportedly found Rodas 'partly to blame' for the accident, which left both Rodas and Walker dead.
