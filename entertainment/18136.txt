Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor has strongly condemned the recent Delhi rape of a 27-yr-old woman by an Uber cab driver. The actress said, "It's an awful thing to have happened. Women are generally not safe in Delhi as compared to Mumbai." Reacting to the ban on Uber, she said that it is not the fault of the cab company.
