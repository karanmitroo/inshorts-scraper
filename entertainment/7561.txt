Actress Jennifer Aniston's friend Chelsea Handler has said Jennifer does not care about the divorce of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. "I don't think Jen cares about what's going on and it's crazy that people think she does... As if she's sitting around caring about [it]. I know I don't," she added. Jennifer was married to Brad Pitt from 2002-2005.
