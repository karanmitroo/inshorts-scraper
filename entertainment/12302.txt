Emraan Hashmi's upcoming film 'Raaz Reboot' has been leaked online two days before its release on September 16. The actor took to Twitter requesting people not to watch the film's pirated copy. "I will request you to give the film a fair chance by watching it in theatres. Itâ€™s a request, which I think anyone sensible will entertain," wrote Emraan.
