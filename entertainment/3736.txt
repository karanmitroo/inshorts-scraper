Rohit Shetty has denied reports that Sunny Deol will be starring in 'Singham 3', which will be backed by another production house. "All copyrights are with us to make any films as part of the franchise as well as use the name in the film titles," he added. Both the earlier films in the Singham franchise were directed by Shetty.
