Actress Raveena Tandon has said that crime against women in India isn't age-related, which is a serious concern. "I don't think any of the kids are safe," she added. "What irks me further is the way our ministers, who are supposed to take a strong stand, end up doing things that in a way encourage crime," Raveena said further.
