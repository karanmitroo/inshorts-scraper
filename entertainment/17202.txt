A US team will make a documentary on India's kid archer, Dolly Shivani, who created the Asian and India records when she was just 35 months old. They aim to showcase the prodigy on forums such as international film festivals. Initially, the team will film a 7-minute trailer which will be used to raise funds to make a full-length movie.
