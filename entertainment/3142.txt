Television actress Hina Khan has said she joined Bigg Boss 11 as a participant because she wants to break that image of herself as a "bahu". She added, "I have seen actors who have done such shows for years and they are never able to come out of that image." Hina joked that she would go anywhere for Salman Khan.
