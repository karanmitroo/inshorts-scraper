The 2015 film 'Angry Indian Goddesses' will have a prequel, confirmed the film's director Pan Nalin. "Itâ€™s only fair for the world to know the backstory of every goddess, of what made them the way they are today," said Nalin. Touted as the "first all-out female buddy film", it starred Sarah-Jane Dias, Anushka Manchanda and Sandhya Mridul in leading roles.
