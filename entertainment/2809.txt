Actress Tisca Chopra, while speaking about sexual harassment, said women are just as much to blame for it because they put themselves in vulnerable positions. She questioned, "Why do these women go to hotel rooms? Do they not fear for their personal safety?" "Being a woman, I would say that first of all, protect yourself," Tisca added.
