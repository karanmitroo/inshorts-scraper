Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that he will be a big part of Shah Rukh Khan's son, Aryan's Bollywood debut, either as his director or a guiding support. "Aryan is my godchild. Him being launched is like my son being launched," Karan added. Aryan is currently pursuing film studies at a Los Angeles-based institution.
