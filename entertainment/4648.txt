Akshay Kumar, while talking about the picture which showed him waving the Indian flag upside down at Women's World Cup final, explained he was trying to steady it but someone from behind clicked the photo. "If you watch it on television, you'll see I'm holding it right," he added. However, Akshay also apologised if someone's sentiments were hurt.
