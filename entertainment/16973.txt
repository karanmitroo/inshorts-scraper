Actor Rajkummar Rao, who features in recently released 'Hamari Adhuri Kahani', went 20 days without a shower for his role in the film. The actor had to look unkempt and messy for a particular sequence. "There is a certain kind of preparation involved in portraying different characters on screenâ€¦ This is something I enjoy doing for them," Rao said.
