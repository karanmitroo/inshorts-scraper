If a movie is declared tax-free in India, it means that the state has waived off the entertainment tax. Different states levy a different percentage as entertainment tax and individually decide on the tax-free status of a film. Tax exemption is provided on the basis of the film's subject, to ensure that the movie is seen by more people.
