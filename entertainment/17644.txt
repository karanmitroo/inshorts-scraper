The thief who stole the dress worn by actress Lupita Nyong'o at the Oscars has apparently returned the garment after discovering that the 6,000 pearls covering it were fake. It was found in a bathroom of the same Hollywood hotel from where it was taken. The dress reportedly had real Akoya cultured pearls sewn into it and was worth $150,000.
