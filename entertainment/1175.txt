Twitter users slammed Disney for releasing the official Black Panther collector's badge with a white character while the superhero character is shown as the king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. A user tweeted, "They white-washed the black panther pin." However, Disney later apologised saying that it was shot under a bright light which caused differences in colour.
