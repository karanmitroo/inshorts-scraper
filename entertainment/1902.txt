Actress-turned-author Twinkle Khanna has said she realised she had failed spectacularly as an actress after spending eight years in Bollywood. "When you don't take success very seriously it's easier to shrug off failure," she added. Twinkle further revealed that she wanted to become a chartered accountant but entered the film industry as her parents wanted her to follow their footsteps.
