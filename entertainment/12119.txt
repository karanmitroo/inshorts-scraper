A series of teasers for the Scarlett Johansson starrer upcoming science fiction film 'Ghost in the Shell' have been released. The film, which is based on a Japanese manga series, was criticised of 'whitewashing' by casting Johansson in the lead role, as her character is Japanese in the original series. The film is scheduled to release on March 31, 2017.
