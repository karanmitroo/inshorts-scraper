Actress Raai Laxmi's intimate scene from the upcoming film 'Julie 2' has been leaked online. "I am shocked. This is ridiculous and so upsetting to see someone leaking a video just before the release," tweeted Raai Laxmi. 'Julie 2', which is being presented and distributed by ousted Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, is a sequel to the 2004 film 'Julie'.
