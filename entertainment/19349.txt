Bollywood actor Rajpal Yadav on Tuesday got temporary relief from the Delhi High Court that suspended his sentence following his appeal against its single judge's order. The single judge of the high court had sent him to 10 days in jail on Dec-3 for misleading the court in a recovery suit filed against him and his wife by a businessman.
