Actress Anushka Sharma has said that she will not be able to handle stardom in the way Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan do. "I sometimes think about this (stardom) and get scared. I haven't experienced superstardom like Salman, Shah Rukh or Aamir. But even this (my stardom) can give a false sense, forget about what they face," said Anushka.
