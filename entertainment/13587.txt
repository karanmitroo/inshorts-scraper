US-based consumer goods startup 'The Honest Company', founded by actress Jessica Alba and three others, is in no rush for an IPO said Jeremy Liew, a board member at the startup. Founded in 2011, it lets users buy over 100 products for babies, personal care, and wellness. Investors valued Honest at $1.7 billion in a financing round last year.
