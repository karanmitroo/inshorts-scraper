Jacqueline Fernandez, wearing a red ensemble, turned up as Santa Claus for underprivileged children associated with Mumbai's Angel Xpress Foundation. She danced with the kids and took selfies with them. "I think this is the season's best time and for me it is the time to give back to the society and be thankful for what I have," said Jacqueline.
