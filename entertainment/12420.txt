Priyanka Yoshikawa, who is half-Indian, has been crowned Miss Japan 2016. "[P]eople are asking me about my ‘purity’ – yes, my dad is Indian and I’m proud of it... But that does not mean I’m not Japanese," said 22-year-old Priyanka. Her victory follows that of Miss Japan 2015 Ariana Miyamoto, who became the first black woman to represent Japan.
