Actress Angelina Jolie revealed that she developed Bell's palsy last year, a type of facial paralysis resulting in facial nerve damage which caused one side of her face to droop. She added, "Sometimes women in families put themselves last...until it manifests...in their health." Angelina further said she feels more of a woman after taking charge of her life and health.
