Speaking about the man who allegedly molested a Bollywood teen actress on a flight by keeping his foot on her armrest, actress Kangana Ranaut said, "For me, it is highly offensive. I would have broken his leg." Kangana added, "Why are we judging and trolling her? In this kind of environment, which is so frightening, who will speak up?"
