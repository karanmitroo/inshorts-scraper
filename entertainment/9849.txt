Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the Aamir Khan starrer film 'Dangal' is among the most patriotic films in recent times. This comes after the CBFC received a letter from a foundation, claiming that the National Anthem was wrongly played in a scene in the film. CBFC would never allow the National Anthem to be disrespected, Pahlaj added.
