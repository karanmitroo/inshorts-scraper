Apurva Asrani, writer of Kangana Ranaut starrer 'Simran', took to Twitter to share the script that he penned for the film. "Interesting exercise to see how some bits evolve, while some get lost in translation," wrote Apurva while sharing the script. Earlier, Kangana was credited for additional story and dialogues before the main writer Apurva on the film's poster.
