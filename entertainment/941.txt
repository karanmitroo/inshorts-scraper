Asking people to boycott the film 'Padmaavat', BJP MLA from Hyderabad Raja Singh has asked the people to burn and vandalise theatres if required to stop others from watching the movie. "If we are able to stop this one movie, it is our success. If we don't stop it, director Sanjay Leela Bhansali will break the society," Singh added.
