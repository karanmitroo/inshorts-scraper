Rishi Kapoor took to Twitter to express his disappointment over a cartoon on the recent fire at RK Studios and wrote, "We take objection to this kind of depraved sick humour." The cartoon depicts RK Studios burning as Raj Kapoor says, "Fire is a good omen in my life, It all began with Aag." 'Aag' was RK Studios' first film.
