'Transformers' actor Shia LaBeouf has apologised on Twitter for hurling insults at policemen who arrested him on charges of disorderly conduct and public intoxication on Saturday. The apology comes after videos of the actor verbally abusing policemen were posted online. He had accused police of being racist and also threatened them by saying he has several "millionaire lawyers".
