Aarambhh Singh, director of Sanjay Dutt's upcoming film 'Malang' has said that he won't make Dutt dance around trees just because it's a romantic film. "We're not showing him as a young lover boy, he's playing around his age. Love and romance can happen at any age. We will give a new definition to love through this film," said Singh.
