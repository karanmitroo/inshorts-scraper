Iranian filmmaker Keywan Karimi has begun serving a year-long prison sentence on Wednesday, handed down over footage that authorities deemed insulting. He will also have to endure 223 lashes as a part of his sentence. The charges against the filmmaker stemmed from a film he directed called 'Writing on the City' that focuses on political graffiti in Iran.
