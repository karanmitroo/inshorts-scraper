Joining the debate on intolerance in the country, actor Aamir Khan on Monday said he was "alarmed" by many incidences occurring in the country. "When I chat with Kiran at home, she says 'Should we move out of India?'... She fears for her child", Aamir said. Further, the 50-year-old actor added, "[T]here is growing despondency apart from alarm".
