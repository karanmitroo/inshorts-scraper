As per reports, the Rajinikanth starrer ‘Kabali' has been leaked online three days ahead of its release. 'Kabali' is reportedly available for downloading or streaming on several links on the dark web. Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani said, "They've not even spared Rajinikanth's film. Kabali was censored in Chennai, so it had nothing to do with our office in Mumbai."​
