The star-studded premiere of Madhuri Dixit-Naseeruddin Shah starrer "Dedh Ishqiya" in Lucknow was cancelled Friday following the controversy created due to the Bollywood performances at the Saifai Mahotsava. CM Akhilesh Yadav was scheduled to attend the premiere. But the event was cancelled and the film's team was informed about it when they were about to board a flight for Lucknow.
