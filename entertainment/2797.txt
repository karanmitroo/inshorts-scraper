Amanda Segel, an executive producer of The Weinstein Company's TV series 'The Mist', has accused Bob Weinstein of harassing her. Segel has claimed that in 2016, Bob repeatedly asked her to dine alone with him and made romantic overtures for about three months despite her multiple refusals. This comes amid sexual harassment and rape allegations against Bob's brother Harvey Weinstein.
