'Kyun Re', the song sung by Amitabh Bachchan for the upcoming film 'TE3N', was released on Friday. "Itâ€™s always very frightening for me to sing a song because I am not a singer," said Bachchan. The song has been composed by Clinton Cerejo, who has also lent backing vocals for the track. 'TE3N' is scheduled to release on June 10.
