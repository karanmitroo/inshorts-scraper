Kareena Kapoor Khan, who got married last October after a five-year courtship, says that marriage has not changed her perception towards roles in films and she is open to do intimate scenes if the script demands. The actress, who had done intimate scenes in Omkara and 3-idiots, reportedly refused do intimate scenes in Satyagraha as the script didnÃ¢??t require it.
