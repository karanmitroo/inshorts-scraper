Singer Madonna has adopted twin girls from the African country Malawi. Madonna was granted permission by Malawian high court to adopt four-year-old Stella and Esther from Mchinji orphanage. Notably, the singer is being given a special exception to laws of Malawi which prevent non-residents from adopting children to take overseas.
