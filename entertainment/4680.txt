Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput on Thursday took to Twitter to complain that e-commerce platform Amazon India had blocked his account and taken his money without delivering the books he ordered. "It seems @amazonIN doesn't like that I read.... 20 books missing over a month. Customer care doesn't care," he wrote. Amazon responded to Sushant's tweet to fix the issue.
