Referring to his demand for one lakh votes to clear 'intercourse' without cuts in 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani said he won't accept votes from unmarried people. He added that voting public should be around 36 as people that age mostly have 12-year-olds. "I want to see...that Indian families want 12-year-olds...to understand meaning of intercourse," said Nihalani.
