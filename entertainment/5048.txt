The Angamaly judicial magistrate court on Saturday turned down actor Dileep's bail plea in the Malayalam actress abduction case. The court remanded him to judicial custody till July 25. The actor's counsel had claimed that he has been falsely implicated in the case and the investigation team was "busy fabricating evidence against him".
