Former Spice Girl Melanie Brown's (Mel B) ex-nanny Lorraine Gilles has filed a lawsuit alleging the singer acted as "camera man" to film their threesomes with her estranged husband Stephen Belafonte. This allegation comes after Melanie accused Lorraine of having an affair with Stephen and aborting his baby. However, Lorraine claimed she never had sex with Stephen without Melanie's "instruction".
