A Jaipur woman filed an FIR against the comedy group AIB for allegedly leaking her phone number in their "If Apps Were People" video. She said she received around 50 calls from strangers since the video's release. AIB beeped-out the dialogue revealing the number and accepted their mistake, immediately after the police informed them, a spokesperson for the company said.
