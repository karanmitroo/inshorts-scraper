Amitabh Bachchan, while slamming the paparazzi in his blog post, wrote he wore his knitted cap over his eyes after he was discharged from Lilavati Hospital to protect himself from the flash of the paparazzi's cameras. "Blinded they make us with their onslaught of special weaponry," wrote Bachchan. He was admitted to hospital reportedly due to neck and spine pain.
