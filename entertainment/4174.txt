 Tiia Ohman and Satu Walden, two bloggers from Finland, share pictures of scenes from 'Game of Thrones' from the locations where they were shot. The pictures show the scenes in a tablet, juxtaposed with the actual location where that particular scene was shot. They have visited 20 locations so far and will soon head to Morocco, Spain, Croatia and Malta.
