Anushka Sharma has said that she is closer to Ranbir Kapoor than Ranveer Singh. "We have a good understanding between us... also during a bad time you become better friends because you have company since we did Bombay Velvet together, which was a flop so we became closer," added Anushka. Her second film opposite Ranbir was 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'.
