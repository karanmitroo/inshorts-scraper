Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that awards are encouraging but they cannot dictate the films that she will be doing in the future. "I have never made films for awards or acted in films for awards," she added. Notably, her debut Marathi production 'Ventilator' has won three awards at the 64th National Film Awards.
