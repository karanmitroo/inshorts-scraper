British singer Adele’s new album “25” sold a record 2.3 million copies in the US in the first three days of its release. Adele’s UK label XL Recordings had last week withheld the album from streaming online on Apple Music, Google Play and Spotify. The album is expected to break NSync's sales record 2.4 million copies in the opening week.
