Actress Anushka Sharma said that these days, people take law and order in their hands and destroy sets. She added, "There's no need for violence. Taking law and order in your hands is not right." Meanwhile, the sets of filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Padmavati' were vandalised and set on fire by a group of unidentified men in Kolhapur recently.
