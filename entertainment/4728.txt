Director Rajkumar Santoshi has confirmed a sequel to the comedy film 'Andaz Apna Apna' but has said that unlike the original, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan will not star as the male leads. "That time, these actors had the innocence... It looks cute if a 20-year-old is chasing a girl. A 45-50-year-old man chasing young girls looks vulgar," added Santoshi.
