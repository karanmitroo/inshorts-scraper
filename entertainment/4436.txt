Kamal Haasan, who hosts 'Bigg Boss' Tamil, has threatened to quit the show over a task wherein contestants were asked to dress up and behave like 'mentally challenged' people. "I'm actually angry about it," he added. Haasan further said it isn't true that just because he is the host, he decides every thing that happens on the show.
