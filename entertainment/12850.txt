The United Nations is set to issue a stamp to mark the birth centenary of Bharat Ratna awardee Carnatic vocalist MS Subbulakshmi. The stamp will be issued next week to coincide with celebrations for India's 70th Independence Day. Notably, Subbulakshmi was the first Indian to perform at the UN General Assembly hall in October 1966.
