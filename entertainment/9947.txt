The iconic Hollywood sign in Los Angeles was altered to 'Hollyweed' by a prankster on New Year, likely marking the legalization of recreational marijuana in US' California state. The police said the prankster, recorded by security cameras, used tarps to turn the white Os into Es. The sign, later restored, was once altered to read 'Hollyweed' in 1976 as well.
