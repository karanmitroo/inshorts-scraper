Television actress Urvashi Dholakia, known for portraying Komolika Basu in the television serial 'Kasautii Zindagii Kay', revealed that she was threatened to be sacked from a show if she didn't lose weight. She added, "I didn't retaliate as I was badly in need of work back then." Urvashi further said that being size-zero is not a yardstick for good health.
