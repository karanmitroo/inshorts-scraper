Actress Esha Deol(31) has suggested opening of dance-bars in India, saying that it will not only satisfy men but ensure the safety of women, on the lines of Bangkok, to curb rising crime against women. Also, welcoming the death-sentence awarded to four-convicts in the Delhi gangrape-case, she said, "the minor accused in the case should also be given capital punishment."
