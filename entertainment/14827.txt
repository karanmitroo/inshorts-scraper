Amitabh Bachchan on Tuesday denied any knowledge of the companies named in the recently leaked "Panama Papers" and said his name has been misused. "I have paid all my taxes including on monies spent by me overseas," Bachchan added. Notably, Bachchan and his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai were among the 500 Indians accused of having offshore assets in the leaked documents.
