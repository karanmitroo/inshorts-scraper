Condemning the Gurugram school bus attack by a mob protesting against 'Padmaavat', Congress President Rahul Gandhi blamed BJP for using "hatred and violence", adding that it's "setting our entire country on fire". "There will never be a cause big enough to justify violence against children," Rahul tweeted. The bus was attacked on Wednesday reportedly by Rajput group Karni Sena.
