Actor Arshad Warsi, while admitting that he is uncomfortable sharing his opinions on social media, said, "I know that even if I tweet that I had chicken biryani for lunch, I'll be told to stay in Pakistan." He added, "Every time you say something, you get trolled for it so badly... That's why I stay away, and I'm happy."
