Rapper-singer Logic performed his new single '1-800-273-8255', which is the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the US, at MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs). Khalid also performed with Logic while suicide survivors wearing t-shirts that displayed the helpline number and a message on the back that read, "You are not alone" were also part of the act.
