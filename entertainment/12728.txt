Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has been granted permission to build an 83-bedroom luxury hotel in London. Housed in six Victorian and 20th-century buildings, the Wellington hotel will feature a spa and two restaurants. De Niro already owns two hotels, one of which was named the world's worst new luxury hotel by travel rating company Luxury Travel Intelligence in 2015.
