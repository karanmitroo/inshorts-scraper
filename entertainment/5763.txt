Actor Rishi Kapoor trolled the Pakistan cricket team on Twitter, after India defeated Bangladesh to face their arch-rivals in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. Kapoor asked the Pakistan Cricket Board to send a cricket team for the match, and not a "hockey or kho kho" team. India defeated Pakistan by 124 runs in their last encounter on June 4.
