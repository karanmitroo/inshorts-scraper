Filmmaker Gauri Shinde, who directed the Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan starrer film 'Dear Zindagi', has said that awards would be important for her if they made sense and were credible. "My award and reward are the personal stories people tell me about how my film affected them and their take away," she added.
