Twitter users slammed Gauahar Khan after she criticised singer Papon for kissing a minor girl, while writing, "Thank god...you didn't say it's overreaction!" Gauahar had once supported Bigg Boss 11 contestant Aakash Dadlani's act of trying to forcibly kiss Shilpa Shinde and called it 'overreaction'. Another user commented, "Aap #Padmavaat k time pe soye the...#Papon k time pe jaag gaye."
