Nawazuddin Siddiqui's ex-girlfriend Sunita has accused him of making false claims about their relationship in his biography 'An Ordinary Life: A Memoir'. "Nawaz has written things from his own imagination [and] changed facts to show himself in a positive light," she wrote. Sunita added, "I didn't leave you because you were poor, but because of your poor way of thinking."
