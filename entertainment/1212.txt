Singer-composer AR Rahman has said he's very proud of his 25 years in the industry as he did things which he didn't imagine he'd do. "If you lose conviction in yourself, you lose the confidence of delivering the things," he added. Rahman further said, "2017 has been one of the best years. I was constantly pushed to do my best."
