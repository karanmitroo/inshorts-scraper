Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that her maternal instincts are kicking in and she wants to have babies. "I think I have been fairly independent, but when you are in your late twenties...you start to get that feeling very badly," said Kangana. She added, "I never thought I would talk like this, but... I am hoping to see that day."
