Actress-model Pamela Anderson has penned a letter for her rumoured boyfriend, WikiLeaks' Founder Julian Assange. "Thinking of Julian makes me wonder, what is the sexiest quality in a man? Surely the sexiest qualities in a man are bravery and courage," she wrote. Anderson also lauded him for "standing up for the oppressed, for the weak, for the forgotten."
