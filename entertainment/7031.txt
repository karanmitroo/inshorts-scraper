Actress Shraddha Kapoor will portray the role of Olympic medal-winning shuttler Saina Nehwal in an upcoming biopic on the shuttler's life. "I feel so lucky to be playing Saina, who's not just been the world's number one badminton player, but is also a youth icon," said Shraddha. The movie, to be released next year, will be directed by Amole Gupte.
