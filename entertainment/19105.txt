The performance of Akshat Singh (8), semi-finalist of TV show India's Got Talent was greeted with standing ovation in The Ellen Show on Monday. Akshat rode on a little bike and then staged a complex routine of headstands, cartwheels and Bollywood-style dance moves. The Salman fan flew to USA last week after being invited onto the show.
