Putting Haryana on alert ahead of release of controversial film “MSG: The Messenger” starring Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, Haryana police has imposed section 144 in various parts of the state. The police’s decision came following protest threats from Sikh organisations. However, the Indian National Lok Dal has said that it would continue to oppose the screening of the controversial movie.
