Rajkummar Rao, while reacting to his film 'Newton' being selected as India's official entry to Oscars 2018, said it can't get bigger than this. "The film... is getting a great response from everywhere," he added. Rajkummar further said, "Content is finally getting its due. And the same kind of sincerity we have made Newton with, it's resonating with the audience."
