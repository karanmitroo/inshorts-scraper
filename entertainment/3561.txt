Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel has slammed Aditya Pancholi for saying Kangana is "lying through her teeth" about filing an FIR against him. Pancholi had said that if she has filed such an FIR, he wants her to show it to the world. "Why should the reigning Queen of the film industry...[succumb] to this small time goon's bullying," tweeted Rangoli.
