Rohit Roy has said before the film 'Kaabil', he was offered only coffee and biscuits but no work by producers when he met them in their offices. "I had been almost written off from the industry and had no good work for two-three years... My time was bad," he added. He was previously seen in the 2015 film 'Calendar Girls'.
