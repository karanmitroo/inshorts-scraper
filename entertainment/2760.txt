Reacting to the controversy surrounding film 'Mersal', Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday took to Twitter and said, "Mr. (Narendra) Modi, Cinema is a deep expression of Tamil culture and language. Don't try to demon-etise Tamil pride by interfering in Mersal." Notably, BJP leaders have said that scenes from the movie criticising GST and Digital India must be removed.
