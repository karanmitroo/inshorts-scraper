Producer Boney Kapoor, on being asked to comment on the ongoing row on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', said, "Padmavati is, well, not my film." Slamming his comment, a Twitter user wrote, "Spineless person." "His films in the past have run into financial issues. Quite sure he must be happy that other director/producer's films face huge problems too," read another comment.
