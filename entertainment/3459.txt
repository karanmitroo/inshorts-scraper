The Rishi Kapoor and Paresh Rawal starrer film 'Patel Ki Punjaabi Shaadi' "hangs between totally slapstick and situational comedy," wrote Hindustan Times (HT). It "resembles a TV show more than a film," said The Times of India (TOI). Meanwhile, Koimoi wrote that "the film can be highly avoidable." It was rated 1.5/5 (HT, Koimoi) and 2/5 (TOI).
