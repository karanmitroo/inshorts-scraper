Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence has written an essay describing sexism in the industry. Calling men lucky, Lawrence, who is one of the highest-paid actresses in the world, has revealed that she is paid considerably less money than her male co-stars. "I’m over trying to find the ‘adorable’ way to state my opinion and still be likable," she added.
