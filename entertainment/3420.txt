Shah Rukh Khan, on the death anniversary of his father on Tuesday, tweeted, "Like my dad (RIP), my only duty to my kids is to delay...onset of their adulthood as much as possible." He added he wants to retain the purity of their childhood. SRK had earlier said his children understand that just because they're photographed, doesn't make them important.
