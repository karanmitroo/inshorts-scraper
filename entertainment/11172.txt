Actress Priyanka Chopra has said that when Salman Khan or Aamir Khan feature on posters of films, they make â‚¹300 crore. "Somehow professional men are given more remuneration... compensation than women are," said Priyanka. She added that movies with female leads don't make that kind of money but when these films make such money, actresses will also earn as much.
