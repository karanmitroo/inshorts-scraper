Actor Seth Rogen has criticised Sony's Clean Version initiative, where offensive and adult content will be censored in PG-13 and R-rated films. The initiative allows home entertainment customers to purchase films that have been edited for broadcast television to encourage viewing for a wider audience. The actor has produced adult-themed comedies, which includes the animated film Sausage Party.
