Comedian Kapil Sharma has confirmed that he has been approached for a Hollywood project. "I'll let everyone know once it's finalised... I'll definitely go there and meet the makers once since nothing major can be discussed over a telephonic conversation," he added. The series, reportedly named 'Comedy Curry', will also feature a Hollywood personality.
