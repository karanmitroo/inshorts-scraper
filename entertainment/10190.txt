Actor Salman Khan on Twitter said that he hates Aamir Khan professionally but loves him personally, after his family thought Aamir's 'Dangal' was a much better film than Salman's 'Sultan'. In response, Aamir tweeted, "Sallu, in your 'hate' I feel only love. 'I love you like I hate you'." Notably, both 'Sultan' and 'Dangal' are based on wrestling.
