Actor Salman Khan has reportedly been dropped as the brand ambassador of Coca-Cola India's soft drink 'Thums Up' after endorsing the drink for four years. Talks are said to be on with actor Ranveer Singh to replace him. Salman's contract expired last month and the company chose not to renew it, reports added.
