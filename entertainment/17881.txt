Akshay Kumar-starrer ‘Baby’ which is about an Indian spy on a mission to catch a dreaded terrorist has been banned by the Pakistan censor board. "Censor boards in Islamabad and Karachi have decided to ban the film because it portrays a negative image of Muslims and the negative characters in the film also have Muslim names,” the Dawn newspaper said.
