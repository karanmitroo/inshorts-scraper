Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that his 25-year-old friendship with actress Kajol has come to its expiry date. "But that doesn't mean it can ever take away from the times we've shared," he added. Further speaking about Kajol's husband Ajay Devgn, Johar said, "I have no relationship with that man. I have never known him... He's not even an acquaintance".
