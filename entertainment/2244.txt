Akshay Kumar, while speaking about his upcoming film 'PadMan', which deals with the issue of menstrual hygiene, said, "Menstruation is natural." "It's not about being bold, but about breaking taboos that hold us back," he added. PadMan is based on the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a man who made sanitary pads accessible to the women of his village.
