Filmmaker-actor Kabir Bedi on Twitter called Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani a disaster. He further wrote, "Censor Board has no idea how much it is damaging India's image with their stupid demands." Kabir wrote this while retweeting an article which discussed how Censor Board has asked for removing words like 'cow', 'Gujarat' from a documentary on Nobel laureate Amartya Sen.
