Singer Justin Bieber has been slammed by American pop rock band Hanson as the band compared his music to the sexually transmitted disease (STD) chlamydia. "I prefer not to get any venereal diseases so whenever Justin Bieber gets near me or near my ears... it's just ear infections, they're terrible," said one of the band members during an interview.
