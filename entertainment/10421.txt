Several students in Israel have demanded that the Ministry of Education move the matriculation exam to another date owing to singer Justin Bieber's concert, which will be held a night before the biology exam. "Justin Bieber does not come to Israel every year," wrote a student on the Facebook page of Israel's National Students and Youth Council.
