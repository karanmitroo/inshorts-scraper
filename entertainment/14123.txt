Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has said that she never does films based on how they will perform at the box office. Speaking about her film 'Sarbjit', the 42-year-old actress said, "It will start building with word of mouth. It’s a sensitive subject and it will grow with audience’s support". "This film should reach every corner of the country," she added.
