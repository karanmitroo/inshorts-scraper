Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was trolled for his anti-demonetisation tweet, which had a pun on Miss World Manushi Chhillar's name. A user wrote, "This just shows how you look at women! Chhillar is Manushi's Family name... not something to make fun of!" Tharoor later apologised for the joke while tweeting, "Certainly no offence was meant to a bright young girl."
