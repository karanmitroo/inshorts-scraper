British rock band Coldplay's vocalist Chris Martin halted a concert midway in Melbourne to help a fan propose to his girlfriend but he ended up getting the wrong woman on stage. "What? You're not the person he's proposing to? What are you doing here?" joked Chris. The fan then went on to propose to his actual girlfriend.
