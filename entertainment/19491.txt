The ticket prices of Hrithik Roshan starrer 'Krrish-3' will cost more than 'Chennai Express', which were sold at Rs 500. Though, the effect will been seen only on multiplex chains like Fun Cinemas, Inox etc. No such rise will be seen in the single screen theatres. The festive season of Diwali is one of the reasons behind the price rise.
