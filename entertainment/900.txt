Speaking about the clash between his film 'Aiyaary' and Akshay Kumar's 'Pad Man', Sidharth Malhotra said, "Yes, it irritates, but now it's too late." "This situation could have resolved earlier, people could have stuck to their dates, respecting others' space," he added. Both 'Pad Man' and 'Aiyaary' are scheduled to release on February 9.
