The Bombay High Court on Monday asked the Maharashtra government to justify its decision to grant Sanjay Dutt early release from prison in the 1993 serial blasts case. The actor was sentenced to five years for possession of arms but was released eight months before completing the jail term on account of his good conduct while in Pune's Yerwada prison.
