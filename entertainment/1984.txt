Filmmaker James Cameron, while talking about why Leonardo DiCaprio's character 'Jack' had to die in 'Titanic', said, "The film is about death and separation; he had to die." He added that had 'Jack' lived, the ending of the film would have been meaningless. Cameron further said, "So whether it was that, or...smoke stack fell on him, he was going down."
