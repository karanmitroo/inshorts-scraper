An old video from filmmaker Karan Johar's interview in 2014 with film critic Anupama Chopra shows him saying that he is definitely guilty of nepotism. Johar added, "I picked up a chubby girl (Alia Bhatt)... May be the fact that she was Mahesh Bhatt's daughter also excited me... Would I have cast Varun Dhawan if he wasn't David Dhawan's son?"
