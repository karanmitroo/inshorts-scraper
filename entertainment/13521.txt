Presenter Chris Evans on Monday stepped down as the host for television series 'Top Gear' after just one season. He had signed a three-year deal with the BBC, but quit following record low viewings for the show's final episode which was screened on July 3. "Gave it my best shot but sometimes that's not enough", Evans tweeted.
