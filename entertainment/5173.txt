Sridevi has said her 1989 film ChaalBaaz would make for a great remake and that Alia Bhatt would fit her role perfectly. Sridevi added, "She (Alia) is spontaneous and an extremely natural actor. She can look vulnerable, innocent and at the same time, she can be smart and mischievous too." ChaalBaaz featured Sridevi in a double role.
