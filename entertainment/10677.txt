A fan has shared a selfie taken with actor Anil Kapoor while they were waiting in an ATM line at a 5-star hotel. The photo was captioned, "[T]hat picture was in no way representative of the pain that #DeMonetisation is". "Taking selfies in an ATM line: check. Thanks to #DeMonetisation, I get to meet you lovely people," replied Anil.
