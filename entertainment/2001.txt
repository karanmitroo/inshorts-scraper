A doll resembling actress Sridevi has been installed at a restaurant in Singapore. The restaurant is reportedly named 'Delhi Restaurant'. "If after so many years in the film industry, people still think of me and use my name in such a sweet and complimentary way, I can only say I am blessed," said Sridevi.
