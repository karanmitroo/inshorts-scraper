Actor Varun Dhawan has said that he is "pretty cool" about posing in his briefs if the role demands it. "In 'Student of the Year' I was pretty much stripped...Honestly, itâ€™s been lucky for me," said Varun. He revealed that his trainer warned him that once he shows his body, he will have to do it throughout his career.
