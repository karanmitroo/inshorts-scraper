Singer Kanika Kapoor has cancelled five shows in Pakistan amid the rising tension between India and its neighbour. The 38-year-old singer, who performed in Islamabad a few months ago, said, "People there (Pakistan) were so lovely. I feel sad the world has come to this stage because of some people." She called the surgical strikes by India a 'political thing'.
