Deepika Padukone has said that there is absolutely no distortion of history in the film 'Padmavati'. Deepika's statement came after the physical assault on the film's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali by protestors, who said that they were not happy as 'Padmavati' distorted facts. The film allegedly shows a romantic dream sequence between Padmavati (Deepika) and Alauddin Khilji (Ranveer Singh).
