Singer Lady Gaga in her 2013 song Princess Die had described late Princess Diana as 'just another dead blonde'. The song also revolved around Diana's eating disorder and her death in a car crash while being pursued by paparazzi. Reports about the song's lyrics emerged days after Gaga spoke with Prince William via FaceTime over raising awareness about mental health.
