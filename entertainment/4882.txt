Randhir Kapoor, while commenting on people who troll his daughter Kareena over her parenting style, has asked who are they to interfere in her life. "[S]he has to go and work out to stay in shape, or else she'll get trolled for that too," he added. Randhir further said Kareena will continue working even though she has a baby now.
