Director JJ Abrams has said that Star Wars isn't a movie, it's a religion. He further added that managing the expectations of the fans can be difficult. Star Wars: The Last Jedi will release in the USA on December 15 this year. It is the second film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, following Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015).
