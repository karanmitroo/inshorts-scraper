Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that Aamir Khan gaining and then shedding kilos of weight for playing the character 'Mahavir Phogat' in 'Dangal' is impressive. Aamir had to shed the weight he initially put on for playing Mahavir's younger version. "Aamir is very disciplined and works really hard on his body... I can never be as disciplined," said SRK.
