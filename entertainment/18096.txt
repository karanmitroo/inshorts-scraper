British makeup artist and self-confessed Kim Kardashian fan, Jordan James Parke (23), has spent over $156k on plastic surgery to look like the reality TV star. Parke had over 50 cosmetic procedures (including Botox, lip-filling surgery, laser hair removal and eyebrow tattoos) to transfigure himself into a Kim lookalike. “I love everything about Kim,” he said.
