Shahid Kapoor, while speaking about the failure of Rangoon, said he cannot take ownership of the film. "Rangoon as a film had many energies and many people... I'm happy my part was appreciated but I'm sad for the film not doing well," he added. Shahid further said it's disheartening when a film doesn't do good business and doesn't get appreciation.
