Model and ex-Bigg Boss contestant Sofia Hayat has slammed beauty pageants while adding that beauty can't be judged as it does not have a single face or form. Sharing a picture of Miss World 2017 Manushi Chhillar, Sofia added, "Miss World would never allow herself to be judged by the standards of others... let alone a committee!"
