Angelina Jolie has denied reports of using a cruel casting process while auditioning children for her film. "Upset that a pretend exercise in an improvisation, from an actual scene...has been written about as if it was a real scenario," said Jolie. The casting involved a game where poor children were made to snatch money and justify the mock theft.
