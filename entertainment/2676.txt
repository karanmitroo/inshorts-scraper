Aamir Khan has said an actor's stardom should be measured by how his flop film performs at the box-office. "My stardom comes into play when I make a bad film that people don't want to watch...(but) still come because of my name," added Aamir. He further said another yardstick for measuring actors' popularity is how people copy their style.
