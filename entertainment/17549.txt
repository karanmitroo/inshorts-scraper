American producer Peter Berg plans to make a documentary on Barbadian pop star Rihanna, which will talk about her journey to become a global music icon. The documentary would be "much more a character study than a music film," said Berg, who had given Rihanna a break into movies by casting her in his epic 'Battleship' (2012).
