During a promotion event in Singapore for the upcoming film Krrish-3, Hrithik Roshan said - "When I read the script, the villain's role looked very exciting. Since I've already played the positive guy, I thought I could play the villain this time around. But Rakesh Roshan, the film's producer and director, was firm that he could never play villain."
