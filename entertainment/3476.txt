Taapsee Pannu, who was recently trolled for posting pictures of herself in a bikini, said suddenly wearing bikini has become against Indian culture. "In olden times...actresses used to wear really small blouses, bikini blouses and people used to worship (them)," she added. Taapsee further said, "I believe if you have the body to wear a bikini...go ahead and flaunt it."
