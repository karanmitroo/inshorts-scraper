Filmmaker Omung Kumar has said the tag 'item number' degrades the meaning and purpose of a song. Referring to the Sunny Leone starrer song 'Trippy Trippy' from his film 'Bhoomi', he added, "It's an integral part of the plot...It's not just another song." Omung further said the song is not insensitive to women and doesn't objectify them.
