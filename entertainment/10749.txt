Actress Shilpa Shetty believes that George Orwell's novel 'Animal Farm' teaches children how to "love and care about animals". However, 'Animal Farm' is an allegorical satire about the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Shilpa made the comments while discussing ICSE's announcement on the inclusion of books like the Harry Potter, Tintin and Asterix series in the school syllabus.
