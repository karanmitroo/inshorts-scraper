Following Model Meghna Patelâ€™s stripping move in support of Narendra Modi, actress Tanisha Singh has now stripped (half) for Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi. The small time actor has taped a picture of Rahul Gandhi to cover her frontal assets. The trend of stripping to show their support for the someone, was started by Poonam Pandey in 2011.
