Actor Farhan Akhtar has said that it took fashion photographer Dabboo Ratnani six years to convince him to pose topless. "Every single time he would say to do it, I would always come and put something on. I am like, 'I can't, I don't want to do it'," said Farhan. The shot featured in Dabboo's calendar this year.
