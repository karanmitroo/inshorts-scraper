Katrina Kaif, who is in Srinagar to shoot for Fitoor, has been provided three-tier security cover. Other vehicles were not allowed at Nishat Bagh when she arrived there, Friday, and half of the garden was closed for the common people. The shooting area was surrounded by CRPF and J&K police. Fitoor is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations.
