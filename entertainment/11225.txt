Actor Jackie Shroff will reportedly play the role of Sanjay Dutt's father Sunil Dutt, in the upcoming Rajkumar Hirani's biopic on Sanjay. "It's a difficult role. I'll try not to look like him... (but) follow his mannerisms," the 59-year-old actor said. While Shroff confirmed he has done a look test for the role, he reportedly hasn't signed the film yet.
