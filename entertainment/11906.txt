Actress Sonam Kapoor has revealed that she and Kareena Kapoor did not get the kind of money for their upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding' that actors John Abraham and Varun Dhawan got for 'Dishoom'. "[A]s a woman in the industry, I don't get my price... There is a lot of sexism in the society which is disgusting," added Sonam.
