The first look of Neil Nitin Mukesh as Sanjay Gandhi from Madhur Bhandarkar's 'Indu Sarkar' has surfaced online. According to sources, prosthetic make-up experts were flown in from abroad and it took six months to perfect Neil's look. The film is based on the 21-month long Emergency period from 1975 to 1977, declared by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
