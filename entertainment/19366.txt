While participating in a discussion in the Maharashtra legislative council on Friday, senior BJP leader Vinod Tawde alleged that actor Sanjay Dutt is being provided rum and beer every day in prison. Tawde alleged some police officers for helping the convicted actor. Criminals do not fear the law as they can get every other facility in jail, claimed Tawde.
