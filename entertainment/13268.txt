Kerala Women’s Commission has issued a notice to actor Mammootty and makers of the Malayalam film ‘Kasaba’ over some scenes and dialogues as they allegedly contain derogatory portrayal of women. "Actors like him should desist from enacting such scenes,” stated the commission. Mammootty in 'Kasaba' tells a junior cop that he could stop a woman's menstrual cycle whenever he wants.
