TV actor Rahul Mahajan and Dimpy, who in 2010 became the first couple in India to marry on reality TV, have filed for divorce by mutual consent. The couple sought to skip the mandatory counselling of six-month but their plea was rejected on Thursday. This is the second divorce of Rahul, the first being with his childhood sweetheart Shweta Singh.
