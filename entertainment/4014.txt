The USA Olympic team's Twitter handle posted a tweet inquiring about Game of Thrones character Night King's contact information to recruit him as a javelin thrower. Reacting to the Team USA's tweet, a user tweeted, "The Night King should be in the Avengers instead of the Hawkeye". "Just look at him. He's obviously Canadian," tweeted another user.
