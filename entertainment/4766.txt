Ken Sturdy, a 97-year-old war veteran who survived the battle of Dunkirk during World War II, attended the premiere of Christopher Nolan's film 'Dunkirk' in Calgary, Canada. "I was 20 when that happened, but watching the movie, I could see my old friends again and a lot of them died later in the war," said Ken.
