Abhishek Bachchan has said that the 'super-stardom' of his father Amitabh Bachchan is unachievable and that he doesn't aspire to attain the same. "He (Amitabh) comes once in a lifetime, that's it. It is better to accept and move on. He is like Sun... Make your own minuscule space under the Sun," Abhishek added.
