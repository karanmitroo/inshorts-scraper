Actor Kamal Haasan has said that he hopes the government and police would clarify on allegations of cops committing arson during the violence that erupted on Monday in Chennai and parts of TN. This comes after a video on social media showed a man dressed in police uniform setting an auto-rickshaw on fire during the violence around the Jallikattu protests.
