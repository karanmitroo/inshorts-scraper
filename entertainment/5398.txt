Actress Ratna Pathak Shah has said that the Censor Board came out looking very silly in the entire controversy around Lipstick Under My Burkha. The film was initially refused certification by the Censor Board for being lady-oriented, but was later cleared with FCAT's support. Ratna, who stars in the film, added that the controversy brought attention to the film's theme.
