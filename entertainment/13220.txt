Actor Daniel Radcliffe, best known for his role as 'Harry Potter', has published poems under the pen name Jacob Gershon. The pseudonym used by Radcliffe combines his middle name and the Jewish version of his mother's maiden name, Gresham. Four poems written by the actor when he was 19 have been published under the pseudonym in an underground fashion magazine.
