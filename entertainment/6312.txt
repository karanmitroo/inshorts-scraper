Neerja's co-producer Atul Kasbekar has said his production company Bling Unplugged offered its share of profits to late flight attendant Neerja Bhanot's family and the Neerja Bhanot Trust. "They have declined to accept the same and now wish to get a share of the studio profits," added Kasbekar. Neerja's family reportedly sent legal notice to makers over the profit-sharing dispute.
