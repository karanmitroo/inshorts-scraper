Richa Chadha, while talking about sexual harassment said, "I'd like the media to carry a consistent campaign against sexual harassment... and not just discuss it...when it's a 'trending' topic." "Men...need to recognise the privilege they have...they can wear what they want...go wherever they want, hang out with who they want without anyone questioning their character," she added.
