Famous poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar has said that Urdu language is a progressive secular dialect and is not related to any religion. "Islamic culture is a misnomer. Religions don't have a culture but, societies have... So, I believe there is nothing like an Islamic Culture," Akhtar said. "Urdu has no connection with any religion... it's anti-religion," he added.
