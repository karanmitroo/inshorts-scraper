Actor Ranveer Singh has said that he is a big trash talker and sometimes even in formal engagements, he is not able to control his verbal diarrhoea. He said this while talking about Bollywood actors and their banter over watching football matches. He added, "Abhishek Bachchan and Arjun Kapoor are both big Chelsea fans...so, we go back and forth bantering."
