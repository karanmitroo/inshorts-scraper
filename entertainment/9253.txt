Animal welfare organisation PETA India has issued a "wholehearted apology" to Tamil actor Suriya as the organisation had earlier called the actor's support for Jallikattu a publicity stunt for promoting his film 'Singam 3'. The organisation added that Suriya plays an honest, dutiful police officer in 'Singam' so he should understand why upholding laws on preventing animal cruelty is important.
