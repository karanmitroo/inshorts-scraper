Actor Arbaaz Khan has said that while it was fun to appear on the television show 'Koffee With Karan', there is no need for people to take everything he said on the show seriously. "Whatever we talked about on the show, most of it were jokes and some of it was true but nothing on a serious note," added Arbaaz.
