Will Smith has said as a black person, it was bizarre for him to play a racist character in the upcoming film 'Bright'. "As a black dude, you don't get a lot of movies where you're a racist. It's rugged and powerful," he added. Directed by David Ayer, 'Bright' is set in a world where humans coexist with fairy-tale creatures.
