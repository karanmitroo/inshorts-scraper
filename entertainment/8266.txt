Rishi Kapoor has said that if trolls write shit to him, he abuses them via direct message and blocks them. This comes after three women accused Kapoor of sending abusive messages on Twitter, after they responded to his tweet about what him and Karan Johar have in common. Rishi added that he'll give it back if trolls mess with him.
