The team of upcoming supernatural psychological horror film 'Rings' staged a prank at an appliance store in New York, where the televisions were set up to play the trailer of 'Rings'. A  compartment was hidden behind one of the televisions, from where an actress dressed up like the character 'Samara' emerged to scare customers. 'Rings' will release on February 3.
