Actor Pankaj Tripathi has said that people come and tell him that they loved his films and then ask him his name. "Naam mein kya hai? People can forget your name, but if you excel at what you do, at least someone will remember you," added Pankaj. He is known for his films like 'Gangs of Wasseypur', 'Fukrey', among others.
