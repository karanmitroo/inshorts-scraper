'Visaranai', India's official entry to the Oscars 2017, has failed to make it to the Best Foreign Language Film category's new shortlist for the 89th Academy Awards. While 85 films had originally been considered in the category, the list has now been trimmed down to only nine films. 'Visaranai' was the ninth Tamil film to be selected for the Oscars.
