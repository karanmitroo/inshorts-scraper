Hollywood actress Gal Gadot was five months pregnant, while shooting parts of her film 'Wonder Woman'. The costume department had to cut a section out of the front of her costume and replace it with green cloth for altering it during post-production. "On wide shots I looked very funny, like Wonder Woman pregnant with Kermit the Frog," revealed Gadot.
