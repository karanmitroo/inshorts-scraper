Choreographer Shiamak Davar has said that there is no other dancer like actor Govinda. He added, "His expressions are the best thing to watch. Like Madhuri Dixit, Govinda is also an expression master." Shiamak, who has choreographed songs for numerous Hindi films, has trained actors including Shahid Kapoor, Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Aishwarya Rai at his dance academy.
