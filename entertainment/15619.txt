Actor Aamir Khan on Wednesday took to Facebook to say that he would be "happy to work" with actress Sunny Leone. Aamir's remarks came after an interview of the latter went viral on social media, with the interviewer being criticised for asking her "insulting" questions. "I have absolutely no problems with your "past", as the interviewer puts it", Aamir added.
