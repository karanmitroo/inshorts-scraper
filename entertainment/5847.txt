Music composer Anu Malik, while talking about the film Border completing twenty years, said, "Whenever I am at the airport, I always...get a hug from the security personnel present at security check." He said the security personnel tell him how they loved Border's songs. Anu added, "To get such recognition and love from the armed forces is the biggest compliment."
