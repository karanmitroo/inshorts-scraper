Ian McKellen, who starred in the 'X-Men' and 'The Lord of the Rings' series, has said there've been actresses who offered to sleep with directors for roles. He revealed that in the early sixties, the director he was working with showed him photographs he got from aspiring actresses with the words 'directors' rights respected' at the bottom of the photos.
