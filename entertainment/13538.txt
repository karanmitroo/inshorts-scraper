The Supreme Court on Tuesday admitted the Maharashtra government’s appeal challenging the Bombay High Court’s verdict acquitting actor Salman Khan in the 2002 hit-and-run case. However, the court refused to fast-track the hearing. In December 2015, the HC had acquitted Khan saying that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges of him killing a man while driving.
