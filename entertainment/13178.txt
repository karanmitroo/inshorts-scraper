Actress Jennifer Aniston got emotional while addressing a fan's question at Italy's Giffoni Film Festival. The actress was asked if she woke up in the morning and didn’t recognise who she really was. Aniston admitted that she has faced such a moment several times while adding, "Will I survive?... You just go, ‘I can’t, yes I can, yes you can'."
