American DJ duo The Chainsmokers has been slammed for making a racist dog-eating joke, when band member Alex Pall joked about not bringing his dog to China. He was asked by a Chinese interviewer if he brings his dog on tours with him. "The Chainsmokers just gonna be racist towards Asians while they're in Asia," tweeted a user.
