Actor Sanjay Dutt continues to remain in prison for the third night since he was granted a 30-day parole on Dec-6, as he is yet to comply with his parole conditions and furnish a surety. Last time when he was released, his sister stood surety for him, but this time it is not clear who the surety will be.
