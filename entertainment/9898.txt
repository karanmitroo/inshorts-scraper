Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor cited the example of former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes, who named his daughter 'India', to justify the name of Kareena Kapoor's son Taimur. "You caught it right! Thank you Jonty Rhodes for that. Only parents have the right to name their kids whatever," tweeted the veteran actor, while sharing a picture of the Rhodes family.
