Veteran actress Geeta Kapoor, who acted in 1972 film 'Pakeezah', has claimed that her son Raja abandoned her in a hospital. "He used to beat me up...He'd give me food once in four days, and sometimes, even lock me up," said Geeta. According to the doctor, Raja left the hospital saying he's going to get money but didn't return.
