Actor Rishi Kapoor, while talking about his meeting with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in 1988, said that he did not think there was anything wrong about it. "By that time, he had not gone against our country, at least not done something as grave as he did later," added Rishi, referring to the 1993 Mumbai blasts.
