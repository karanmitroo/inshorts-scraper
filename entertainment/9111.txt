On the completion of 12 years of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'Black' on Saturday, actor Amitabh Bachchan revealed that he did not take any salary to work in the project. "I had just wanted to work with Sanjay, after seeing all other works he had done... Just being a part of such an enterprise was sufficient fees," wrote Bachchan.
