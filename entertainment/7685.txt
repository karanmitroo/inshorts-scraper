Actress Taapsee Pannu has revealed that she lost out on a few films in South India because she was too fair and the people there did not relate this (fair) complexion to a girl-next-door. Taapsee said, "I have never used a fairness cream in my life.... when I started working, I found that being fair has actually backfired for me."
