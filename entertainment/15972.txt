The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a petition challenging actor Salman Khan's bail granted by the Bombay High Court in the 2002 hit-and-run case. Sushila Patil, mother of Ravinder Patil who was a key eye-witness in the case had filed the petition. While Salman was convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, his appeal against the verdict is ongoing.
