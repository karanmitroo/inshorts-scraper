The first look of Rajinikanth-starrer 'Kabali' was unveiled on social media on Wednesday. Rajinikanth can be seen sitting cross-legged on a couch, wearing a grey suit in one of the posters. In another poster, the actor is holding a chain, tying some goons with it. Rajinikanth will be seen playing a mafia don in 'Kabali', which will release next year.
