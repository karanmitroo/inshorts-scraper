Hollywood actress Anne Hathaway, who hosted the 83rd Academy Awards, is sure that Neil Patrick Harris will do a great job hosting the 87th Academy Awards this year. "He'll be great. He's a natural host," she said. "Do the opposite of what I did, and you'll be fine," Hathaway, who was criticized for her 2011 Oscar performance, advised Neil.
