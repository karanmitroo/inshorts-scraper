Miley Cyrus reportedly took a dig at Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video, which showcases Swift seeking vengeance against a former friend. Cyrus said, "I don't get the violence revenge thing. That's supposed to be a good example? And I'm a bad role model because I'm running around with my assets out? I'm not sure how they are worse than guns."
