UK's Prince Harry proposed to American actress Meghan Markle on one knee while they were cooking at his cottage at Kensington Palace earlier this month, the couple has revealed in a joint interview. "She didn't even let me finish, she said, 'can I say yes? can I say yes?' and then there were hugs," the Prince added.
