Lahore High Court on Tuesday lifted a ban on the airing of Indian television serials in Pakistan. The court stated that "the world has become a global village" while questioning for how long such "unreasonable restrictions" could be imposed. The court noted that instead of a blanket ban, Indian content with "objectionable" or "anti-Pakistan" content could still be censored.
