Hindu Makkal Katchi, a nationalistic Hindu party from Tamil Nadu, has called for a ban on the Tamil version of reality show Bigg Boss and wants the show's host actor Kamal Haasan to be arrested. The party's official statement read, "The participants are mouthing obscene statements and are acting 75% nude. It is also derogative of Tamil culture."
