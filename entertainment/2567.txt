Comedian-turned-actor Andy Dick has been fired from two movies after being accused of sexual misconduct and harassment on sets. Andy, who has been accused of groping people, non-consensual kissing and licking, said, "I didn't grope anybody. I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say good-bye and...licked them. That's my thing." He further said this is him being funny.
