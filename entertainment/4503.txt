Child Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) has revealed that the baby girl, who was adopted by actress Sunny Leone, had earlier been turned down by eleven prospective parents. "Without looking at colour, background and health status, Sunny Leone happily took the child in adoption," said CARA's CEO Lt Col Deepak Kumar. Leone had applied for adoption last year.
