Walt Disney Company on Saturday announced setting up 14-acre “Star Wars” lands at its California and Orlando parks. The new expansions will introduce a new planet from the intergalactic film-saga with two new rides where participants will take control of the Millennium Falcon spaceship, as well as the Cantina, the infamous hub of rogue smugglers and traders in the films.
