Director Anurag Basu has said that he cannot wait for actor Ranbir Kapoor to star in all his films, despite the duo's friendship. "There is a Kishore Kumar biopic, going on floors after 'Jagga Jasoos'. I am still unsure about the project as Ranbir has other films too. I might have to take some other actor for it," Basu said.
