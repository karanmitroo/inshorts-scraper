Miss World 2017 Manushi Chhillar, while reacting to Shashi Tharoor using her surname as a pun in a tweet against demonetisation, tweeted, "'Chillar' talk is just small change - let's not forget the 'chill' within Chhillar." She further wrote, "A girl who has just won the World isn't going to be upset over a tongue-in-cheek remark."
