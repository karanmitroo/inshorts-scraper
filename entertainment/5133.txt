Amitabh Bachchan has sent a legal notice to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas for using his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan's poem in a music video posted on YouTube. Vishwas deleted the video after Bachchan accused him of copyright infringement and sought damages from him. Vishwas claimed that the video was only meant to pay tribute to the poet.
