The villain in the upcoming film 'X-Men: Apocalypse’ has been compared to Lord Krishna, drawing criticism from Rajan Zed, a US-based Hindu leader. The trailer of the film features the villain saying, “I have been called many things over many lifetimes- Ra, Krishna, Yahweh". Zed has sought a deletion of all such scenes as they are "disturbing to the devotees".
