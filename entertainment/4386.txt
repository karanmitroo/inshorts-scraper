Ranbir Kapoor, while speaking about the upcoming biopic on Sanjay Dutt, said the makers aren't portraying a Gandhi like-character but a "very fraud man". "He's someone who is loved and disliked. He's the most controversial, and to have the ability to tell about your life so honestly, and to make a movie out of it is very brave," Ranbir added.
