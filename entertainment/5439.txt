Actor Gulshan Grover has said that after watching SS Rajamouli's 'Baahubali', he felt that he would've played the role of Kattappa better. He added, "There is certain physicality, panache and expression that are required for such roles and I have all of them in me." Gulshan further said that actor Sathyaraj, who played the role, has done a decent job.
