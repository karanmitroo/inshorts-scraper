Comic company Marvel plans to launch a new series this fall titled ‘Moon-Girl and Devil Dinosaur.’ Aimed at encouraging gender diversity in its superheroes, the series will feature the adventures of pre-teen genius Lunella Lafayette and her 30-foot tall dinosaur friend. The concept for this reportedly comes from the short-lived Devil Dinosaur comic, penned by Jack Kirby in 1978.
