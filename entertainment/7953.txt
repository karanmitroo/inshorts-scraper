Actor Kamal Haasan took to Twitter to post a message after the demise of his elder brother Chandrahasan (82) on Saturday night. "He was a friend, philosopher, brother and a good father. I've failed to fulfil even half of his dreams that he had for me," wrote Haasan. Notably, Chandrahasan was in charge of Kamal's home production Raajkamal Films International.
