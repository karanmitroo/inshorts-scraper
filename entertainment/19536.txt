Delhi High Court has ordered certain words to be deleted from the song 'Party all night', sung by rapper Honey Singh in the movie 'Boss' starring Akshay Kumar and Sonakshi Sinha. The censor board, in agreement with the HC, stated that it too found the lyrics vulgar and had asked the producer to remove them.
