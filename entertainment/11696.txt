Michael Jackson has topped Forbes' annual list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fourth consecutive year. The 'King of Pop', who died in 2009, raked in $825 million in earnings in the past year. Interestingly, the cumulative earnings of the next twelve celebrities on the list, which included Bob Marley and Elvis Presley, were less than one-third of Jackson's earnings.
