Actress Twinkle Khanna has said that she is "troll proof" while sharing a picture of herself with Salman Khan, in response to fans of Salman criticising her for her column. "I write social, political satire-will not examine an ant & spare an elephant because I fear getting trampled by the herd," wrote Twinkle in another tweet.
