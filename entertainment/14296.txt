Nurses of the Amritsar civil hospital on Monday staged a protest against ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’ for allegedly portraying their profession in a derogatory manner. “The show has objectified nurses", senior vice-president of the Staff Nurse Welfare Association said. The nurses also objected to the uniform worn by actress Rochelle Rao on the show, and demanded its cancellation.
