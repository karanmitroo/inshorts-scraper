Akshay Kumar starrer 'Baby' which hit the screens today, is as simplistic as its title, reports Indian Express. The film shows Akshay's most credible performance after a long time. However, the film is slower as an action flick and seems longer. 'Baby' has been rated 4/5 (Hindustan Times, Times of India) and 2/5 (NDTV, India Today and Indian Express).
