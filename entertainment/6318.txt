Actor Tom Cruise has confirmed that a sequel to his 1986 film Top Gun is "definitely happening". Cruise added, "It's true... I'm going to start filming it probably in the next year." Last year, producer Jerry Bruckheimer had tweeted a photo of himself with Cruise, where he wrote that he discussed Top Gun 2 with the actor.
