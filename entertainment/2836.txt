Arshad Warsi, who hosted the first season of the reality show 'Bigg Boss', has said that the contestants on the current eleventh season are tacky and the channel is consciously using nutcases to get TRPs. Arshad added, "People enjoy watching crass, and the channel is merely serving it...The audience wants to see dramatic people, those who fight, hit and abuse."
