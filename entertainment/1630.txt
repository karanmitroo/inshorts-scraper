Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has shared a picture of Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli and actress Anushka Sharma's wedding reception card. It includes a potted sapling, believed to be a metaphor for new beginnings and the recipient's name is embossed in golden letters on the packaging. "We pray that this love story goes on forever," wrote Mahesh alongside the picture.
