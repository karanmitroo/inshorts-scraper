Filmmaker Subhash Ghai, whose film 'Taal' completed 18 years on Sunday, said he had no idea the guy draping Aishwarya Rai in the song 'Kahin Aag Lage' was actor Shahid Kapoor. "I wanted a good-looking boy...So I asked for him," he added. Subhash further said, "Nor did I know he was going to become such a big star".
