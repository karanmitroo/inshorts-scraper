Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has defended director Kushan Nandy in the recent controversy where Chitrangada Singh reportedly refused to film an intimate scene with Siddiqui after a row with Nandy. â€œWe did a normal scene. There was nothing unacceptable about (it). The incident being described did not happen," said Siddiqui. Further, he called Nandy "a gentleman, incapable of crass behaviour".
