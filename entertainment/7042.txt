The divorce of actor Farhan Akhtar and his estranged wife Adhuna Bhabani was finalised on Monday. The custody of their two daughters Shakya and Akira will remain with Adhuna, while Farhan will have the rights to access them whenever he wants. Farhan and Adhuna, who got married in 2000, announced their separation in January last year.
