Photographer Kayla Glover from Chicago recently did a Harry-Potter themed photoshoot of her four-month-old daughter. The look was complete with a cauldron, glasses, a wand and a Gryffindor scarf. Kayla, who had been planning the shoot before her child was born, said, "I knew whether I had a boy or a girl I would be using this theme".
