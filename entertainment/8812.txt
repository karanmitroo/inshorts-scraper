In a recent interview, Shahid Kapoor said that he hopes his daughter Misha can enjoy life like a normal child. He added, "That's the only wish I have for her...but everyone talks about her so much that you get worried about her having to deal with that baggage." Misha, born in August 2016, is Shahid and wife Mira's first child.
