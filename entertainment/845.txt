Rajput group Karni Sena's chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi on Wednesday said India will burn if the release of 'Padmaavat' is not banned. Stating that the violence over the film is "sad and wrong", Kalvi added that no one can stop the protests. This comes after protesters set fire to vehicles in Haryana and Gujarat during protests against Padmaavat's release.
