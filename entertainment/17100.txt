Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has set the Guinness World Record for taking the most selfies in 3 minutes by snapping 105 selfies. The Rock set the record at the premier of his movie, San Andreas, in London on Thursday. He took much more than 105 selfies but some were disqualified for being blurry or cutting off his face.
