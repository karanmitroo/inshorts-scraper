Veteran actor Dilip Kumar, who was admitted to Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital on Wednesday, has been shifted to the ICU as he has suffered from kidney failure. The doctors treating the 94-year-old actor said that given his age, his rising creatinine levels which are adversely affecting his kidneys, is a serious matter. Last year, the veteran actor had been hospitalised twice.
