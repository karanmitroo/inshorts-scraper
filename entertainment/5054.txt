Music composer AR Rahman's sister AR Raihanah said she didn't see anyone leaving his Wembley concert in UK which was held on July 8. This comes after fans slammed Rahman on Twitter for performing Tamil songs during the concert. She further said that Rahman performed songs in Hindi and added, "We should think as Indians. We should think beyond boundaries."
