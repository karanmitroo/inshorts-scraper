Twinkle Khanna on Twitter denied reports of her being upset with the team of the Akshay Kumar starrer film 'Padman'. Reports suggested that Twinkle, who's also the film's producer, was upset as the production team couldn't keep the budget in check, due to which she owes money to creditors. The film also stars Radhika Apte and Sonam Kapoor.
