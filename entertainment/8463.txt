A video showing deleted scenes, including a topless scene of Swara Bhaskar, from the final cut of her upcoming film 'Anaarkali of Aarah' was leaked online. "I now fear the entire film might be leaked online before the release," said director Avinash Das. The leaked video features three scenes, which were cut by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).
