As per reports, actor Fawad Khan who has been in Pakistan as his wife is pregnant, may not return in October to promote his Bollywood film 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' (ADHM). His decision could reportedly be owing to the 48-hour ultimatum given by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to Pakistani artistes working in India to leave the country following Uri attack.
