Filmmaker Karan Johar has said that Alia Bhatt is his second daughter and third child. Responding to this, Alia joked that she would play Johar's mother Hiroo if a biopic was being made on the filmmaker. Johar said that she should play his childhood bestie Twinkle Khanna and not his mother in the biopic as Alia wasn't "Sindhi enough".
