The blue pinafore dress that actor Judy Garland wore in “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sold for $1.56 million in a Bonhams Hollywood memorabilia auction in New York on Monday. The dress reportedly was one of the two Garland wore while shooting the film and had her sweat-stains on the neck. Bonhams had estimated it between $800,000 and $1.2 million.
