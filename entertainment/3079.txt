Actor Jared Leto will star as late Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine, in an upcoming biopic. The film's director Brett Ratner said, "Jared is an old friend...he told me, 'I want to play him.' And I really believe Jared can do it." However, Leto's meeting with Hefner failed to take place as the latter passed away.
