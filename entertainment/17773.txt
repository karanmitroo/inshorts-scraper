A book based on Michael Jackson's late former manager Frank DiLeo, who passed away in 2011, reveals that MJ underwent painful plastic surgery because he didn't want to look like his father. According to Michael, his father had abused him when he was a kid. The book has been written using DiLeo's personal journals and audio-video recordings.
