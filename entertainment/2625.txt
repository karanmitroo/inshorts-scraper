The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a petition seeking a ban on the movie 'Mersal', saying people can refrain from watching the film if they don't like it. "It is only a film and not real life. Freedom of expression is for all," the court added. The advocate seeking the ban claimed it "shows India in a poor light".
