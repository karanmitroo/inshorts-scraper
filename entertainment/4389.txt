Akshay Kumar, while at an event, read a part of a Facebook post by a woman from Chandigarh, who was stalked by Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala's son Vikas Barala and his friend. She had written, "Ladies please be proactive about your own safety. Note the number of any vehicle that tries to harass you, don't be afraid to call...cops."
