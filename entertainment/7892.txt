Sanjay Dutt has suffered a hairline rib fracture while shooting a fight sequence, with a group of 19-20 men, for his film 'Bhoomi'. Dutt got injured when a jump went wrong as the scene, which is the film's climax, was being shot in Chambal. While Dutt has been advised to rest, he has continued shooting, taking rest only during breaks.
