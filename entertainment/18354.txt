A UK metal band 'The Defiled' has made history, by playing world's first live gig on a floating iceberg, located in the middle of the Greenland Sea. The musicians performed in freezing temperature and on fast flowing ice. The small crowd came to watch this once-in-a-lifetime gig from fishing boats from the nearby town of Kulusuk (Greenland).
