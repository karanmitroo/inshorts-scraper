Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma-starrer 'Bombay Velvet' that released on Friday has "earnest performances, but cliched storytelling," said Hindustan Times. The Anurag Kashyap directorial, also featuring film-maker Karan Johar, "...is grandeur yet doesn't match up to the expectations one had from it," said India Today. It has been rated 3/5 (HT, India Today), 2.5/5 (NDTV) and 2/5 (Indian Express).
