Filmmaker Nagesh Kukunoor's film 'Dhanak', which released on Friday, "actually manages to kind of temporarily transport you to a magical place where hopes don't die", wrote Mid-Day. NDTV called it a film which "artfully coaxes the audience to believe in miracles" while Times of India called it a "half-baked story". It was rated 3.5/5 (Mid-Day), 4/5 (NDTV) and 3/5 (TOI).
