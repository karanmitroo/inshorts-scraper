'Lipstick Under My Burkha' will be the opening film at the 17th edition of the New York Indian Film Festival, the oldest Indian film festival in the US. The Konkona Sen Sharma and Ratna Pathak Shah-starrer film explores the sexual encounters of four women. Notably, India's Censor Board has refused to certify the film, claiming the story was too "lady-oriented".
