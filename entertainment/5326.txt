Producer Siddharth Roy Kapur has said the Tamil Nadu government's decision to levy 30% entertainment tax alongside the 28% GST will leave the Tamil film industry commercially unviable. "This move... will... defeat the very purpose of introducing GST as a progressive 'One Nation One Tax' regime," he added. Theatres across TN have been shut in protest against the decision.
