The Johnny Depp and Mia Wasikowska starrer 'Alice Through the Looking Glass', which released on Friday, is "different" only because of "fascinating characters", wrote Indian Express. Hindustan Times called the film "simply a lavish, effects-laden fantasy adventure" while Mid-Day wrote that it "has little that's above ordinary". It was rated 2/5 (Indian Express, Mid-Day) and  2.5/5 (HT).
