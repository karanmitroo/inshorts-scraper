The release of the controversial Punjabi movie "Kaum de Heere", that allegedly glorifies the assassins of former PM Indira Gandhi, was barred by the I&B Ministry on Thursday. The movie is based on the lives of assassins-Kehar Singh, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh. Incidentally, all the three have been given the status of "martyrs" by the Akal Takht Sahib.
