A senior spokesperson of Karni Sena's unit in Chittorgarh has claimed that over 1,900 women have signed up for 'Jauhar'. This comes after the Supreme Court rejected pleas by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh seeking a modification of its order which lifted the ban on 'Padmaavat' in four states. "People... are disheartened with the verdict of the court," the spokesperson added.
