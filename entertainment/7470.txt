Actress Vidya Balan has revealed that in her early days in Bollywood, photographers pushed her aside once to click actor Aamir Khan, which hurt her ego. She added, "When I reached home... I realised he has done a lot many good films...and is a well-known star. The moment I realised this, I was perfectly normal."
