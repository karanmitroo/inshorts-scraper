The Akshay Kumar starrer film 'Rustom', which hit the theatres on Friday, is "an intriguing film for sure", wrote Hindustan Times. "When the film shifts to the fight in the court, and turns into a procedural, it becomes flat-out dull", wrote Indian Express. The film has been rated 3/5 (Hindustan Times, Mid-day and TOI) and 1.5/5 (Indian Express).
