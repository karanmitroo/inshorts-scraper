While speaking about the protests over Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial 'Padmavati', producer-photographer Atul Kasbekar said, "Why did this become religious? Is your God so vulnerable? Mine isn't!" "If you have a problem with the subject or the film, do not watch it," added Atul. He further said that Padmavati is essentially a fictitious character.
