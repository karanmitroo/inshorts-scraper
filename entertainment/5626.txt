The co-producer of Wonder Woman Jon Berg has revealed that along with the film's director Patty Jenkins, he's already planning "to make another great Wonder Woman film". "Patty and I are writing the treatment right now. I had a blast making it with Patty the first time. We've got a cool idea for the second one," added Berg.
