Self-styled critic Kamaal R Khan called actor Salman Khan a 'lallu' in his review of the trailer of 'Tubelight'. He added that though Salman is acting like a joker in 'The Radio Song', the song is nice and credits music composer Pritam for the same. Towards the end of his review, KRK claims the film will earn about â‚¹150-200 crore.
