Filmmaker JA Bayona has confirmed that there will be a 'Jurassic World' trilogy. Bayona took over as the director for the 'Jurassic Park' film series from Colin Trevorrow, who directed 'Jurassic World' (2015). "I grew up watching Steven Spielberg movies and I love those movies and the legacy, so itâ€™s a question of being truthful to the legacy," said Bayona.
