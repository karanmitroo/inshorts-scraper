Filmmaker Kabir Khan has denied reports of approaching Deepika Padukone to play a Chinese character in Tubelight. He added, "In today's age, you can access actors around the world. Why would you take an Indian actor, especially an actor of Deepika's stature and make her play a Chinese character?" Notably, Chinese actress Zhu Zhu stars in Tubelight.
