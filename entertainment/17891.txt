Katrina Kaif has reportedly fired her make-up man Subhash Singh for turning up late to her shoot. Subhash had been working as Katrina's make-up man for the past 11 years. According to a source, "Santosh got stuck because of unfavourable weather conditions." However, Katrina said, "He didn't show up at Anurag Basu's shoot as he had taken a job elsewhere."
