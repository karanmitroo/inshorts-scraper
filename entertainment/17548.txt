Sonakshi Sinha won the worst actor (female) award (for Action Jackson) for the third straight year at the Golden Kela Awards, Saturday. The worst actor (male) was conferred upon Arjun Kapur for Gunday and 'Everything else', while the worst film went to Humshakals. The Golden Kela Awards, in its 7th year now, is a tongue-in-cheek effort to curb Bollywood's mediocrity.
