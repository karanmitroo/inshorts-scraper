Choreographer-filmmaker Farah Khan, while commenting on an Instagram picture of Chunky Panday's daughter Ananya Panday, jokingly wrote, "Do a DNA test please... she's too lovely to be Chunky's child." The picture was shared by Chunky's wife Bhavana Pandey. While Farah is Chunky's family friend, their common friends are said to have considered her comment in bad taste.
