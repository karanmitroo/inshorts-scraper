The Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy (KCA) has announced plans to restore and digitise over 1,500 classic Kannada films. The academy has proposed that a ₹5 charge be levied on tickets for other language films released in Karnataka to fund the ₹6-crore project. While over 3,000 Kannada films have been released so far, copies of only 500 films are available.
