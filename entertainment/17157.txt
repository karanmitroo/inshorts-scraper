Harry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns and Ned Flanders, is leaving the animated TV series 'The Simpsons' after more than 25 years following a dispute with producers. The show will go on and the actor's character will be recast, executive producer Jean said. “This because I wanted what we've always had: the freedom to do other work,” Harry tweeted.
