Justin Bieber forgot lyrics to his own song Despacito during a recent performance in New York. Justin made up his own lyrics and sang, "I don't know the words so I say burrito, I don't know the words so I say Dorito." At one point he passed the mic to the audience and said, "Come on, you know the words."
