Speaking about rumours of a fight with Alia Bhatt, Jacqueline Fernandez said she felt very hurt by such reports. "Sometimes, I feel the only thing I get written about is that I'm dating someone or that I'm in a catfight," she added. Jacqueline further said, "We're working hard, and running our...houses on our own. I wish [journalists] would grow up."
