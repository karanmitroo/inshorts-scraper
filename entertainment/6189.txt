A man claiming to be Parineeti Chopra's classmate from her school in Ambala posted on Facebook that she was lying at a recent event when she said that she used to cycle to school as she was poor. He wrote, "Shame...coming from a privileged background and lying...I guess this is what being a celebrity means. Create a fabricated sob story."
