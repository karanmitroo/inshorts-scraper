Essel group chairman Subhash Chandra on Twitter said he was "saddened" to see youth "smoking, drinking wine and dancing" at the Coldplay concert. "My question (is) do they also know Rabinder Sangeet & other cultural Aspects & Indian art forms," tweeted Chandra. He further stated it's "high time we make our own cultural heritage cool" for our youth.
