Filmmaker Sajid Khan has said Amitabh Bachchan is the most gifted comedian of all time. "He ended the run of the comedians in films when a mainstream actor (like him) started doing comedy. He's the finest comedian as a superstar," he added. Sajid further said Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh are also talented comic actors who can pull off anything.
