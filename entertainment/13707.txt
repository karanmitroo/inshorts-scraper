Filmmaker Deepak Tijori has said that the sequel for 'Tom Dick and Harry' will be a "clean family comedy". Tijori said, "The original film had a lot of sexual innuendos in it, but this time we are avoiding that." The 2006 film starred Dino Morea as deaf, Jimmy Shergill as mute and Anuj Sawhney as a blind man.
