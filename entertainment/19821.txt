Michael Jackson spent nearly $35-million to cover up his crimes after he molested at least 24-boys, according to a Sunday People report published Saturday, which says it has obtained "secret FBI files" that feature private investigators' reports, phone transcripts and audio tapes. The report portrays Jackson as a serial molester and child porn addict. Calls to the FBI went unreturned.
