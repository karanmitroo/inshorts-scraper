Parineeti Chopra has said she'd be lying if she said the ₹100 crore benchmark doesn't matter. "It matters to every actor. It just shows how audiences are accepting you, how much they love you," she added. Parineeti, whose recently released film 'Golmaal Again' earned over ₹200 crore in India, further said, "I'm loving the feeling that I have right now."
