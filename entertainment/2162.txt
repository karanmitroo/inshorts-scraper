Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya has said that Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati' won't be allowed to release in the state until objectionable scenes are removed from the film. Various Rajput communities and political leaders have been protesting against the film on the grounds that it distorts historical facts and demeans the Rajput queen Padmavati.
