Actress Anushka Sharma has said that the word feminism has been corrupted a lot. "A feminist is either a male or female who believes in equal rights for men and women. People have forgotten that definition and look at feminists as an anti-men brigade," she added. She further said that nobody should be discriminated against on the basis of anything.
