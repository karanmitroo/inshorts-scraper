Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has reportedly listed his four-story mansion in the Santa Croce area of Venice, Italy for $10.8 million. Depp bought the mansion five years ago for $13 million, reportedly outbidding an Arabian prince. The 17th century Palazzo Dona Sangiantoffetti, which overlooks the Grand Canal, has nine bathrooms, seven bedrooms and a private dock for boats.
