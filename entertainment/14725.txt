US President Barack Obama has received advanced copies of 'Game of Thrones' season six, creators of the show David Benioff and DB Weiss revealed. "When the commander-in-chief says, ‘I want to see advance episodes,’ what are you gonna do?”, Benioff said. Last month, HBO confirmed that, for the first time, critics and reviewers wouldn’t receive early copies of the episodes.
