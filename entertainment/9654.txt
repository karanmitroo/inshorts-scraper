Karan Johar, while talking about Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri's son AbRam, said, "He is like a toy that you want to own." Johar added, "I have that maternal and paternal feeling - I feel it for Gauri and SRK's kids." He further shared how when AbRam visited Dharma Productions, his staff behaved as if actor Brad Pitt had arrived.
