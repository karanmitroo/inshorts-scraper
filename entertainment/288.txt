Anand L Rai has revealed a producer told him if he made the character 'Manu' in 'Tanu Weds Manu' a little macho, he could get Rai a bigger star than Madhavan. "There was a temptation to get a bigger star," he added. However, Rai further said he didn't change the cast as he didn't want to change the film's story.
