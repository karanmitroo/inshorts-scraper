Late singer Michael Jackson's daughter Paris has revealed that she was sexually assaulted by a much older "complete stranger" when she was 14. "It was not a good experience at all, and it was really hard for me, and, at the time, I didn't tell anybody," said Paris. She also spoke about how she tried to commit suicide at 15.
