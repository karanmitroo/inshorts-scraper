Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has demolished an illegal 2,000 square feet canteen used by employees of Shah Rukh Khan's production house Red Chillies. The studio had blocked access to an open terrace and set up the canteen, said officials. Red Chillies stated, "It's not an operational canteen...The part which the BMC has demolished are the energy-saving solar panels."
