Actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson on Monday confirmed that he will portray the fictional character 'Doc Savage' in the adaptation of the character by Sony Pictures. "Doc Savage is... the inspiration for Superman. Can't wait to sink my teeth into this one of a kind character," said Johnson. The character first appeared in American pulp magazines in 1930s and 1940s.
