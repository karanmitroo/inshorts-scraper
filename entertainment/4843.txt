Director Jaideep Varma wrote a Facebook post slamming Saif Ali Khan, wherein he said, "Saif is everything...obnoxious about Bollywood...stupid, uncultured...yet highly entitled." He claimed that Saif asked him to write a script and didn't respond to him after the script's completion. "Saif has never...displayed his father's grace or pioneering intelligence or his mother's talent," added Jaideep.
