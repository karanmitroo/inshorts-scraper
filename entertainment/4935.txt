Taapsee Pannu has said there's an obsession with the female body everywhere. She added, "Do I need to name...songs in Bollywood that have some weird obsessions? It's not just there (in the southern film industry)." Taapsee was recently bashed for her remark "what is so sensuous about hitting a girl on her midriff", directed at Telugu filmmaker K Raghavendra Rao.
