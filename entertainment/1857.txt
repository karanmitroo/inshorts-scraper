Actress Sanya Malhotra, who is set to star opposite Ayushmann Khurrana in the upcoming film 'Badhaai Ho!', has said, "It won't be anything rigorous. Thankfully, I am not wrestling in this one." The film will be a "coming-of-age story of a family as it grapples with some unexpected news," as per Bollywood trade analyst Taran Adarsh.
