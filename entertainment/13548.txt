According to reports, Indian sitcom 'Sarabhai vs Sarabhai' will come back as a web series. "[N]one of us wanted a never-ending TV series but a shorter term online was a good idea. Once I return from my vacation, I will finalise the script and we will move on from there", JD Majethia, the producer, was quoted as saying.
