Hindi film 'Pakeezah' starring "tragedy queen" Meena Kumari, who was born on August 1, 1932, took nearly fourteen years to complete due to differences between Meena and her husband and director Kamal Amrohi. The film was a flop at the time of release in 1972. However, it went on to become a hit after Meena's death on March 31, 1972.
