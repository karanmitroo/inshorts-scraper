Singer Neha Bhasin said that she hopes the trend of actors singing for films dies out soon. She added, "You can only judge how well they sing if they do so without a machine which doesn't happen most of the time. The songs are tuned...it's difficult to comment." Neha is known for songs like 'Dhunki' and 'Jag Ghoomeya', among others.
