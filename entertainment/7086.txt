Singer Sonu Nigam on Sunday took to Twitter to post a video of the early morning Azaan. In the video, which he captioned "Goodmorning India", the Azaan lasted for more than two minutes. Earlier, Nigam had said he is not a Muslim but still he is woken up by the Azaan every morning and called it "forced religiousness".
