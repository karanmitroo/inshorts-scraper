Calling it an 'honest confession', superstar Shah Rukh Khan on Wednesday tweeted that he and his 'Dilwale' co-star Kajol were the worst best dancers in the world. Replying to his tweet, Amitabh Bachchan termed himself as the 'worst' dancer. "I'll beat u at bad dancing. I'm a natural interpretive dancer and my form is called disaster," SRK said to Bachchan.
