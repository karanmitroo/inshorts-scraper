Siddharth-Garima, the writer duo who penned a song in 'Padmaavat', responded to the open letter by actress Swara Bhasker with a blog post titled 'An open letter to all Vaginas'. The letter read, "Why judge that day from 700 years ago with 'what would I do today'? It's a film based in the 13th century when women preferred...death to rape."
