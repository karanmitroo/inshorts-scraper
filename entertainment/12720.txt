Opening up on his split with ex-girlfriend Preeti Desai, actor Abhay Deol said that it is "harder" for actors to "hold on to relationships" as they are always under the public eye. "The desire to protect your relationship when you are open to public scrutiny is natural. There is too much guessing, speculations et al happening," Abhay added.
