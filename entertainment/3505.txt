Akshay Kumar has said television actors deserve to be paid more than film stars or at least the same as what film stars are paid. "They work much harder...They've to read 12-15 pages of script, which is given to them minutes back from the writer...There're several cameras monitoring you," he added. Akshay further said film actors do not value things.
