Former Bigg Boss contestant Om Swami has reportedly asked the makers of dance reality show 'Nach Baliye' why he can't dance alone and compete on the show.
"What if I don't have a baliye (partner)? I can totally dance alone and compete with your other contestants," said Swami. The dance reality show involves celebrity couples competing against each other.
