Taylor Swift's new music video "Wildest Dreams" has drawn flak for being racist as it portrays Africa as a backdrop for an entirely white-skinned cast. The video was released on Monday during the MTV Video Music Awards. The video depicts Swift as an early-20th-century movie star who falls in love with her co-star while filming a movie in Africa.
