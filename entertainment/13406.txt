Actor Shiney Ahuja has filed a case against the film 'Great Grand Masti' for reportedly naming the character of a maid after him. He has demanded that the makers take off the scenes featuring the character 'Shiney' and extend a written apology. Notably, the actor was convicted and jailed for raping his maid, who had later retracted her statement.
