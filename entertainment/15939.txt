Animated Hollywood film 'The Peanuts Movie' which released on Friday, is a sweet nostalgia that takes you back to childhood, wrote HT. Calling the film's 3D 'pointless' and narrative 'cute', Mid-Day added that the voicing done by child artists is a plus for greater attachment. The Steve Martino directorial has been rated 3.5/5 (Indian Express), 3/5 (HT) and 2.5/5 (Mid-Day).
