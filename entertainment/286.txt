'The Mummy' actor Brendan Fraser alleged that he was molested by former president of Hollywood Foreign Press Association Philip Berk, when he grabbed the actor's a** cheek at an event in 2003. Sharing details of how he was allegedly harassed by Berk, Fraser added, "I felt ill. I felt like a little kid... I thought I was going to cry."
