Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh on Tuesday requested the media and BJP MP Subramanian Swamy to stop speculating about the death of actress Sridevi. While Dubai media reports claimed that traces of alcohol were found in Sridevi's blood, Swamy said he believed that her death was a case of murder. Dubai Police said the actress died due to "accidental drowning".
