The Censor Board has reportedly removed a bra shot and a reference to comic book porn character 'Savita Bhabhi' before clearing the Katrina Kaif and Sidharth Malhotra starrer 'Baar Baar Dekho' with a 'U/A' certificate. The Board is said to have refused certification to the film until the 'offensive' bra shot was removed. The film will release on September 9.
