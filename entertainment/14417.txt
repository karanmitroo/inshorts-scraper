An early look of the upcoming film 'Fast and Furious 8' through behind-the-scenes footage during its shoot in Cuba last week has been released. Actor Vin Diesel introduced the film as one of "the first global Hollywood film" to be given permission for shooting in Cuba. Notably, the US resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this year.
