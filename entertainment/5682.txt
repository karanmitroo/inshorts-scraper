Actor Saif Ali Khan has said that Bollywood is incomplete without Karan Johar. Justifying his statement, Saif added, "Baahubali... Can you imagine our film industry without that? He (Johar) is one of those arteries in the blood flow of the film industry." Johar distributed the Hindi version of the Baahubali film series.
