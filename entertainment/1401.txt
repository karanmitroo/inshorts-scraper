John Abraham's photo from the 2008 film 'Dostana' has been used to promote a gay cruise in Mexico. Activist-author Nia Levy King shared the poster on Twitter, questioning whether the actor's image was being used with his permission. In 'Dostana', John and Abhishek Bachchan's characters pretended to be gay in order to share an apartment with Priyanka Chopra's character.
