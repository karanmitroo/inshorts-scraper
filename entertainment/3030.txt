At the sixth edition of the Khushwant Singh literary festival at Kasauli on Friday, author Shobhaa De said, "Sex is a threatening and terrifying three-letter word as is the three-letter word God." Claiming that both God and sex are used for achieving violent goals, she added, "Kama is a beautiful word, but Kamasutra is the biggest con ever."
