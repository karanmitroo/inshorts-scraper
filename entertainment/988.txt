Sunny Leone's statue will be unveiled at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in Delhi. The team from London's Madame Tussauds met Sunny in Mumbai, where they took over 200 specific measurements and photographs of the actor to create a life-like wax figure. "Madame Tussauds is a 'one-of-a-kind' attraction...I am so thrilled to be chosen for this incredible honour," said Sunny.
