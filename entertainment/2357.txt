Censor Board Chief Prasoon Joshi has said the film certification body respects filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali as an individual and artist. Earlier, Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) member Arjun Gupta had said Bhansali should be tried for treason. "It's unfortunate to see the personal point of view expressed by an advisory panel member of CBFC against Bhansali," added Prasoon.
