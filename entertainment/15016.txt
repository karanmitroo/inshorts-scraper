Retired wrestler Hulk Hogan was awarded $115 million in damages in an invasion of privacy lawsuit against gossip news site Gawker for publishing his sex tape. The verdict "represents a statement as to the publicâ€™s disgust with the invasion of privacy disguised as journalism," Hogan's lawyers said. However, Gawker Founder Nick Denton sought to overturn this verdict on appeal.
