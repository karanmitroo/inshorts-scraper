Lyricist Javed Akhtar has said that whether it is a masjid, mandir, church or gurudwara, prayers shouldn't disturb anybody. Javed said this when asked about singer Sonu Nigam's comments demanding a ban on loudspeakers during religious sermons. Earlier, Sonu had tweeted, "I'm not a Muslim and I have to be woken up by the Azaan," and called it "forced religiousness".
