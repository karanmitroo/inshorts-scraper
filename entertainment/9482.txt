Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma took to Twitter to slam the supporters of the traditional bull-taming sport Jallikattu. "[E]ach supporter should be made to be chased by a 1000 Bulls and then let's see how much they will protest?," he tweeted. He further wrote, "[S]ome African tribes have cannibalism as culture and that doesn't elevate the definition of culture."
