According to reports, Netflix wants to buy the rights to all films of Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan which will release from now on. This would mean that the films will be available on Netflix first and television channels will have to buy the satellite rights from Netflix. Earlier, both the actors met Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in Mumbai.
