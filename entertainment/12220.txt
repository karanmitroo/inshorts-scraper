The Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) has restricted the entry of journalists inside its campus over an incident where a woman journalist was allegedly found inside the boys’ hostel. The directive, however, goes against FTII's Visitors’ Policy, which allows journalists to enter after completing the security process. Meanwhile, FTII Chairman Gajendra Chauhan has defended the decision.
