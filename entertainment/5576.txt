NASA called out on a firm owned by Ironman-famed actor Gwyneth Paltrow over wearable "healing stickers" that it promoted on its website. The lifestyle brand 'Goop' had claimed the stickers were made with the "same conductive carbon material NASA uses to line space suits". However, after NASA dismissed the claims, Goop removed the promo and apologised for "misleading" its customers.
