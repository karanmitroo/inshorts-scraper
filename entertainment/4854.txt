Actress Prachi Desai said that casting in films is still based on whether the person is a big name or belongs to a famous family. She also said that people in the industry are not welcoming to outsiders. Prachi added, "I...turned down a couple of big films, because they...wanted me to do the same kind of thing again and again."
