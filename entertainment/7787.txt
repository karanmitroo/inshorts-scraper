Rajinikanth has cancelled his trip to Sri Lanka for a housing scheme launch, following protests by some pro-Tamil groups. The groups alleged that the event is an attempt to involve Rajinikanth in an "ethnic issue". In a letter, Rajinikanth has urged people to not politicise his visit if he gets a chance to meet Sri Lankan Tamils in the future.
