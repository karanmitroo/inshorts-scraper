Arnold Schwarzenegger of ‘Terminator’ film series fame has lent his voice to the community-based traffic and navigation app Waze. The move is a part of the promotional campaign for his upcoming film 'Terminator Genesis', releasing worldwide on July 1. “You have reached your destination. Hasta la vista, baby!,” says one of the voice recordings of Arnold in the app.
