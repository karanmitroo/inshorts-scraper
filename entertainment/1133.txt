During his radio show 'Calling Karan', filmmaker Karan Johar urged a gay caller to be honest with his wife and tell her the truth after the man told him that he recently got married to the woman under family pressure. "While you are entitled to your orientation, you are not entitled to ruin somebody else's life," Karan told the caller.
