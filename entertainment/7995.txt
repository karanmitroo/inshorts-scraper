The crowd-funded film 'Mantra', starring Kalki Koechlin and Rajat Kapoor, is "a flawed nostalgia", wrote Hindustan Times. "The story and performances make sure you are involved till the very end," wrote Times of India while Koimoi wrote that the film is "a failed attempt thanks to its sub-plots". The film has been rated 3/5 (HT), 3.5/5 (TOI) and 2/5 (Koimoi).
