Ajay Devgn starrer 'Singham Returns' is an orgy of relentless action, shrill dialoguebaazi, and eardrum-shattering background music, and there isn't much that's groundbreaking in the script, writes IBNLive. It also says that the story, about the need for corruption-cleansing, is misguiding, and plods to tire you out eventually. The ratings are 1.5(Indian Express), 2.5(IBN), 2(Hindustan Times) and 3.5(TOI).
