Opening up on the row over his film 'Padmaavat', Sanjay Leela Bhansali said, "The protests were illogical... There was nothing to be discussed." "It had reached an obnoxious level with people sitting with swords on national television and giving death threats," he added. Bhansali further said, "[The film] is an answer to the anguish that we all went through."
