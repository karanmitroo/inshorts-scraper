Lebanese-American porn star Mia Khalifa has refuted the reports which claimed she was approached for participating in reality show 'Bigg Boss 9'. Later, there were rumours that she has accepted the offer. "Let's get something clear: I am never stepping foot in India, so whomever said I have "shown interest" in being on Big Boss should be fired," Khalifa tweeted.
