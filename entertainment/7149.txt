Actress Hema Malini has said her husband Dharmendra wanted to hit Bacchu Kadu, the independent MLA from Maharashtra after he said, "Hema drinks heavily daily, does she commit suicide." Kadu said this while countering claims that farmers commit suicide due to their drinking habits. Hema added she will take Kadu to court and ask him to issue a public apology.
