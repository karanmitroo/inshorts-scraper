Actor Aditya Roy Kapur has said that the link-up rumours with actress Katrina Kaif are ridiculous. "Sometimes, you go for dinner with a friend and things get blown out of proportion... It's like you can't go to a friend's house without being linked to her," he added. He further said that he does not want to overthink on these rumours.
