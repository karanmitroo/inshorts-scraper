Basketball legend and five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant has won an Oscar for his animated short film 'Dear Basketball'. The film is based on a poem Bryant wrote in 2015, announcing his retirement. "As basketball players, we're told to shut up and dribble," the 39-year-old said on stage and added, "I'm glad we did a little bit more than that."
