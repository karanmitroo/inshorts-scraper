Openly gay actor George Takei has said that making the character 'Hikaru Sulu' gay in the upcoming film 'Star Trek Beyond' as an homage to him is "really unfortunate". "I'm delighted that there's a gay character. [But] unfortunately, it's a twisting of Gene's [Roddenberry] creation, to which he put in so much thought," said Takei.
