Katrina Kaif has said people talking about her role despite Salman Khan's presence in 'Tiger Zinda Hai' is exciting. "Portraying the role of a powerful female character... [doesn't] necessarily mean that one has to play the protagonist or the solo lead," she added. Katrina further said, "It is really nice to see that the female character could be as strong."
