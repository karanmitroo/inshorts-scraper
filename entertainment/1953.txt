BJP leader Suraj Pal Amu, who kept a â‚¹10-crore bounty for beheading Deepika Padukone and Sanjay Leela Bhansali over Padmavati row, has resigned as the party's Haryana Chief Media Coordinator. This comes after Amu criticised CM Manohar Lal Khattar for not meeting members of Shri Rajput Karni Sena. Meanwhile, a case of criminal intimidation has been registered against the leader.
