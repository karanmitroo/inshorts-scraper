Actress Shweta Tripathi, who recently featured in the film 'Haraamkhor', has said she will never feature in an advertisement for fairness creams. "It's outrageous that even in this day and age, there are products that urge people to be fair," she added. She further said that she won't be a part of projects which promote stereotypes in society.
