A Pune local court has admitted a petition seeking a ban on the release of the film 'Bajirao Mastani' across Maharashtra. The petition claimed that the film is a "misinterpretation" of Bajirao Peshwa, on whom the film is based, and mentioned that the film's song "Pinga" was offensive to Marathi culture. Bajirao Mastani is scheduled for release on December 18.
