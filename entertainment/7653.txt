Actress Shilpa Shinde, who portrayed the character 'Angoori Bhabhi' on the television serial 'Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai', has filed a complaint of criminal defamation against the heads of three industry associations. She alleged that the associations had imposed a 'ban' on her, though they have no such power, and had warned of action against any production house which employed her.
