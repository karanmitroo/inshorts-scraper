Scarlett Johansson acted as US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump in a fake perfume advertisement 'Complicit' on comedy show Saturday Night Live. "A feminist...a champion for women, but like how?" says the narrator as Johansson sees Alec Baldwin, playing Trump, reflected in a mirror. The advertisement's tagline is, "Fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won't."
