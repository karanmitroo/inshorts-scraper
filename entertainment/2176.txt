Miss World's official Twitter account mistakenly posted a picture showing Miss England Stephanie Hill ranking second and Miss Mexico Andrea Meza securing the third spot at the beauty pageant, when it was the other way round. Comparing this to host Steve Harvey announcing the wrong Miss Universe 2015, a user tweeted, "Steve Harvey must be laughing his a** off."
