Saudi Arabia's Minister of Culture and Information Awwad bin Saleh Al-Awwad on Monday said that public cinemas would be allowed in the country for the first time in over 35 years. "Opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification," he added. Cinemas were banned in the conservative kingdom following opposition from clerics.
