Hollywood journalist and founder of awards website GoldDerby.com Tom O'Neil has revealed that an Oscar statuette costs only $1,000 (₹68,000) to manufacture. In comparison, the cumulative amount of money spent by Hollywood studios to promote Oscar-nominated films is $100 million (₹680 crore) every year. Reports suggest that nominated films tend to earn more money once they win an Oscar.
