Sonakshi Sinha, while speaking about rumours of a fight with Salman Khan, said such reports don't make any difference to her. "I ask Salman what you have fought with me now? I think people want to talk about something or the other," she added. Sonakshi further said, "I'm grateful to him... whatever I'm today is because of 'Dabangg'."
