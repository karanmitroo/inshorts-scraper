Sachin Tendulkar, who attended the special screening of 'PK', said that the Aamir Khan starrer is the best film he has ever seen. "His role in the film is completely different. It is completely out-of-the box film with a very strong message. It is a must watch film. Without any doubt it is his best performance," he added.
