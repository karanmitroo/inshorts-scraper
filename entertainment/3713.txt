Actor Matt Damon, while discussing how US President Donald Trump got a cameo in films like 'Home Alone 2', said, "The deal was...if you wanted to shoot in...his buildings, you had to write him in a part." Damon added most directors would do this and cut Trump's scene from their films later but films like 'Home Alone 2' retained it.
