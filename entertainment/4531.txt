Amitabh Bachchan has said that the opportunity of catching up on sleep on a film's set for actors is a rare and gifted moment in the script. While sharing a picture of him sleeping for a film scene, Bachchan added, "My sleep was genuine, they actually had to come and wake me up to tell me that it was over."
