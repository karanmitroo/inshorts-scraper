Several UN staff members protested against the appointment of DC superhero Wonder Woman as the honorary UN ambassador for the empowerment of women, saying she has an "overtly sexualized image". They added that "the United Nations was unable to find a real-life woman that would be able to champion the rights of ALL women on the issue of gender equality".
