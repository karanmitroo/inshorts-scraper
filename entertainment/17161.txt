Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, whose latest film 'Bombay Velvet' failed to make a good start at the box office, said that he was not depressed by the lukewarm response to the project. "Its time to close the book and move on," he posted on Facebook. "...I'm not depressed or hiding, this has taught us a lot... no regrets whatsoever," he added.
