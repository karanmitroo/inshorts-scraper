After singer Justin Bieber accidentally made fun of boy band One Direction on a chat show, #JustinBieberFeatOneDirection was a global Twitter trend on Sunday. Users suggested that Bieber and One Direction mend fences and unite on stage for a mashup. Some users trolled the trend tweeting, "IF BOTH THESE FANDOMS ARE MIX TOGETHER WE HAVE KILLED THE WORLD JUST SAYIN".
