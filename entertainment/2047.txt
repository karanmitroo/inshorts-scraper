Actress Sunny Leone and her husband Daniel Weber took to Twitter on Friday to complain about delays experienced on four Jet Airways flights. Sunny tweeted, "Seriously it's crazy the amount of delays @jetairways is having everyday... Ruined my week of sleep!" Daniel later tweeted that Jet Airways called him and blamed the delays on the airport instead of the airline.
