Filmmaker Anurag Basu, who worked with Ranbir Kapoor in 'Barfi', has termed him 'risky', calling Salman Khan 'boring'. "I'm glad there is an actor like Ranbir who is taking the risk... He isn't like Salman who is doing same thing film after film", Basu said. "It's not paying off but at least he (Ranbir) is getting the satisfaction", he added.
