The Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde starrer 'Mohenjo Daro', which has three kissing scenes, has been passed by the Central Board of Film Certification without a single cut. "I guess they (the kisses) came across as they were meant to, as manifestations of pure love. Vulgarity is always in the intention and expression... we never went that way," said Hrithik.
