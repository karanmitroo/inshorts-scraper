Choreographer-turned-filmmaker Remo D'Souza has denied reports that actor Salman Khan, who will be working in Remo's film, has put the project on hold because the actor is not prepared for it. "Salmanâ€‰is in Abu Dhabi and I am here working on the film," he added. Remo further said, "You will see Salman dancing like never before (in the film)".
