Singer Arijit Singh recently posted a public apology to Bollywood actor Salman Khan on Facebook for allegedly insulting him. Adding that he sent Salman apology texts many times, Arijit wrote, "I apologise here in front of everyone... Please do not remove the song that I sang for you in Sultan". However, Arijit later deleted the post from his Facebook account.
