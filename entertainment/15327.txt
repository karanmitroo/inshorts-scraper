Daniel Craig has reportedly quit the James Bond franchise, in order to appear on the American television series ‘Purity’. Producers have repeatedly tried to convince him to appear as Bond for the next instalment, reports claimed. Before the release of 'Spectre', the latest Bond film, Craig had claimed that he would "rather slash his wrists than play James Bond again".
