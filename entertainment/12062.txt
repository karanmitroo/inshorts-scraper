Filmmaker Karan Johar, while responding to Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's demand to ban Pakistani artistes from working in India, has said that such a ban is "not a solution" to terrorism. "I beseech everyone to look at it holistically and understand the situation, that there is a larger situation here and it has nothing to do with banning talent," said Karan.
