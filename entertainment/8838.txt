Karni Sena's founder Lokendra Singh Kalvi has demanded the setting up of a pre-screening board to examine films with historical themes. He suggested the committee could consist of a retired judge, two journalists and two historians (from states concerned). Earlier, Kalvi suggested a pre-production check being done for historical films with groups about whom the films are being made.
