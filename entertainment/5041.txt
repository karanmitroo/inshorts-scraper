PM Narendra Modi's lookalike and Kerala resident, MP Ramachandran has said that he will shave off his beard to not look like Modi. "People are misusing my picture. This has been happening for a while," he said, after comedy group AIB posted his picture alongside Modi's to create a meme. He also said he often gets selfie requests from strangers.
