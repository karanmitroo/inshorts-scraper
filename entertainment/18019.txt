Former Miss World Priyanka Chopra said that she finds it strange to walk in swimsuit on stage. "I am happy that it didn't happen with me in my years during Miss World. We didnâ€™t have this swimsuit round," she added. The organisers of the Miss World contest have removed swimsuit round from their competition starting next year.
