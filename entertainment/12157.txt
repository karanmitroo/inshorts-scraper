Actress Kareena Kapoor has said that her cousin Ranbir Kapoor is a "superstar" and "the best actor till date" even if he gives "25 flop or hit films". "I don’t like the fact when people say 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' will bring back Ranbir (on track)... [E]verybody has hits and flops…even I have had flop films," added Kareena.
