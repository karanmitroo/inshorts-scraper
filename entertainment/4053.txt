Former Censor Board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani has revealed that he had received a letter from the Home Ministry asking him not to pass 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' before Eid due to its title. "They feared that it could lead to communal problems," he added. Nihalani further said, "I stood by the makers. Yet I was made out to be the villain."
