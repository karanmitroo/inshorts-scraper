Hollywood actor Eddie Redmayne has revealed that he's "really allergic" to cats and finds it "awful". "It's really embarrassing, whenever you're near a cat to have to take an antihistamine," said the 34-year-old actor. Redmayne will be next seen in 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them', an upcoming fantasy film based on JK Rowling's novel of the same name.
