Actress Vidya Balan on Friday claimed she would strive to end male-female disparity in Bollywood especially in the pay-gap, as she made an appearance on Ekta Kapoor’s TV show “Itna Karo Na Mujhe Pyar”. She noted that TV actresses were getting paid “extremely well” and with female-oriented films like “NH10” and “Piku”, this trend could be anticipated in Bollywood too.
