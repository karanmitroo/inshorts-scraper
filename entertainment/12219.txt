Actor Vivek Oberoi's firm is set to build 5 lakh low-cost housing units by the end of this year. The project aims to provide housing facilities to low-income people. The actor said that his inspiration for the project was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ‘Housing for All by 2022’ vision while adding that profit-earning is not the motive behind the project.
