A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed by a member of nationalistic Hindu party 'Hindu Makkal Katchi' against actor Kamal Haasan for his alleged derogatory remarks on the Mahabharata. Earlier, a police complaint was filed by the party. Haasan had commented that the Mahabharata talks about a woman (Draupadi) who was used as a pawn and was gambled away.
