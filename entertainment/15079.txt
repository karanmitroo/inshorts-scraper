'Alam Ara', Indiaâ€™s first sound film, was released on March 14, 1931 at Majestic Cinema in Mumbai.  The film, directed by Ardeshir Irani, featured Master Vithal and Zubeida in lead roles. The film was shot with the Tanar single-system camera, which recorded sound directly onto the film. The shooting was done mostly at night to avoid daytime noises.
