A Bombay court on Monday cancelled an arrest warrant that was issued against actor Sanjay Dutt for failing to appear before the court in connection with a criminal intimidation complaint. The complaint had been filed by film producer Shakil Noorani in 2013, alleging that he received threat call from gangsters on behalf of the actor to settle a dispute.
