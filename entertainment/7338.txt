Actor Randeep Hooda tweeted that Pakistan is making another 'Sarbjit', while referring to the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian national who was arrested and sentenced to death in Pakistan on charges of spying. "No trial, no evidence, only a closed military court proceeding??? It reeks of lies," tweeted Randeep. He further wrote, "Maybe we should break him out @SushmaSwaraj."
