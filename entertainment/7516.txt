Punjab Police on Tuesday denied reports that they arrested actor Rakhi Sawant after she failed to appear in court in a case over her alleged "derogatory" remarks against sage Valmiki. This comes after a Ludhiana court issued an arrest warrant against Sawant on March 9. However, Sawant's team reportedly said she had "surrendered" and left for Punjab.
