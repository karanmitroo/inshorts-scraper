Comedian Sugandha Mishra said she stresses on female comedians not being made eye-candy. She added that sometimes, makers of a comedy show keep women only for cues and give main lines to men. Sugandha further said that initially, good-looking girls find it difficult doing comedy as they're confused about negative portrayals, as is sometimes required in comedy shows.
