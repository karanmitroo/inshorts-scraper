According to an Oxford research, watching traumatic films triggers the release of feel-good chemicals, endorphins, also dubbed as "natural painkillers", in the brain. Endorphins increase the level of pain tolerance and enhance feelings of group bonding. The study found, on an average, the pain tolerance level of the test subjects watching a tragic movie increased by 13.1%.
