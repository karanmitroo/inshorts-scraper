The Bombay High Court has passed an order restraining further exhibition and distribution of Kannada film Pushpaka Vimana while citing that it "appears to be a copy of the Korean movie Miracle in Cell No. 7". Korea-based Kross Pictures had filed a copyright infringement case against Pushpaka Vimana's makers alleging that proper remake rights hadn't been acquired from the company.
