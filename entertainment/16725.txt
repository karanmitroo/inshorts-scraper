Actor Anushka Sharma on Wednesday said she would never endorse fairness products. “I would not endorse products that propagate racist and sexist (beliefs)….and propagate social taboo. I don’t want to endorse products that propagate fair skin and all. I will not propagate anything that says this is right or wrong", she said.
