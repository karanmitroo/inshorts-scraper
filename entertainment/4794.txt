Actor Arjun Kapoor has said that he won't affiliate himself with films which are derogatory towards women. Speaking about the influence films have on masses, he added, "If we, as filmmakers and creative people, start becoming the do-gooders and the cleansers of society, it means that the infrastructure of our government has let us down drastically."
