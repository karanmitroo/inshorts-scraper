Actress-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt shared an old photo of herself with her half-sister Alia Bhatt. It was taken on the sets of the 1996 film 'Chaahat', starring Pooja and Shah Rukh Khan. "Amazing that this robust baby has grown into the fine young woman she is and has a film coming out... where she is now opposite Shahrukh!," read the caption.
