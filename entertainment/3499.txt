Director Vishal Bhardwaj, while defending Kangana Ranaut, said when Kangana and Hrithik Roshan's legal conflict was going on, any other actor would've stopped shooting in the middle to fix their mental state. "Whereas Kangana was strong, even when media was writing something or the other controversial about her," he added. Kangana was shooting for Bhardwaj's 'Rangoon' during the legal conflict.
