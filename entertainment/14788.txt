Animal rights organisation PETA US has honoured Jon Favreau, director of 'The Jungle Book', with the Innovation in Film Award, for using computer-generated imagery instead of captive animals to create the film. “Forward-thinking directors like Jon Favreau know that the future of film lies in technical wizardry” Sachin Bangera, PETA India’s associate director of public relations, said.
