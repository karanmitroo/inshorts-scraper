Actor Ram Kapoor has said that the career choices Sunny Leone has made in her life have no bearing on the kind of parent she will be. Sunny and her husband Daniel Weber recently adopted a baby girl named Nisha. Ram added, "Whatever her past is, she has done that in a country where it's allowed and legal."
