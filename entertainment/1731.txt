YouTube personality and TV show host Sahil Khattar has said that he aims to change the stereotype of bald men getting only funny or negative roles in films. Sahil cited the example of Dwayne Johnson, the world's highest-paid actor of 2016, and Vin Diesel, who stars in The Fast and the Furious franchise, as being bald actors who are successful.
