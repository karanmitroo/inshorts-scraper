Boxer Vijender Singh uploaded a Dubsmash video of himself on his Twitter account, recreating Sunny Deol’s famous ‘dhai kilo ka haath’ dialogue. Vijender captioned the video, “Inspired by @IAMSUNNYDEOL Paaji “, which the actor later retweeted. Sunny Deol also wished Vijender luck for his first pro bout in India on July 16 against Australia's Kerry Hope.
