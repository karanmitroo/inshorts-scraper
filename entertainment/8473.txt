In an apparent dig at Union Minister Kiren Rijiju’s tweet over Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur's issue, lyricist Javed Akhtar tweeted, "I don’t know about her but Mr Minister I know who's polluting your mind".  On Kaur’s campaign for peace between India and Pakistan, Rijiju had tweeted, "Who’s polluting this young girl's mind? A strong Arm Force prevents a war".
