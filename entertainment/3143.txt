Veteran actor Dharmendra while sharing a picture from his younger days recalled how he used to ask himself, "Mein Dilip Kumar ban sakta hun kya?" He talked about how he used to imagine his face being on posters of Hindi films and dream about being an actor. Dharmendra's Bollywood career began around 20 years after Dilip Kumar's acting career started.
