Singer Ash King said he was disappointed by the fact that Canadian singer Justin Bieber lip-synced at his maiden concert in India. He added, "It is wrong because he is such a good singer and it is so nice to hear a good singer live." Ash further said he was also disappointed with the clothes Bieber wore for his performance.
