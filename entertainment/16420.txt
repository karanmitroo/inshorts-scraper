Kangana Ranaut and Imran Khan starrer 'Katti Batti' which released on Friday is "sweet, funny, sassy - but inconsistent," wrote TOI. The Nikhil Advani directorial makes 'Hero', previous week's release from the same director, appear like a good film, said HT. The film has been rated 3/5 (Times of India), 1.5/5 (Hindustan Times) and 0.5/5 (Indian Express).
