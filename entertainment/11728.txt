Actor Amitabh Bachchan has said that a biopic on his life would be a "disaster". "I would not like a film to be made on me and neither I can say which actor should do it," added Bachchan. "[B]ecause I'm not worthy of anything like that, there wouldn't be much to do in such a film," he had said earlier.
