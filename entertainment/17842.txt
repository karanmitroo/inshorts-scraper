Veteran actress and social activist Shabana Azmi said at the Kolkata Literary Meet that actresses should make an "informed decision" while taking up item numbers in movies. She said that while she would not want to be moral police, actresses should be "vigilant" of the fact that popular item songs are "leading to sexualization of young children".
