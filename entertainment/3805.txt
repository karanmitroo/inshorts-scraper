Ajay Devgn, while discussing incidents of paparazzi following star kids around, said, "I really request that (our) kids should be left alone." Ajay added, "They are just 13, 14 or 15 years old, and don't understand a lot of things...somewhere I feel a line must be drawn." Earlier, Kajol said media should be more responsible in dealing with star kids.
