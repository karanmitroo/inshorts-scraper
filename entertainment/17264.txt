Amitabh Bachchan is planning a website dedicated to his late father, poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, having comprehensive facts about him. Bachchan appealed to his fans on Twitter to share with him any information they have about the poet. "I wish to put up a comprehensive website, giving correct information, because many sites carry his name but incorrect information!!," he tweeted.
