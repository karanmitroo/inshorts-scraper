After taking an afternoon flight back to the Yerwada jail, actor Sanjay Dutt headed back home, Thursday, as prison authorities told him it was not necessary for him to surrender yet. Dutt was granted a 14-day furlough, but the extension was not granted. According to sources, a 14-day-extension can be taken on a furlough, without committing any offence.
