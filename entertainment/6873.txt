Actress Priyanka Chopra revealed that she has been kicked out of films because someone else was recommended to the producer. Speaking on nepotism, Priyanka said that she has faced it a lot and added that outsiders in Bollywood don't have a foot-in-the-door access. She added, "Eventually, those who are meant to be success stories become that, despite all hindrances."
