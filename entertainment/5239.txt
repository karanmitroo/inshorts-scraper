Actor Govinda took to Twitter to describe his experience of shooting for Jagga Jasoos, after the director Anurag Basu confirmed that his role has been removed from the film. Govinda tweeted he didn't even charge a signing amount for the film. "I gave full respect to Kapoor family...I did the film because he is my senior's son," wrote Govinda.
