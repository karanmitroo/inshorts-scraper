Veteran lyricist Gulzar on Saturday said that India is witnessing an atmosphere of “uncertainty and fear” that it has never seen before. "What’s happening in the country now is sad, but the uncertain fear it creates is also disturbing", Gulzar said. Further, defending the 'Sahitya Akademi', he said that the government should be blamed for the "growing intolerance" in India.
