Television anchor and model Rochelle Rao, who was last seen on 'Bigg Boss 8', has been roped in for 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. Rochelle will feature in the show as a nurse. "My nurse character on it will portray a glamorous side, but I won’t be going overboard as one can’t flaunt that too much on the show", she said.
