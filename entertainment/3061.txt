Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski is under investigation by the Swiss police over new rape allegations made against him by a woman who claimed he assaulted her in 1972 when she was 15. She is the fourth woman to publicly accuse Polanski of sexual assault. Notably, Polanski had fled the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl.
