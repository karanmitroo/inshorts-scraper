Late actor Raj Kapoor's 'Mera Naam Joker' and 'Sangam' will be the last two films to be shown at Delhi's 84-year-old Regal cinema hall that will shut down on March 31. The cinema hall, which is located in Connaught Place, was said to be a favourite of Raj Kapoor. The building will be converted into a multiplex soon.
