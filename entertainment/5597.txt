Sridevi has said that her earlier statement about being happier if elder daughter Jhanvi Kapoor gets married instead of acting was misunderstood. She added, "What I meant...was I'd prefer if my daughters didn't lead the...hectic life that comes with this business..." Sridevi added she doesn't believe that girls should only get married, and wants her daughters to have an identity.
