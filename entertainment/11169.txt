Actor Amitabh Bachchan has sung a Ganesh aarti song for the upcoming film 'Sarkar 3'. The 74-year-old shared pictures from the sets of the film in a blog post. "In prayer for the aarti for ‘Sarkar 3’ on the beach of the Arabian Sea off Juhu... The sinister serious looks... (are) deliberate and pertinent for the scene,” wrote Bachchan.
