Talking about issues one faces to finance films based on historical figures, actress Kangana Ranaut said, "If I want to make films like Living Room Part 3 or Bedroom Part 4, it is easier." She added, "Today, we are rehashing stories, making manipulative cinema to titillate senses and backing movies that will make big money."
