Aditya Pancholi has said that actress Kangana Ranaut should give him an unconditional apology on the same platforms where she "falsely accused" him. "I'm filing a criminal defamation suit against Kangana. If she is unable to prove her allegations, she should be locked up in jail. Else, I should be locked up," he added.
