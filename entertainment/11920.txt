Censor Board Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani has said that Pakistani artists including Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan, who have worked in upcoming Bollywood films, "should not be asked to leave India". "They have every right to work here", added Nihalani. He further said that such a ban would affect filmmakers like Karan Johar, whose upcoming film stars Fawad Khan.
