Actress-producer Malaika Arora Khan, famous for her item numbers in Bollywood, says her son Arhaan is not affected by her work. "He doesn't get affected by my songs. He is too tiny and young. If he likes the song, he comes up and says that he liked it," Malaika said when asked how her son reacts to her item numbers.
