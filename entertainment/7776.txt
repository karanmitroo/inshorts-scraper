Comedian Ahsaan Qureshi has asked Sunil Grover to grow a spine and "leave this nautanki" over the latter's "don't act like God" comment to Kapil Sharma. Ahsaan said, "If you don't have the guts to speak because you think he won't take you again...that means he is your God." Ahsaan added that Kapil and Grover's fight can't be taken seriously.
