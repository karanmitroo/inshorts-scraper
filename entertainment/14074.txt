Actor Randeep Hooda called Salman Khan "‘a different breed altogether", while commenting on the friendship that he and the 50-year-old actor share. "We have similar interests and very similar sense of humour. With this film ('Sultan') we got more time to spend together,” added Hooda. In 'Sultan', he plays the coach of the titular character played by Salman.
