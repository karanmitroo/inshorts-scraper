Angelina Jolie, in the latest court filing, has claimed that estranged husband Brad Pitt has requested to seal divorce documents as he is "terrified that the public will learn the truth". This comes after Pitt slammed Jolie for "exposing" their children and requested to seal divorce documents to protect their privacy. Jolie currently has sole custody of their six children.
