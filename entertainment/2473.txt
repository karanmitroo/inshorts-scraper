A 36-feet effigy of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was burnt at a bonfire event in the UK on Saturday. Over 10,000 people attended the annual event commemorating Guy Fawkes' failed plot of blowing up the British Parliament in 1605. Weinstein was picked to be this year's public figurine after he was accused of sexual harassment by over 40 women.
