The release date of Sooraj Pancholi and Athiya Shetty-starrer 'Hero', a remake of the 1983 film with the same name, has been postponed to September 11. The film, a Salman Khanâ€™s production, was earlier scheduled to release on September 4. The previous release date was clashing with multi-starrer film 'Welcome Back', a sequel to 2007's hit comedy film 'Welcome'.
