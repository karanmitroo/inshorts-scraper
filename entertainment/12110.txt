Responding to cricketer Gautam Gambhir's statement that he "does not believe" in biopics on cricketers, filmmaker Neeraj Pandey has said that filmmakers "need to talk about everything". "Films are made on stories... If the story is worth telling, then you can play anything," added Pandey, whose upcoming biopic on cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni will release on September 30.
