The Madras High Court dismissed a plea seeking to revoke the censor certificate of Vijay starrer 'Mersal' for containing references mocking GST and Digital India. The court cited that everyone has the right to express their opinions. The court further said 'Mersal' is just a film and not real life, while responding to the argument that it propagates false information.
