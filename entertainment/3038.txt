Actor Manoj Bajpayee, who has won two National Film Awards, has said, "Everybody is going to forget which and how many awards you have got." Manoj added, "When you get up in the morning after celebrating the award you won, you realise that you are again standing on platform zero. Every day is a new morning, with a new challenge."
