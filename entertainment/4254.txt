Actor Naseeruddin Shah, while speaking about nepotism in the film industry, asked which parent wouldn't want to help their own child get a better position than what they had. "It's only natural that you would want them to not repeat the same mistakes," he added. Naseeruddin further said nepotism is prevalent in all places and not just the film industry.
