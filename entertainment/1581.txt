The Karnataka government has decided not to permit Sunny Leone's New Year's eve show in Bengaluru following protests from Pro-Kannada group Karnataka Rakshana Vedike Yuva Sene. Karnataka Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy said, "I have instructed [authorities] not to allow such events. Don't bring Leone here...Let them organise events related to Kannada culture and literature, which is our heritage."
