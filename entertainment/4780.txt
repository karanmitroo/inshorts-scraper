Singer Sunidhi Chauhan has said she doesn't understand why songs are being recreated in India despite so much talent in the country. She added, "There are many people who are waiting to get an opportunity and are talented. I am not fond of recreations." Sunidhi further said that original music is required else music gets repetitive for the audiences.
