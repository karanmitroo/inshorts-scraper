Actor Hrithik Roshan on Sunday criticised a Twitter trend titled 'Characterless Kangana' where Kangana Ranaut was called "characterless" and "publicity hungry" while being slammed for her alleged past affairs. "It is characterless to judge another. Whatever may be the case," tweeted Hrithik. The two are currently involved in a legal battle which started with Kangana calling Hrithik her "silly ex".
