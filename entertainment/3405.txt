While hosting the 2017 Emmy Awards, US comedian Stephen Colbert mocked President Donald Trump by saying if he would have won an Emmy for his show 'The Apprentice' then he wouldn't have run for President. Colbert further told the audience, "This is all your fault" as "Emmys mean a lot to Trump". Trump didn't win an Emmy despite multiple nominations.
