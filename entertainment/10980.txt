Responding to reports about police closing the investigation into the Hrithik-Kangana case, the actor's lawyers have said that they are "totally false". "A section of the media in connivance with Ms. Ranaut's lawyer has sought to disseminate this false information," they said. They added that there is "unimpeachable evidence" to suggest that there was no relationship between Hrithik and Kangana.
