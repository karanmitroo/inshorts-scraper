Chetan Bhagat was recently trolled on Twitter after he asked people to send images of his latest novel, One Indian Girl, in a beautiful background. A user tweeted an image that showed the novel's cover as toilet paper, while another image showed a woman burning his book. Bhagat later tweeted, "Nice. A little better photoshop needed but good effort."
