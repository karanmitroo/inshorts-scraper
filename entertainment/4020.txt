Naseeruddin Shah has said film adaptations of noted playwright William Shakespeare's plays work better than theatre adaptations in India. He added, "It has happened many times that after the play, people came up to me and said, 'It was a good play, but we didn't understand the words'." Shah has acted in 'Maqbool' and 'Omkara', film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.
