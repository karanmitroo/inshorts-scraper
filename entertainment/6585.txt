Social media users have likened a Mars Rover prototype built by Parker Brothers Concepts for NASA, to a Batmobile. The 6-wheel solar-powered rover is made of carbon fibre and aluminium and is estimated to weigh around 2250 kg. However, the vehicle will never go to Mars and would be used to promote NASA's manned 2033 Mars mission, said its developer.
