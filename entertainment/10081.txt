National wrestling coach PR Sondhi has said he is contemplating filing a defamation suit against the 'Dangal' makers over his alleged false portrayal in the film. Sondhi had coached India's 2010 Commonwealth Games women wrestlers, and has apparently inspired the negative character of PR Kadam. "They made it spicy but didn't convey what happened...Distorting facts hurt my reputation," said Sondhi.
