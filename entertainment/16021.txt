Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha on Tuesday slammed India's Central Board of Film Certification for making cuts in the kissing scenes. Questioning the reduction in length of such scenes, Sinha asked if it was going to destroy our morality or the culture of our country. "This is absolutely ridiculous that the censor board has to act like a nanny", she added.
