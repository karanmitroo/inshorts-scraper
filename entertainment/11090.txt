Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has said that currently, Hindi cinema was 80 per cent 'Mastram' (erotic pulp fiction) and 20 per cent literature. "Hindi cinema is occupying the place of literature. If it is taking that space, it must serve the purpose of literature," said Kashyap. He added that cinema should deliver the social message that literature is supposed to do.
