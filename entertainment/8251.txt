Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chief Pahlaj Nihalani has slammed the film 'Rangoon' for breaching the law by not showing the censor certificate before its screening in theatres. The CBFC was also informed that anti-smoking short films are not being played during the film even though it has scenes featuring substance abuse. "These are serious offences," said Nihalani.
