The Bengaluru Police posted a witty tweet warning drug sellers that read, "Roses are red, Violets are blue, Heard you're selling drugs, We'll come visit you." The tweet also had a photo collage of the character Pablo Escobar from the series 'Narcos' with the caption, "When you're trying to be a drug lord but then you realise you're in Bengaluru!"
