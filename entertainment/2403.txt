Soha Ali Khan, while talking about her nephew Taimur Ali Khan, said it's not like he's wearing designer clothes everyday that he has to be clicked by the media. "I'm sure after a point people are disinterested. Taimur is (just) a child," added Soha. She further said it's not necessary for the kids to be clicked every now and then.
