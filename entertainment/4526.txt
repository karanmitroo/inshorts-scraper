Actress Sana Khan, while speaking about Salman Khan hugging her on the red carpet at an awards show, said she can't believe that a normal hug was trending. "People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had closed fists, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug," she added while slamming those who trolled her.
