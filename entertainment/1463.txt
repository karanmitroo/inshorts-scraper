Rape-accused producer Harvey Weinstein's ex-wife Eve Chilton has asked him to pay â‚¹32 crore ($5 million) for child support immediately as the ongoing legal proceedings against him could leave him financially insolvent. Calling her demand ridiculous, his lawyer said, "He has made every single payment for nearly 14 years." Chilton, Weinstein's former assistant, was married to him from 1987-2004.
