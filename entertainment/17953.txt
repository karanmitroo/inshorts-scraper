Talking about his upcoming venture 'Shamitabh', director R Balki said "Nothing about Shamitabh is conventional and the trailer is testimony to that. It will keep you guessing and doesn't give away the plot and we hope that audiences come to the theatre to know more." The trailer of the Amitabh Bachchan and Dhanush starrer film was released few days back.
