Describing how she was molested by Guess Co-founder Paul Marciano on sets of Guess campaign shoot, supermodel-actress Kate Upton said, "Paul...forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them, playing with them." She added, "After I pushed him away, he said, 'I'm making sure they're real'." She further said that after denying Marciano's advances, she was fired from the Guess campaign.
