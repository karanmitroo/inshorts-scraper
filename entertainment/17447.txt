Shiv Sena slammed actor Naseeruddin Shah Monday for expressing his regret on the animosity between India and Pakistan and saying that Indians were being brain-washed to believe that Pakistan is an enemy. In its mouthpiece 'Saamana', Sena wrote that Shah could seek his answers from those who have been victims of terrorist activities carried out from the soil of Pakistan.
