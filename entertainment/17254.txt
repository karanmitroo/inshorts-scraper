Sunny Leone’s sex-comedy ‘Mastizaade’, which was scheduled to release on May 1, has not been passed by the Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The film is full of double meaning dialogues and vulgar visuals that can't be edited out with an opening scene where both Tusshar Sharma and Vir Das are seen having sex with a horse.
