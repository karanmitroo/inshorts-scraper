The Aamir Khan-starrer 'Dangal' has not been preponed for an Independence Day release, and will hit the screens during Christmas. While previous reports suggested otherwise, Aamir himself debunked the rumours on Monday. "I had said that Independence Day would be an ideal day to release 'Dangal' because it's a patriotic film... (but) wouldnâ€™t even be ready by then," Aamir said.
