BJP MP Manoj Tiwari has said that films with Pakistani actors should be banned in future. He added that he was "delighted" over the release of 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' on the scheduled date after the producer's assurance that they won't work with Pakistani actors. "We should at least ban people who did not condemn attack on India," he added.
