A letter dated June 10, 1980, written by former Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa, who passed away on Monday, has emerged online. The letter addressed to a journalist reveals why she turned down the heroine's role in Rajinikanth's film 'Billa'. "I feel constrained to point out that I'm not, I repeat, not 'struggling to stage a come-back,'" wrote Jayalalithaa.
