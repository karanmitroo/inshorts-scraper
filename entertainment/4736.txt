Nathalie Emmanuel, who portrays 'Missandei' on 'Game of Thrones', said her first nude scene for the show, which was featured in season 7's second episode, was a big deal. She added it was strange because she has become good friends with co-star Jacob Anderson, who portrays Grey Worm. "But it was fine and, obviously, done really respectfully," she further said.
