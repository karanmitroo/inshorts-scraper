A video shows Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman giving tips to Jimmy Kimmel for hosting the upcoming Oscars ceremony. Freeman tells Kimmel that this is either "an opportunity to be toast of the town" or a "chance to blow it in front of billions". When Kimmel says his words aren't encouraging, Freeman tells him, "Do your own damn pep talk."
