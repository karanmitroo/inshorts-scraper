Director Siddharth Anand has revealed that Hrithik Roshan didn't sign the film 'Rambo' as he didn't want to star in another remake after 2014 film 'Bang Bang!'. He added that Hrithik would've been a great choice for the part. Tiger Shroff has been cast in the film which is a remake of Sylvester Stallone's action movie by the same name.
