Actress Disha Patani, while talking about her rumoured boyfriend Tiger Shroff, has said that as actors, there is a "big risk of being slut-shamed" in case relationships don't work. She added, "We are good friends... There is nothing special about going for parties or catching up for a meal with friends. I understand this (gossip) is part of the profession."
