All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday said that the film 'Padmaavat' is "bakwas" (rubbish) and Muslims shouldn't watch it as God didn't create them to watch a two-hour film. "(PM Narendra) Modi has formed a 12-member committee for that film...but nobody was consulted when law to end triple talaq was being made against us," Owaisi asserted.
