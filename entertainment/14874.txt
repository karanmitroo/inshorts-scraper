Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan has named actress Kangana Ranaut for the first time in an FIR as the person who had been exchanging e-mails with his alleged impostor. He had earlier refrained from naming Kangana in the FIR, first filed in December 2014. The cyber cell has reportedly issued summons to the actress to record her statement.
