Rajput organisation Karni Sena has called for a Bharat Bandh on December 1 if Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati' releases on that date. "We demand a complete ban on the film. Now, we don't want any pre-screening of the movie," said a member of the organisation. The Maharashtra government has provided Bhansali with precautionary security cover amid growing threats.
