Actor Jim Carrey's late former girlfriend Cathriona White has accused him of giving her STDs, in a newly-discovered note that she wrote two years before her suicide in 2015. The note further read, "You (Jim) introduced me to cocaine, prostitutes, mental abuse and disease...You did good things for me but being with you broke me down as a person."
