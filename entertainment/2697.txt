Irrfan Khan has said sexuality shouldn't be hidden behind the facade of religion or judged by age. "It's not a crime to be in a relationship with an older man or a younger woman...Let's not complicate relationships with these diktats," he added. Irrfan will be seen playing a man who marries his daughter's friend in 'Doob: No Bed Of Roses'.
