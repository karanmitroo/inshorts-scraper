British director Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave” won the Academy Award for best picture on Sunday, making history as the first movie from a black director to win the industry’s highest honor in 86 years of the Oscars. The unflinching portrayal of pre-Civil War American slavery also won two other Oscars - best supporting actress and best adapted screenplay.
