A New Hampshire woman Kristina Ruehli on Monday sued Comedian Bill Cosby, claiming he defamed her last year and accused her of lying in her assault allegations against Cosby. Ruehli had said Cosby drugged and raped her 50 years ago. More than 50 women have accused him of assault in the same way, but he has never been criminally charged.
