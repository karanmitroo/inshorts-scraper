Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Thursday tweeted about his 1973 film 'Abhimaan' completing 44 years of its release. In a blogpost, he wrote that the film was produced under the banner 'Amiya', 'Ami' from Amitabh and 'Ya' from Jaya, and he still doesn't know who has the rights to the film. Notably, Amitabh and Jaya got married in the same year.
