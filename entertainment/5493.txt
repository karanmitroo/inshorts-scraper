Filmmaker Kunal Kohli has tweeted that in today's times, acting isn't discussed but looks are while adding, "That's the sad part." He further wrote, "Instead of gym shots & promotional outfits & looks, I wish actors would post memorable scenes they've shot. Or just an expression from a scene." Kunal is known for directing films like Hum Tum and Fanaa.
