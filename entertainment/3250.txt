Juhi Chawla has said a piece of advice by late filmmaker Yash Chopra which she cherishes is that even in a sad scene or death scene, a heroine must always look beautiful. Juhi revealed he said this when the makeup artist made her look sallow for a scene in the 1989 film 'Chandni'. Wednesday marked the filmmaker's 85th birth anniversary.
