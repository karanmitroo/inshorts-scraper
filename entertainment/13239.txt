NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has said that his biopic 'Snowden', which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a ‘pretty accurate portrayal’ of his story. Snowden, who is currently living in  exile, joined the film's cast via a live chat on Google Hangouts at the Comic-Con in San Diego, to interact with the audience. The interaction was following the film's first public screening.
