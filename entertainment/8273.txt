Models walked on study tables for singer Rihanna's third show for 'Fenty', her fashion line with Puma, at the National Library of France during the Paris Fashion Week. The "back-to-school" inspired collection featured school girl skirts and baseball tees.  "When I was in school, it was... my dream to be able to dress up in whatever I wanted," said Rihanna.
