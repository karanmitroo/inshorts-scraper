The team of the upcoming film 'Tum Bin 2' paid a tribute to late ghazal singer Jagjit Singh by organising a ghazal concert on the occasion of his death anniversary on Monday. The event was hosted by Anubhav Sinha, the film's director. The film's first song, 'Teri Fariyad' is based on the original track sung by Jagjit Singh.
