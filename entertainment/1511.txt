Writer Nishant Kaushik has slammed 'Hichki' director Siddharth P Malhotra for not giving him credit for writing the film's story. "In 2015, Siddharth spoke to me about a story that needs to be written...After 2.5 years, I watch the Hichki trailer and notice a...similar storyline," he tweeted. Nishant added, "If I were you, my conscience would be pricking me."
