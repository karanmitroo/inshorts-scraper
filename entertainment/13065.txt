Actress Constance Wu, from the series 'Fresh off the Boat', has accused the makers of the American-Chinese film 'The Great Wall' of perpetuating racism by casting Matt Damon, a white actor as the lead. "Our heroes don’t look like Matt Damon... We like our colour... our culture ," said Wu while advocating for actors of colour to be given such roles.
