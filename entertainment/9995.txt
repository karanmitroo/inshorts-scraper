The makers of television series 'Sherlock' have said that the show is likely to end with the fourth season, which will premiere on January 1, 2017 on BBC. This is owing to the difficulty of scheduling the actors' time. "We would love to do more, but we are not lying, we absolutely donâ€™t know," said co-creator Mark Gatiss.
