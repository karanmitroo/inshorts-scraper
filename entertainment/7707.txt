Mumbai Police will reportedly close the probe into the molestation case against The Viral Fever CEO Arunabh Kumar by this week without filing an FIR. While advocate Rizwan Siddhiqui urged the police thrice to file an FIR in the case, Mumbai Police claimed that they can do so only if any victim comes forward personally and not on social media.
