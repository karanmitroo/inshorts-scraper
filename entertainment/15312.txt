Production house Yash Raj Films (YRF) will be starting its own visual effects or VFX division called 'yFX'. The move is aimed at making YRF a "fully integrated studio", as visual effects are reportedly becoming a bigger part of Indian cinema. The VFX studio's maiden project will be the upcoming YRF film, 'Sultan', which stars Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma.
