Hollywood actor-director Sylvester Stallone has reportedly performed 'shradh' for his dead son in Haridwar. Notably, Stallone's 36-year-old son had died in 2012. As per reports, Stallone was disturbed as he still used to see his son. He then contacted an Indian Vedic scholar who suggested performing 'tithi shradh', a Hindu ritual performed to ensure peace for departed souls.
