After the roaring success of Singham Returns, actor Ajay Devgn on Tuesday donated two brand new cars to Maharashtra Home Minister RR Patil, to be used by the state's police force. Director-producer Rohit Shetty was also present on the occasion. Perhaps this was Ajay Devgn and Rohit Shetty's way of saying thank you and doing something for the police force.
