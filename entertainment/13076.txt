According to reports, singer Justin Bieber rejected a $5-million offer to perform at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Cleveland, US. The Republicans' attempt to book Bieber reportedly would have marked his biggest single payday. Bieber reportedly turned the show down at the behest of his manager Scooter Braun, who is an avid Hillary Clinton supporter.
