Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose film 'The Salesman' won the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars this year, accepted his trophy nearly three months after the ceremony at the Cannes Film Festival. Farhadi had boycotted the Oscars ceremony following US President Donald Trump's ban on Muslim visitors. He praised Cannes as a "place where cultures speak to one another".
