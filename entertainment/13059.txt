'R D Burmania : Panchamemoirs', a book by entertainment journalist Chaitanya Padukone, reveals that composer RD Burman hated composing cabaret songs. "Whenever I compose raga-based melodies, I derive total creative satisfaction. Classical music is my forte," Padukone quotes Burman in the book. The book also includes anecdotes about Burman by Amitabh Bachchan, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle.
