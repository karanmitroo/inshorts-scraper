Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri, while slamming actress Swara Bhasker for her remark on 'Padmaavat', called her a "fake feminist". Responding to this, Swara tweeted, "Pretty low and sick even by your own abysmal standards of conduct and civility." Swara had said "she felt like a vagina" after watching 'Padmaavat' and accused Bhansali of glorifying the practice of Jauhar.
