Responding to questions by the media about Alia Bhatt, her half sister actress-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt said, "She is smarter than all of you combined." Pooja added, "Don't be fooled by her frivolous image in the media." Alia was trolled over her intelligence after she said Prithviraj Chauhan was India's President in an episode of 'Koffee With Karan' in 2014.
