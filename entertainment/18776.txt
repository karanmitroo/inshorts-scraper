Sonu Nigam, who had recorded 'Hangover', a romantic duet with Shreya Ghoshal, for Sajid Nadidawala's Kick, was replaced by Salman Khan and his portions were dubbed over by Salman. Confirming the same, Sonu said, "Yes, I had recorded this song last year. I wasn't told that it has been dropped. I wasn't even paid for it."
