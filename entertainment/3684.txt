'Simran' writer Apurva Asrani, in a Facebook post, said, "I'm not ok with film makers getting bullied...writers getting f**k*d over just because you are an outspoken woman." He further said, "I'm not ok with women who can't handle being broken up with and...manipulate the world to shame the man." Apurva said this in a veiled reference to Kangana Ranaut.
