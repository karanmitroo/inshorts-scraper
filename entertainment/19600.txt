Shahid Kapoor's romantic-comedy 'Phata Poster Nikla Hero' failed to make a mark, managing to collect a measly Rs.13 crore at the box-office in its opening weekend. The movie, also featuring actress Ileana D'Cruz, was condemned by critics with Indian Express rating it 0.5/5. However, the film's opening was supposedly better than Shahid's last two films, 'Teri Meri Kahaani' and 'Mausam.'
