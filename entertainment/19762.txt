Sanjay Dutt's last legal option against his conviction and sentence of 5 year jail term in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case ended on Monday after the Supreme Court dismissed his curative petition. The 53-year-old actor, who has been lodged in the Yerawada jail in Pune, has spent 69 days behind bars to undergo remaining sentence of three-and-a-half years.
