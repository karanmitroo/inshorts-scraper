Hollywood actor Pierce Brosnan, who appeared in Pan Bahar's advertisement, said he had no prior knowledge of endorsing something that would harm one's health. His contract said he was to endorse a “breath freshener” which Pan Bahar allegedly claimed was “all-natural containing neither tobacco, supari, nor any other harmful ingredient". Brosnan has demanded to be removed from the firm's campaign.
