Actor Anupam Kher on Friday questioned JNU for not screening his film 'Buddha stuck in a traffic jam', which is based on "contemporary social issues". "Why are only certain people allowed to exercise their freedom of expression at JNU?" asked Kher. In response, the university said that the atmosphere is not right to screen such a film on the campus.
