According to a Sportskeeda report, four Indian athletes preparing for the 2016 Rio Olympics at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi, were asked 'not to disturb proceedings' of Salman Khan's Sultan, shooting at the stadium. The guards were reportedly "clueless" about who the athletes were. The athletes said "...our goal is Rio and we donâ€™t want to be distracted by anything."
