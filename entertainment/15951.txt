Followers of popular Kurdish singer, late Ahmet Kaya, have accused British singer Adele of plagiarism in her ballad “Million Years Ago” from the album “25”. Kaya’s fans allege that the song has similarities with his 1985 song Acilara Tutunmak (Clinging to Pain). Kaya had died in 2000 in Paris while on exile from Turkey.
