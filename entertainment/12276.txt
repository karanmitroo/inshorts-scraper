Michelle Obama, wife of US President Barack Obama, had rejected a role on the animated sitcom 'The Simpsons'. The show's co-creator James L Brooks said, "We tried to get her on “The Simpsons” and we couldn’t. We finally got a note that said “good try,” because we were so aggressive." Michelle was reportedly asked to play herself in an episode.
