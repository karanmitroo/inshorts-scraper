Speaking about the row on the upcoming film 'Padmavati', actress Deepika Padukone said, "I know and I believe that nothing can stop the release of this film." "It's absolutely appalling. Where have we reached as a nation? We have regressed," she added. Deepika further said the only people the film's team is answerable to is the Censor Board.
