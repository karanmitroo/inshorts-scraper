Director Sabbir Khan and actor Tiger Shroff will file a defamation case against filmmaker Kritik Kumar Pandey. The filmmaker had earlier filed a complaint alleging that the duo had stolen the storyline of 'Munna Michael' from him. The aspiring director had also said that he has been "deceived" as Tiger had "committed" to doing the film with Pandey earlier.
