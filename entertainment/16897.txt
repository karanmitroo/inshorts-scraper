Filmmaker Karan Johar, who made his full-fledged debut in Anurag Kashyap's 'Bombay Velvet', feels that nobody liked him in the role. “Nobody has offered me any role till now. I think nobody has liked me", Johar said. Further, he added, " I should at least get offers... I can’t cast myself in my own films… I am not that stupid".
