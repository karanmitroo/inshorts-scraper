Sex robot inventor Arran Squire from North Wales brought his hyper-realistic sex-doll, who he said is part of his family, on British television show 'This Morning'. The doll, named 'Samantha', also spends time with Arran, his wife and their children. Arran said the doll has a 'family mode', which prevents it from making any inappropriate comments at the wrong moment.
