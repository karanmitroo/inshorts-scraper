Actress Emma Watson has said that she still fears walking the red carpet despite attending film premieres for more than ten years. "It’s funny because obviously I’ve been doing it since I was like 10-years-old....It’s just the level of energy and the amount of people and it is a lot of attention in a small place,” she added. ​
