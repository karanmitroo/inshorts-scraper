Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia said that the film 'Indu Sarkar' is "fully sponsored" and added, "The organisation and the individual who is behind the film is known to us." Scindia added that that his party condemns the false depictions in the film. 'Indu Sarkar' is based on the 21-month Emergency declared by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during 1975-1977.
