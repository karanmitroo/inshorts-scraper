Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has confirmed her plans to retire as an actor to focus on her career as a film-maker. "I'll do a few more, but I'll be happy to let that all go at some point," she said. Further, the 39-year-old actress said, she would prefer directing movies unless there is a role that "really means something".
