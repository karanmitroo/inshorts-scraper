Singer Ed Sheeran has said that fame is weird, because he noticed that after he became popular, many people around him changed. He added, "When the people around you change towards you, you can get very paranoid." Notably, Sheeran's recently released album 'รท' (Divide) has become UK's fastest-selling album by a male artist.
