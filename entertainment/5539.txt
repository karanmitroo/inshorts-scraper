Pictures of actor Aamir Khan sporting a nose piercing and piercings on his ears for his upcoming film 'Thugs of Hindostan' have emerged online. A source added, "His character demands it and it's just a glimpse of what he has done physically." The film is reportedly about the thug culture, which existed during India's pre-independence era.
