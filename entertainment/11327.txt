A three-minute video states that previously, movie trailers occurred at the end of movies, and as the advertisements "trailed" the actual film, they were called trailers. By the end of the 1930s, movie studios realised that these advertisements would be more effective if they were displayed before a movie. However, the term "trailer" continues to be used even today.
