Singer Ed Sheeran was spotted in a kurta and later in a T-shirt with 'India' written on it, while performing at his Divide Tour concert in Mumbai. He performed songs like 'Shape of You', 'Castle On The Hill' and 'Photograph'. While this was Sheeran's second concert in India, his first ever India concert was held in Mumbai in 2015.
