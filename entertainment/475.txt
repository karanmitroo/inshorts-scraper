Actor Anupam Kher, who is currently shooting for his 512th film 'Baa Baa Black Sheep', has said his competition is not with actors of his age but with actors from the younger generation. "When people call you a thespian, it is your time to pack your bags," he added. Kher further said it is just the beginning for him.
