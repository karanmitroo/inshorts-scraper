Taylor Swift has donated $250,000 to help singer Kesha in a legal battle to break her contract with Sony. Earlier, a judge refused to let Kesha get out of the contract even after she claimed Sony was forcing her to work with her alleged rapist Dr Luke. However, Dr Luke claimed Kesha is making false allegations to break the contract.
