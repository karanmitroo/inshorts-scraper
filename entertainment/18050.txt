Actor Sanjay Dutt, who is serving a sentence of around four years at Pune's Yerwada jail, was Tuesday granted furlough. Dutt was found guilty of illegal possession of arms in a case related to the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai. He has spent over 118 days out of jail, either on parole or furlough between May 2013 and May 2014.
