Actor Tom Hanks sent artist Denise Esposito a typewriter with a note after she gifted him a book of sketches. Hank's note read, "For your lovely book of sketches of all those movies, here's a typewriter to do with whatever you need! Make more art!" The artist gave the sketchbook to Hank's publicist during the Rome Film Festival in October.
