Pop singer Madonna has said that women continue to remain the "most marginalised group” in society, even more than the gay community. “Gay rights are way more advanced than women’s rights. People are a lot more open-minded to the gay community than they are to women, period", she said. Further, she said, "I didn’t feel like straight men understood me".
