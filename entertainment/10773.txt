Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has said he'd love to work with Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese together in a film. "Leo loves Marty the way I do. I'd love for...us to do something," De Niro added. He also revealed that Scorsese had asked him to feature in DiCaprio-starrer film 'The Departed', but he couldn't due to "scheduling issues".
