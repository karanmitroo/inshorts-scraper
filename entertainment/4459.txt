CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani has filed a complaint against TV reporter Himanshi Chaudhary, alleging harassment, intimidation, and breach of privacy. The complaint says Chaudhary made news out of his refusal to speak to her. She had tried to interview Nihalani after he said he would clear the word 'intercourse' in 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' if he gets 1 lakh votes.
