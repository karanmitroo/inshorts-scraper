Yahoo has launched a new TV watching website called 'Yahoo View' featuring Hulu's free content. Users can watch latest five episodes of shows from networks like ABC, NBC and FOX on Yahoo View, eight days post their original broadcast. The website is also tied up with Yahoo-owned blogging site Tumblr and users can directly switch between the platforms.
