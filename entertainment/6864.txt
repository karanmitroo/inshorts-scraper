TV producer Ekta Kapoor has said, "Even a person like me feels a sense of fatigue doing even one show for a hundred episodes. I can pull it off for hundred, but after that, I get bored." She added that while it was "great fun earlier", it's a challenge to create something new and get viewers attached to newer characters.
