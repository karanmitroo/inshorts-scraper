Singer Zubeen Garg has apologised to the Indian Army for hurting their sentiments by wearing their uniform cap. While returning from Delhi, Zubeen was reportedly asked to take off his cap by a defence personnel at the airport, to which he replied, "You're Major but I am Colonel. So, you should salute me." He was later criticised for this comment.
