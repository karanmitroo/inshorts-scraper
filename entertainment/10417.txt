Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that he will be doing Hollywood films and a series as well in the coming years. However, Siddiqui said his plan is mainly to do lead roles there. "Unlike our Indian actors, who get ready to do anything just to be a part of Hollywood, I would only like to go for impactful roles," added Siddiqui.
