Singer Beyonc√©, while speaking about raising funds for the survivors and victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, said, "Natural disasters don't discriminate. They don't see if you're an immigrant, black or white...Jewish or Muslim." Notably, Hurricane Irma has prompted one of the largest evacuations in the US history and is also among the strongest Atlantic hurricanes.
