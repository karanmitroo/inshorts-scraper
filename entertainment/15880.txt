Actor Orlando Bloom visited the Taj Mahal in Agra on Sunday with former Samajwadi party leader Amar Singh. Bloom was invited by the Uttar Pradesh government for an event but was deported from New Delhi on Saturday after his e-visa was rejected. He returned after external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj intervened.
