Veteran actress Shabana Azmi has said that she regrets not meeting late actor Vinod Khanna after learning about his illness. She added, "Perhaps because I want to remember him as he was - handsome, warm and considerate." Shabana and Vinod had worked together in films like Parvarish (1977), Shaque (1976) and Khoon Ki Pukaar (1978), among others.
