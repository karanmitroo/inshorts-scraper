Actress Taapsee Pannu apologised for her remarks on K Raghavendra, director of her debut film Jhummandi Nadam. "Raghavendra...is reason why I'm... in the industry in the first place," said Taapsee. Earlier, she had recalled being hit on the midriff with a coconut while shooting for her debut film and said she didn't understand why Raghavendra felt it would appear sensuous.
