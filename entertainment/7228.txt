Veteran actor Amol Palekar has filed a plea in the Supreme Court seeking relaxation in the censorship of films. In his petition, Palekar has claimed that the Board repeatedly violates a filmmakers' fundamental right to speech and expression as 
there's no member with a legal background on the Board. Further, he called "pre-censorship" of films irrelevant in the internet era.
