Singer Lady Gaga, while responding to body-shamers, said that she is proud of her body and others should be proud of theirs too. "Be you, and be relentlessly you. That's the stuff of champions," she wrote in an Instagram post. The singer faced criticism for her weight and figure following her performance at the American football event Super Bowl.
