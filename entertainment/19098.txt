A US court Monday allowed Google to continue showing the trailer of the controversial anti-Islamic film - 'Innocence of Muslims' - on YouTube, after editing some portions. However, the court did not allow uploading new copies of the video. The film, which depicts Prophet Mohammed as a fool and a sexual deviant, has sparked protests by Muslims across the world.
