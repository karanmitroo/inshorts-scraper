English pop girl group Spice Girls will reportedly reunite to mark their 20th anniversary with a world tour. However, Victoria Beckham will not be a part of the reunion. The girl band released their first single in 1996. "Mel B flew into London last month to secretly agree the plan with the other three girls," media reports said.
