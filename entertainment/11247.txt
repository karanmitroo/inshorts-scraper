Around 200 paintings by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan went on display at the Halcyon Gallery in London on Saturday. Dylan has said 'The Beaten Path' exhibition explores "the American landscape" and how one sees it "while criss-crossing the land." The 75-year-old, who has been painting for about 50 years, has designed his own album covers in the past.
