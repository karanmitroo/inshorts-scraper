Ousted Censor Board Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani has said that the erotic thriller 'Julie 2' does not have scenes of obscenity or vulgarity and is a completely adult family film. When questioned about 'Julie 2' being described as a "woman's fantasy", Pahlaj said, "I know what you are referring to...all I'd like to say is that there is no 'burkha' here."
