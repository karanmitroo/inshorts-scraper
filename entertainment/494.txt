Karan Johar has said he is not taken as seriously as Sanjay Leela Bhansali or Rajkumar Hirani because they're intense filmmakers, who do their work and nothing else. He added he was a victim of perception. Johar further said, "If I wear my Gucci jumpers, high heel shiny shoes, and I'm grabbing headlines on Twitter...how will you take me seriously?"
