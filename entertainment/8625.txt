Russian Practical Shooting Federation President Vitaly Kryuchin teamed up with string quartet 'Noir' to perform 'Radetzky March' by Johann Strauss I while shooting from his gun. Notably, the 'Radetzky March,' dedicated to Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, was popular among Austrian soldiers. Kryuchin has previously performed 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' and 'Ode to Joy'.
