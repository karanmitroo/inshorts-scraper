The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has sought customs duty concessions in the upcoming budget for certain components of electric vehicles (EVs) that are currently not manufactured in India. Further, it has also requested the government to not offer any such concessions to completely built units (CBUs) that are imported, to promote local manufacturing of electric vehicles.
