Yoshikazu Tanaka, the chief engineer of Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell car Mirai, has revealed that the Japanese automotive manufacturer is converting human waste into hydrogen to fuel the car. Microorganisms are added to the solid waste from sewage to create biogas and eventually extract pure hydrogen. Mirai combines hydrogen and oxygen to make electricity, while only emitting water vapour.
