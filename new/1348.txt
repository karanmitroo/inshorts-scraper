A video uploaded on YouTube shows a $250,000 Lamborghini Murcielago cruising on a road in Australia's Sydney towing a trailer full of goats. The driver of the car, which has a top speed of 330 kmph, is seen smiling at cars passing by. While one user commented on the video, "Lambo hauling lambs...", another commented, "Whatever floats your goat".
