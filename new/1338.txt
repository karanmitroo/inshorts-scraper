Norway is planning to build a series of floating underwater tunnels to reduce travel time. The 'submerged floating bridges' would consist of large tubes 100 feet below water, suspended by pontoon-like support structures. The $25 billion tunnel project could cut trip time from Kristiansand to Trondheim (1,095 km), which takes 21 hours via ferry to about 10 hours.
