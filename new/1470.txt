A Tesla Model S car on autopilot mode reportedly crashed into a parked van on a Switzerland highway last week. The Tesla was behind a car, which later switched lanes to avoid a van that had stopped on the highway. The driver has blamed the car for not spotting the van and the automatic braking system for failing to trigger.
