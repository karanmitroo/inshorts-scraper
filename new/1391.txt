Tesla's Elon Musk on Friday tweeted that the Tesla Model X which crashed in Pennsylvania on July 1 had autopilot disabled during the crash. The accident wouldn't have occurred if autopilot was on, he added. This came after a US Senate Committee called out Musk, seeking answers about the autopilot technology and how the company is educating drivers about it.
