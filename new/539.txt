Bentley has released a 57.7 billion-pixel image of luxury sports sedan Flying Spur W12 S taken from a camera suspended 264 metres up the Cayan Tower, one of Dubai's tallest buildings. NASA-derived technology was used for image, which took 48 hours and 1,825 frames to create. It can be zoomed-in till the letter 'B' is clearly visible on the car.
