A four-minute video shows a Tesla car driving completely by itself and parking in an empty lot without any human assistance. The car is fitted with eight 360-degree cameras and twelve sensors that can distinguish between hard and soft objects. A radar allows the car to 'see' through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.
