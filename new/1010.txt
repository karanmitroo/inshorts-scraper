Chipmaker Nvidia has demonstrated an AI-based self-driving system that learns by observing human drivers. Nvidia claims the system can drive on any type of road as it learns by observing how humans drive in a specific situation. Dubbed 'BB-8', the program uses 'deep neural networks' to successfully navigate an obstacle course containing simulated construction zones and narrow country side roads.
