Japanese automaker Nissan has begun international arbitration against India to seek over $770 million in a dispute over unpaid incentives, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. In a legal notice sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, Nissan sought payment of incentives due from Tamil Nadu government as part of an agreement to set up a car manufacturing plant.
