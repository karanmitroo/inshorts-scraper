Tata Elxsi, a design firm part of the Tata group, will reportedly become the first company to test self-driving cars in India. The company is said to have sought permission to test re-engineered sedans equipped with ultrasonic sensors and LIDAR radars in Bengaluru. Tata Elxsi is not building its own autonomous cars, but working on software for other carmakers.
