Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker Tesla's rival Faraday Future has cancelled its plan to build an assembly facility in the US. Faraday had already secured a negotiating agreement with the city council regarding the site to construct the factory. This comes after Faraday had to stop the construction of $1 billion facility in Nevada last year due to cash crunch.
