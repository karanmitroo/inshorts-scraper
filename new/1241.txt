A 1955 Jaguar D-Type car, which won a 24 hour Le Mans race in 1956 in France, sold at RM Sotheby's Monterey auction for $21.78 million. This made the Jaguar the most expensive British automobile ever sold at an auction. The car is painted in the winning team's traditional Scottish blue colour with a white cross.
