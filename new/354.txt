Honda Motor on Friday released a 2013 email in which one of its engineers said he knew the "truth" about Takata's airbag failures, but later admitted he was mistaken. The faulty airbags have been blamed for 16 deaths and prompted automotive industry's largest-ever safety recall. The engineer was referring to a 1999 Takata incident which wasn't related to the recall.
