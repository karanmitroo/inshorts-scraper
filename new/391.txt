Tesla has fired engineer AJ Vandermeyden who accused the automaker of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts. Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees. The company argued that she received special treatment at the expense of others, yet chose to "pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla."
