Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors dropped the word 'Motors' from its name on Wednesday. This comes after Tesla acquired solar panel-making company SolarCity in a deal worth $2 billion last year. Earlier, Musk also revealed a plan to start a service where Tesla car owners can rent their cars out when they're not in use.
