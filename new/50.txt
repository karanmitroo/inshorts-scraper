General Motors has been sued over a collision between its self-driving car Chevy Bolt and a motorcycle in the US last month. The rider Oscar Nilsson claims the car, involved in GM's self-driving testing program, swerved into his lane, knocking him off his motorcycle and injuring him. Reportedly, cruise self-driving vehicles have been involved in 22 accidents since last year.
