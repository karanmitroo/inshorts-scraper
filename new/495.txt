Uber's Product Director for its Elevate flying taxi program Nikhil Goel has said that his goal is to "get to the point where flying to work is cheaper than owning a car." Goel added that Uber is aiming for the service to be mainstream in the next ten years and that Elevate will work in a way similar to UberPOOL.
