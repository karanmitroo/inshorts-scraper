An Indian man, Vikram Dharam, has modified his Toyota Fortuner to carry a modified scooter at the rear of the SUV. The stock front bumper has also been removed for the convenience of climbing over steep inclines, and there is a ladder on sides to climb up the roof to access the tent system and cylindrical water tank.
