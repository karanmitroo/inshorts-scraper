Royal Enfield supplied motorcycles loaded with Lewis machine guns and stretchers to the Royal army during World War I. It also came with a Vickers machine Gun sidecar attachment which could be turned skywards and used against low flying aircraft. Notably, Royal Enfield became the fastest growing Indian brand in 2016.
