Google and Italian carmaker Fiat Chrysler are working on an Android Nougat-based in-car system technology under Google's newly set up self-driving car company Waymo. The new system called Uconnect, includes an 8.4-inch screen for accessing Android apps and in-car controls like air conditioning, heat, and terrestrial radio. The new technology will be on display at CES in a Chrysler 300.
