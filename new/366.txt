Former NASA engineer Mark Rober claims to have created the "nicest car horn ever" called the 'courtesy honk'. The horn lets out two quick chirps to alert drivers when the light turns green. Rober also demonstrated a less alarming horn meant to alert pedestrians. He also made a third horn for extreme situations which sounds like a train horn.
