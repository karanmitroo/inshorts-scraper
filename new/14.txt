Japan-based carmaker Aspark has developed an electric car called Aspark Owl which goes from 0-100 kmph in 2 seconds, missing Tesla Roadster's world record by 0.1 seconds. Further, the Owl, which can deliver a range of 150 km on a single charge, will reportedly be priced at $4.4 million and start with a limited production run of 50 units.
