Vehicles registered outside Himachal Pradesh will now have to pay a green tax for entering the Shimla Municipal Corporation area. The tax would be ₹50 for two-wheelers, ₹200 for small cars, ₹300 for SUVs, and ₹500 for trucks. However, no barrier would be erected at entry points and random checking of outside vehicles would be done to ensure compliance.
