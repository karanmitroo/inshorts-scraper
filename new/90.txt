American electric carmaker Tesla has been burning cash at a rate of $480,000 (â‚¹3.1 crore) every hour over the past 12 months. At the current pace, it will exhaust its entire stockpile of cash by August 2018, according to Bloomberg. Tesla, however, said it has enough money to meet its Model 3 production target by March-end, which has been delayed.
