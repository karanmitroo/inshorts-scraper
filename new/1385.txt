A one-of-a-kind Bentley Continental GT Convertible designed by "Godfather of British pop art" Sir Peter Blake has sold at the Goodwood Festival of Speed for £250,000. He designed each seat with a different colour, replicating them on the steering wheel. A distinctive treadplate, signifying that this is a Peter Blake design, has “Number 1 of 1” labelled on the car.
