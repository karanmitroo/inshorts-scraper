An American man has sued Oregon state after he was fined â‚¹32,000 for criticising mathematical formulas used by the state's traffic lights without having the required engineering licence. The man had claimed that the green-yellow-red progression was too short for lights with a left or right turn. The lawsuit claims that the fine violates the man's freedom of speech.
