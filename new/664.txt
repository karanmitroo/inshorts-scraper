Nissan India is set to enter the Limca Book of Records after it made the largest-ever outline of India's map to commemorate the country's 68th Republic Day. A Nissan GT-R sports car carved out the approximate map of India on Sambhar Lake's dry surface in Rajasthan. The map covers a 3-kilometre-square area with a perimeter of 14.7 km.
