Google has patented an adhesive layer on the front end of its self-driving cars to protect the pedestrians during an accident. The adhesive coating reportedly activates when it comes in contact with a person and aims to reduce the damage caused. Further, a pedestrian may be carried by car until its driver or the car itself reacts to the accident.
