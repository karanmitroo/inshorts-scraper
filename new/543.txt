Owners of three 2016 Shelby GT350 Mustang sports cars have sued Ford for "knowingly selling... cars with defective and dangerous powertrains". The lawsuit claims that the Mustangs overheat and go into a "Limp Mode with drastically reduced speed and performance", despite Ford calling its cars "track-ready". Ford has also been accused of refusing to replace or modify the defective components.
