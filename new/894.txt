A one-minute video shows the lithium-ion battery of a Tesla Model S exploding like fireworks after the car crashed into a tree. The collision, which took place on Thursday in the US, killed the driver and passenger. "Some of the smaller cells that had broken apart began firing off almost like projectiles," said a fire department representative.
