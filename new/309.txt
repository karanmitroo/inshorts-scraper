A driver in England who left his â‚¹1 crore Ferrari in a car park overnight found it stranded in the middle of a car boot sale the next day. It was parked opposite a sign warning drivers not to park overnight on Saturdays because the spot is used on Sundays for a market. A parking penalty ticket was also given.
