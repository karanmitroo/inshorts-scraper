Chinese technology company LeEco on Wednesday unveiled its autonomous electric car 'LeSee Pro' in San Francisco. The steering wheel of the car folds up and retreats into the dashboard when the car is in autonomous mode. It also features an exterior light display that shifts between five different colours to let pedestrians know which the mode the car is in.
