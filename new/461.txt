A cruise ship called Norwegian Joy, which will launch in China this year, claims to have the world's first racetrack at sea. The two-level track has been built in partnership with Ferrari at the top deck and will have room for 10 electric go-karts at a time. The Norwegian Joy can accommodate up to 3,850 passengers.
