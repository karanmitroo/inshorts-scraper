Hyundai has revealed a "Mobility Vision" concept that shows an autonomous car docking into the interior of a smart home. As part of the living space, the car can act as an air conditioner, share its entertainment facilities by connecting with the home's devices and even provide power in emergency situations by using its onboard fuel cell as a generator.
