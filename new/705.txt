Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Thursday tweeted about an update to make Tesla Model S world's fastest production electric car by accelerating from 0-100 kmph in 2.42 seconds. This would make the cars 0.05 seconds faster than rival Faraday Future's recently unveiled 'FF91'. Responding to Musk's tweet, Faraday Future said, "We're ready to work together to elevate the electric industry."
