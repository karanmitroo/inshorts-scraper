Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk in a recent tweet explained what the logos of the companies, which manufacture electric cars and reusable rockets respectively, mean. Tesla's stylised 'T' logo is intended to represent the cross-section of an electric motor, Musk said. The extended 'X' in SpaceX's logo symbolises a rocket's trajectory.
