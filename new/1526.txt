Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari on Monday appointed its Chairman Sergio Marchionne as the new CEO with "immediate effect", adding yet another title for the Italian-Canadian manager, who also runs Fiat Chrysler. Marchionne replaced 69-year-old Amedeo Felisa, who retired from his post when the carmaker's board of directors met to discuss the first-quarter results, the company said.
