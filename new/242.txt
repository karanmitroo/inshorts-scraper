Uber is reportedly planning to close its car-leasing operation Xchange Leasing in US by the end of this year. The plan comes after Uber was informed about losing ₹5.7 lakh per car on average as compared to previous losses of around ₹30,000 per car. Xchange leased cars to drivers who had old cars, or didn't meet the required standards.
