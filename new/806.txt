George Hotz, the hacker known for unlocking the first iPhone, has publicly released the self-driving car software developed by his startup, which he called an "open source alternative to Tesla's Autopilot." Hotz recently cancelled his startup's $999 kit which could be fitted into cars to turn them self-driving as he did not want to "deal with regulators" in the US.
