Consumer-advocacy organisation Consumer Reports has called Tesla's Autopilot system "too much autonomy too soon". The blog urges the automaker to disable hands-free feature until its system can be made safer. Laura MacCleery, Vice President of Consumer Policy and Mobilisation of Consumer Reports said, "By marketing their feature as ‘Autopilot,’ Tesla gives consumers a false sense of security".
