US-based high-speed transportation system Hyperloop, if introduced in India, will reduce the travel time between Pune to Mumbai to only 25 minutes, according to company's Chairman Bibop G Gresta. "You can live in Pune and work in Mumbai or vice-versa," said Gresta. The Hyperloop proposal is with Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari for its feasibility evaluation in the country.
