Google Co-founder Larry Page, while being questioned about the company's ongoing lawsuit against Uber said,  "I'm not sure I authorised it". According to reports, he said the phrase "I don't recall" to Uber's lawyers at least 40 times in his testimony. Google's self-driving car spinoff Waymo sued Uber in February, accusing the ride-hailing startup of stealing trade secrets.
