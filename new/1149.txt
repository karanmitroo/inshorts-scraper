British automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is reportedly planning to manufacture Land Rover SUVs in India. The Tata Motors-owned company might make a mini version of its Defender SUV locally by 2019-20, said the report. In September 2015, JLR CEO Ralf Speth had said the company did not plan on building a plant in India.
