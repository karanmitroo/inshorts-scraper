Hyundai Motor has said it plans to lift US investment by 50% to $3.1 billion (over â‚¹21,000 crore) over five years after US President-elect Donald Trump threatened to tax imports. Toyota may also build a new plant in the US. Notably, Trump has warned of a 35% tax on vehicles imported from Mexico amid attempts to revive US industrial jobs.
