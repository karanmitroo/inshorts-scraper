A Texas-based driver has claimed that his Tesla car crashed into the side of a highway construction zone while on Autopilot mode without any warning. Dashcam footage shows that the car did not curve along with the road to avoid the collision. The car was reportedly using a first-generation Autopilot system, which isn't designed to change lanes to avoid collisions.
