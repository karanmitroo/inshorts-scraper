Tesla has responded to a female engineer's 2016 lawsuit accusing the Elon Musk-led company of harassment at workplace. "After an exhaustive review of the facts, the claims of gender discrimination, harassment have not been substantiated," said Tesla's statement. Tesla also said the employee has been moved into successive engineering roles "despite having no formal engineering degree."
