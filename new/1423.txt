BMW is teaming up with chipmaker Intel and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) provider Mobileye to build its first fully autonomous self-driving car by 2021. Called the BMW iNEXT, the car will reportedly be able to drive itself from start to finish without a human driver inside. The companies will provide extended autonomous test drives in 2017.
