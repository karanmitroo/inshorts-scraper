Mercedes is running an advertisement seeking a replacement for the newly-retired Formula One world champion Nico Rosberg. "Ideally, you will have a proven track record in skills including steering, braking and in particular, accelerating. Possession of an FIA Super Licence will be an advantage," reads the ad. Rosberg announced his retirement last Friday, after winning his maiden F1 title.
