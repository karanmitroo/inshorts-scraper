Automotive accessory startup Pearl Automation, which was founded by former Apple employees, has reportedly shut down a year after it launched publicly. The three ex-Apple engineers behind Pearl Automation had helped lead the design and development of several iPod and iPhone generations. The startup's only product was a ₹32,000 wireless backup camera that fit around a car’s rear license plate.
