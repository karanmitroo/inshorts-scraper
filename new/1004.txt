A two-seater electric driverless car was publicly tested for the first time in UK's Milton Keynes on Tuesday. The car traveled for 1 km at 8 kph on pavements around Milton's railway station. The car's software was developed by Oxford University's Robotics Institute, who called this "a landmark step" towards bringing self-driving vehicles to the roads of the UK.
