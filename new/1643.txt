General Motors has secured an Indian patent for an invention that will automatically send vehicle's information through an e-mail to the owner. The new invention will wirelessly collect a vehicle's data including mileage, oil life and vehicle safety system status. This data will be e-mailed to the owner as a reminder of servicing or oil change, without human intervention.
