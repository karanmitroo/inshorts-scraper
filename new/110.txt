Cars manufactured after July 1, 2019, must be equipped with all advanced security features like airbags, seat-belt reminders, speed alert systems, reverse parking lights, as per a proposal approved by the Union Road Transport Ministry. The move is aimed at ensuring passenger as well as pedestrian safety on India's roads. Currently, only luxury cars are equipped with such features.
