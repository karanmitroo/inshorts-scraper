German researchers have claimed that self-driving vehicles can make moral decisions using algorithms that assign a value-of-life for every human, animal, and inanimate object. The team used virtual reality to simulate a foggy road in a suburban setting in which volunteers were forced to decide which obstacle to save. The data was then used to design algorithms for driverless cars.
