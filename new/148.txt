Drivers of polluting vehicles in the UK will have to pay a daily charge of £10 (around ₹900) to drive in central London, authorities said. The new levy, called T-Charge, has been introduced in an effort to improve air quality in London. The charge mainly applies to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006 and came into force on Monday.
