Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh on Sunday claimed that RSS is an unregistered organisation and sought details of its annual fund collection, especially on 'Guru Purnima'. Talking about the attack by "cow-protectors" on Dalits in Gujarat's Una, he added that even the organisation behind it, was not registered and its members are "hooligans" collecting money in collaboration with police.
