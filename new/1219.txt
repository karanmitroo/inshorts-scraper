According to the US Justice Department, Harley-Davidson has agreed to pay $12 million in civil fine and stop selling after-market devices that cause its motorcycles to emit too much pollution. The American motorcycle maker was accused of selling 3,40,000 'super tuners' that enabled its motorcycles to pollute the air at levels greater than certified by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
