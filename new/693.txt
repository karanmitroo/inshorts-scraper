A man named Ryan Negri was stranded at Red Rock Canyon on Sunday after his Tesla car's smart lock refused to open using his phone. Negri claimed the lock didn't open as the phone was unable to catch a signal. Negri's wife ran three kilometres after which her phone received a signal and she got the car's key from home.
