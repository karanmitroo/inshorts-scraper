Toyota Kirloskar Motor is planning to hike the prices of all its vehicles in India by the end of this month or very early next month. The hike is to offset the impact of adverse foreign exchange and rising input costs. The company's Director and Senior VP N Raja said the hike could be around 2-3% in the current prices.
