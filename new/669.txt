Elon Musk-led carmaker Tesla's Model S has become the world's longest range electric car that travels up to 539 kilometres on a single charge. This comes after adding a '100D' battery pack, giving the car an extra range of 32 kilometres. The Model S 100D still hits 250 kmph top speed and goes from 0-100 kmph in 4.2 seconds.
