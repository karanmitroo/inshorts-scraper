At the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed on Thursday, a giant sculpture honouring the German luxury carmaker BMW was unveiled. Every year since 1997, the festival honours historic motor racing cars with a central display statue in front of the Goodwood House in England. This year's structure contains three of BMW's most successful cars from the past 100 years.
