To celebrate the completion of 50 years of the line of Mustang automobiles, American automaker Ford has welded together two Mustangs side-by-side â€“ a 1965 and a 2015 model. It was unveiled at the National Inventors Hall of Fame and Museum in Virginia, where the visitors would be able to hear recordings of the engines that powered both the models.
