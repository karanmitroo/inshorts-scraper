Ford has announced the development of features like 'evasive steering' that will change the direction of the car if it predicts an accident through its radar system. The cars will be able to park themselves without the driver's input and give audio and visual warnings if they sense wrong-way driving. Additionally, the headlight beam will automatically be widened at roundabouts.
