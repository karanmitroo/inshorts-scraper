Suzuki Motor Corp's head Osamu Suzuki will step down as the CEO on June 29, the Japanese automaker said on Wednesday. However, he will continue working as the Chairman. This comes after the company, last month, admitted to using fuel-economy testing methods not compliant with Japanese regulations on 2.1 million vehicles sold in the nation since 2010.
