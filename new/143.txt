US-based automaker Ford on Wednesday said that it would recall about 1.3 million vehicles including 2015-17 F-150 and 2017 Super Duty trucks in North America. The recall is due to faulty frozen door latches or bent actuation cables which may prevent the door from opening or closing. The company estimated the cost of the recall at $267 million.
