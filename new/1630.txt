A Russian startup has made an off-road all-terrain vehicle 'Sherp', priced at $50,000, that moves easily on land, ice and water. The diesel-run vehicle with a 44 horsepower engine achieves speeds of 28 mph on land and 3.7 mph in water. The vehicle can climb obstacles up to 27.5 inches, turns like a tank and comes with self-inflating tyres.
