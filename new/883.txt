Harry Sperl or 'Hamburger Harry' in USA owns a 1987 Harley-Davidson Sportster bike which is customised to look like a hamburger. The top bun of the 'Hamburger Harley' is fitted with hydraulic cylinders, the beef patty is tuned to emit steam like a warm real-life meat patty, and the stereo plays the sound of frying burgers.
