Ford has announced the first on-the-fly update to the second generation of its SYNC software to include Apple's Siri Eyes-Free feature for about five million of its cars. By long-pressing the voice recognition button placed on the steering wheel, drivers will now be able to make phone calls, get directions and check the weather, among other things, without touching their iPhone.
