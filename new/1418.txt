Supersonic car 'Bloodhound SSC' has received new funding for its first attempt to break the land speed world record of 1227.985 kmph in October 2017. Powered by a Rolls-Royce EJ200 jet engine, a Jaguar V8 engine and Nammo hybrid rockets, the 13.4-metre long car delivers 135,000 brake horsepower. The earlier record was set 20 years ago by Thrust SSC.
