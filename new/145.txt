Tesla Co-founder Elon Musk on Monday shared a slow motion video of the electric carmaker's Model 3 car in making. In the video, four red-coloured robotic arms, assembling the car were slowed down to 1/10th speed of their speed. Earlier, Musk said Tesla is "deep in production hell" and is diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of Model 3 cars.
