German luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz will introduce a petrol variant to all its models by September. The diesel-only models CLS, GLE and GLS are likely to receive the 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine used in the recently launched S 400. This comes after the recent Supreme Court decision banning sales of 2,000 cc and above diesel vehicles in the NCR.
