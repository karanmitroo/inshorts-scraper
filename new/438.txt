A judge has granted approval on an agreement for Volkswagen to pay $1.22 billion to fix or buy back 80,000 vehicles in US linked to its emissions scandal. The amount will cover buyback, repair, and cancelled leases for affected models, and $225 million for a fund to mitigate pollution. Volkswagen has now agreed to spend around $25 billion in US.
