The UK city of Oxford has announced plans to create the world's first zero-emissions zone by banning all petrol and diesel cars from its centre to curb pollution. The ban would be introduced in phases starting from 2020, including the blocking of non-zero-emitting taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses from using some streets.
