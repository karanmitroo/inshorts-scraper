Swedish car maker Volvo is developing a keyless car technology to replace car keys with a smartphone app. The technology will allow drivers to unlock car doors and start engines through a Bluetooth connection. Users will also be able to share their digital car keys and access more than one car. This will be commercially available by 2017.
