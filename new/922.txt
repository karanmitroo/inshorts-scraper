German automobile manufacturer Audi has announced its foray into the car-sharing business with a pilot 'Shared Fleet' program. Customers will be able to locate and unlock their assigned red Audi A4 sedans with a connected smartphone app. The pricing for Audi's fleet is said to be based off the time used, not the distance driven.
