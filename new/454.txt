Japanese tyre making company Bridgestone has developed air-free tyres for cycles that put an end to pumping air to the tyres quite often and flat tyre issues. Rather than the tube of inflated air, these tyres use spokes stretching along the inner sides of tyres to maintain the weight. The spokes of these tyres are made with special thermoplastic resins.
