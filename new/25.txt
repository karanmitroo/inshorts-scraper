US investigators probing Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler have found that its cars were equipped with software which may have helped them to pass diesel emissions tests, according to reports. The company reportedly used a software designed to switch off emissions cleaning after 25 km of driving. The ongoing investigations could lead to significant penalties and recalls, the car maker said.
