German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt on Thursday announced a recall of 22,000 Porsche Cayenne models with 3-litre diesel engines after finding potentially illegal emissions controlling software. The vehicles allegedly have a "warm up mode" to comply with emissions requirements. Porsche is owned by Volkswagen, which in 2015 admitted to manipulating software to cheat emissions tests.
