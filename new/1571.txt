Honda and Hitachi have developed a prototype smart key that comes with an inbuilt alcohol detector. The system is able to detect the amount of saturated water vapour in human breath and check the alcohol levels within three seconds. It wonâ€™t allow a vehicle to start if the driver fails the test thus reducing drunk driving instances.
