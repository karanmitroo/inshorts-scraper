Swedish automobile company Volvo has unveiled the world's largest bus chassis called the 'Gran Artic 300', which is 30 metres long and can carry up to 300 passengers. The new bus has been designed for Brazil's BRT system, a transportation system where buses run on dedicated lanes. One biarticulated bus of the model replaces three standard buses.
