Robotic expert Heather Knight, a PhD from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, has claimed Tesla's self-driving technology is a threat to cyclists. In an essay titled "Tesla Autopilot Review: Bikers will die", she said Tesla's situation awareness display isn't even close to accurate with cyclists. Knight said drivers would ignore this limitation and put biker lives at risk.
