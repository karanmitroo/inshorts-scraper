Dutch limousine maker RemetzCar has converted Tesla's luxury sedan Model S into an all-electric hearse, a vehicle for conveying the coffin to a funeral. The company sawed the sedan in half and stretched it 31.5 inches, where a glass roof has been installed. The hearse can travel for up to 350 kms on a single charge.
