Ahead of the Independence Day of the United States, which is celebrated on July 4, Kentucky-based car dealer Paul Miller Ford has created a giant American flag using cars. To make the 22,000-square-foot flag, 123 red, white and blue vehicles were used. "We wanted to do something special to honor the Fourth of July", Paul Miller Auto Group CEO said.
