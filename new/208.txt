NEXA has come up with a unique test drive challenge for Ignis in which people play a virtual game of air hockey with two cars serving as strikers. The cars are fitted with sensors to track their back-and-forth movement, which is displayed on a big screen. Through the game, contestants can experience Ignis' acceleration, throttle response, and braking abilities.
