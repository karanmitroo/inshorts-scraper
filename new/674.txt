Land Rover created the first prototype for the iconic Range Rover in 1969 under the name 'Velar'. In 1973, Range Rover got its recognisable floating roof, the four-door body was introduced in 1981 and the car became world's first all-aluminium SUV in 2012. In its latest rendition, the SVAutobiography Dynamic 2017 features the most powerful engine in Range Roverâ€™s history.
