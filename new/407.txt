A British man has reportedly turned his 1958 Volkswagen pick-up truck into a Rolls-Royce jet-powered vehicle. The 5,000 bhp jet engine allows the truck to travel at over 482 kmph. The man, who already holds a Guinness World Record for world's smallest road legal car, expects the Volkswagen truck to be recognised as the world's most powerful road registered car.
