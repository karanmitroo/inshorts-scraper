SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has shared a video of MIT's entry to SpaceX's first-ever Hyperloop competition in which teams built pods to travel inside a 1.5-km long tube. "Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions," Musk captioned the video. MIT Hyperloop won the Safety and Reliability award at the competition.
