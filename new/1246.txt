German carmaker Audi has developed a new shock absorber prototype called 'eROT', which generates electricity from rough roads while smoothening out the ride. Traditional absorbers are replaced with motors to capture the wheel's movement, convert it to electricity and feed it back to the car's 48-volt battery system. Audi claims eROT can reduce carbon emissions by three grams per km.
