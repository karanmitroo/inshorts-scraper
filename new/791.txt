From December 1 to 4, Ferrari held its annual Finali Mondiali (World Finals) event in Florida's Daytona, the first time in North America, with Ferrari Challenge finalists from around the world competing in the event. There were also demonstrations of past F1 cars, and the last Ferrari LaFerrari ever built was auctioned to help victims of the recent Italy earthquakes.
