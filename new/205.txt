Elon Musk on Monday shared a picture on Instagram of a Tesla Model S car in a tunnel dug by his startup 'The Boring Company'. The startup is digging an underground tunnel network in California and aims to help cars avoid traffic. The cars will be transported on electric sleds inside the tunnels at a speed of about 209 kmph.
