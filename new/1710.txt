As part of a little Christmas fun, Jaguar has built the F-Sleigh. Based on the design of the Jaguar F-Type convertible, the all-ice F-Sleigh gets skates instead of wheels, a generous amount of boot space and jet power to fly through the night. The F-Sleigh has been recently showcased as part of JLR's exhibition of their 2016 accessory collection.
