Millionaire Zahid Khan's Ferrari worth £200,000 (₹1.65 crore), which was parked on the pavement outside a court, was confiscated and destroyed by police. "The police told me they didn't believe that the car was mine and that I had to prove ownership," he said. Earlier, Khan was exposed as a rogue landlord after forcing tenants out of his luxury home.
