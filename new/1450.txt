British luxury carmaker Bentley on Tuesday released a 53,000 megapixel​ photo of its latest car ‘Mulsanne EWB’, taken using a technology initially developed by NASA. The technology was built to capture images of the Mars landscape. Interestingly, the image of the car can cover a complete football field when printed.
