Amid the ongoing lawsuit against Uber for stealing Google's self-driving car tech through ex-executive Anthony Levandowski, Uber has claimed it knew Levandowski 'possessed' Google data but not that he had stolen it. Google responded that the "evidence clearly shows that stolen information has already made its way into Uber's technology." Notably, Uber has fired Levandowski amid the dispute.
