Volkswagen has acquired Canadian digital payments provider PayByPhone to let users pay for parking with a smartphone. PayByPhone is running a pilot program in London in which license plates are connected with user accounts and the user is automatically charged when they leave a parking lot. In 2015, Volkswagen bought a 92% stake in leading German mobile payments firm SunHill.
