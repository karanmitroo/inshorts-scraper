A video shows a full-size mock-up of Airbus' modular jet concept 'Transpose' which will be installed with changeable sections like gyms, coffee shops or kid-safe play areas. The jet will offer passengers more room to sleep by using stackable beds. Airbus claims each module can be swapped within an hour, and the concept will be flight-ready "within a few years".
