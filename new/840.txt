Volkswagen has said it will reduce capital expenditure to 6% of automotive sales by 2020 from 6.9% last year. This comes as the German automaker looks to fund its strategic shift to electric cars apart from reeling with the cost of the emissions scandal. Volkswagen has also announced 30,000 job cuts which could save the carmaker around $3.9 billion.
