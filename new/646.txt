The former Co-founder and CTO of Hyperloop One, Brogan BamBrogan, has started a new venture named 'Arrivo' that will build a 21st-century high-speed transportation system for passengers and freight. The new venture's technology will be based on the Hyperloop architecture. BamBrogan had quit Hyperloop last year and sued the company of harassment and violation of the labour laws.
