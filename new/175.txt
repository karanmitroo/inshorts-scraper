The US National Traffic Safety Board on Tuesday said that lack of 'safeguards' in Tesla's Autopilot led to Joshua Brown's death in a crash last year. It said that Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed, and the system gave far more leeway to the driver to divert his attention.
