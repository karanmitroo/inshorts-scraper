Mahindra has launched the XUV500 and the Scorpio with a 1.99-litre engine, priced at ₹11.58 lakh and ₹9.67 lakh respectively. The smaller engines are available in Delhi only, to circumvent the ban on diesel vehicles with engines larger than 2000cc. Based on the 2.2 litre mHawk motor, the power and torque output of the smaller engine remains unchanged.
