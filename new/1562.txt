Audi on Monday debuted its connected mobility concept car with an electric longboard stored into the rear bumper. The navigation system automatically calculates and suggests whether a user is better off driving the car or using the longboard to reach the destination. Capable of going 12 km on a single charge, the longboard can also be used as a scooter.
