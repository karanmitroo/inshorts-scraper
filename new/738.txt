Nissan on Monday unveiled the 'Vmotion 2.0' concept car whose logo on the front grille and rear diffuser will glow when the car operates in self-driving mode. The front and rear doors of the sedan swing outward to open. The headrests of the car's seats feature Bose speakers that can control the direction and distance of sound.
