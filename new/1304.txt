Audi CEO Rupert Stadler has been reportedly ordered to pay back $13,980 that he spent for a party with around 30 top managers of the company in May 2015. An internal revision classified the party as private and asked the CEO to reimburse for the same. The expenditure was made on a 'beer contest', but Audi has not commented yet.
