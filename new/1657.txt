Qatar's first homegrown supercar called Elibreia was unveiled at the Qatar Motor Show 2016 in Doha. A graduate from the University of Texas A&M Qatar conceptualized the idea for the car during an undergraduate research project. The vehicle, which is made of carbon fibre, weighs less than a tonne and features a 535 horsepower engine.
