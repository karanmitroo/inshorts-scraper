Bentley used technology developed by NASA for its Mars rovers to take a 53 billion-pixel image of its 'Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase' car crossing San Franciscoâ€™s Golden Gate bridge. The image is over 4,000 times larger than a smartphone picture and can cover a football field if printed. Bentley Co-founder WO Bentley was born 128 years ago on September 16, 1888.
