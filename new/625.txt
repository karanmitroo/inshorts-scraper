Audi dealers in China are demanding $4 billion (around ₹27,000 crore) to cover losses over the past three years. The dealers blamed the automaker for adding too many distributors, which potentially worsened a sales decline that saw BMW and Mercedes-Benz overtake the luxury brand last month. Notably, Audi lost its leadership in China’s premium car segment as deliveries fell 35%.
