Putting an end to rumours of Volkswagen Group selling off Ducati in the wake of the emissions scandal, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler said in an interview, "Ducati is not for sale." "Ducati and Lamborghini belong to Audi and, together with us, have an excellent future," added Stadler. Notably, Audi-owned Ducati and Audi itself are owned by the Volkswagen Group.
