The US Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday accused Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of using a software that allowed excess diesel emissions in over one lakh trucks and SUVs sold since 2014. Fiat, however, dismissed the accusations claiming that its software was "properly justified". The allegations against Fiat came after a probe that stemmed from EPA investigation of automaker Volkswagen.
