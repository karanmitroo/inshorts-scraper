An American woman has sued Uber and Honda after the driver of her Uber cab jumped a red light, leading to a crash that left her paralysed from the chest down. The suit alleges security lapse on Uber's part for ignoring previous drug and gambling charges against the driver. The owner of the Honda-branded taxi has also been sued.
