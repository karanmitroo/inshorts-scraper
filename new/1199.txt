The 'R' engine by Rolls-Royce once held the speed records for land, air, and water simultaneously. In the early 1930s, Supermarine S6B broke the air speed record at 643kmph, with the BlueBird car breaking the land record and the Miss England II motorboat making a new record on water. Saturday marked the 139th birth anniversary of Rolls-Royce Co-founder Charles Rolls.
