American automobile multinational General Motors developed the world's first fully automatic transmission for passenger automobile use in 1939, called the Hydra-Matic. The clutch and clutch pedal were eliminated for the car to be operated solely through the accelerator. General Motors, that was founded 108 years ago on September 16, 1908, currently produces vehicles under 11 brands.
