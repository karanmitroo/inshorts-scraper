The 1896 Arnold Benz Motor Carriage, believed to be the first car to receive a speeding ticket, will go on display this year. The car was going at about 13 kmph, which was four times the speed limit. The carriage was pulled over by a policeman on a bicycle and the driver Walter Arnold was fined a shilling plus costs.
