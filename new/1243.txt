A memo filed by Bajaj Auto before the Chennai High Court said it has "withdrawn its comparative advertising campaign" which compared mileages of Bajaj's CT100 and TVS' XL 100. Bajaj also said it has agreed "not to reintroduce the said advertisement either by itself or through its dealers." TVS Motor had filed a case claiming the advertisement maligned its product.
