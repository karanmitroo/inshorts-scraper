American automaker Ford's engineers have built a new technology called 'On-the-go H2O', which includes a drinking water tap on the front console of a car. The water supply comes from the condensation that is a natural byproduct of the vehicle's air conditioning system. According to the creators, the technology can provide clean water in developing countries.
