Ferrari has announced the end of its 'Corse Clienti' program that allowed select customers to purchase its retired Formula One cars. It also offered owners a chance to drive the F1 cars at circuits around the world with a full team of mechanics. The cars built for 2014 and onwards will not be sold as they are "difficult to maintain."
