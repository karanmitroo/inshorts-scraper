Denmark will lower the tax on the cheapest cars to 85% from 105% that will cost the government about $100 million (nearly ₹650 crore) next year. The cheap-car category will be expanded to include vehicles costing up to $29,810 (₹19.3 lakh) compared with the current cap of $17,177 (nearly ₹11 lakh), Denmark's Finance Ministry said on Thursday.
