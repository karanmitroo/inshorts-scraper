Mahindra Group's Executive Chairman Anand Mahindra on Tuesday trolled a user who asked Mahindra to buy Pininfarina Maserati Birdcage car, picture of which he shared on Twitter. "That's one cage I wouldn't mind being imprisoned in", tweeted Mahindra, to which a user replied, "What stops you from buying it? Go for it". "We bought the company instead....(Pininfarina)," Mahindra tweeted back.
