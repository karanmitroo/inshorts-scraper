British luxury sports car manufacturer Aston Martin has launched an online configurator for its Vantage GT8, a limited-edition sports car that was revealed last month. Only 150 units will be produced with prices starting from Â£165,000 per unit. The configurator offers a choice of 35 exterior colors, four special racing-inspired liveries, four wheels and an aero kit, among others.
