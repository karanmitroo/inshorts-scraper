US President Donald Trump on Tuesday met the CEOs of country's three major automakers namely Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Noting pollution regulations are “out of control”, Trump said he believes he can cut regulations "by 75% or maybe more". He also assured the government will reduce taxes so that cars sold in the US are built locally.
